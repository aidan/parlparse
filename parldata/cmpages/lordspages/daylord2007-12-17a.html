For example, the reduction in the number of qualifying years needed for a full basic state pension is 30&#151;a key measure&#151;and, for the first time, paid and credited contributions for caring will be recognised equally for basic state pension and state second pension.

The challenge for the measures was to reach those people whom my noble friend most wanted to reach but not to have to bear the cost of the others. That has been the difficulty. For example, if this is a policy commitment that the Opposition want to take on, let me explain that the option of an extra nine years pre-2010 and six years post-2010 would cost in cash terms a bit short of &#163;5 billion to 2050&#151;net present value, in prices terms, &#163;1.3 billion.

I not only provided for them to become members of the scheme but I backdated the years of service to ensure that they paid money for those years that they had already completed. I hope that the Government do the same with the national insurance contributions.</p>

Let us look at the facts of what has happened since 1997. Currently, only around 35 per cent of women reaching state pension age are entitled to a full basic state pension. When the 2010 changes come in, that figure will be three-quarters and, in 2025, 90 per cent, which will be equality with men. Because of the changes that we have made to the state second pension, 2.1 million carers, more than 90 per cent of them women, and 6.1 million low earners, almost 60 per cent of them women, are included in the scheme, which did not provide for them before.</p>

If one looks at who would not benefit from the proposals, one sees that it would be the poorest women, because the poorest women headed for pension credit would lose pound for pound if they were asked to cough up for additional class 3 contributions. The proposals would not help those women who could not get beyond 60 per cent of their spouse&#146;s pension; they would simply be paying in money to no avail.

We all know very well and greatly admire the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, of course, but what was her precise status at the meeting and what did she actually say? Did she remind Mr Mugabe that 80 per cent of people in his country are unemployed; that four in five of them are living below the poverty level; that famine is spreading; that he has reduced this once rich country to the most appalling misery; and that he is using torture and murder against the opposition? Did she tell him that face to face? If not, is there not more opportunity ahead to be a little more bold and forthright against this horrible man?</p>

<a name="71217-0002.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="0712172000099">The purpose of the amendments is quite clear: they would set annual targets. The purpose of the Bill is to reduce the level of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. The Government have talked about five-year targets and they were not persuaded of the need to support our amendments for three-year targets. Indeed, I have a sneaking suspicion that they may not support these amendments because of a few well-judged words at the end of the first Committee day. However, will the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, answer a question which is at the heart of the Bill? If we do not set annual targets, is there any point in the Bill at all? A five-year target could quite easily be missed and, if we are to follow the scientific evidence that has been so ably demonstrated by many Members of the Committee who have spoken about the science behind this issue, and 10 years&#146; time will be the point of no return at which irreversible climate change will have taken place, the first few targets are incredibly important.</p>

<a name="71217-0002.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="0712172000100">As we all know, there will be slippage because when policies are put in place they suffer from implementation stages, planning stages and so forth. As we have seen in the past, there can be a major difference between the levels of emissions on a yearly basis depending on whether there is a cold winter or a change in the spot price of gas, which means that companies move from gas power stations to mothballed coal power stations. That would have a major impact on any budget set by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="71217-0002.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="0712172000101">The other point is that many Secretaries of State will not last the full five years. It is my conjecture that most will not last the full year, although that is probably just on past form and shows that I am quite cynical. However, it is important that each year target gives each Secretary of State his own individual stamp to ensure that the policy is being adhered to.</p>

<a name="71217-0002.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="0712172000102">The most important aspect of all of this is that, if we are serious about reducing the amount of carbon dioxide, we must do so as early as possible. Each year that we do not reduce carbon dioxide is adding to the greater total and therefore the carbon dioxide will be in the atmosphere for a longer period. It would be great if further along we had reduced the amount of carbon dioxide, but there would still be an interest rate of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that had built up at this end of the curve.</p>

<a name="71217-0002.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="0712172000103">The Minister will probably say that there are excellent reasons why this should not be adhered to because it would put a straitjacket on ministerial policies. However, he may have a slight difficulty with that partly because of the bravery of the Government in introducing the Bill into this House first. I am sure that an amendment carried by this House would be extremely popular in another place and in the country. We should not forget

If decisions are taken on that basis I am surprised that this provision is not in the Bill already, because 16,292 of the respondents to consultation called for annual targets.

However, an EDM in the other place earlier in the year on this issue was signed by 412 Members. My mathematics is slightly rusty, but that does give a fairly large proportion of Members of the House of Commons who might well welcome any amendment to the Bill that deals with annual targets. If we want to stick to the five-year targets, it is incredibly important that we do not forget that the five-year targets that the Minister was arguing for were set out so that we can dovetail into the ETS system. But from next year, the ETS system will be working on a completely different timescale. I hope that the Government will come forward with positive reasons why they are rejecting this amendment and perhaps with notice of amendments of their own that they intend to bring in to introduce the milestones. I believe that introducing the Bill, which we all support, without milestones makes the Bill fundamentally flawed in its objective of achieving annual reductions&#151;leading to the massive reduction of between 60 and 80 per cent at a later date.

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="0712172000107">Five-year budgets are robust enough in terms of science, but they are not robust enough in terms of politics. A five-year period allows Governments to blame their predecessors for failing to reach targets themselves, potentially locking us into a situation where each Government blame their predecessor for failing to reach the target and nobody actually takes responsibility for meeting reduction targets. If we want the Bill to have any teeth&#151;I am sure the Committee is agreed that that is what we are seeking&#151;there needs to be a mechanism to ensure that Governments do indeed take responsibility. We need annual markers to pin the project firmly to Governments&#146; annual agendas. Again, I emphasise that the purpose of the Bill is to drive across government departments a common agenda to achieve the Bill&#146;s objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="0712172000108">Our amendments on annual targets, which make up the next group, propose rolling annual targets, which offer a more realistic way to achieve the desired results of increased accountability. Having rolling targets means that the targets would be set according to an annual rolling review, looking five years ahead, allowing the committee, the Secretary of State and Parliament to tilt targets according to progress made every year, while avoiding the possibility of any Government simply shunting responsibility on to their successors. The Liberal Democrat proposals do not have a rolling factor, which means that their static milestones simply have commitments within the five-year periods without any mechanism to see how that will affect whether we will meet the target, or to see what impact success or failure has had on what the budget should be for the next five years. Our rolling targets are therefore much more adaptable.</p>

We know that extraneous factors come into play. However, the flexibility allowed for in rolling targets ensures that measures can be drawn up to make up for years when there are colder winters or other such variable phenomena. That also ensures that, should one year be a success, the Government do not rest on their laurels. That places more of a concerted burden on the Government to address climate change every year and across all departments, and I hope that the Government do not shy away from such a responsibility&#151;or the opportunity to make a success of this legislation. Perhaps the Minister should be comforted by the fact that we fully intend to be the Government who present the first five-year report to Parliament. Notwithstanding that, we know that we have support outside this House, from Friends of the Earth, for more flexible, rolling targets&#146; arrangements.</p>

One abiding problem for us on these Benches has been that the Bill provides moments when there is potential wiggle room for Ministers not meeting targets. It is imperative that we know where we stand in relation to the great problem that faces us. Thus any procedure that takes into account the many variables that might otherwise lead us to an incorrect conclusion or assessment is to be welcomed.

Furthermore, the Government have absolutely no control over about 50 per cent of emissions from the UK economy, yet nobody seems to take any account of that in how we are to measure these things and to be accountable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="0712172000117">In reply to the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, the point that my noble friend referred to on 11th December was that references to binding annual targets were not suitable. I am not arguing about what any of the scrutiny committees have said, but none of them came forward to require such targets. However, they looked at other aspects of this important issue, and we do not seek to run away from it. We think that the Bill has strong mechanisms&#151;we will come to them in Clauses 28 and 29&#151;to make sure that the government of the day are, importantly, annually held accountable to Parliament, on the basis of the expert and independent assessment of the Committee on Climate Change. The independent scrutiny that that will provide, on an annual basis, will strengthen the accountability for achieving emission reductions each year in every five-year budget. Therefore, we are not seeking to have the issue swept away for five years with no scrutiny and nothing done about it.</p>

<a name="71217-0003.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="0712172000118">If the Committee on Climate Change reports that, in its expert view, the UK is not on track to meet the budget, we would expect the Government to do everything possible to get back on track so as to satisfy the committee&#151;and, moreover, to be under intense pressure in Parliament and in the court of public opinion. That is absolutely crucial. Annual scrutiny will help raise expectations that concerted action will be taken throughout each budget and, it is hoped, increase the confidence that the budgets will be met. We remain opposed to annual milestones or targets because we do not think that they would work in practice. I want to give four reasons and some detail as to why that is the case, because it is important for the next stage.</p>

<a name="71217-0003.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="0712172000119">First, there are annual natural fluctuations. Emissions go up or down by a small amount each year, depending on the weather. The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, recognised that point in moving the amendment. During a five-year budget period, the fluctuations will, or are expected to, average out. We also have to ask ourselves whether proposals for annual milestones or targets will help the credibility of the system that we are setting up under the Bill. Would it help to have a debate each year on why the UK was, say, 0.2 per cent above or below its annual milestones and whether this was because the Government were doing well or because the weather was abnormally warm or cold that year? Such a debate would be irrelevant.</p>

<a name="71217-0003.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="0712172000120">Secondly, annual milestones and the political pressure to meet them could lead to huge pressures to rush through costly policies in a year, or particularly  


<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_483"><b>17 Dec 2007 : Column 483</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>late in a year, with the aim of achieving short-term emissions reductions to ensure that targets were met. However, those policies might not be sensible from the economic, social or environmental points of view and could prove to be a distraction from the long-term decisions that need to be taken to put us on a trajectory to the 2020 targets and beyond. For example, would the Government of the day be expected to put up the cost of heating fuel in October to help to meet our annual targets? If not, what alternative measures could be taken late in a year to try to meet the milestones? One has to look at this from the practical point of view of the sequence of when information on which to judge performance becomes available. This would be the case even if there were no obligations on the Government to meet annual targets&#151;in other words, if the targets were merely indicative. The same argument would apply regardless of whether the targets were set milestones or were legally binding.</p>

<a name="71217-0003.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="0712172000121">Thirdly, even if the Government of the day wanted to set annual milestones, they would simply not have enough information on which to base a decision. Even with the best will in the world, definitive information on emissions in a given year is not available until well after the year ends, as I think noble Lords will accept. The Government of the day would learn that they were off track for a given year only when it was already too late to do anything about it, unless it were the Government&#146;s intention to buy credits each year. I am sure that such an issue would be controversial, bearing in mind the reference to it during our first day in Committee.</p>

<a name="71217-0003.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="0712172000122">Finally, as I pointed out, proposals for annual milestones do not recognise that the Government have no control of the annual emissions from 50 per cent of the UK economy. The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme covers half the UK&#146;s CO2 emissions, including sectors that are more responsive to price signals. However, within the European trading system, companies are completely free to phase their emissions however they like during the five-year period. It is simply not possible for the Government to influence this and decisions will be based more on the carbon price across Europe. Again, how would that be taken into account in assessing our progress against the milestones?</p>

<a name="71217-0003.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="0712172000123">These are not intellectually stunning arguments against the principle; each one is a practical concern if we are to legislate for scrutiny. Those who are scrutinising the Government, here or elsewhere, will want something that they can genuinely measure the Government&#146;s performance against. These are practical issues that I bring to the Committee.</p>

<a name="71217-0003.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="0712172000124">Perhaps I may make a couple of points about other amendments in the group. Amendment No. 76 would require the Government to &#147;have regard to&#148; their annual statement of emissions, provided for in Clause 12, when setting the indicative annual targets. There would be a serious practical difficulty with that. Final emissions figures are available on 15 January&#151;one year and 15 days after the end of the year in question. Final detailed figures are available on 15 March. The information required would simply not be available in

I realise that that is not an argument for doing nothing or for not having annual scrutiny, but I am making a practical point about how you change what has happened in one year and how you account for it.</p>

<a name="71217-0003.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="0712172000125">I have a couple of paragraphs on the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord May, which I think are worth using, even though the noble Lord is not here. Obviously colleagues will take this away and have a look at it for Report. Amendment No. 31 would help by providing additional information on the causes of any fluctuations in annual emissions. We sympathise with the noble Lord in his efforts to address a problem that is not addressed in the Liberal Democrat proposals or in the group of Conservative ones to which we shall come shortly. However, we are not convinced that the proposals of the noble Lord, Lord May, would entirely address the problems. They would help but they would not entirely address them. There might simply be a new debate about the accuracy of the methodology used in adjusting emissions to take account of temperature fluctuations. The amendment would also not address the other, practical problems of the annual milestones that I have set out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="0712172000126">As I said, we are not at all afraid of being held accountable for each year of progress, but that has to be done in a practical way. Those who are checking on the Government need a target or a figure or a means of scrutinising, so that it is not just a case of them saying each year, &#147;We wish you had done better&#148;, and the Government saying, &#147;Haven&#146;t we done really well?&#148;. They have to be measured against something. That cannot be done in the way proposed by this group of amendments.</p>

I know that I am going to have an opportunity to talk again on the annual milestones, but there is an inconsistency in the Minister&#146;s arguments. He talked about a last-minute flap to put up heating costs in order to reduce emissions for the forthcoming winter and later he said that he thought that these annual milestones would not be much use because it would be too late to do anything about it by the time it was found out that they were being strayed from. The key is that we are looking at an arrangement that is designed to be indicative; any annual report is bound to centre around the degree to which the Government feel that they are on track for achieving their five-year target. We really need an annual progress report based on some sort of annual milestone target.</p>

The Secretary of State will have to put up the price of oil or whatever, and it will not matter whether it is in year 4, year 3 or year 1. What came out of the discussion was that there must be some form of stepping stone so that we can see how the trend is going. There is no doubt that the evidence that we had in the committee was strongly in favour of that. Can the Minister confirm that the emissions results currently published by the Government already take account of hot and cold years so that it is possible to make a comparison? Given the trend and provided that there is transparency in all the figures, the variation between a warm year and a cool year is not so relevant now.</p>

It is nonsense to say that we cannot deal with this matter because we will not have the figures for another 12 months or so.

Unsurprisingly, so far as I can see, the volume of energy has not retreated in the face of that price attack, so, in my view, the idea that price changes will have a great effect on customers, as one or two speakers implied earlier in the debate, is simply not borne out by the practical evidence.</p>

When people talk about emissions, they often mean emissions just from electricity, but there are emissions from agriculture, such as methane from sheep and land usage. There are major issues, but I dispute what the Minister said about their being completely outside the Government&#146;s control, because, if we are looking at a 60 to 80 per cent target, certain things will not be outside the Minister&#146;s control. That goes back to an earlier debate: if we are looking at a third runway at Heathrow, at what point does the massive amount of emissions that will come from that third runway feed in to this debate and who makes the decision?

&#147;With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement about the European Council held in Brussels on 14 December, which focused on two major concerns: the reforms Europe must make to meet and master the global challenges we face for competitiveness, employment, secure energy and climate change and issues of security, in particular Kosovo, Iran and Burma, that we must confront together. &#147;I start with the most immediate concern facing the summit: the best way to bring about a satisfactory resolution to the status of Kosovo. Kosovo is the last remaining unresolved issue from the violent break-up of the former Yugoslavia. In the light of the recent failure by the parties in the troika process to find a negotiated way forward, the European

It is to the credit of all parties in the dispute that even when faced with conflicting positions, the region remains at peace. And, as the European Council conclusions noted, it is essential that this commitment to peace is maintained. &#147;The principles of our approach are, first, that Europe takes seriously its special responsibility for the stability and security of the Balkans region. Indeed, it is thanks to the sustained efforts of NATO troops and the diplomacy of the United Nations and the European Union that a safe and secure environment has been maintained. But, secondly, we were agreed that the status quo was unsustainable and that we needed to move forward towards a settlement that ensures what we called a, <ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"><a name="0712172000321">&#145;stable, democratic, multi-ethnic Kosovo committed to the rule of law, and to the protection of minorities and of cultural and religious heritage&#146;.</p>
</ul> And, thirdly, after a detailed discussion at the Council, we were also wholly united in agreeing that European engagement should move to a new level. We agreed in principle and stated our readiness to deploy a European Security and Defence Policy policing and rule-of-law mission to Kosovo. This will consist of a multinational mission of around 1,800 policemen and judicial officials. I can confirm that the UK will contribute around 80 of these, including its deputy head, Roy Reeve. European Foreign Ministers will confirm the detailed arrangements for this mission shortly. &#147;Fourthly, we also reaffirmed that a stable and prosperous Serbia fully integrated into Europe is important for the stability of the region. The Council encouraged Serbia to meet the necessary conditions to allow signature of its stabilisation and association agreement and expressed our confidence that Serbia has the capacity to make rapid progress subsequently towards candidate status. Indeed, the conclusions of the meeting of European Foreign Ministers last week reiterated the European Union&#146;s support for enlargement more generally, and we also look forward to recognising the progress made by both Croatia and Turkey at this week&#146;s accession conference in Brussels.&#147;The UN Security Council will discuss the issue of Kosovo with representatives from both Belgrade and Pristina on 19 December with the aim of giving Russia an opportunity to accept a consensus on the way forward. If this proves impossible, we in Britain have always been clear that the comprehensive proposal put forward by the UN special envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, based around the concept of supervised independence for Kosovo, represents the best way forward. And while we are rightly focused on the immediate priority of bringing the status process through to completion in an orderly and managed way, the European Council agreed that it is also important that we address the longer-term challenge of ensuring Kosovo&#146;s future economic and political viability. I welcome the commitment made by the European Union to assist Kosovo&#146;s economic and political development. Planning is now under way for a donors&#146; conference to follow shortly after a status settlement.

Here again, the power we wield working with all the EU is greater than if we acted on our own. As I have made clear repeatedly, Iran remains in breach of its international obligations. In September, Foreign Ministers from the E3+3 agreed that until there were positive outcomes from Javier Solana and the International Atomic Energy Agency&#146;s discussions with Iran, we would seek tougher sanctions at the United Nations. The latest E3+3 assessment is that sufficient progress has not been made. &#147;The European Council conclusions call on Iran to provide full, clear and credible answers to the IAEA and to resolve all questions concerning its nuclear activities. The European Council reiterated its support for a new UN resolution as soon as possible. In addition, we agreed to decide on new measures that the EU itself might take to help resolve this situation at the January meeting of Foreign Ministers. These should complement UN measures or substitute for them if the Security Council cannot reach agreement.&#147;Iran has a choice&#151;confrontation with the international community leading to a tightening of sanctions or, if it changes its approach, a transformed relationship with the world from which all would benefit.&#147;As set out in the Council&#146;s conclusions, the EU also reaffirmed its deep concern about the unacceptable situation in Burma, and makes clear that if there is no change in the Burmese regime&#146;s approach to political negotiations and basic political freedoms, we stand ready to review, amend and&#151;if necessary&#151;further reinforce restrictive measures against the Burmese Government. The Council also reaffirmed the important role of China, India and the Association of South-East Asian Nations in actively supporting the UN&#146;s efforts to establish an inclusive political process leading to genuine national reconciliation.&#147;For our part, we believe that the forthcoming visit of the UN envoy&#151;Professor Gambari&#151;is critical. It is essential that the Burmese Government meet the demands set out in the UN Security Council statement of 11 October to: release all political prisoners; create the conditions for political dialogue, including relaxation of restrictions on Aung San Suu Kyi; allow full co-operation with Professor Gambari; address human rights concerns; and begin a genuine and inclusive process of dialogue and national reconciliation with the opposition.&#147;In particular, the regime should respond to the constructive statement of Aung San Suu Kyi of 8 November and open a &#145;meaningful and timebound dialogue&#146; with the opposition and the country&#146;s ethnic groups.&#147;The Council also agreed that a key part of the EU&#146;s external agenda is how we can&#151;by working together&#151;maximise our influence in tackling global poverty. The Council agreed that the European Commission should report by April next year&#151;half way to 2015&#151;on how the European Union is meeting its commitments to the millennium development goals, and how we can accelerate our progress.  


<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_490"><b>17 Dec 2007 : Column 490</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;In addition to these issues of international security and development, the Council conclusions and the special declaration on globalisation also set out the challenges that the European Union must now address on globalisation.&#147;First, we agreed to maintain our focus on economic reform, with a renewed focus on modernising the single market so it enhances the European Union&#146;s ability to compete in the global economy. We must have full implementation of the services directive by 2009 and we must continue to work together towards further liberalisation in the energy, post and telecoms markets&#151;where market openings could generate between &#8364;75 billion and &#8364;95 billion of potential extra economic benefits and create up to 360,000 new jobs. Investment in research, innovation and education&#151;and removing barriers to enterprise&#151;are also essential.&#147;Secondly, we confirmed our commitment to free trade and openness. The priority is securing a successful outcome to the Doha trade round, which would deliver gains to the global economy approaching $200 billion by 2015, equivalent to 0.6 per cent of global income and bringing significant benefits to rich and poor countries alike. We will also promote better EU-US trade links.&#147;Thirdly, we agreed to do more to develop mechanisms for co-operation within the European Union and with countries across the world to tackle security challenges like terrorism, illegal immigration and organised crime. We renewed our commitment to the EU counterterrorism strategy and to co-operate on counter-radicalisation work.&#147;Fourthly, we will work together to deliver our commitments to tackle climate change, including the target of reducing emissions by 20 per cent by 2020, or 30 per cent as part of an international agreement. And building on the significant progress made last week in Bali&#151;an agreement on which the Environment Secretary will report to this House tomorrow&#151;we must help negotiate an ambitious post-2012 international climate change agreement. And Europe must also now step up funding, including through the World Bank, to help the developing world shift to lower carbon growth and adapt to climate change.&#147;It was agreed at the last Council meeting that the presidency would bring forward a proposal for a new reflection group. This was announced in October. At this later meeting, the Council invited Mr Felipe Gonzlez Mrquez, assisted by two vice-chairs, Mrs Vaira Vike-Freiberga and Mr Jorma Ollila, chairman of Shell and Nokia, to,<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"><a name="0712172000322">&#145;identify the key issues and developments which the Union is likely to face in 2020 or 2030 and to analyse how these might be addressed&#146;.</p>
</ul>The remit specifically states that,<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"><a name="0712172000323">&#145;it shall not discuss institutional matters. Nor should its analysis constitute a review of current policies or address the Union&#146;s next financial framework&#146;.</p>
</ul>It will report back to the Council, which will decide how to follow up its recommendations.  


<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_491"><b>17 Dec 2007 : Column 491</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;I can also tell the House that today we are publishing the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, which contains the institutional changes to accommodate a Europe of 27 members and will include the safeguards that we have negotiated to protect the British national interest: the legally binding protocol that ensures that nothing in the Charter of Fundamental Rights challenges or undermines the rights already set out in UK law and that nothing in the charter extends the ability of any court&#151;European or national&#151;to strike down UK law; legally binding protocols that prescribe in detail our sovereign right to opt in on individual justice and home affairs measures, where we consider it to be in the British interest to do so, or alternatively to remain outside if that is in our interest; a declaration that expressly states that nothing in the new treaty affects the existing powers of member states to formulate and conduct their foreign policy, and that the basis of foreign and security policies will remain intergovernmental, a matter for Governments to decide on the basis of unanimity; and an effective veto power on any proposals for important changes on social security, so that when we, Britain, determine that any proposal would impact on an important aspect of our social security system, including its scope, cost or financial structure, we can insist on taking any proposal to the European Council under unanimity.&#147;With the publication of the Bill that legislates for the amendments to the European Communities Act, Parliament will now have the opportunity to debate this amending treaty in detail and to decide whether to implement it. We will ensure sufficient time for debate on the Floor of the House, so that the Bill is examined in the fullest of detail and all points of view can be heard. That will give the House the full opportunity to consider this treaty, and the deal secured for the UK, before ratification.&#147;In addition, I can tell the House that we have built into the legislation further safeguards to ensure proper parliamentary oversight and accountability. To ensure that no Government can agree, without Parliament&#146;s approval, to any change in European rules that could in any way alter the constitutional balance of power between Britain and the European Union, there is a provision in the Bill that any proposal to activate the mechanisms in the treaty that provide for further moves to qualified majority voting, but which require unanimity&#151;the so-called passerelles&#151;would have to be subject to a prior vote by the House. In the event of a negative vote, the Government would refuse to allow the use of the passerelle. The Bill also includes a statutory obligation that any future EU amending treaty, including one that provided for any increase in the EU&#146;s competence, would have to be ratified through an Act of Parliament. So Parliament would have absolute security that no future change could be made against its wishes.&#147;I said in October that I would oppose any further institutional change in the relationship between the European Union and its member states, not just for this Parliament but for the next. I stand by that commitment. This is now also the settled consensus  


<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_492"><b>17 Dec 2007 : Column 492</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the European Union. All 27 member states agreed at the Council&#151;as expressly set out in the conclusions&#151;that this amending treaty provides the Union with a stable and lasting institutional framework and that it completes the process of institutional reform for the foreseeable future. The conclusions of the Council state specifically that the amending treaty,<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"><a name="0712172000324">&#145;provides the Union with a stable and lasting institutional framework. We expect no change in the foreseeable future&#146;.</p>
</ul>&#147;Finally, let me conclude with the discussion on the most immediate economic issues: concerns about the economic consequences of the global financial turbulence that started in America in August. The Government&#146;s first priority in the coming weeks is to ensure the stability of the economy and to have the strength to take the difficult long-term decisions necessary. The Council agreed that the whole of the European Union must now turn its attention both to the immediate measures necessary and the long-term strengthening of international capacity to secure greater financial stability. The announcement made earlier this week by central banks in the major financial centres that they will provide liquidity to ease tension in the financial markets must now be built upon. As we agreed, supervisory authorities in different countries need to co-operate effectively across borders in exchanging information and in the management of crises and contagion.&#147;The European Council conclusions emphasised that macroeconomic fundamentals in the EU are strong and that sustained economic growth is expected. But we concluded that continued monitoring of financial markets and the economy is crucial, as uncertainties remain. The Council underlined the importance of work being taken forward both within the EU and with our international partners to improve transparency for investors, markets and regulators; to improve valuation standards; to improve the prudential framework, risk management and supervision in the financial sector; and to review the functioning of markets, including the role of credit-rating agencies. &#147;The European Council will discuss these issues at its spring 2008 meeting on the basis of a progress report by the Finance Ministers Council and by consideration of the financial stability forum&#146;s work to date. As agreed by Chancellor Merkel, President Sarkozy and myself in October, the progress report should examine whether regulatory or other action is necessary. I have invited Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy to London so that we can discuss the proposals in the paper we agreed and issued a few weeks ago. The measures are important to strengthening the international community&#146;s role in addressing financial turbulence across the world, showing the importance we attach to taking the tough long-term decisions to ensure, in testing times, the stability of the economy. &#147;Mr Speaker, the conclusions of the Council state specifically that in the institutional framework we expect no change &#145;for the foreseeable future&#146;. The protections that have been agreed in the amending treaty defend the British national interest. In the Bill introduced today, we are legislating for new

Why &#147;yes&#148; then and &#147;no&#148; now? The noble Baroness has bravely taken leadership in this House on Europe, so she knows the answers to these questions. So can she tell the House unequivocally what elements that were in the constitution are not in the new treaty? Will she spell them out? What is the difference between the two? Every other European leader admits that they are substantially the same, so why cannot she do so this afternoon? Does she not see that there will be no trust in this Government unless they fulfil that central promise which they gave at the last general election? After the farce of Lisbon, there will be no authority for this Government in Europe unless our Prime Minister can show, before ever the treaty comes to be ratified, that he is a strong leader whose actions carry the full-hearted consent of the British people? Great harm was done to the image of our country last weekend. Only honesty, courage and the keeping of promises can repair it.</p>

Having negotiated in the justice and home affairs arena for two and a half years, I know that it is possible to be very clear about wanting to ensure that Britain&#146;s interests are fully and properly recognised and respected, and to do so in a spirit of negotiating with colleagues to work as closely together as possible in the fields to which the noble Lord referred.

However, the principle is that the constitutional treaty would have abolished the European Union and re-founded it under a single constitutional order. That is fundamentally and distinctively different from what we have before us now, which is an amending treaty. I understand the politics of all this. I understand that politically it is useful to discuss and describe an issue as being about trust in a Government&#151;that is what opposition parties do&#151;but we have to be realistic.

However, I remember that, when I was sitting over there, something called the Maastricht treaty came up; it is so long ago I can barely remember it. Being younger then, I hinted that it might be a suitable subject for a referendum. The silence on the then Government Benches was deafening, and my old friend Tom Strathclyde was among those silent. As it happens, I am temperamentally inclined towards referenda&#151;a hush has descended on the Chamber&#151;but I acknowledge that it is foolish of me. I wonder when the Conservative Party has ever had or hinted at holding a referendum. It did not do so even on the Magna Carta.</p>

&#147;Mr Speaker, with your permission I should like to make a Statement on the progress report by Kieran Poynter, chairman and senior partner of

<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_503"><b>17 Dec 2007 : Column 503</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>PricewaterhouseCoopers, into the loss of child benefit records at HM Revenue and Customs. Before I turn to that, I can confirm that the police investigation continues. While the searches are drawing to a close, their inquiry is not yet complete. However, the police have reiterated that they have no information or intelligence that the data have fallen into wrong hands. They will keep that under review. &#147;The banks, too, say that they have found no evidence of any activities suggesting fraud arising from this incident. They continue to monitor closely the accounts concerned so that they can see immediately if there is any unusual or irregular activity. As I have told the House previously, the majority of accounts into which child benefit payments are made are with a small number of banks and these banks have checked them back to 18 October, the date the missing data were posted. There are no reports of any activities suggesting increased fraud attempts deriving from the incident. &#147;I deliberately gave Mr Poynter wide-ranging terms of reference because of the seriousness of this loss, together with my concern about previous losses of data which I referred to in my statement on 20 November. Mr Poynter started his review on 23 November, just three weeks ago, and as he says his work is far from complete and his conclusions will develop as that work progresses. Inevitably, therefore, this report is short, but I said last month that I would return to the House when it became available. A copy has been placed in the Vote Office in the usual way. &#147;Kieran Poynter sets out the work he has put in hand. He says that he has given priority to the immediate steps Revenue and Customs must take to protect data security. Revenue and Customs has already put in place a number of measures. Mr Poynter says that these are measures that he would have recommended, and which his report sets out. As Mr Hartnett, the acting head of Revenue and Customs, said to the Treasury Select Committee on 5 December, they include the imposition of a complete ban on the transfer of bulk data without adequate security protection such as encryption, as well as measures to prevent the downloading of data without adequate security safeguards. In addition, Revenue and Customs disabled all the personal and laptop computers it uses to prevent the downloading of data onto removable media. Those computers will only be reactivated at the approval of a senior manager for a specific business-critical purpose. &#147;Mr Poynter has also begun his investigation into exactly what happened in relation to the loss, but he makes the point that there are more inquiries to be made, more interviews to be carried out and greater examination of the evidence available. As he says, it would be wholly inappropriate for him to draw final conclusions until his work is completed. &#147;Mr Poynter also draws attention to the general responsibilities and accountability in HM Revenue and Customs. These issues are also referred to in the capability review into HM Revenue and Customs carried out by an independent panel overseen by the Cabinet Secretary. The House will be aware that  


<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_504"><b>17 Dec 2007 : Column 504</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this review was commissioned as part of a general review, announced in July 2006, of the strengths and weaknesses of all government departments. The Revenue and Customs review is published today, along with that for the Treasury and updates for four other departments. I am also publishing Revenue and Customs&#146; autumn performance report. &#147;The capability review identifies a number of important strengths of Revenue and Customs, including a proven ability to bring in the money to fund public services while driving down its own costs and delivering greater efficiency. It refers to committed people with honesty and integrity, and with clear desires to transform and improve. The review also highlights a number of areas where improvements are needed, including the necessity to set up a simpler structure and clearer accountability, improving confidence and strengthening management information. The acting chairman agrees, and is announcing proposals to put in place a simpler organisational structure with clearer accountabilities which, as Mr Poynter says, will make it easier to implement recommendations on data security as his review progresses. &#147;I said in my Statement that the Prime Minister had asked the Cabinet Secretary to ensure that every government department checked its procedures for the storage and use of data, and to make recommendations on how to improve data handling procedures across government. His interim report is also published today, alongside a Written Ministerial Statement by the Minister for the Cabinet Office. &#147;The Prime Minister has already announced that the Information Commissioner will have the power to conduct spot checks on departments. There will now also be new sanctions under the Data Protection Act for the most serious breaches of its principles, which will take account of the need not only to provide high levels of data security but to ensure that sensible data-sharing practices can be conducted with legal certainty. We will consult early in the New Year on how that can best be done. The report also sets out a range of other measures. &#147;Revenue and Customs and, before it, the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise have served successive Governments well. Their staff are dedicated and hard working. However, the loss of this data was extremely serious and should not have happened; again, I apologise to everyone who has been affected. &#147;As I told the House in November, the loss of this data together with losses in previous incidents mean that a wide-ranging review is necessary so that lessons could be learnt, procedures tightened and security improved.&#147;Mr Poynter tells me he expects to conclude his work in the first half of next year and I shall report back to the House when I have his final report. I commend the Statement to the House&#148;.

The Minister must be very grateful that there is only one more day until the Christmas Recess and that this is probably the last time that he has to appear to put on a brave face to cover the incompetence of the Chancellor and the Chancellor's departments&#151;for this year at least.</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="0712172000203">Four weeks ago, the Chancellor had to admit that HMRC had managed to achieve the largest-ever loss of personal data on some 25 million people in 7.5 million families. That Statement, dreadful as it was, was not the whole truth. It said that the release of data was carried out by,</p>
<ul><a name="0712172000277">&#147;a junior official in HMRC&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 20/11/07; col. 1101.]</ul>
<p><a name="0712172000258">But we now know that the junior official was a manager among the top 4 per cent of staff in grade terms in HMRC. Furthermore, an even more senior person, the child benefit process owner, was well aware of the fact that unencrypted personal data were being supplied in industrial quantities to the NAO.</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="0712172000204">The Chancellor also said that he had delayed informing the public and Parliament about the data loss because the banks,</p>
<ul><a name="0712172000278">&#147;were adamant that they wanted as much time as possible to prepare&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 20/11/07; col. 1102.]</ul>
<p><a name="0712172000259">The British Bankers&#146; Association immediately issued a press release to say that it had not been asking for a delay. While the Chancellor admitted to some other major lapses in data security this year, he did not own up to all of them. He did not say that there were 2,111 security breaches a year at HMRC. He did not spell out that the lost discs contained data that were not encrypted or that encryption was not a routine HMRC procedure.</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="0712172000205">We looked forward to learning more today in the interim report of Mr Poynter, but were disappointed at the lack of hard facts. Is Mr Poynter working alone or is he allowed some support? Will the Minister say how much this review has cost to date and what it is estimated to cost in total?</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="0712172000206">The big question for us is whether the failings at HMRC were systemic. The Chancellor has said that they were not, but Mr Dave Hartnett, the acting chairman of HMRC, when he gave evidence to the Treasury Select Committee in another place, said that the failings may well be systemic. Indeed it is difficult to find any explanation other than systemic failure to account for the fact that the letters sent out after the event also revealed personal information and not all were correctly addressed.</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="0712172000207">We continue to have the gravest concerns about the culture of HMRC. It was created at the behest of the Prime Minister when he was Chancellor to generate cost savings. We warned at the time of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Bill about the difficulties of such a large merger and were unconvinced by the responses.</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="0712172000208">The published e-mail exchanges between the HMRC official who released the information and the NAO are informative. The NAO had pointed out that  


<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_506"><b>17 Dec 2007 : Column 506</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it did not need the quantity of data that was actually sent and asked for a smaller, non-confidential data set. The HMRC man replied:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"><a name="0712172000269">&#147;I must stress we must make use of the data we hold and not over burden the business by asking them to run additional scans/filters that may incur a cost to the department&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0712172000209">The assessment and collection of taxes is not a business. HMRC&#146;s language does not acknowledge that tax assessment and collection is a public service; and with that may go a lack of awareness of the obligations that go with public service. In addition, I believe that it has subsequently been established that the cost referred to was about &#163;5,000. What kind of organisation puts the security of data about 25 million people at risk for &#163;5,000?</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="0712172000260">The HMRC capability review is also published today and not before time. It talks, as does the Poynter review, about setting up a simpler structure with clearer accountability. It is full of management speak&#151;performance management, strategic frameworks, customers and process improvement&#151;but there is nothing about public service. Is the Minister sure there is no issue of culture to address? Structures are fairly easy to deal with, but changing culture is infinitely harder and change cannot start until the problem has been recognised.</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="0712172000210">The Chancellor appointed Sir David Varney as the first chairman of HMRC. He was a businessman with a sound reputation in the commercial world. He set up the structures that are now to be changed. He had already left when the data loss disaster struck and his successor appeared to pay the price of failure. I say &#147;appeared&#148; to pay because Mr Paul Gray may have resigned as chairman of HMRC but he is still being paid in full somewhere in the Cabinet Office. Meanwhile Mr Varney is now the Prime Minister's adviser on transformational government. God help the rest of government from being transformed like HMRC.</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="0712172000211">It remains a fact that the disks have not been found despite a huge police exercise to find them. Will the Minister say how much the police exercise has cost to date? The Information Commissioner has made it clear that he wants far greater powers to help him to enforce high data-protection standards. Our Data Protection Act does not even give the Information Commissioner full power to pursue issues in contravention of EU law and the structure of offences is weak. The Information Commissioner is being fobbed off with a non-statutory ability to carry out spot checks on government departments, which is simply not good enough.</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para10">
<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="0712172000212">The interim report on data-handling procedures in government also released today holds out the prospect of new sanctions but in the same breath says that this has to ensure sensible data-sharing practices. When are the Government going to see that they have already gone too far? For good reason public opinion has shifted sharply against national identity cards and the related register. The Government must now put data security above all else or they will forfeit public trust. This Statement and its accompanying flimsy documents are no more than a smokescreen. We have learnt little that is new and some big questions remain unanswered. The Minister said that Mr Poynter

I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, that he must be extremely grateful that this is the last time this year that he has to appear before your Lordships&#146; House to make such a Statement. I am sure all noble Lords would want to wish the Minister a happy and relaxing Christmas in view of his recent exertions and a relatively disaster-free new year, although on recent evidence I am not sure that he can necessarily look forward to that. As well as the issue we are debating today&#151;and we have been spared this in your Lordships&#146; House&#151;a Statement is being made in another place at 5.30 pm about the almost laughable further misplacing of information by DVLA. There are two sequential Statements in Parliament today about the loss of data held by government. I doubt whether this has ever been the case before. We certainly have no cause to believe that this endemic failure is being resolved by Mr Poynter&#146;s review or anything else.</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="0712172000214">If there is one lesson which jumps out from all the evidence we have seen about the incompetence of the Government in this area, it is that there is no way that they should now be proceeding with even more centralisation of valuable personal data, whether it be for a compulsory ID card scheme, the DNA database or the NHS case records system.</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="0712172000215">The Government are basing their defence of their behaviour here on the distinction between systemic failure, which is the fault of Ministers, and procedural failure, which is the fault of officials. Needless to say, they have come down on the side of this being a procedural rather than a systemic failure. However, is it not the case that in recent years pressure within Whitehall, happily supported by Ministers, has been for ever-greater information-sharing across government, whatever the confidentiality problems? A generation ago, when I worked at Customs and Excise, we were not allowed to share information with the Inland Revenue on the basis of taxpayer confidentiality. Arguably, that went too far in one direction but, equally, I think that very few people could now doubt that the pendulum has swung too far the other way.</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="0712172000216">The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, referred to the work that Sir David Varney is undertaking on so-called transformational government. This seems to mean removing barriers to information-sharing within the public sector, the practical consequence of which could be to magnify many times the damage done by information losses of the kind experienced by HMRC. Will the Government now ask Sir David to pause and think further about whether government and the country are ready for further transformation along the lines of the recent disasters?</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="0712172000217">On the specifics, HMRC has now apparently agreed which data are to be encrypted and which are not and it has also agreed to a clear procedure for ensuring that that is done. In that regard, can we be assured that  


<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_508"><b>17 Dec 2007 : Column 508</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Government have sought and gained the support of the big computer companies which dominate the operation of IT in HMRC and other departments? On that subject, and to return to something that I raised when we debated these issues earlier, surely it is now imperative that the gateway reviews on the external use of IT companies are published. Can the Minister confirm that the Government will no longer block in the courts publication of these reviews?</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="0712172000218">Can the noble Lord also explain why Ministers have been blocking reasonable questions about security within government? Why, for example, have the Government refused to answer simple factual questions raised by my colleague in another place, the honourable Member for Falmouth and Camborne, about whether departments have existing protocols governing data exchange within and between government departments and agencies such as HMRC? The obfuscation leads to the obvious conclusion that they have no such protocols and are trying to conceal the fact. Can he put pressure on the Cabinet Office to release any such protocols?</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="0712172000219">Two minor but irritating issues have arisen in recent days. Can the Minister explain why the helpline for families who are worrying about HMRC data losses is on an 0845 number? The misuse of 0845 numbers as a revenue source for government departments has been a growing scandal to which there has been no satisfactory response. It is highly unsatisfactory that an 0845 number is being used in this case.</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="0712172000220">Finally, is the Minister aware that the many millions of letters which were sent out apologising for the loss of personal data themselves unnecessarily included a great amount of personal data, including national insurance numbers? As, according to the Courts Service, 8 per cent of all official letters go astray, are not the Government just compounding the error of their earlier disaster with another initiative which uses personal data needlessly and in a way that could lead to its misuse?</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="0712172000221">This is another sad Statement by the Government. So far, the Poynter review has not answered the questions that we need to be answered before we and, more importantly, the public can feel satisfied that personal, confidential information is being dealt with acceptably by the Government. Together with the noble Baroness, I ask the Minister when we can expect, if not a satisfactory conclusion, at least a conclusion to the Poynter review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="0712172000223">With regard to the interim review, Poynter confirms that what the Chancellor said in his Statement to the House was entirely accurate with the data then available. There have been subsequent developments, but there is no question of any challenge to the Chancellor&#146;s good faith in presenting to the House with total accuracy all the information that he had available at the time. Poynter is looking at how to improve security using  


<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_509"><b>17 Dec 2007 : Column 509</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>encryption and other strategies. It will be recognised that HMRC took action immediately to ensure that restrictions were in place. The Poynter report emphasises that he entirely agrees with the prompt way in which the department acted and with the measures that it has taken.</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para20">
<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="0712172000224">The noble Baroness said that the new acting head seemed to indicate that the errors were systemic. Noble Lords who have been before Select Committees in the other place will know that challenging questions are presented and responses are given in good faith. If we look at the context in which Mr Hartnett was responding to those questions, it is clear that he had an open position on whether the errors were systemic. He did not know at that time. He was all too well aware that that is exactly the kind of issue that the Poynter report is meant to identify and which it is in the process of identifying. Mr Hartnett was not ruling anything in or out. How could he when we still awaited a full investigation of what had gone on?</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="0712172000225">The noble Baroness asked me to identify the costs of the process. I cannot do that at this stage. This is an interim report supported by a sophisticated level of efficiency, as the noble Baroness would wish. The costs involved will become clear when the final report is due, but no one would expect that at this interim stage we can identify the costs involved in this exercise. An element of cost that we can discuss is whether the culture of the department has changed significantly. It is somewhat striking that the party opposite suggests that it has never dreamed of anything that bears down on costs, improves efficiency or introduces new managerial techniques into the Civil Service and that as far as it is concerned this is a wilful Government who pursue aims that they do not follow. That party is for ever berating this Government on the costs of government and emphasising the excessive degree of red tape, which it regards as excessive bureaucracy, yet when we make a strategic change to a major department&#151;a change that is now being reviewed by the Cabinet review which can see no evidence that there was a loss of efficiency through the merging of the departments&#151;it suggest that somehow the Government are at fault. I entirely refute that proposition.</p>

<a name="71217-0006.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="0712172000226">It is important that we recognise that there was a significant failure, for which due apology has been made. Lessons have to be learnt from it and those lessons have to be acted on. Poynter identified that in the most important part of the interim report. If the noble Baroness can contain her impatience until after Christmas, in due course we will get a full report from that highly qualified individual who will give the Government the best advice from a full analysis of what went wrong. Far from it being a smokescreen, as the noble Baroness indicated, it would be absurd to suggest that in the space of three weeks Poynter could have analysed fully what went wrong in the department and have provided a full account of what needs to be done in the future. Of course the report is significant, not least because Poynter has been working against a background of an intensive police investigation. Indeed, not even the police have been able to conclude their inquiries at this stage, such is the complexity of the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="0712172000229">The noble Lord, Lord Newby, said that certain lessons had to be learnt. It is the case that we have to look at the relationship between the Government and the big computer companies, as he put it, with which we make arrangements. The noble Lord indicated that in the past he had witnessed a limited exchange of information, but we are in a new era. In order to provide effective government, it is necessary for departments to talk to each other about problems that are frequently referred to in this House as being cross-government in nature and thus in need of that level of co-operation. However, it is absolutely essential that such cross-government activity has to be secure, and that is what the major report will address its investigations into. It will look at the efficacy of government with a heightened emphasis on the security of cross-government information in the wake of this most unfortunate development at HMRC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="0712172000230">The noble Lord also mentioned the problems surrounding communications with the general public through 0845 numbers. In the light of these difficulties, when the department does correspond with anyone directly affected by them, it is absolutely incumbent on officials that they guarantee that the reader and recipient of the letter is the person to whom it is addressed. Given that, of course such a letter will have a little more than just an initial and the surname of the person to whom it is addressed. It is bound to carry some additional information in order to make sure that the communication is delivered correctly. I hear what the noble Lord says, but noble Lords will recognise that this is a misadventure which has caused the Government a great deal of concern and grief. This is not anything more than the product of the need to provide interaction between departments at a much higher level than in the past. Further, the amount of information which a government now inevitably compile is much greater than in the past as a result of the expectations of our citizenry. It will therefore be appreciated that it is important to look at the Poynter report and the further investigation into the wider issues of government in order to identify clearly the constructive road ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="0712177000004">The mechanism in place for setting a rolling annual target in Amendment No. 30 is that the Secretary of State would set the target in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee on Climate Change and after it had been approved by resolution of both Houses of Parliament. Those two conditions would have to be met before the annual target was set. The other amendments stipulate that in the reports, annual and interim, rolling targets would be included.  


<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_514"><b>17 Dec 2007 : Column 514</b><br /> <br /></columnNum></p>

<a name="71217-0007.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="0712177000005">We believe that rolling annual targets are the more appropriate way to have milestones. They offer flexibility and accountability. As mentioned above, the fact that targets were adjusted yearly would allow the Secretary of State and the climate change committee to take account of the multiplicity of variables that might affect the successful accomplishment of a target. That is not intended to give any Minister&#151;or anyone else, for that matter&#151;a way to shirk their responsibilities. On the contrary, the idea of having projections updated every year simply allows for targets to correspond more closely with scientific realities that affect the process of reducing climate change. Reduction in emissions does not follow a steady yearly pattern; all the speakers in all our debates have recognised that, and it is important that any annual milestone arrangement reflects it.</p>

<a name="71217-0007.htm_para13">
<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="0712177000006">The risk is that if some great improvement is made at the beginning of five years&#151;say, a group of old power stations is finally phased out&#151;the Minister will be able to do very little for the remaining five years if he wishes and will still meet the target. That is not acceptable. In order for progress to be maintained, yearly evaluations, with an eye on how one year will affect the coming years, are essential. That would affect Ministers&#151;and everyone else. I have altered my notes, because I am sensitive to the point made by the Minister that the Government are responsible for only 50 per cent of emissions. The response to the Bill, when it is enacted, will go way beyond Whitehall. Everyone will have a responsibility to see that the targets are met.</p>

<a name="71217-0007.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_121"><a name="0712177000007">So, with yearly evaluations, Ministers and everyone else could be made more accountable. Actions to reduce climate change could then be assessed independently of some of the accidents of fate that might bring failure or success to a particular year&#146;s budget. That system would allow for an organic assessment process that saw current efforts matched with their related future possibilities. Additionally, having rolling annual adjustments would ensure that projections on expected progress were carried over between Governments. By having the next six years assessed annually, there would be a continuity of the process of reducing emissions that was outside the sphere of everyday politics. No Government could blame their predecessor if the targets for the following six years were under constant scrutiny. That is a major tenet of our position on the Bill as a whole.</p>

<a name="71217-0007.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="0712177000008">I am sure your Lordships are beginning to see that with rolling annual targets we would have yet another way to ensure that we were being as faithful to scientific advancement and analysis as possible while removing the ability of Ministers to avoid what we recognise is a great responsibility. At their core, indicative milestones would increase the pressure to ensure that measures were working early in the budget period and would detract from the ability of Ministers, or anyone else, to pass the buck.

Those milestones would become a duty on the Secretary of State. While I sympathise with the general thrust of the noble Lord&#146;s amendments, inserting that kind of pressure would go beyond that.

The rolling targets feed into the very nature of the targets. We support that. That targets on a yearly basis should be looked at is common ground. The noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, has pointed out that a duty is being placed on the Secretary of State but, as we know, under the Bill there is no sanction against the Secretary of State if a target is not met, a point that was raised at Second Reading and probably ought to be looked at again. That is the major problem we have with all these provisions.</p>

<a name="71217-0007.htm_para16">
<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="0712177000011">The Minister said in response to the previous group of amendments that there might be certain issues that change, such as winter. I understand that certain aspects of trying to meet this year-on-year target will be difficult, especially in the area of energy generation. I was speaking to one of the energy companies this morning. Scottish and Southern Energy was talking about the type of power stations it will be looking at in the future. One of the problems all power stations have at the moment is that, although we are introducing a duty within the Bill, they have very little firm analysis of what type of power station regulation will allow them to build and what sort of return on investment will be achievable with differing government objectives. With carbon becoming one of the most important attributes, along with price and reliability, that we will have to consider when we discuss Ofgem&#146;s responsibilities in the Energy Bill, there will be a problem with the targets since they cannot be met quite so easily on a year-by-year basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="0712177000012">When we discussed this issue in the break&#151;the Statements served a purpose&#151;it was suggested that we could take out the milestones and consider an internal delivery path, a mechanism that already exists, to judge the trajectory. The Minister has made the point that this is a difficult area, but that is something we should discuss in looking at this area. Those targets would be set between year one and year five, and there might be&#151;for such reasons as a nuclear power station coming on-line or the London Array becoming operational in 2012&#151;a significant effect on the yearly basis. It comes back to the major problem we face with all of these: although some noble Lords have not agreed with our assessment of the five-year plan, there is enormous potential for drift for reasons that are outside the powers of the Secretary of State for Defra. This is one of the problems with bringing other departments in.</p>

What will concentrate the mind of the Chancellor in setting the Budget, or of departmental officials in framing legislation for Ministers on the need for changes in environmental areas? The more I listen to this debate, the more I look to the words my noble friend used in replying to the previous amendment. He talked about toughening up the annual report.

Of itself, all it does is put in place an administrative structure which will produce targets and budgets and, under regulations, can produce market mechanisms. The real changes that must take place probably have nothing to do with that. There will be immense technological changes. These will depend on regulations in an entirely different field. They will depend on financial incentives and a clear determination on the part of the Government that technology has to change. The whole energy industry has to change. We cannot use fossil fuels. That is a huge revolution in thinking, but if we do not have that, what we are writing into the Bill, and what the Government have already written into it, will be completely worthless.</p>

If you do not have a duty to try to fulfil the obligation to meet those indicators, there is no coercive power under this Bill to deliver what we are seeking.

It might be worth bearing in mind that a number of large energy companies, when now considering projects and talking to their individual component parts, require not only a financial budget but an emissions budget.

I should clarify that because I may have misled noble Lords. We have no control over the annual, year-on-year fluctuations in emissions from 50 per cent of the economy&#151;I think that that is accepted&#151;but the EU Emissions Trading Scheme covers half the UK&#146;s carbon dioxide emissions. The Government set the cap for them over five years. Over the budget period as a whole, we have control over the emissions. Within the emissions trading system, however, as colleagues know, companies are free to vary their annual emissions provided that they meet their obligations over the period as a whole. The Government have no control over the annual emissions from UK companies within the trading system. That was the practical reason that I was giving. I was not saying that we have no control whatever&#151;there is control over the five years&#151;but we have no control at all over how the obligations are practically operated by companies.</p>

Three targets may be applied in 2030, for example&#151;the annual target, the rolling annual target and the interim target, which may each require different levels of emissions.

In other words, for the Government to comply, 70 per cent of the target reductions must be achieved by reducing domestic emissions or by increasing domestic carbon sinks. To meet the 2050 target, emissions must be 42 per cent lower than they were in 1990. In other words, 70 per cent of the 60 per cent target&#151;if that is what we settle for in the Bill, though I hope we do not and go instead for a higher target&#151;must be achieved domestically. The other 18 per cent&#151;that is, about 30 per cent of the 60 per cent&#151;can be covered using carbon credits.

If my maths is correct&#151;though it may not be&#151;domestic greenhouse gas emissions need not be reduced at all under the Bill in order to meet the Government&#146;s targets. The Government could simply purchase carbon credits to cover the difference. In other words, if emissions were still at present levels in 2050, the Government could claim to have met their targets entirely by purchasing offsets. The price of a certified emissions reduction&#151;the carbon unit created by the clean development mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol&#151;is currently about $10 per tonne of CO2 emitted. In order to cover the entire target reduction in 2050, the Government would therefore have to spend some $4.6 billion. That would cover only a single year, whereas the Government would have to offset the difference between actual emissions and their carbon budget every year.

Amendment No. 27 would place a limit on the number of international credits used, based on the size of the budget rather than the size of the target. In the short term that would lead in practice to more international credits being allowed. In the long term, however, it would lead to fewer. For example, in a 2020 budget with a 20 per cent reduction target&#151;where the baseline equals 100&#151;a 30 per cent target would lead to a limit on credits of six; that is, 30 per cent of 20 per cent of 100 equals six. And for<I> Hansard</I>&#146;s benefit I should say that this is clearly written out in my notes. In a 2050 budget with a 60 per cent reduction target&#151;where the baseline equals 100&#151;30 per cent of the target would lead to a limit on credits of 18; that is, 30 per cent of 60 per cent of 100 is 18.

I am glad that Bali has set us on the road. However, by the time we get to 2020 we will have to have established clearly through our efforts that we have had the basic principle of supplementarity very much in mind.

He probably knows as much as anyone about the complexities of climate emissions trading and these issues. In his evidence he expressed that it was extremely difficult to form judgments about the exact percentages and figures that we should settle on at this stage. He suggested that when we moved on to the real as opposed to the draft Bill, we should make sure that the climate change committee was not just given the task of recommending the UK&#146;s share of credits and ensuring that the UK made a full and adequate contribution to the reduction of climate change, but that it should be able to embrace the issue of the international contribution.

The committee should ensure that any imported credits were worth while and stood up to international and national evaluation of their value&#151;that they were not just paper transactions or the kind of scams referred to by some critics but made really worthwhile contributions.

This is a very important issue of how far the UK relies on its own reductions in carbon emissions and how much on bought-in credits from overseas. Clearly, there is a balance to be struck. There is a strong case in theory for achieving carbon emissions at lowest cost, wherever that is possible across the world. There is also a good argument for carbon trading being a mechanism by which economic resources are transferred to developing countries that are themselves achieving carbon emissions cuts.</p>

<a name="71217-0008.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="0712179000031">On the other hand, it is clear that the primary focus of developed countries&#151;and this is why the word &#147;supplemental&#148; was used in the Kyoto Protocol&#151;must be on reducing their own carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions. That is vital for two reasons. First, it is only because we are driving down and are committed to driving down our own emissions that we will be the drivers of the new technologies that are then available to the rest of the world, be they new technologies in energy efficiency or renewable energy. The other is perhaps a more short-term thing, but at the moment we cannot be as sure as we should like to be about the robustness of some of the offsets that we can purchase from the other end of the world. Therefore, it is essential that the primary focus of the UK climate programme be on our own greenhouse gas emission cuts with only a supplemental role for bought-in credits.</p>

<a name="71217-0008.htm_para22">
<p><a name="stpa_151"><a name="0712179000032">In that context, I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, is correct to say that the details of that require more thought and that that is something that the climate change committee should look at and develop recommendations on. The appropriate amount of a purchase from overseas will change over time; it may be appropriate for it to be somewhat bigger in the very short term&#151;in the first budget or so&#151;because it is difficult to turn the ship quickly, but it should reduce over time. In that respect, I admired the ability of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, to construct between Amendments Nos. 25 and 27 something which many of us when we first looked at the paper thought must be contradictory but which is a clever mathematical way in which to achieve that tightening over time. However, I worry that, if we accept the amendments, we would inadvertently make them far too lax.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="0712179000033">For example, if we run the figures on Amendment No. 27, if the budget for 2020&#151;the third of the first three carbon budgets&#151;was at the lower end of the range suggested by the Bill at 26 per cent, so that the budget would be 74 per cent of the 1990 figure of 100 minus 26, the amount that we could buy in to achieve that would be 30 per cent of 74 per cent, which would be 22 per cent. In that case, we would have achieved 90 per cent of our reduction by a bought-in mechanism and, over 30 years, would hardly have cut our greenhouse gases at all. Therefore, the principle of the amendment is worth talking about, but the details have to be worked out by the committee. If one puts in place a set of figures without that detailed thought, there are two dangers. On the one hand, it is impossibly tight, but it also signals a willingness to buy in credits from overseas. That is what would be achieved by the 30 per cent figure proposed in Amendment No. 27.</p>

It sounds as though the son of the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, is in favour of the principle even if he cannot decide on the relevant level. We clearly cannot simply deal with this problem by shuffling it off on to other countries. That is the important principle of the amendments. All countries will need to reduce their carbon emissions, but especially developed Western ones. That is the focus of the amendments. Clearly, credits will be useful to developing countries, but we need to balance that if those countries are to be able to develop themselves. It is extremely important to bear that in mind. Therefore, we must give a strong direction to the climate change committee that these reductions must be largely in the UK and not simply by trading. That is why I support the principle of the amendments.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, is undoubtedly right that this is complex. He may well be right that, in the end, wherever the carbon cut occurs in the world is equal. However, there are a number of important political and technical issues that require us to take the principle of the amendment very seriously. If the outcome were, never mind the precise arithmetic of the 30 per cent, something like what the noble Lord, Lord Turner, said&#151;that 90 per cent of our achievements as a result of following the precepts of the Bill were actually achieved overseas&#151;that is not the Bill that we are selling to our own people and the rest of the world. If we were buying all the credits overseas, British citizens would be without the pressure on their way of live to adopt new technologies and new ways of doing things which keep us ahead of the game.</p>

<a name="71217-0009.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="0712179000036">It is complex, because three different elements are intertwined. They are interrelated but not the same: there is the issue of trading; of our domestic target, which is essentially what is in the Bill; and our Kyoto commitments and the supplemental mechanisms that are provided under Kyoto. They do not all end up with the same result. The latter two, in this context, can be seen as mechanisms for achieving the first, but they are not the same and they are not the same answer. One could adopt a figure along the lines of the amendment without at the same time inhibiting trading or any new post-Kyoto international agreement.</p>

<a name="71217-0009.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="0712179000037">The central theme of the Bill is that Britain is setting itself&#151;its own industry and people&#151;a target to make a significant contribution towards the problem of climate change. If we allow a situation under the Bill whereby our companies and institutions are buying those credits elsewhere, that central principle falls.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="0712179000038">The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, may well be right: the exact figure and the way in which that is achieved may be best left to the advice of the climate change committee. The optimum figure will certainly change over time. Apart from anything else, if the whole economy is in the trading mechanism you cannot count these things twice; therefore you are at the end of the road. But at this stage of the Bill, whereas we may not actually agree on a percentage, the principle

There should be a limit on the degree to which we can meet said targets over the budget set out in the Bill by overseas credits, however we care to express that. Although we can all argue about the 30 per cent&#151;we know that it will change over time and we accept that the climate change committee will make the recommendations&#151;the principle raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, should be included in the Bill.</p>

It is important to get the right balance between international credits and UK action for all the reasons that Members of the Committee have described, such as the decarbonisation&#151;that is a dreadful word&#151;of the UK economy. Furthermore, we will not exactly look like global statesman and leaders on the carbon front if we are not doing very much back home, and, at the moment, confidence in the green development mechanism is not where it should be in terms of the sorts of gases that it is reducing and the verification mechanism. In the early stages, there is an absolute need for a strong focus on carbon reduction within the UK as well as doing our bit for carbon reduction internationally.</p>

<a name="71217-0009.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="0712179000040">I am not sure whether the target is the right one&#151;there are two different targets for two different amendments in this group. The noble Baroness Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, admirably wrestled with the complications of the targets. The answer probably lies with the climate change commission&#151;sorry, climate change committee: that was a Freudian slip that pre-empts a future amendment&#151;but that worries me. The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, talked about year-to-year changes by the climate change committee. That is not the answer either. We have to find a way of giving a strong signal to British business and investors in British business that the Government are earnest about UK carbon reduction. However we do that, it needs to happen. Some strengthening of the role of the climate change committee in the Bill to make it clear that there is a requirement for it to report in that fashion and to make a strong recommendation to the Government along those lines would be of some assistance.</p>

The Secretary of State said that we are bold in the United Kingdom&#151;I paraphrase that but it is what he said. We are putting through legislation that will ensure that Britain reduces its carbon emissions by 60 per cent on a statutory basis. That is what he said, but that is not what the Bill does. I wish it did but it does not. Because of international trading and the concept of a carbon account, we can get to 2050 and under certain circumstances not have reduced our carbon emissions at all. In fact, under certain circumstances, we could reach the 2050 target but miss it because we had been selling credits because our industry had decarbonised so much.</p>

It is very unlikely that that would happen. I am not arguing that it would actually happen, but it could, within a very large spectrum, mean that any of those results, between what we emit now and what our target is in the future, could be possible, given the flexibility of the concept of the carbon account in this Bill. It is quite clear that those outcomes could be very broad. The principle of my own amendment, Amendment No. 111, that I also wish to talk to, is that we need to understand this difference. I am not completely against including a certain degree of trading within our targets for reduction&#151;that is a practical and reasonable way forward. Again, I emphasise the point that if we say that we do not allow all credits and trades to count, that does not in any way stop those trades happening anyway, because they do happen. The EU ETS will carry on regardless, as will the flexible mechanisms under Kyoto and no doubt its successors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"><a name="0712179000046">What we are saying&#151;this is absolutely core to what the Government themselves believe&#151;is that there has to be, primarily, a reduction in carbon in our own economy, outside of any trading. To do that, we need to have that stated in the Bill itself. It is as simple as that. In my own amendment, and that of my noble friend Lord Redesdale, we have put two numbers. We have said 10 per cent up to 2020 and then 5 per cent. I am far less adept at mathematics than my noble friend Lady Miller. I had meant that to mean 10 per cent and 5 per cent of the total carbon budget, rather than the difference. These numbers are clearly things that we would have to be more clear and precise about, as we move through the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="0712179000047">It is essential for the purpose of the Bill, for the reputation of the Bill internationally and for our leadership internationally that there should be a restriction&#151;preferably one that gets tighter as time goes on&#151;on how much we can include carbon trades within our carbon budget.

That is the way to make it clear to the international community that there is no fudge factor&#151;this is much bigger than wiggle room&#151;and to say that really we are leading here.

The question is how best to define it in the Bill. I also agree that we need to give the climate change committee a very clear direction and steer. That may take the form of saying that the figure of 60 per cent, if that is what it finally is, is an internal figure, rather than this complicated series of formulae that were introduced by the noble Baroness, which I think people would find very hard to comprehend or explain. I would prefer, if we are going to say that there has got to be a limit and a steer, to turn around and say that the internal figure has got to be a fixed percentage and that the climate change committee should take us in that direction. The noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, was right when she said that we have to give that steer and direction. What we are groping for is how we get there in a way that is clear.

I would certainly require there to be a restriction even if we decided later what it was. I believe we should make up our mind on that restriction before the Bill gets Royal Assent. This is a core area. It does not get in the way of carbon trading happening within the schemes that exist at the moment or those that will exist in the future.

But it certainly does matter for the UK, both from the point of view of moral leadership and for the positioning of our industry. I would add that if we are doing this in the interests of supporting British industry and positioning it better for a low-carbon world, we need to do this in a considered and gradual way, so that British industry is not dually disadvantaged by comparison with its competitors in Europe. We believe that in the long term, this would be an advantage. But a lot of industry lives on a quarter by quarter, year by year basis. It would be important not to impose burdens that would unduly disadvantage them in the short term.

But trading will continue anyway. The EU ETS just carries on trading; the flexible mechanisms of Kyoto will just carry on, whatever we use as a measurement here. We are being entirely consistent.

The first is where UK companies and entities can buy credits from those who emit less than their capped allocation, and the second is the funding of projects abroad, which will displace the growth of emissions from the developing world. UK companies that emit more in a given period than their allocated cap must buy sufficient credits to bring their net carbon account into line with their cap. They can buy credits from another company within the UK; that will reduce their net carbon account but increase the selling company&#146;s, so that both companies stay within their respective cap allocations. Because those transactions take place in the UK, there is no change to the UK&#146;s net carbon account. Alternatively, the company can buy its credits from another company outside the UK.

<ul><a name="0712179000095">&#147;the use of the mechanisms shall be supplemental to domestic action and that domestic action shall thus constitute a significant element of the effort made&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0712179000085">&#147;Supplemental&#148; and &#147;significant&#148; suggest that a figure of well below 50 per cent would be acceptable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="0712179000063">At this point, I would like to say something about the reporting of the UK&#146;s net carbon account. There is a need for full disclosure in the reporting of the reduction in emissions from one period to the next. By that I mean disclosure of how much of the change is due to the UK&#146;s domestic emissions, how much is due to carbon trading&#151;both of credits and debits&#151;and how much is due to the taking of credit for developing-world projects. That would offer some transparency to the process. We have tabled an amendment to that effect, to which we shall come later.</p>

<a name="71217-0009.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="0712179000064">What is the right percentage? We have lots of different ideas in the Committee today. Should it be the same percentage throughout the 42 years? That was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Turner. There may be merit in tapering the percentage over the period. Initially, companies would need to trade carbon extensively until they got their own house in order. If they failed to do so and as their allocated cap reduced year on year, the cost of trading carbon would become prohibitive, until price forced them to take action. For an example of tapering, let us take the figure of 40 per cent suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. You could have something like 40 per cent in the first 10 years, 30 per cent for the next 10 years, 20 per cent for the next and 10 per cent for the remaining. That example averages out at about 25 per cent for the 42 years, which is coincidentally the same figure as I plucked out of the air at the beginning of my remarks. However, if there is to be any tapering, it should be for the committee to decide.</p>

Buying indulgences abroad may increase as years go by but, by having a tapering mechanism in place, the whole thing would reduce.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="0712179000067">I said earlier that we should not put a percentage into this Bill, as we would only be guessing. The setting of limits for carbon credits should be left to the committee of experts. Indeed, I understand that Brussels is currently looking at setting those limits centrally, so it would be entirely inappropriate for us to put a limit in the Bill before the EU had deliberated. Doing so would make our position inflexible&#151;another reason why the setting of limits should, we believe, be delegated to the committee so that it can look at all the facts and evidence. We have tabled amendments to that effect, which we shall debate later.</p>

We are all pretty numerate, but it is a matter of trying to explain the figures in a forum like our Committee, when we lack the good communications technology that the Committee on Climate Change will certainly have. I freely admit that we shall return to some aspects of this important debate, as some of your Lordships have said. The significance of this matter is

<a name="71217-0010.htm_para0">
<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="0712179000069">One or two Members of the Committee have asked how the Government can prove that we are determined and committed to decarbonising the UK economy. From that point of view, the Bill needs more clarity. We will take that aspect away to see how we can modify the Bill to make it absolutely clear that we are committed to that decarbonisation. That is what underlies it: we are all agreed on trading. The only reason that people might oppose trading on principle might be if we are not committed to doing anything ourselves. The very last sentence of these 11 pages says that in view of the opinions expressed, we are certainly prepared to take the Bill away to see how we can clarify our commitment.</p>

<a name="71217-0010.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="0712179000070">I do not propose to use all 11 pages; that was just to frighten your Lordships. However, I want to answer the discussion on the amendments which, as they were put to us, have been incredibly interesting in getting the debate going. It will also be useful for our debates on other amendments. Domestic action is crucial and, if I have not made this clear, I want to emphasise that we recognise the importance of reducing our emissions within the UK. We are committed to the international principle of supplementarity, which states that the use of international mechanisms should be supplemental to domestic action. The latter should, therefore, probably constitute the significant element in our efforts to meet our targets.</p>

<a name="71217-0010.htm_para2">
<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="0712179000071">For example, the 2007 energy White Paper, <I>Meeting the Energy Challenge</I>, sets out an ambitious and far-reaching programme of action across the economy to reduce our own emissions. Our projections are that it would put us on track to reduce carbon dioxide emissions&#151;through domestic action and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme&#151;by between 21 and 26 per cent by 2020. We recognise that further action will be needed. However, as I have said before, a tonne of carbon is a tonne of carbon wherever it is emitted. The international trading has significant benefits in reducing the cost to the world as a whole in tackling climate change, by providing the finance needed for developing countries to move to a low-carbon development path. It also underpins the global system that we simply must have if climate change is to be tackled. The question that we must ask, therefore, is: how are we to get the right balance between domestic and international action to reduce emissions over time? We are talking about a fairly long timescale.</p>

<a name="71217-0010.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="0712179000072">The amendments proposed would take different approaches to that balance. When debating and scrutinising a Bill, it can sometimes appear as though amendments to one part of the Bill are somewhat contradictory to those in other parts. That is easily done&#151;I have done it myself when in opposition&#151;and there is nothing wrong in it. We are here to scrutinise, so I make no point on principle that, because an amendment takes one view, a political party is therefore being contradictory or changing its mind.</p>

<a name="71217-0010.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="0712179000073">However, I will deploy the amendments in turn. While the amendments take different approaches, we do not accept that they capture the complexity of the

For instance, within the EU, surely we can expect the European Commission to come forward with proposals to change how the EU Emissions Trading Scheme operates? Meanwhile, internationally, as the Committee will be aware, discussions on the post-2012 framework have been taking place in Bali&#151;and their outcome is difficult to predict.</p>

<a name="71217-0010.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="0712179000074">Amendment No. 25 would place a limit on the use of carbon units of 30 per cent</p>
<ul><a name="0712179000096">&#147;of the difference between the 1990 baseline and the annual equivalent of the carbon budget&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0712179000086">Carbon budgets will get smaller over time, as we reduce emissions towards our 2050 target, so the difference between the 1990 baseline and the carbon budget will increase over time. This amendment, therefore, would mean that the number of carbon units allowed would increase over time. Under Amendment No. 25, if the 2050 target was set as at least an 80 per cent reduction, as many of your Lordships have proposed, this amendment would mean that the limit on the use of carbon units was higher than the budget itself. That is because the level of the carbon budget would be, at most, 20 per cent of the 1990 baseline in 2050, while the number of carbon units allowed would be 30 per cent of 80 per cent, which is 24 per cent of that baseline.</p>

<a name="71217-0010.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_175"><a name="0712179000075">Amendment No. 27 would limit the use of carbon units to 30 per cent of the carbon budget, so, over time, as that budget gets smaller it would mean that the number of carbon units allowed would decrease. As one of your Lordships has already mentioned, that is therefore the opposite approach to that taken by Amendment No. 25.</p>

<a name="71217-0010.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="0712179000076">Amendment No. 111 would place no explicit limit on the quantity of carbon units that may be used; instead, it says that if we are going to use carbon units, no more than 5 or 10 per cent of them can be from overseas. In practice, the vast majority of carbon units credited to the net UK carbon account will come from elsewhere in the European Union and from the international carbon market. This amendment would, in practice, make it difficult for us to use any carbon units to meet targets and budgets. That may not have been the intention, but I am trying to explain the practical effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="0712179000077">I now have about seven pages extolling the virtues of emissions trading schemes and their importance.

<ul><a name="0712179000097">&#147;this must not become an &#145;either/or&#146;: the Government should ensure that the UK&#146;s targets are sufficiently challenging that they drive decisive emissions reductions at home and abroad&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="0712179000087">We are already committed to looking at tightening up our 2050 target, as we said at Second Reading. There is a general consensus on that question. We all recognise the need to meet our international obligations under the principle of supplementarity, and we have every intention of doing so under this Bill. However, as your Lordships have said, the situation is complex and not the easiest to explain. That is why we are proposing and asking the Committee on Climate Change for each budget period on an ongoing basis to provide advice on the appropriate balance between domestic, European and international action. This is a flexible approach that recognises that the international climate change framework will look very different in 2050 from how it looks now&#151;although I was taken by the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, on not leaving it all to the Committee on Climate Change in this respect: there are other aspects of this for business. The noble Lord made a telling point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="0712179000079">For those reasons we would like to take this concept away to see where we can clarify in the Bill&#151;although I do not identify where that will be&#151;that we are committed to decarbonising the UK economy. We obviously want to decarbonise the world economy at the same time, but the fact of the matter is that we do not want to do one of those things by hiding behind the other. That is the point that we need to come back on, and we are grateful for the debate initiated by the noble Baroness.</p>

Will he help me with my slight crisis and go to the extent of using the words &#147;the majority&#148;? Would the Government be prepared to instruct the climate change committee that the majority of carbon savings would be achieved from domestic action? I stress that because successive Governments will come under the hammer on this. Getting behaviour change through will not be politically popular, but I am desperately trying to cling on to something here that ensures that the government of the day are required to take relatively unpopular actions for the benefit of the country as a whole and in the longer term.</p>

There is a general view that it must be a good deal tighter than that. I said that I do not think that we can decide on the exact percentage, but following what the noble Baroness, Lady Young, said earlier, we have got to give a clear steer to the climate change committee on this issue which cannot rest on the existing definition of supplementarity or the interpretation of it. It has to be tougher than that. I intervene only because, while I nearly always agree with my former chairman who chaired us admirably on the Joint Committee, for once he was not being tough enough. I would like to be a good deal tougher in giving our steer, however it is devised, so that the climate change committee, in coming to specific recommendations, understands perfectly that the international and the national issues must be taken into account, but the national issues must be a very substantial part of the contribution.</p>

When I was in Moscow last week and my noble friend moved my amendment to Clause 1, the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, said that taking a series of amendments in isolation from the others can create problems. I am afraid that here we cannot take the clauses and amendments in isolation. I am going to have to refer back to my original amendment which was proposed by my noble friend Lord Caithness. I do not intend to weary the Committee by going into it in too much detail because I am pretty confident that we are going to have to do that again at Report. None the less, some very interesting things were said. On reading the debate, I was puzzled by something that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said but I think I am now clear that it was either a misreporting in the <I>Official Report </I>or one of those slips of the tongue that we are all guilty of when we are speaking off the cuff.

It is clear from what he said subsequently that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, was referring, as he had at Second Reading and as he did several times during his response to the debate, to the fact that Clause 1 was not a provision that was to be treated like going through a red light or over the speed limit and getting a fine. That is not the kind of penalty that is implied; the penalty is parliamentary opinion, the court of public opinion and the opinion of business. He made it clear that one of the prime objects of the drafting of Clause 1 had been to change the whole approach of civil servants, Ministers and the Government because they believed they were dealing with a legally enforceable clause.</p>

He gave some very good reasons why it was not going to be enforceable in the way of being taken to judicial review and he gave a very clear description of the fact that this was going to be a question of a range of policies across government. It is exactly that kind of situation that the courts are not going to intervene in. They are not there to decide that policy is wrong, let alone that a great interacting set of policies has been wrong. They usually intervene only if they feel that the decision has been taken entirely in the wrong way or that there is a clear breach of a straightforward law. That is why unfortunate Home Secretaries in all Governments seem to fall foul, because they can be pinned down on a single provision concerning, say, immigration legislation or something of that kind.

I am a little sceptical, as was the Joint Committee, with the view that civil servants and Ministers will dramatically change their approach in this way.

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="07121727000015">I was extremely careful about the way that I drafted that first amendment to link it to Clause 4 which sets out the arrangement for setting targets and budgets over five-year periods. My reason for wanting to link it clearly to Clause 4 is that we are entering a rather different area. While it is almost inconceivable that a duty to see that something happens in 30 or 40 years hence can be enforced, with five-year budgets you are talking about much more limited periods and you get the results quite quickly. I could even envisage circumstances arising from Clause 4 where the courts might be prepared to intervene. The Front-Bench spokesman for the Liberal Democrats&#151;I cannot remember who it was&#151;earlier referred to aircraft policy and airport policy. I can just conceive of a budget and target having been prepared. The Department for Transport, which does not always seem to be quite as interested in these issues as Defra, might come along with a new policy for building runways that might conceivably be held to be in breach of the statutory duty. But I would rest on that, which is why I have moved this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="07121727000016">The Joint Committee, having expressed its doubts, took up the extremely valuable contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, who, coming to the same conclusion that we needed some system of enforcement, came forward with a series of proposals and recommendations. The committee reached a conclusion on page 41 of its report that it had,</p>
<ul><a name="07121727000030">&#147;astrong preference ... to introduce a compliance mechanism within the Bill that will give both meaning and strength to the duty to &#145;ensure&#146; by compelling the Secretary of State to redress any failure to meet a target or budget, where necessary through court intervention based on the compliance mechanism&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121727000023">We went on to follow the example provided by the Kyoto Protocol compliance procedure. That principle establishes that if,</p>
<ul><a name="07121727000031">&#147;a carbon budget is exceeded ... the excess emissions are deducted from the carbon budget for the subsequent period&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121727000017">In other words, since it is clear that they have failed to achieve their target, the Government have to come forward immediately with a detailed plan which they will put to Parliament as to how they are going to put it right in the immediate period that follows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="07121727000018">That is just one of the possibilities but one can think of others. The noble Baroness and her colleague Mr Clive Bates gave evidence to us on this subject on days 50 and 51 and elaborated on other perhaps even tougher possibilities, such as forcing the Government if they fail to meet their targets to purchase emission allowances on the international carbon market, investing in a domestic carbon reduction fund at an agreed price per tonne of carbon, and a number of other possibilities.</p>

However, if we are to have a Bill that has teeth, surely there must be a compliance mechanism. It is no good for the Government to say again and again that this is a legally enforceable Bill and that the courts will intervene and perhaps impose even tougher penalties than I am talking about. No one believes that. None of the outside interested bodies which strongly support the Bill believes that, and there is a real danger of everyone concerned being embarrassed when the world outside realises that we have no means of making this a legally enforceable Bill. Where will we be then, as we set our moral example to the rest of the world?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="07121719000002">Therefore, I say that there is a compelling need for a compliance mechanism in the Bill. I do not say that the single solution that I have offered in the amendment is the final answer, although I go on to refer to other possibilities. When the noble Baroness, Lady Young, and her colleague came before the Joint Committee, I asked them to work up some more detailed ideas and to come forward with other specific recommendations on the way in which we might proceed down this road. I hope that in due course, if not today, we shall hear about some of those proposals. However, I urge the Government to accept the Joint Committee&#146;s strong recommendation for a compliance mechanism. I beg to move.</p>

I was saddened by the Government&#146;s response to the Joint Committee&#146;s recommendations on this matter. The most that the Government managed to come forward with was the statement that they were proposing to amend the Bill to require the Government to explain in Parliament why they had failed to meet the carbon budget. However, that is not good enough. When one has a budget of this nature, it is unacceptable to say, &#147;These are the reasons why we have not achieved it&#148;, and then to sit down and do nothing about it. The whole point of the amendment and the Joint Committee&#146;s recommendation was that something had to be done about it. The Government argued in their response that, if there were a compliance mechanism, it would be likely to weaken the statutory result from a judicial review. I do not think that that is right. I do not think that a judicial review will be very likely to happen under this Bill, for all the reasons given by my noble friend Lord Crickhowell. However, a compliance mechanism is necessary, just as it is with the Kyoto agreement, and it should be very simple. In it, the Government should set out exactly how they are going to remedy the situation in which they find themselves.</p>

One would have thought that there was an absolute responsibility to ensure that at least at the end of every budgetary

Therefore, in principle, I accept the proposal in the amendment and I hope that, similarly, my noble friend can go down that route. He may argue with the wording to some extent because it implies a certain element of discipline in relation to the process by which the penalties, if I may call them that, might be introduced, but I am sure that he will find a way round that.</p>

As I think I have said before, it is very nice to think of the Secretary of State of the day being dragged away to the Tower of London because the targets have not been met, but that will not happen. Judicial review might happen but that process would not contribute greatly to what we want to achieve here, which is to ensure that we meet our longer-term targets.

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="07121719000008">We are a bit adrift from our trajectory for meeting current targets, and no amount of words of commitment to meeting targets will address that. Practical measures are needed, and that probably means new policy and perhaps new investment. That is why I thought that the proposition put forward in the evidence sessions to the Joint Committee that I helped to present was quite neat and cunning. I shall not go into it in great detail, save to say that under the proposed compliance mechanism, if the targets at the end of the five-year period were not met, the Government would have to buy enough international credits and make sufficient contributions to a domestic fund to meet the gap. In that way, we would be clear that new funding was going into the system to help to drive reductions. The most important thing there would be that a UK-based fund would be used to help to implement carbon reduction technologies within the UK faster than would otherwise have happened. Clearly, there would be a need to be fast because the target had not been met. The intention behind our proposition was to say, &#147;Let&#146;s find a way that asks the Government not just to report on what else is going to happen but to put their money where their mouth is and drive change for the future&#148;.</p>

In 30 years&#146; time when our children or, dare one say it, grandchildren are looking at this problem, if it is suddenly decided that the whole thing is a lot of rubbish and there is no sanction, they could just sit back and not implement any of it.

Our position is that the Bill does not have provisions for making plans on how to overcome the problems that might arise if the budgets are not met.

That would increase the transparency and open the Government&#146;s action up to deeper parliamentary and public scrutiny. Any plan to remedy the shortfalls would involve an assessment of the reasons why the Government had not met the target. This fits into our more general theme of beefing up the committee and making the Bill more robust. A roll call of how we had missed targets would be inadequate to face the challenge of climate change appropriately.

The problem with the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, and supported by other noble Lords is that the Government could be challengeable in law if it were thought that they were neglectful of their obligations, and there would be a risk of judicial review. Although other Members of the Committee indicated that that ought not to worry the Government unduly, it will worry them because the remedy would be at the discretion of the court. It may be that the court would do what it often does in these circumstances and would issue a declaration to force the Government to reconsider their action. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of the court making a more stringent order, such as ordering the Government to purchase credits to remedy the position. Although such sanction would certainly meet the objective of the noble Lord, Members of the Committee will recognise why the Government cannot take this proposal lightly. We are facing real issues in compliance although we entirely subscribe to the general wish articulated on all sides of the Committee.</p>

For instance, Clause 14(3) requires that if a budget has not been met the Secretary of State must explain to Parliament why that was the case. In addition, Clause 28(2) requires the Committee on Climate Change to set out in its report to Parliament its views on the ways in which the budget for a period was or was not met. The Bill therefore ensures that there is ample opportunity for scrutiny and debate if a budget is not met.</p>

We have now consulted on these proposals and taken account of the many helpful responses to that consultation. The amendment regulations set out a series of practical measures to address abuses affecting vulnerable agency workers without adding to the burdens of legitimate agencies that would never mistreat their workers in this way. In fact, the amendment regulations also include a deregulatory measure that reduces the burdens on agencies that supply workers on very short-term assignments. In addition, by taking action to outlaw some bad practices carried out by disreputable agencies, we will benefit the law-abiding agencies which suffer from unfair competition from those who cut corners at the expense of vulnerable workers.</p>

<a name="71217-0011.htm_para17">
<p><a name="stpa_208"><a name="07121724000005">I should emphasise at this point that it would be quite wrong to suggest that all agency workers are vulnerable. Most agency workers are neither vulnerable nor exploited. Similarly, some employees on permanent contracts are undoubtedly vulnerable and subject to treatment that all in this House would condemn. The amendment regulations are therefore practical measures to address some key abuses affecting vulnerable workers.</p>

<a name="71217-0011.htm_para18">
<p><a name="stpa_209"><a name="07121724000006">We are proposing three main changes to the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003. The first of these will give agency workers a clear right to withdraw from accommodation, transport or other services provided by their agency without suffering any detriment. It is important that if an agency worker is using such services, they can choose to do so on the basis of their own free will. While a lot of the services that agencies provide are of benefit to their workers, I am aware of others that are not. These include instances of accommodation that consists of a space in a shared room in an overcrowded house at an exorbitant rent or transport that costs far more than could be obtained in the open market. These abuses tend to affect migrant workers, but can also apply to indigenous agency workers. While it is already an offence to make an offer of work conditional on an agency worker paying for other services such as transport or accommodation, we are now proposing to strengthen this provision by giving agency workers a right of withdrawal subject to a period of notice without suffering any detriment. In that way, agency workers will not be tied to services that do not represent value for money.</p>

<a name="71217-0011.htm_para19">
<p><a name="stpa_210"><a name="07121724000007">These extra rights will be backed by additional resources for enforcement. It has been suggested to the Government that not enough inspectors are working for the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate and that their numbers should be increased, and the Government have responded to these representations. In September, the Secretary of State announced plans to double the number of inspectors. In addition, the inspectorate will be given stronger investigative powers through the forthcoming Employment Bill to enable it to identify the scale of any non-compliance, and the potential penalty for breaking the law with regard to agency workers will be raised to an unlimited fine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"><a name="07121724000008">The second major change will affect the taking of fees from would-be entertainers and models for including their details in publications such as casting websites and model books. Such publications are used by entertainers and models to help them obtain work. There are too many instances of unscrupulous individuals advertising for would-be actors or models to attend casting sessions and then engaging in hard-sell tactics to persuade them to pay high fees for the provision of services and the promise of work. Those wishing to enter the worlds of modelling and entertainment are often young and often inexperienced. They are vulnerable to being exploited by unscrupulous people who persuade them that they have a great future if they sign up. They are assured there will be plenty of opportunities for them to get paid work in the industry, sometimes on the basis of exaggerated claims such as the agency&#146;s connections with popular TV shows. On the strength of these claims, unsuspecting individuals are induced to pay relatively high fees, often more than &#163;150, to include their details in the agency&#146;s publication or website.</p>

<a name="71217-0011.htm_para21">
<p><a name="stpa_212"><a name="07121724000009">This practice takes advantage of people vulnerable by virtue of their inexperience. In practice, of course, the modelling and entertainment industries are very difficult fields to get into, where even talented professionals can find it hard to get work. The amendment regulations therefore increase protection for workers by introducing a seven-day cooling-off period for contracts for placing a worker&#146;s details in a publication or a website. To make this protection effective, any agency which takes a fee during the cooling-off period will be committing a criminal offence. The cooling-off period will apply to all contracts for placing an individual&#146;s detail into a publication or website, whether the individual was responding to an advertisement for a casting session or approached the agency direct. The Government&#146;s intention is to make the practice of enticing people to these kinds of casting sessions a lot less attractive. Reputable agencies do not need to use such underhand tactics and therefore will not be affected by this change. They should benefit from measures to stop such bad practices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="07121724000010">We are aware, of course, that there have been calls for all such fees to be banned. We have looked carefully at the responses to the consultation on these proposals and have concluded that a complete ban would have adverse impacts on reputable publications which actors and models use to find work. Such publications are valued by those in the profession and we do not want to risk such publications becoming uneconomic.</p>

<a name="71217-0012.htm_para1">
<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="07121724000011">The last significant change in these amendment regulations will benefit agencies by reducing administrative burdens. Where agencies supply workers for short-term assignments of five working days or less, they will no longer have to provide written information provided that they have obtained all the required information from the worker and provided that the worker has already received information about the hirer and that information has not changed. This change should save agencies an estimated &#163;6 million per year. It will particularly benefit agencies in the catering and hospitality sector or agencies which supply interpreters and supply teachers, where assignments are typically very short.

As the Minister said, very often these are young hopefuls who are being ripped off by as much as &#163;100 or &#163;200 a time. It is a practice which preys on people&#146;s hopes and dreams and it is legal because of a loophole in the 2003 conduct regulations which we are trying to amend.</p>

<a name="71217-0012.htm_para4">
<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="07121724000015">The question is whether the proposal before us will do what the Government originally promised&#151;to stamp out the practice in question. Regulation 7 would amend the original regulation by providing a seven-day cooling-off period for payment after a casting session and would entitle a work seeker to back out of any contract signed without penalty. We have been presented with a well-intentioned and, on the surface, reasonable suggestion that the provisions will improve things. However, they will not prevent the scam from occurring in the first place or address the central problem that it is often weeks, sometimes months, after the original event that people realise that no work is forthcoming.</p>

<a name="71217-0012.htm_para5">
<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="07121724000016">The reactions to the Government&#146;s propositions have been quite negative. The first negative reaction was from the Equity spokesman who said that he was absolutely livid with what was happening. Mr Spencer MacDonald, the principal representative of the Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and Theatre Union, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"><a name="07121724000048">&#147;We are deeply disappointed because we have been hammering away at the Department of Trade and Industry for a number of years and we thought they were slowly coming around and understanding the problems being experienced by our members. They have not come up with the goods really&#151;they have not delivered anywhere near what we wanted&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121724000046">Why have the Government chosen to ignore the views of Equity and BECTU on the issue? Does the Minister agree that instead of a short cooling-off period there should be a ban on up-front fees in this sector, as there is in almost any other business sector? Why have the Government turned their face against this?</p>

<a name="71217-0012.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="07121724000017">Further, will the Minister explain why the Government have rejected the eminently sensible suggestion of Equity and BECTU that a distinction should be made between directories and online information services on the one hand and genuine entertainment employment agents on the other? Such a distinction would allow agents to develop the continuing relationship with artists that they need and to charge the fee in relation to work sought, not up front. The publication side would then

This is important. The Minister in the other place spoke about not setting up blanket bans but he had the opportunity to distinguish between the two functions. Equity and BECTU suggested that and I suggest it now.</p>

<a name="71217-0012.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="07121724000018">The rules of the House require that if we want to oppose the relevant provision in the statutory instrument, we must vote against the whole measure. We do not want to do that because the other regulations merit our support. However, I emphasise that regulation 7 is wholly inadequate. We do not want to support it and it is a great shame that Ministers have chosen to bury the proposal in such a way. As Mark Prisk, my colleague in another place, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"><a name="07121724000049">&#147;For at least four years Ministers have recognised that there is a problem, but they have failed to act. When complaints have been made, their officials have failed to prosecute. When they have brought forward legislative tinkering and changes, those have been slow to be forthcoming and inadequate to the task. The result is that thousands of people have been ripped off over those four years while Ministers have dithered and their officials have failed to prosecute&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 10/12/07; col. 12.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121724000047">I hope that the Minister can explain why he and his colleagues are happy for this con to continue. I do not believe that this is his wish but it is the net effect of what we are being presented with today.</p>

These regulations are almost entirely, with one exception, to be supported, and the points she raises on regulation 7 are particularly well made. It is not clear from the Explanatory Memorandum why the Government have gone back on their original intention. It is indicated that this is as a result of consultation, but certainly the consultation with industry leaders to which the noble Baroness referred would indicate that her points are well made.</p>

<a name="71217-0012.htm_para8">
<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="07121724000020">As she rightly pointed out, one of the weaknesses of the procedure under which we are called in the dinner hour, or in the Moses Room, to debate these regulations is that we only have the opportunity to either accept them or to vote the whole lot down; there is no provision to amend them. On an issue such as this, that makes opposition and reasonable debate more difficult.</p>

<a name="71217-0012.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="07121724000021">I repeat my congratulations to the Government and to the noble Lord, Lord Bach, over recent regulations and what now appears to be regular procedure. Whether or not that extends beyond his department to all departments, his department is to be congratulated on the regulatory impact assessment, as now appears with all regulations emanating from his department. I found it considerably more informative and helpful than the Explanatory Memorandum that used to accompany statutory instruments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="07121724000022">Again, for the record, I press the Minister in general terms on a point that is dear to our hearts on the Liberal Democrat Benches, and appeared in our last two general election manifestoes: the necessity for sunset clauses in regulations. In another context, I notice, the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, has put down an amendment providing for a sunset clause, which we will be supporting. The Minister&#146;s department

That is almost a sunset clause, but does not quite have the full effect. One of the reasons that we are in favour of sunset clauses is to try and alter the culture of government, where regulation is piled on regulation.</p>

<a name="71217-0012.htm_para11">
<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="07121724000023">I also ask the Minister&#151;although he may feel this is an inappropriate moment&#151;if, in commenting on the regulations, he is prepared to comment on the wider issues regarding agency workers that appear to be emanating from decisions or potential decisions in Europe. He will be well aware that there is a wider context. A number of people and lobby organisations in the United Kingdom are unhappy about the relationship between what an agency worker is and what an employee is&#151;what is the definition of an agency worker? Is he in a position to comment? Also, what about the apparent dispute between his Government and their paymasters in the trades unions on the treatment of agency workers, in general terms, flowing from potential European directives?</p>

The instrument is deficient in what it does not say, rather than in what it does say. I raised my points at the Merits Committee last week. The Merits Committee would probably have asked for the instrument to be returned to the department for further consideration had it not been for the imminence of the Recess and the desire not to interfere with process. There are three major concerns for me in the instrument. One is an important point that is not there and appears to be in total conflict with the law as it stands&#151;on the admission of the department. The other two points are serious moral hazard issues relating to young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="07121724000025">The issue that is not there, which is strangely and apparently in conflict with the law, is that regulations do nothing to address the one area in which fees are charged by agencies directly to jobseekers. They have been charged on that basis for a great many years. The issue is that of out-placement agencies, where the recently redundant or people without jobs at the management and executive levels go to agencies that purport to obtain for them introductions to employers who will provide employment opportunity. The agency in that case generally takes a fee both from the employer who takes them on, if successful, and from the jobseeker, on a regular basis. Some of those fees are enormous. I have heard of job fees from out-placement operations exceeding &#163;2,000 per month, rapidly exceeding the amount of redundancy upon which the redundant executive depended for the survival of himself and his family during the time that it will take him to get a job. That is a tragic situation. There appears to be no regulation and I seriously hope that with the Employment Bill, forthcoming after the Recess, we will see some attempt to bring those agencies under some regulatory control. That is very important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="07121724000026">There is an issue where the principle of out-placement can work brilliantly&#151;if it is worked as an integral part of a redundancy package, paid for by the employer that has declared the redundancy. In that case, there needs to be clarification about the taxable status of the fee paid on behalf of the executive&#151;as to whether it is a benefit to be taxed or not. That is not clear, in practice, in standardisation. There is another case, where an employer has a large number of redundancies to declare&#151;I myself have had cases of 2,000 and of 500 people at a time&#151;and you mount your own out-placement operation inside. Some of the agencies are extremely good at coming into a firm and setting up an out-placement operation on your behalf. We did it at the Dome with wonderful effect. We had 2,000 young people, all being declared redundant on 31 December of the year of the Dome, and none of them had jobs to go to. We brought in a brilliant young woman, who set up an out-placement operation for us, for a very small fee. We got 1,620 job offers for the 2,000 people by the time that they left the Dome. That is an example that should be encouraged.</p>

<a name="71217-0012.htm_para14">
<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="07121724000027">We do not want the Government to write off the whole of the out-placement industry, but, please, to put some regulations in place that allow the benefits to continue and that rule completely out of order the scoundrels who are bankrupting the redundant unfortunates. I am told that it is already illegal under the Employment Act 1978 to run an out-placement operation on that basis, so why are they not being prosecuted accordingly? There is a real mystery there.</p>

<a name="71217-0012.htm_para15">
<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="07121724000028">My two questions of moral concern relate to the provision, which is recognised in the instrument, whereby an agency can take a fee for doing a block booking of a large number of agency staff to go and work, perhaps, at a sporting event&#151;usually catering or waitress and serving staff for the hospitality and restaurants. Until recently, I have been responsible for running both the Grand National and the Cheltenham race course meetings, so I am intimately familiar with this process. In both those places, you would have hundreds of young women being bussed in from all over the country to provide the waiting staff, usually drawn from the catering colleges where they recruit whole classes. They are provided with accommodation at the locations to which they are taken. My concern with the instrument is that it now appears, according to the Explanatory Memorandum, not to allow you to terminate your short-term employment in less than five days. A lot of people, who are very inexperienced, at the ages of 15 or 16 have to have their parents&#146; consent to go, but I very much doubt whether the parents know what they are letting them go to. These affairs are not attractive places for young people. The accommodation is very primitive and, while there are hundreds of young women together in such places, there are also hundreds of young men&#151;staff handling the horses or all the others handling a race meeting. There is easy access to alcohol and, I fear, easy access to drugs as well. The risk to those young people of being exposed to predatory and rather intoxicated young men is really unattractive indeed.</p>

They do not get paid for the day, so they have no pay to use to get a bus or train home anyway. There needs to be some better welfare condition built in. One of the suggestions was that there ought to be some sort of mother hen appointed to every dormitory, to look after it&#151;that would be a good move. I suggested that to a noble Baroness on our side of the House and she said that in her young days such a person used to be known as the bunny mother, which raises some interesting possibilities. There is a welfare issue of serious concern. I have known of some young women who have gone on these affairs and been stuck there for the whole week because they could not get out and was seriously distressed by the experience. This instrument makes it more dangerous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="07121724000030">My other concern relates to the famous regulation 7, which both noble Lords who have spoken so far have mentioned. They missed one of the more important and pernicious points of it, which comes in Note 24 of the Explanatory Memorandum:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"><a name="07121724000050">&#147;Entertainment or modelling agencies can only charge work-seekers a fee out of earnings the agency has found for them&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121724000031">It is not unusual for model agencies to be asked to provide a block booking of 20 or more models for a party, which is part of the selection or casting process for a promotion or launch. In so doing, the agency will get a fee for providing 20 or so models to arrive at one time. The models get to go to a free party and they get paid a fee. This now says that a portion of that fee can be taken by the agency. That might seem fair enough, but it really is not because these are very impecunious young people, trying to make their way. If the fee is taken from them in part, it is not particularly nasty or dirty-minded of me to suggest that the likelihood is that they will seek to augment the depleted earnings by negotiating another fee with anybody they can find at the party.</p>

The Minister said that he was looking at one such publication, which has existed for 80 years and performs a legitimate role in the industry. We would not want to take action that goes too far.</p>

As far as out-placement agencies are concerned, I repeat that the practice he described so well is already an offence, under the Employment Agencies Act 1973. We are also proposing measures in the Employment Bill, which will increase the penalties for this offence by making it eligible for trial in the Crown Court as well as a magistrates&#146; court. Where offences were tried in the upper court, there would be no limit to the fine that could be imposed.

The regulations cover measures to protect workers, the contents of terms and conditions, and steps that agencies must take before supplying workers to a hirer. Additionally and importantly, the conduct regulations require the agency to take all reasonable practical steps for the protection of the worker. The noble Lord, Lord James, said that, for workers under the age of 18, agencies are required to obtain consent from a parent or guardian before supplying them for a position where they are required to live away from home. There may be some ignorance about that, but that parents or guardians of workers under that age are required to give that permission represents a significant control. Forcing people to give sexual favours against their will, or any assault&#151;actual or aiding and abetting an assault&#151;is a serious criminal offence and a matter for the police. That is true also of taking illegal drugs. While we do not for a moment contradict what the noble Lord said&#151;it would be foolish to do so&#151;we think that remedies already exist.</p>

They also stipulate that reports on carbon emissions should contain breakdowns by sector, such that we are afforded a clearer picture of from where our emissions are coming. This should be taken in two parts&#151;to allow the climate change committee to budget for sectors, and the stipulation of reporting on emissions by sector. I shall deal first with the whole concept of sectoral budgets.</p>

<a name="71217-0013.htm_para3">
<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="0712181000007">There are various arguments for and against having carbon budgets broken down by sector. We have tabled the amendment allowing the climate change committee to budget for sectors without mandating that it does so or that it does so for all sectors. The purpose of this is to ensure that it considers the potential advantages of sectoral targets and is at liberty to produce budgets containing sectoral breakdowns should they prove to be beneficial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="0712181000008">Budgets for sectors can be useful in targeting specific areas of the economy that are in dire need of improvement. If the net UK carbon account is considered too broadly, it risks ignoring the fact that tremendous efforts in some sectors might be mitigated by the emissions of another. They might also serve as a means of providing early incentives to the industry that emits most carbon. However, there are arguments that dictating too much from the top strips away some of the dynamism and innovation required to combat climate change effectively. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, mentioned earlier the role of the markets in tackling climate change&#151;and that certainly is a factor. Certain sectors might be able to reduce emissions by availing themselves of the services of others. There is a risk that it will provide too prescriptive a framework; likewise, there is a risk that a particular sector of the economy will not be as progressive about reaching targets if it feels that it has comfortably met its particular target.</p>

This issue has been brought up before. The Secretary of State is given the responsibility for the whole of the carbon emissions. According to the figures that I have here, the energy industry is worth 37.4 per cent, road transport 21.6 per cent, other industries 17.8 per cent, residential 14.9 per cent and agriculture is at around 15 per cent. Obviously those figures change on a year-by-year basis. Of course, road transport has its own department. Energy is under DBERR and residential under DCLG. Even though there is discussion of ministerial responsibilities, the problem for any Minister is that those other industries will

I could understand if the Secretaries of State of each department were given the responsibility and a binding target to meet the obligations that are set out, but that is not how the Bill is constructed at present. That feeds back into the argument about whether the Prime Minister should have overall responsibility.</p>

<a name="71217-0013.htm_para6">
<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="0712181000011">The issue with sectoral targets is that by giving sectors targets, each of those Ministers would have the same responsibility as the Secretary of State for Defra in meeting the obligations set out by the Committee on Climate Change. They are not easy targets to meet. We are talking about 21.6 per cent of road transport, but does anyone in the Committee believe that, because of carbon, there will be a massive reduction in road transport on that basis? There will have to be long-term policies, which are difficult to implement, as we have found. As the congestion charge has shown, it is difficult to bring about a reduction in traffic, keep that reduction static and reducing on a regular basis. On that basis, I hope that the Government will look favourably at the amendments.</p>

They go to the heart of several things. On page 29 of the Joint Committee report, Professor Sir David King told us that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"><a name="0712181000113">&#147;Each sector needs to know where it is expected to go and that justifies private investment funds going into these sectors&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0712181000106">More interestingly, many of the witnesses we talked to were stunned that sectoral targets would not be made available. They saw it as fundamental to the whole process of accountability.</p>

<a name="71217-0013.htm_para7">
<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="0712181000013">I also had the good fortune to talk to a previous Cabinet Secretary who made it clear that the machinery of government itself would require that such sectoral targets existed within government. I would have thought that we had now reached a stage of maturity in our democracy where, if such sectoral targets exist within government, they have no reason whatever not to be made available, certainly to the Committee on Climate Change and through that committee on an annual basis to Parliament. On that basis alone, I support this suite of amendments.</p>

While the Bill speaks in generalities about the ultimate objectives of the legislation in the long term, I wanted to find something in the Bill that was more concrete and which would be a spur to industry to respond. Setting targets against sectoral backgrounds would indicate to industry precisely where we want the changes. With the makeup of the Committee on Climate Change including, if I remember rightly, one person who specialises in innovation and technological developments, one would hope that the team that surrounds that person would also be part of generating the debate. That would be a spur to industry to follow that route.</p>

I would have thought that setting such a target would concentrate the mind on the need to go down the nuclear route as soon as possible&#151;some of us passionately believe that&#151;as indeed, it will send us down renewable routes and other routes that are perhaps not being fully exploited at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="0712181000016">I want to tell a little story. Every individual and community can make a contribution if they know that their sector has been identified. I offer as an example the block of flats where I live in London. There are 170 flats and we were arguing with Peverel, the managing agents, about how we could introduce changes in compliance with the objectives of Parliament to reduce energy. Peverel was not introducing any great changes. Last week, in desperation, I took a representative of the managing agents round all the floors of all the blocks in our development and said, &#147;Take out that light and that light&#148;&#151;every other light throughout the whole development. If we deliver on the number of lights we intend to take out, the result will be to cut our energy bill from &#163;90,000 per annum to about &#163;45,000. That is a 50 per cent cut in a substantial energy bill in one development, which could be replicated nationally in offices, shops, residential accommodation, blocks of flats and community homes throughout the United Kingdom, and certainly in local authorities, where huge amounts of energy are being consumed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"><a name="0712181000017">If you have a target area&#151;in this case, energy combined with residential accommodation&#151;then people will know what the expectation is in that area, and industry and communities will respond to that objective. I have taken just one area&#151;I could speak at length on road transport and the way in which economies might be produced there&#151;but it is only by identifying these sectoral areas as targets for change and for the reduction of energy consumption that we can realise the ambitions of the Bill.</p>

My particular interest is to get the land management sector to understand what a pivotal role it can and should play, not only in reducing carbon emissions, but in improving carbon sequestration. I am in the middle of conducting an exercise to determine how, in the next five years, we can reposition ourselves as a carbon-neutral producer of apples. It is a complicated concept, because so much carbon is used in refrigeration, as well as transport and marketing. It is possible, and it is an exercise that we are in the middle of exploring, but it will be possible only if we can do it as part of a sectoral target. No doubt there will have to be market incentives, and perhaps others, to encourage farmers and land managers to adopt practices for which they have not seen a need before.</p>

In following the example of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, the churches instituted an eco-congregation award about five years ago.

Some sectors are self-evident, such as energy. Transport is not just one sector but a variety of sub-sectors. The climate change committee, as much as the Government or more, will have to build up an overall target based on what it thinks is possible in particular sectors and sub-sectors. Overall targets mean nothing unless they are based on an assumption and estimate of what is achievable at the level of sub-sectors and, in some large cases, individual businesses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="0712181000026">This is one of the most important debates of the evening. Once you start thinking that the basis of overall targets is what can be achieved at the level of sectors, sub-sectors and businesses, one starts to see the dangers as well as the opportunities. Three five-year rolling programmes in advance can quickly turn out to be an illusion of planning, and you then get policies to achieve those plans over 15 years. The first conference that I went to as a young university economist was on planning coal production in the UK. All kinds of people told us how much coal had to be produced and how. It was a lot of coal. Eventually, we had to find a way of not producing a lot of coal, because people did not want that amount&#151;certainly not of British coal. I was a Yorkshireman saddened by that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="0712181000027">I simply give a word of caution. You can easily enthuse about what policies have to achieve in particular sectors.

It also showed the gap between strategic thinking about sectors and what we are telling the climate change committee that it has to produce in two years&#146; time. We are expecting it then to produce some pretty important forecasts, on which government policies over 15 years will have to be laid out. When those come before the Government and Parliament there will have to be careful examination of our enthusiasm for what can be achieved and how to achieve it.</p>

I think that the committee can only give guidance, because we could get into real difficulties if it becomes a planning agency for 15-year plans. The thrust of the proposal is enormously to be supported, but addressing the nuances and subtleties of converting it into action that Parliament, the public and industry can support and deliver will be a real challenge.</p>

We have had the example of apples, though I doubt that the noble Earl was on about the apple sector. It might be the fruit-growing sector, or the farming sector as a whole. My noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours then gave the residential sector as an example. But then we had a local government issue, with residential issues mixed up with land. It is a question of looking at sectors. But then my noble friend Lord Woolmer referred to the national plan of the 1960s and George Brown. I said to my ministerial colleague on the Front Bench that, as I have now discovered, &#147;Not all members of the Government have heard of George Brown, so mentioning him is probably not a good idea&#148;. I also expected my noble friend Lord Woolmer to mention the No. 7 tractor plant and the problem of picking winners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="0712181000035">The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, in his second contribution, then made the distinction that, contrary to the point about the demise of the national plan, here we have almost a consensus in principle for industry, government and business actually to do something to make it work, but not to have it imposed top-down by telling individual companies and sectors what to do. That is the important point coming out of the debate. Obviously, we want to make sure that each budget and the 2050 target are met. We can agree that it does not matter where in the economy the reductions come from. We must be flexible about this. Flexibility is the key, along with the principle of making sure that we achieve the targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="0712181000036">There is a number of problems with the idea of sectoral targets, but it depends on how you look at the sectors. There is no doubt that this is where the national plan of the 1960s would have led, and did lead, to inefficient policy making. If you are rigid with your plan and your target, you get a problem. I was given an example in my notes. Evidence might come forward&#151;and it is highly likely to come forward today&#151;of a new technology that turns out to be the most cost-effective means of reducing emissions, but we might be tied to meeting the targets through other sectors. That way you would ossify the technology and the chances of putting it into practice. I am not knocking sectoral targets, but we must be flexible about this. As I said on Second Reading, operation of this kind of legislation will unquestionably lead to the creation of new businesses, but not all of them will succeed. We have to give them the flexibility to work out what is best.</p>

<a name="71217-0013.htm_para25">
<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="0712181000037">The emissions trading scheme is a good example of a policy that covers multiple sectors. One can broadly divide the economy into no more than five or six sectors, but we are looking at something below that. In a way, this comes down to letting the climate change committee take this principle, and maybe we will find a different way on Report of looking at the need for some kind of way forward. It should not be prescriptive, stop technology or wreck the putting into practice of new and good ideas, but it should assist those in different sectors who feel that they want to make a contribution.</p>

<a name="71217-0013.htm_para26">
<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="0712181000038">The noble Earl made a good point. I am not saying that he gave this example, but he identified the fact that the large retailers dominate our food economy. We have asked them on a range of issues concerning the food chain to ensure through their suppliers, as part of their job, that workers are not exploited, that the gangmasters legislation is operated fairly and that the minimum wage is paid. It is the retailers&#146; job to make sure that the provenance of their products is okay&#151;for example, by preventing the restamping of non free-range eggs as free-range. They can ensure that through each supplier in the chain. It is no different in the case of those who want to be associated with cutting emissions; the same can be done with suppliers, but you would not want to be prescriptive by ordering the sector to cut emissions. The work goes across many sectors.</p>

<a name="71217-0013.htm_para27">
<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="0712181000039">I shall take some advice on this. If there are any targets knocking around Whitehall&#151;I suspect that we will have some figures in the department or in the Treasury, although I do not know&#151;they are not being operated and they would not be prescriptive in that sense. We must be flexible, but we need people to be assured that the legislation has clarity and that we can take it forward.</p>

We do not think that setting emission reduction targets for each government department&#151;to pick on Amendment No. 32&#151;is the way but we will certainly consider that alongside the proposals we discussed last week. I do not think that anybody has used the word rigid about sectoral targets, but by implication

We need to look at what we mean by a sector because that is not adequately explained. We need to make sure that the Committee on Climate Change has maximum flexibility in this with the good will and willingness of industry and competition and new technologies so that a door is not closed because some sector has been given a target that ends up knocking out an opportunity for new technology so that someone will not take the risk of investment. We would not want that to happen. If we can find a solution along those lines, we will have served the scrutiny of this Bill extremely well in exactly 30 minutes.</p>

At Second Reading, I felt there was particular feeling from all sides of the House for this very strange mid-point target that the Government had inserted into the Bill which&#151;I do not know whether it was meant to but it clearly does&#151;put in not only a minimum target range but also a maximum. It suggested that if the UK economy by 2020 reduced carbon emissions by more than 32 per cent, then somehow the Secretary of State would be equally culpable if he had missed the lower target. That seemed an extremely perverse and almost masochistic form of legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="0712181000049">Our amendment does two things. It takes away the ceiling for reductions, which does not seem to make any sense, and it replaces the single target with a figure of 40 per cent. Perhaps we will get back into the previous argument about whether it is up to Parliament to decide what the target should be. Our view&#151;and the Government&#146;s view, we have heard&#151;is that there needs to be a figure in the Bill. That is the case for the final target and we believe that it should also be the case for the approximate mid point in 2020, and that the right figure for an 80 per cent overall reduction is a best estimate of 40 per cent. Where does this figure come from? It is half of 80 per cent&#151;rather easier mathematics than we heard earlier.</p>

On the other hand, we hope that technical innovation will be stimulated very strongly by the imperative of climate change. New technologies will come on stream some years ahead to allow the extra efficiencies to be met to a greater extent later. If we take the view that the two roughly cancel each other out, then the figure of 40 per cent is more or less correct and is suitable for the Bill at this stage.</p>

That was for greenhouse gases generally but, as we know, carbon dioxide is the most important of those. I presume that the British Government fully supported the EU stance on targets to be met by developed nations and I would certainly expect them to have done so. If as a nation we are saying that we should be at the forefront of those targets and leading not just globally but within Europe, then, within that context, 40 per cent again seems to be the right figure. However, most importantly, we should remove the upper target. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="71217-0014.htm_para9">
<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="0712181000054">It is worth remembering&#151;the evidence was given to us by Mr Mortimer of the Bill team&#151;that the UK&#146;s target of 26 to 32 per cent for CO2 translates into 32 to 37 per cent of all greenhouse gases. Therefore, the suggestion that we should lift the CO2 target to 40 per cent has some fairly substantial implications. However, I draw attention to the evidence given by the then Secretary of State, who has since been transferred to other responsibilities. I think that we should at least understand the case that he advanced under cross-examination, as it may help us to decide whether it was a strong argument.</p>

<p><a name="0712181000109">He was then asked whether it was not rather odd to put an upper cap of 32 per cent on the provision, and then there was a diversion into the arrangements for changing the legislation and removing the cap if the circumstances should change.</p>

<a name="71217-0014.htm_para12">
<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="0712181000058">There we have it from the Secretary of State that the whole reason for this cap is to give confidence to business and industry. I entirely and completely understand why we have to tell business and industry exactly where they need to get to if we are to achieve the results we want, but I find it difficult to believe that the confidence of business and industry is going to be shaken by the possibility that they might beat the target. It is not a situation I have ever discovered in business. Indeed, the Secretary of State&#151;or it may have been one of his officials&#151;pointed out in evidence that it would be possible to bank the surplus and use it in future. Most businessmen would be quite pleased to know that if they exceeded the target they would have a cushion for any subsequent setbacks. So while I understand the desirability of giving confidence to business and wholly support the need to let business know exactly where the Government want to go, after rereading the Secretary of State&#146;s evidence under cross-examination, I remain as unconvinced as the committee was at the time. It is now up to the Minister, who is always compelling and convincing, to provide us with the certainty and the assurance that the now Foreign Secretary was unable to give us when he gave evidence to the committee.</p>

It might be thought that the Committee on Climate Change needs some guidance on the absolute minimum acceptable target and the maximum that it ought to think about. Why is that? At the maximum point, there is inevitably a trade-off between what it might be possible to force through and what the consequences would be. One of the many issues the committee has to consider is the economic consequences of trying to achieve different things. If we say, &#147;We will not give the committee any guidance. It should get the highest level of carbon reduction it can&#148;, and the committee does that, the Government may then have to say, &#147;We cannot face the consequences of that target&#148;. Other amendments in the Marshalled List would ensure that the committee will effectively determine what happens and the Government will simply have to put before Parliament what it recommends.</p>

If no guidelines are given, it is very difficult, but if a specific figure is given, it jolly well has to be justified. With respect to the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, I cannot see the argument that because 40 per cent is half of 80 per cent, that is a good reason for why it should be the figure the Committee on Climate Change has to draw up plans for in 2020. It is not a sound argument. The idea of a range for an intermediate position is not at all ridiculous; in fact it is entirely sensible.</p>

However, that is how it is internationally and that is how it should be in the Bill. Forty per cent is, I agree, a big target, but it is not as big as it seems for the first period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="0712181000070">On the low-hanging fruit argument, as I said myself, there are arguments both ways. The huge potential from the unexciting and unsexy area of energy saving is well accepted&#151;particularly in the domestic sector, let alone from energy saving in industry. That is a whole area where, with the right government policies and&#151;let us not forget&#151;public and personal motivation, we could achieve much. Having said that, I agree that there is more sense in the medium-term target going back to the climate change committee&#151;more perhaps than the final one, although we have all accepted around the Chamber that the final target, at 60 per cent, is wrong. We are not absolutely saying that it is wrong, but we all believe that it is wrong. Therefore, what I am saying is that, if you have a mid-term target in the Bill, then it is going to have to be something of the 40 per cent order. That is a fact in order to meet the types of target that are going to be set for us&#151;through Government, but suggested by the climate change committee. I misunderstand the Bill the way that I read it at the moment. To me, the statutory targets have to be between those two numbers&#151;that is how it reads. If I read that wrong, then fair enough. Even then, it certainly needs amendments to point out that that is a target range above the statutory figure or however we move forward. That, to me, is not clear in the Bill at all&#151;in fact, to me it seems clear the other way around.</p>

The annual rolling targets and the yearly milestones are essential for monitoring the short-term progress, yet these are created with an eye on meeting the interim targets which are to be the scaffolding on which our progress hangs. It is thus very important that the long-term outline for fighting climate change comes from the committee. Any changes to the interim target should come from the scientists on the committee and also be subject to parliamentary approval.</p>

Thus it is essential that they are realistic and authoritative. Having the committee set them achieves this result. It is essential to provide a genuinely independent yardstick by which we can measure the effectiveness of government action.

I agree with him that it is difficult for a Secretary of State at any particular moment to be charged with a responsibility that spans 20 or 40 years. However, if these interim targets are set independently and publicly and are tethered to the short-term milestones, it might go some way to having a mechanism to ensure that the long-term targets have real meaning and we will be able to assess a particular Secretary of State&#146;s performance. This must be done in conjunction with reports that not only list the status of carbon counts but also provide an assessment of the measures that have been implemented to reduce emissions.

Although he made points about the range, the committee particularly welcomed the importance to business represented by the 2020 target.

The intention to achieve increased long-term certainty would be undermined by these different mechanisms in the Bill.

As far as I could see, the Government were not convinced, and I am not sure that the rest of the Committee was. The amendment would simply tidy up the language of the Bill and make it more precise. The Bill already stipulates that the number of years for a carbon budget period will be five. We see no reason why that cannot be reflected here.

As we know, the system of five-year budget periods in the Bill mirrors the length of current commitment periods under the Kyoto protocol and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, as has been discussed in Committee. However, binding targets under the Kyoto protocol currently only extend to 2012, and it cannot be taken for granted that any future international agreement that sets targets would run on a five-year cycle. In fact, we touched on that at close of play in our previous sitting. Clause 18, therefore, allows the Secretary of State, subject to parliamentary approval through the affirmative resolution procedure, to amend the length of a carbon budget. That power can be exercised only if it appears necessary to keep the budgetary periods in line with similar periods under any agreement at European or international level. Before doing so, the Secretary of State must consult the devolved Administrations.</p>

It introduces two new penalties of a financial nature in addition to the existing straightforward fine. But there is also a provision for the Secretary of State or the Welsh Ministers to prescribe additional penalties by statutory instrument. The Bill as introduced makes no special provision for orders under this clause, so they would stand to be subject to the negative resolution procedure in accordance with Section 160 of the Transport Act 2000.

<p><a name="0712178000023">The noble Lord said: I wish to speak to this group of amendments. As I understand it, the Bill proposes reinstating the power of passenger transport executives to own and provide vehicles to operators. This amendment would enhance that power formally to allow passenger transport executives to provide vehicles to community transport operators. I believe that most PTEs do this as a matter of course but Amendment No. 65 would regularise that position.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0001.htm_para13">
<p><a name="0712178000024">Amendment No. 66A would give passenger transport executives the operator of last resort powers if a quality contract was terminated or services under that contract ceased, perhaps because the operator had defaulted on the contract. Not dissimilar powers are available to the Government under rail franchising and, I believe, to Transport for London for bus franchises in London. Obviously, the power is intended to be used as a last resort and only for so long as it is necessary for the passenger transport executive to procure an alternative provider of services.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0001.htm_para14">
<p><a name="0712178000025">Amendment No. 66 relates to the infrastructure. Depots are an obvious requirement for any quality contract scheme. The incumbent operator will generally own their own depots and is under no obligation to release them to a local transport authority or, indeed, to any other successful bidder to help facilitate an initial quality contract. Reference has already been made to the fact that a prominent bus operator, the chief executive of Stagecoach, was quoted in a Sheffield newspaper in October 2006 as saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0712178000216">&#147;If franchising or Quality Contracts are brought in we will put all our depots up for sale in South Yorkshire. That is not a threat, it&#146;s just that we don&#146;t think it is the way to make the system work&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71217-gc0001.htm_para15">
<p><a name="0712178000026">Local transport authorities may decide to build and lease new, modern, purpose built facilities to help facilitate the quality contracts schemes. However, as we well know, in some of the largest urban centres with the strongest economies, finding a suitable site and getting planning permission, which is also a headache, could prove to be very challenging indeed. The amendment would allow passenger transport executives to acquire land compulsorily where this is required for the purposes of securing services under a quality contracts scheme. For example, the power might be required to acquire a depot without which services might not be effectively operated.</p>

I should like to ask a number of questions to the mover of these amendments, in particular Amendment No. 66A. Could my noble friend envisage such an amendment being necessary if quality contracts were not part of this Bill? Has there been any example of quality partnerships up and down the country failing in the way he just outlined that they might? My noble friend

Under the 2000 Act, has there been any example of an operator defaulting so far as quality partnerships are concerned and the fairly expensive measures outlined in this group being necessary under existing legislation?</p>

<a name="71217-gc0001.htm_para17">
<p><a name="0712178000029">My noble friend referred to the comments made by the chief executive of Stagecoach. I have never been involved in the Stagecoach operation, but it is perfectly legitimate for the chief executive of that or any other company to say that they will dispose of their facilities and premises in any area up and down the country in any way they want if they are no longer necessary because of this legislation and the implementation of quality contracts. I wish that those who advocate quality contracts with such passion&#151;I know that the brief to which my noble friend referred was prepared by the aptly named Mr Jeremy Bray on behalf of the Passenger Transport Executive Group&#151;would acknowledge that their proposals will be extremely expensive. It is not just a question of switching from one operator to another. The problems outlined so ably by my noble friend will happen from one end of the country to the other.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0001.htm_para18">

I very much support these amendments in the name of my noble friend Lord Rosser. As he said, they are very similar in intent to what has been done with railway passengers. My noble friend Lord Snape said that there has never been a case of operators defaulting. That may be true, but there was not a case of operators defaulting or failing on the railways until Connex did it. Then there were powers in railway legislation for the Government to take it over until they could find another operator. </p>

They are as chalk and cheese. They might refer to methods of transport, but the sort of provisions and difficulties to which my noble friend referred were envisaged and drawn up as part of the railway franchising process. They have not been for &#147;bus franchising&#148;&#151;if that is the right term of quality contracts, which I believe it is.</p>

Of course, they are completely different, but the effect on the passengers is much the same. The buses would not run, just as the trains would not have run. This attempt by my noble friend Lord Rosser is to ensure that the buses keep going if an operator withdraws. Perhaps it is the wrong way, but if the noble Lord, Lord Snape, could say, &#147;Someone else will step in immediately, even without a contract or bus garages&#148;, that would be fine. But there is a lot to be said for something like these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="0712178000034"><b><a name="71217-gc0001.htm_spnew9"><a name="0712178000262">Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My noble friend Lord Rosser has raised some interesting points and some interesting points have been put to him during the debate. Perhaps I should make it plain that the Government cannot accept any of the amendments as they are, but they raise issues that we might want to explore further. I shall explain.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0001.htm_para19">
<p><a name="0712178000035">The main purpose of Clause 57 was to put the PTEs on an equal footing with other local transport authorities. Those other authorities do not have a specific power to lease buses to operators, but can do so as a use of their general well-being powers under Section 2 of the Local Government Act 2000. That procedure has been used in relation to contracted services and approved by the Department for Transport and the authorities&#146; auditors. The PTEs are in a different position, partly because they do not currently have well-being powers, although if Clauses 86 and 87 of this Bill are enacted, their parent authorities will  have them in future, but more importantly because  the power they explicitly had under the Transport  Act 1968 was taken away by orders made under the Transport Act 1985 and there is, therefore, doubt whether even the provision of well-being powers would be enough to authorise them to lease buses. That is because well-being powers are limited inasmuch as they cannot confer a power on an authority to do something which they would otherwise be unable to do because of a prohibition, restriction or limitation in other legislation. Therefore, Clause 57 is explicitly seeking to remove the implied prohibition in Section 10(1)(viii) of the Transport Act 1968 in particular circumstances.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0001.htm_para20">
<p><a name="0712178000036">The revived power is expressed in narrow terms, linked to the operators providing services to the PTE under contract, either the normal subsidy contract or a quality contract. We are not in favour of giving them an unrestrained power to lease out buses, even for purely commercial operations. We believe that that could create distortions of competition between different operators.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0001.htm_para21">
<p><a name="0712178000037">The next amendment concerns the PTEs&#146; power to acquire land by compulsory purchase. I shall reflect on what my noble friend has said, but the existing power is very broad and would be construed in relation to a PTE&#146;s current statutory functions which, since the Transport Act 2000 came into force, have included, potentially, letting quality contracts. It is not immediately obvious, therefore, that the power needs extending in this way.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0001.htm_para22">
<p><a name="0712178000038">Finally, and most intriguingly, there is the question of whether PTEs should get back not only some of their power to lease buses, but also some of their power to operate them. The Government have no intention of restoring the power in full and going back to the pre-1986 position. However, I am persuaded that Amendment No. 66A would not allow them that possibility and scope and could allow them to operate buses only in narrowly defined circumstances where they would indeed be operators of last resort. Noble Lords have pointed out that there are similar provisions on rail franchising and in London bus legislation.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC208"><b>17 Dec 2007 : Column GC208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71217-gc0001.htm_para23">
<p><a name="0712178000039">We should not simply dismiss the arrangement out of hand. It raises a number of issues, however. One is whether it is right to give the power to the PTEs themselves, rather than requiring them to set up operating subsidiaries which, as I understand it, is the practice elsewhere and was a requirement under the Transport Act 1985 when the original PTE power was removed. Another is that they would have to have a PSV operator&#146;s licence under the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981, and if they were to be in a state of readiness to take over services at any time, they would have to get it from the traffic commissioners well in advance. This is not a formality, as any bus operator would explain. It would mean having a transport manager with a certificate of professional competence who, presumably, would have to be available to step in at any time even though he or she would not be needed to manage any transport for most of the time. This may not be a problem for PTEs at the moment, but I suspect it could be in the future, particularly if new European Commission proposals are adopted which would considerably tighten the rules on transport managers and professional competence. I shall certainly ask the Minister of State and officials to look again into some of these matters between now and Report, but I cannot agree to this set of amendments today. It would not be appropriate to do so, and I am not entirely confident that they would work, but it is worth our giving some further thought to some of the issues raised by the noble Lord, particularly in the last amendment in the group.</p>

<p><a name="0712178000040"><b><a name="71217-gc0001.htm_spnew10"><a name="0712178000263">Lord Snape:</b> I apologise for detaining your  Lordships for another couple of minutes on Amendment No. 66A, but I get the impression that the Minister is fairly sympathetic to at least some parts of it. Will he say in what circumstances he would envisage its provisions being necessary if he is prepared to take another look at it, as I suspect he is? Most bus companies&#151;I am talking not only about the big five, if that is the right term for them&#151;are fairly reputable organisations. It is inconceivable that many other companies that run buses in the United Kingdom would go bust, so why does the Minister think it necessary to have this fallback position in relation to the amendment, if that is indeed what he thinks?</p>

<p><a name="0712178000041"><b><a name="71217-gc0001.htm_spnew11"><a name="0712178000264">Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, gave my noble friend an example in a sense. One of the operating companies could go into administration, and it might be appropriate in that circumstance for the PTE to step in as a last resort. I have the confidence that my noble friend Lord Snape has that nearly all bus operators are reputable. I am sure that the big five are capable of dealing with most of the problems that sometimes occur in any industry. There may be an occasion&#151;I hope that there will not be&#151;where a small operator, perhaps in extremis, fails and goes into administration and someone needs to step in and be that operator of last resort. As my noble friend has said, we have not had anything  close to that yet, but it would offer a measure of public reassurance if another operator did that. Most of us, however, would not envisage or welcome it happening.</p>

If we are talking about quality contracts, and we are, am I right in thinking that the Minister thinks that the quality contract might go in the first place to a smaller company as I outlined when we debated the whole principle of quality contracts last week? Does it not illustrate the weakness of the whole quality contract franchising business that, all too often, it is likely to go to the lowest bidder, who all too often will not have the ability, the facilities or the financial backing to continue the quality contract in its entirety? Does that not indicate the weakness of the whole quality contract concept?</p>

<p><a name="0712178000043"><b><a name="71217-gc0001.htm_spnew13"><a name="0712178000266">Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I do not accept my noble friend&#146;s premise. Nor do I accept his premise that a quality contract would necessarily go to the lowest bidder, because this is not just about finding the lowest bidder for a particular service in those circumstances. As we have already discussed quality contracts, the scope for their development is constrained and, as we found with the operation of the Transport Act 2000, this has not yet been a route that people have particularly wanted to explore. I therefore do not see this as the big threat that my noble friend may see it as. I am not saying that he sees it as a big threat, but we want to explore this particular small issue. We shall take it away and see whether we might need to have recourse to it at some point. As I said, I do not give an absolute commitment to bring something back. There may well be circumstances in which it would be a useful provision to have, but I suspect they would be very rare.</p>

<p><a name="0712178000044"><b><a name="71217-gc0001.htm_spnew14"><a name="0712178000267">Lord Berkeley:</b> Perhaps I may clarify something about the comparison with the railways. The two franchises that have failed since the process started were GNER and Connex. The quality of service in Connex was reported as being variable, GNER&#146;s was and is pretty good, but they both failed for financial reasons. Interestingly, when the Strategic Rail Authority was responsible for the railways it had a team of people with the necessary expertise, safety case and everything, who were available and ready to step in should anybody withdraw so that the services were not disrupted. I hope that my noble friend may wish to explore that kind of thing as regards the quality of contracts on the buses.</p>

We do not want to see a breakdown in service. We certainly cannot have that. As regards Connex&#146;s operations with rail franchising, the experience was not good&#151;I certainly did not enjoy it.</p>

I should like to clarify what he said in relation to purchase. I thought he was saying&#151;and I want to check whether I have misunderstood this&#151;that the powers might already be there to enable the purchase.

<p><a name="0712178000047">The amendment would supply the PTEs with the necessary costs. Cost is obviously one of the things PTEs would have to take account of in the equation&#151;whether they did it, what cost would be involved and whether they though it was a cost that they were prepared to stand.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0001.htm_para25">
<p><a name="0712178000048">The other issue raised is of examples where quality partnerships or quality contracts have failed. My understanding is that we have had only one quality partnership, we have had voluntary partnerships and we have not had any quality contracts. I suppose it is not surprising that one does not have examples of ones that have failed when there has only ever been one in existence anyway. In the hope that my noble friend will respond and clarify what his response was on the issue of the acquiring of land, I will withdraw the amendment.</p>

It would duplicate and overlap in a confusing way with the existing powers in the Transport  Act 1985, which enable local transport authorities to subsidise services where particular transport needs would not otherwise be met.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0002.htm_para3">
<p><a name="0712178000058">As noble Lords will know, we are proposing to introduce, by means of Clauses 58 and 59, greater flexibility for local transport authorities to subsidise the provision of services to a particular standard. However, we still consider it appropriate to retain the requirement that such subsidy can only be made if the service, or particular standard of service, would not otherwise be provided. Extending Section 106 of the 1985 Act to the generality of services would seem to have the effect of removing that requirement. Broadening the powers in Section 106 to services already provided commercially would, for instance, raise the question of whether such subsidies might be disallowed under the European Community&#146;s state aid rules.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0002.htm_para4">
<p><a name="0712178000059">Quite apart from all that it is important, as I am sure noble Lords will agree, that there should be specific grant-making powers for facilities for disabled persons. Such facilities can be expensive to provide, and an operator with an eye purely to profitability may not chose to provide them. We have heard on many occasions how essential it is for many disabled persons to have access to good public transport. If Section 106 were replaced by a much more general funding provision, persons with a disability may be forgotten or given much lower priority. That would be contrary to the many clear messages that we have given and that we have been given, in particular by the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, at various stages in Committee. While I am sure it was not the intention of my noble friend Lord Rosser, it could well be the consequence if the amendment were accepted. I hope on that basis that my noble friend will withdraw his amendment.</p>

Noble Lords will understand and will forgive me if to some extent I am reading what he has given me. Amendments Nos. 69A and 70 are grouped. They are probing amendments and their purpose is to seek clarification and a specific commitment from the Government. The effect of one of the amendments is to subject the Public Transport Users Committee for England, if created, to the specific disability equality duty. I understand that an indication may have been given that some action might be feasible on this.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0002.htm_para9">
<p><a name="0712178000066">The Disability Discrimination Act 1995, as amended by the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, establishes a general and a specific disability equality duty. The general duty states:</p>

<p><a name="0712178000204">In tabling this probing amendment, I ask whether the Minister can confirm that the Public Transport Users Committee for England will, if established, be a public authority within the meaning of the Disability Discrimination Act 2005&#151;a person carrying out public functions&#151;and thus subject to the general disability equality duty.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0002.htm_para10">
<p><a name="0712178000067">As I said, the Disability Discrimination Act established general and specific disability equality duties. The specific duty arises from Section 49D of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and the Disability Discrimination (Public Authorities) (Statutory Duties) Regulations 2005 made under it. Those regulations list a large number of public authorities and require them to produce disability equality schemes. These are action plans produced with the involvement of disabled people for how those organisations will promote equality. The list of public authorities already covered by the specific duty includes any passenger transport executive, Transport for London, the British Transport Police, all local authorities and joint transport authorities, and Passenger Focus, the operating name of the Rail Passenger Council established under the Railways Act 2005. The last of those is quite significant, as one option in the consultation about the PTUC is to expand the remit of Passenger Focus. The question is therefore whether it is the Government&#146;s intention that the Public Transport Users Committee for England, in whatever form it eventually emerges, will be subject to the specific disability equality duty. I beg to move.</p>

It is long overdue, and I commend the Government for saying that they will introduce it. I have had discussions with Passenger Focus, and it certainly welcomes this which is also encouraging.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0002.htm_para11">
<p><a name="0712178000069">In proposed new subsection (8), the first of three in this amendment, is it important to have some regional representation for buses, and probably for rail. Clearly, the Rail Passenger Council&#146;s structure was not ideal. There were far too many regions, and the selection and operation of some members was probably not as good as it could have been. So Passenger Focus is much better, but it would be wrong to expect people with complaints about a bus in Manchester or Leeds to address all their complaints to London, where the head office will inevitably be. Particularly for buses, it is important to have a regional structure.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0002.htm_para12">
<p><a name="0712178000070">Proposed subsection (9) may be stating the obvious, but if one does not know how to contact the users&#146; committee it is no good at all. After many years, there is now, on all railways, the address of Passenger Focus, so that people can get in touch by phone, by e-mail or in writing. That is very important. Proposed subsection (10) probes whether the Department for Transport will pay for any extra resources that are needed for the Public Transport Users Committee and the effective transport commissioners if they are to fulfil that role.</p>

My noble friend Lord Bradshaw attempted to table an amendment which was refused and, therefore, I gave notice of my intention to oppose the Question that Clause 64 stand part. Perhaps I can ask the question now to save time later. Could the Minister say a little more about why the Government feel it is necessary to set up a new statutory body to deal with bus users&#146; representation rather than trying to breathe life into the existing arrangements to see whether they can be improved? Can the Minister assure us that he believes that setting up a statutory body is the best way forward and that the current arrangements are not fit for purpose?</p>

I managed to get the conference organisers to rejig the programme and I gave my lecture between two o&#146;clock and three o&#146;clock, but I am afraid the Committee has moved so rapidly through the Bill this afternoon that I did not make it in time.

It is in bus companies&#146; interests and in passenger transport executives&#146; interests that people know how and where to make a complaint because that provides important information and can help to resolve profound problems with the service and improve the quality of that service. It is in everyone&#146;s interests that complaints, mechanisms and public fora work well. It is right that where a passenger has an issue or an important comment to pass on that there are well established channels for doing so. It could be argued that by placing obligations on bus companies to publicise details will lead to them taking more seriously the comments and complaints. I think we would all want to sign up to that.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0002.htm_para13">
<p><a name="0712178000074">While I agree with the sentiments behind Amendment No. 69A, a number of complications arise from it that will need further consideration before the Government can determine how best to deliver the spirit of this amendment.

As the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, suggested, that could be done by enhancing the role of Bus Users UK, a non-statutory body. We could build on that. We are also including powers in this Bill to add functions to the Rail Passengers Council&#151;known as Passenger Focus. That could provide another possible route. However, we need to ensure that any obligation on operators to make information available would apply equally to any of these options. Whatever approach we decide on, we must ensure that each of those options is viable and workable. If the intention behind the amendment is to have complaints procedures publicised so that a passenger knows where to go if they have an unresolved issue, the legislation needs to be more flexible about what information is required.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0002.htm_para14">
<p><a name="0712178000075">In the spirit of the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, and pending the outcome of our consultation on the best way of approaching passenger representation, I undertake to ask colleagues in the department to ensure that we liaise with the Confederation of Passenger Transport and the Bus Partnership Forum to see what they think can be done. We also might want to consider whether there should be different requirements in different parts of the country, because not everything is the same everywhere, and in some areas in which a local authority has implemented a quality partnership scheme, or a quality contracts scheme, it may be more appropriate to use the local authority and route complaints and concerns through that channel.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0002.htm_para15">
<p><a name="0712178000076">In conclusion, I agree that there may well be a place for a statutory obligation. We need to look more carefully at whether a new statutory obligation would be the best and most appropriate way of dealing with the point, or whether it can be dealt with under existing legislation or guidance. If the noble Lord is happy to withdraw the amendment, I will consider the issue further and write to all noble Lords before Report with suggestions as to how we might achieve the objective which I think we mostly all share.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0002.htm_para16">
<p><a name="0712178000077">On Amendment No. 69ZA, I am grateful to my noble friend for providing another opportunity to talk about the size and shape of bus passenger champions. I listened with interest to the points that have been made. As I said earlier, we are giving more consideration to how we can find the best way of taking this forward. One reason for that is to ensure that the body will be allowed to influence large national stakeholders, including central government. It is estimated that about 60 per cent of bus services are operated by one of the big five transportation companies, such as FirstGroup and Stagecoach, so it is essential that the new bus champion has the status and standing to get right to the heart of those organisations.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0002.htm_para17">
<p><a name="0712178000078">On a further point, we have no formal watchdog, so any new statutory body will necessarily take time to develop and the new process may need to be incremental. I recognise that many will see the need for local representation, and although I have made it clear that the Government&#146;s first position on this matter is that we are consulting, I should make it very clear that we are also listening and will be interested to receive a broad range of views. It is important to us that the legislation is flexible. I assure noble Lords that, as currently drafted, it will not preclude the setting-up of regional offices or regional committees as a network if that were considered to be the best way of dealing with the issue.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0002.htm_para18">
<p><a name="0712178000079">I am grateful again to the noble Lord, Lord Low, for tabling Amendment No. 70, which provides an opportunity to consider ensuring that disabled people and their needs are right at the heart of developing a network of committees. The Government have done a lot to improve accessibility in public transport. We introduced regulations that specify the minimum technical accessibility requirements that are designed to make buses and coaches more accessible to disabled people. It is interesting that the number of wheelchair-accessible, low-floor buses increased from 8.2 per cent in 1997-98 to 58 per cent in 2006-07. So there has been a large growth in that particular type of bus. As a product, we can argue for the campaigning in the legislation. We have also introduced regulations to ensure that certain obligations on the providers of services not to discriminate against disabled persons in the provision of goods, facilities and services apply to bus operators.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0002.htm_para19">
<p><a name="0712178000080">I entirely agree with the aim behind the amendment but would suggest that there might be a different way of implementing the obligation. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 already places certain general duties on all public authorities in carrying out their functions. If established, we would expect the Public Transport Users Committee to be a &#147;public authority&#148; within the definition in Part 5A of that Act, and therefore subject to the same general duty as all other public authorities.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0002.htm_para20">
<p><a name="0712178000081">The purpose of the Disability Discrimination (Public Authorities) (Statutory Duties) Regulations 2005 is to ensure better performance by specified public authorities of the duty to have due regard to the need to eliminate disability discrimination. The regulations contain a schedule listing those public authorities to which the obligations apply. An amendment to the regulations was made this year&#151;

For those reasons I am grateful to the noble Lord for probing these issues in the amendment.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0002.htm_para28">
<p><a name="0712178000093">Specifically in relation to this amendment, the Bill would confer on the Public Transport Users Committee the function of making recommendations to the Secretary of State about prescribed public passenger transport and facilities in England. I accept there may be others that the committee, or Passenger Focus if we extend its remit, would want to make recommendations to. However, the Secretary of State also has powers to confer, in secondary legislation, additional functions on the committee, and this might include the functions of making recommendations to traffic commissioners, local authorities or indeed, I suggest, the bus industry. I therefore suggest to noble Lords that the first part of this amendment is unnecessary. Following our consultation, I hope it will become clear how these relationships might work in detail. Any order made to set up a public transport users committee would also need to be laid before and approved by a resolution of this House and another place.</p>

The purpose of the amendment is to gain from the Minister recognition of the fact that many homeless families suffer from isolation and that this Bill should seek to assist them, or that help should be offered elsewhere. I apologise for not tabling this amendment earlier. Its possibilities became apparent to me only late last week in discussion with the researcher of my noble friend Lord Low of Dalston. The amendment&#146;s purpose is to probe. I should make clear that my goal is a debate about homeless families rather than the general homeless population. The problem is that there are more than 100,000 homeless families, who live in temporary accommodation, much of it private. Some time ago, I visited homeless families in Newham, east London, with a health visitor. I have also spoken to mothers of families in the Barnardo&#146;s families in temporary accommodation project in London. The housing that I saw was on occasion damp, unhygienic and overcrowded.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0003.htm_para5">
<p><a name="0712178000103">As important as the poor quality of housing and the overcrowding is the isolation that these families can experience. The research in this area points to the isolation experienced by the many women who are bringing up children in temporary accommodation, often far from their community, family or friends and on their own without a partner. Such isolation tends to lead to despair. In addition, these families are moved far away from the child&#146;s school, so they need assistance to transport their child to their school.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0003.htm_para6">
<p><a name="0712178000104">Her Majesty&#146;s Government have taken many steps to reduce homelessness. No family now spends more than a few weeks in bed-and-breakfast accommodation unless it is an asylum-seeking family. Much of the available social housing is being refurbished with money from this Government. The Government promise another 3 million homes under the Housing and Regeneration Bill. However, the effect of the right to buy and the limits on councils reinvesting their money in new social housing has led to a dramatic rise in the number of homeless families to an historic high of more than 100,000, as I have said. Surely it is incumbent on both central and local government to do as much as possible

Will the Minister say whether this Bill might be used to increase access to transport for homeless families to help to reduce their isolation? If not, what other steps does he propose to improve their access to transport? Does he recognise the difficulties that these families face and the scale and seriousness of their problems?</p>

<p><a name="0712178000105">I apologise once again for not giving the Minister more time to consider these questions. I would be very grateful for a letter as much as an oral response at this time, and perhaps an undertaking to come back with something similar on Report. I beg to move.</p>

I hope that the Minister will say in his response that he supports the amendment, but if he objects to it, will he say whether he objects to it in principle or because of the logistics of trying to implement it? Bearing in mind the spirit of the amendment and the difficulties that homeless people have in finding the money to travel around at all, as well as their need to do so&#151;as we all do on occasions&#151;I hope that he might be sympathetic to it and say something helpful about it.</p>

I do have a modicum of sympathy for it for the very reasons that he and other noble Lords have adumbrated.

<p><a name="0712178000110">The Concessionary Bus Travel Act 2007 was all about expanding the geographical scope of concessionary bus travel; it was not about extending the concession to other groups of people, as the amendment envisages. It is premature to consider extensions when the Government are still in the process of introducing the national bus travel concession scheme.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0003.htm_para9">
<p><a name="0712178000111">The Transport Act 1985 provides local authorities with considerable flexibility to offer more than the statutory concession to their residents. There are numerous examples of local authorities that offer concessions to additional groups of people. My local authority of Brighton in the early 1990s extended its concessionary scheme to assist travellers who had contracted HIV/AIDS. That happened to be a large group of people at that time in that conurbation. That concession was considered to be of some value.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0003.htm_para10">
<p><a name="0712178000112">The new national concessionary bus travel scheme does not affect those powers, and local authorities retain the discretion to provide enhancements to the proposed national minimum, taking account of their local circumstances. Although homeless people are not currently listed in the 1985 Act as being eligible for travel concessions, the power already exists for the Secretary of State, in secondary legislation, to add further classes of persons to that list.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0003.htm_para11">
<p><a name="0712178000113">As noble Lords will know, the Government have sought to provide local authorities with more freedom and flexibility in choosing how they use their resources so as best to reflect their local priorities. That approach has been generally supported by local government. I am sure that noble Lords will agree that the Government have already done a great to deal to improve the well-being of older and disabled people, who are among the most vulnerable in our society. From April 2008, the Government will be providing around &#163;1 billion of funding each year for concessionary travel in England, which is a major public spending commitment of which we are rightly proud. The extension from the local to the national entitlement alone involves substantial new money of &#163;212 million for local authorities in England.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0003.htm_para12">
<p><a name="0712178000114">We are not ruling out extensions to other groups of people in the future, but extending eligibility to give free travel to homeless people, for example, would need a robust and fair system for assessing eligibility. With a national concession, there is greater potential for fraud. Who would qualify&#151;the family or the individual? I recognise that the amendment is born of good intentions, but I hope that the noble Earl will now feel able to agree that in general terms the approach the Government is taking is the right one.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0003.htm_para13">
<p><a name="0712178000115">The key objective for us at the moment is to successfully introduce the national bus concession next April, so now is probably not the right time to make further legislative changes without proper planning, some considerable thought and some fairly in-depth consultation to make sure that we would have the best approach. I offer encouragement and sympathy, but now is not the right time to move on this issue.</p>

It seems to me that we have a situation where some pensioners are quite wealthy&#151;many are not, but some are&#151;and yet they get free bus travel and can travel the length and breadth of the country. Good luck to them. It seems extraordinary that there are other vulnerable groups who cannot even travel across the same town. It is important that we keep this under review, particularly in the case of such a group, which does not have the benefit of a loud voice. The fact that the concessionary fare scheme for pensioners was announced just before the last election probably says it all.</p>

The best thing is to tackle the root cause of the problem, which is homelessness, and we have been doing that very successfully. Our aim is to halve the number of households living in temporary accommodation to something approaching 50,000 by 2010.

It may be that this issue can be returned to in the future, but we currently think it best to concentrate our efforts on making the current scheme workable and seeing how that beds in.

Our concern is that applicant ITAs could form and that their main transport interest will be to create major road schemes to connect large towns, to the detriment of rural communities between those towns and the general state of the environment.

I agree that how far existing transport arrangements in an area are integrated and sustainable are key issues which authorities would have to take into account. For instance, authorities in an existing integrated transport area carrying out a review will want to consider whether the existing arrangements whereby the ITA has overall responsibility for public transport in the area, while roads are a matter for individual councils, enables effective integration, or whether changes are needed. Similarly, authorities in an area where there is no ITA will want to consider how effective integration of transport services is best achieved.

As well as directing a review, the Secretary of State would also be able to direct that the authorities in question should publish a scheme containing proposals for establishing an integrated transport authority.</p>

<p><a name="0712178000148">Clause 71 would give the Secretary of State a similar power to direct one or more authorities in an existing integrated transport authority area to carry out a review of those matters which could be included in an order made by the Secretary of State under Clauses 72 to 78. The matters which the Secretary of State could direct authorities to consider in such a review include the existing constitution of the ITA and its boundaries and the distribution of statutory transport functions between the ITA, other local authorities and the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0003.htm_para39">
<p><a name="0712178000149">As I mentioned in the context of Clause 68, we are clear that in the first place it should be for local authorities and ITAs themselves to decide whether to undertake a review of governance arrangements in their area. We would intend to make that very clear in the guidance that we issue to authorities on carrying out a review, a draft of which we have already made available. However, the power in the clauses for the Secretary of State to direct a review provides a sensible contingency. It might be used, for instance, in circumstances where governance arrangements in an area were demonstrably not working properly but the authorities were unable to reach agreement that a review should be undertaken, or perhaps to reach agreement as to the area to be covered by a review. A direction from the Secretary of State in those circumstances could be of considerable assistance in resolving issues and providing a way forward.</p>

That could help to ensure that the work undertaken by a review would lead to proposals which the Secretary of State would then be able to bring into force in an order under this part of the Bill. We would also expect to be able to say more in the guidance that we intend to issue under Clause 83 about the particular circumstances in which a direction might need to be issued. I hope that the noble Lord understands that in most circumstances we need that contingency power.

The implications of not having the consent of local authorities are great at present. The Bill would allow the ITA to be the mechanism for opposing road pricing on a local authority which has decided that it does not want such a scheme in its area. That would certainly contravene the asserted principle that these matters are for local authorities to decide. An authority may decide against road pricing because its electors are against it, which would be the most important reason against setting up a scheme.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0004.htm_para15">
<p><a name="0712178000176">Amendment No. 78B seeks to ensure that changes to constitutional arrangements are agreed to by authorities in the ITA area. The Bill allows a Secretary of State to appoint non-elected members to an ITA. There are several arguments against having non-elected members on an ITA and there is a real possibility for excluding or watering down the influence of one or more of the authorities within it. Members of local authorities whose powers are to be diluted, in this case giving non-elected members voting rights, should be accountable to voters if they support such a dilution.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0004.htm_para16">
<p><a name="0712178000177">Clause 74 allows the Secretary of State to delegate a function of a local authority to an ITA. Amendment No. 80A seeks to ensure that the local authorities whose functions are to be removed consent to that change. In the case of the delegation of road charging function, the ITA could have the power to introduce road charging without the consent of constituent authorities, as I have said. There is a provision to make it a requirement for some consultation and approval by both Houses of Parliament, but that neglects the need for local accountability. None of the provisions would themselves, or in combination, prevent an order being made against the will of a local authority. Road charging could be imposed in an area by a local authority that does not want it. For similar reasons, Amendment No. 80B seeks to make a requirement that local authorities consent to the direction that can be given to them by an ITA. The potential again exists here for an authority to be directed on road charging without its consent. I beg to move.</p>

It would allow for those authorities carrying out a review of governance to propose that certain functions of the ITA itself should be delegated to an executive or delivery body of the ITA. So, it could allow for instance for certain functions to be delegated to a passenger transport executive which was responsible for delivering the ITA&#146;s policies on public transport in the area or it could enable the functions of a PTE to be exercised by the integrated transport authority itself.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0004.htm_para18">
<p><a name="0712178000180">Given that any such functions delegated via an order would remain within the overall ambit of the ITA structure, we do not believe that it is necessary to include an explicit requirement for consent to be given to any such delegation, which I suppose could be tantamount to a form of veto. Amendment No. 78B would have the effect that an order made under  Clause 74 could not provide for the delegation to an ITA or its successor body of the functions of a local authority in its area without the consent of the local authority.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0004.htm_para19">
<p><a name="0712178000181">As I made plain earlier in our discussions, the series of reports on transport governance which were published recently have identified possible problems with existing arrangements. One issue which is frequently highlighted is the current separation of powers in the metropolitan counties between the PTAs, which are responsible for planning and procuring public transport services, and the district councils, which hold powers over roads as the highway authorities and traffic authorities for their areas. For example, while the PTA has overall responsibility for bus services, the installation of bus priority measures such as bus lanes, which are a key factor in improving services, is a matter for the district councils.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0004.htm_para20">
<p><a name="0712178000182">In carrying out governance reviews under Clauses 68 and 70, authorities will want to consider whether changes to existing arrangements for carrying out local authority functions could lead to better integrated decision-making and implementation. In particular, authorities will want to consider how far, if at all, the current division of responsibilities for roads and public transport creates a barrier to improving transport services in the area. It might be that any necessary improvements could be best achieved through joint working, without the need to formally transfer functions. But Clause 74 could enable functions which are complementary to each other, such as bus operations and bus lanes, to be exercised in a co-ordinated manner by one statutory authority, which seems to be very sensible.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0004.htm_para21">
<p><a name="0712178000183">As I have reiterated, we are looking for local authorities in an area to come up with their own proposals for improvement, and we would expect that authorities carrying out a review would want to ensure that any transfer of functions to an ITA which was proposed enjoyed the full support of the authorities concerned, otherwise they are less likely to work. I should stress two points here. First, any such changes made by an order would, of course, be subject to consultation with those authorities which would be affected and to the affirmative resolution procedure in your Lordships&#146; House and in another place. Secondly, given that representatives of local authorities in an area would  


<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC229"><b>17 Dec 2007 : Column GC229</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have to provide a majority of the members of each ITA, they would retain the ability to influence how the ITA exercised any of its functions, including those functions which had been transferred to the ITA from a local authority.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0004.htm_para22">
<p><a name="0712178000184">On Amendment No. 80B, Clause 75 offers another way to enable an ITA to influence how an area&#146;s local road network is managed without the need to formally delegate the highway or traffic powers of the local authority. This would enable an ITA to be given a power to direct local highways authorities and local traffic authorities as to how they carry out those functions. The functions to which this power might be applied include the installing of traffic management measures, local regimes for parking, the carrying out of road maintenance works and so on. In existing PTA areas these functions belong to the metropolitan district councils. As with the other powers in Part 5 of the Bill, it would be for the authorities carrying out the governance review to consider whether such a power to direct should be given to an ITA.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0004.htm_para23">
<p><a name="0712178000185">An order which gave an ITA this power to give directions would need to specify those individual roads or descriptions of roads on which the authority could be directed&#151;for instance, the roads carrying major bus routes. A direction which was then given under this power could, for instance, specify that the highway or traffic authority either should or should not take a particular course of action. An example might be that a local traffic authority must install a bus lane on one of its roads in order to improve bus reliability on a key radial route in an urban area. Another example of a direction given under this power could be that a local highway authority must not carry out road works on a key strategic road at a particular time or on particular days.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0004.htm_para24">
<p><a name="0712178000186">Where an ITA was given such a power to direct, we would not expect a direction to be a frequent event. In London, Transport for London already has a related power to direct London boroughs. In the vast majority of cases, discussion between it and the boroughs has managed to resolve any disagreement over individual works and it has not proved necessary to resort to the direction-making power. There is no reason why the same should not be true in ITA areas, particularly given that representatives of the individual councils in the area would constitute a majority of an ITA's members.</p>

I know that the noble Lord is somewhat concerned, perhaps even slightly obsessed, with road pricing. He made a point about road pricing being instituted by the ITA without local authority consent. Perhaps I should respond to that by explaining that the Bill does not allow an ITA to make a road-charging scheme without the agreement of a local traffic authority, which is, of course, a council. That is made clear in Clause 90 of the Bill. The fact that particular functions of a local traffic authority can be delegated to an ITA does not mean that the local authority would cease to be the statutory traffic authority.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0004.htm_para26">
<p><a name="0712178000190">In any case, Clause 90 of the Bill makes clear that an ITA can enter into a scheme only with one or more other authorities. If it were the intention that a delegation under Clause 74 could have the result that an ITA could make a scheme on its own, Clause 90 would have to be very differently drafted without requiring there to be a joint scheme within the ITA&#146;s own area. There are checks and balances at work here. It is probably worth the noble Lord reflecting on that as well.</p>

The Bill provides that the majority of members of an ITA must be elected members appointed by its constituent council, but the amendment would ensure local determination of whether an ITA should have unelected members, the appointees, and the status of the appointees on the ITA, including any voting rights. The amendment would clarify that any members nominated by bodies other than local councils must be appointed by the ITA.

I was very grateful to the Minister for his comments at Second Reading, when he attempted to give some comfort on this issue. Nevertheless, while these clauses remain in the Bill, it is inevitable that there should be some confusion and concern about this role. First, it is not clear whether the powers of the Secretary of State would simply be to tell an ITA that it had to have a certain number of non-elected members and leave it to the ITA to choose who they were. I would have some difficulty with that, too, because it should be for the ITA to decide for itself whether to have other stakeholder members. However, I am not even clear whether the Secretary of State could decide who those members should be. That would be a step further, and so would be even worse.</p>

<p><a name="0712178000197">The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, referred to road-user charging in this context. It is certainly important that, if an area is to introduce road-user charging&#151;there is no doubt that this will be controversial&#151;the people who are taking responsibility for that should be accountable in some way. However, the larger issue is the levy because, although the ITA has the right to go to its constituents&#146; authorities and ask them to raise a levy from the general public, it is only right that people should be locally accountable in some way and should not be foisted on the ITA by the Secretary of State.</p>

The arrangements for a particular ITA&#146;s membership which are set out in an order would flow from the governance scheme put forward by authorities in that area under Clause 70, which would be subject to widespread consultation.

Furthermore, the Bill leaves it open to authorities carrying out a review to propose that the ITA&#146;s membership should continue to be made up of only local councillors, if they felt that to be more appropriate. If they just wanted councillors, that would be fine and the end of the story. Alternatively, they would be able to propose that persons from other sectors should be members of the ITA; for instance, representatives of the business sector, transport users, Network Rail, environmental groups and others who might bring relevant wider experience, knowledge and understanding.</p>

I do not think that there can be a different status of member if you have an ITA. That would be wrong. Where the order for a particular ITA area provided for the ITA&#146;s membership to include one or more non-elected persons, it would also need to include a provision covering how those persons would be appointed. That is important to ensure that appointments follow proper procedures. Given that, we do not think that it is necessary or desirable for the Bill to take the inflexible approach that members must simply be appointed by the ITA itself.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000008">The noble Baroness, Lady Scott, asked about political balance. The approach would reflect the Local Government Act 2000 and its executive arrangements. In essence, we have to reflect on how that Act works, because it would be hard to achieve political balance between parties where, for instance, a single leader of an executive, as set out in Section 11 of the 2000 Act, operates. We seek to allow ITAs to use the same structures as local authorities have had in place since 2000, so it is not a perfect reflection of political balance. That is how I understand it.</p>

I suspect that for many current PTA/PTE areas, moving towards that model would be a step too far. They are by their nature very different beasts from local authorities. If it was a step too far for local authorities, I suspect that it would be even more controversial among the passenger transport authorities, because they are a coming together of component local authorities. The idea that one person or even a small group of people could be chosen from among those, without any political balance, would upset the arrangements that have served extremely well for the past couple of decades.

<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC235"><b>17 Dec 2007 : Column GC235</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

Clause 97 abolishes the need for confirmation of English charging schemes by the Secretary of State. While the reasoning behind removing the Secretary of State's responsibility for approving each road pricing scheme is understood, and I have no wish to return to the Transport Act 2000 situation, there should be some form of central government control in ensuring that these schemes are fully harmonised in their objectives and fully interoperable.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0005.htm_para18">
<p><a name="07121721000033">Clearly, legislative and statutory guidance from the Government can help to achieve that objective and Clause 100 seems to take a first step towards that, but, in my view, central government should clearly demonstrate what mechanism will be in place to ensure that a local authority, implementing a scheme which fails to meet the statutory guidance, will be brought to account. Currently, that remains unclear and I suggest creates a degree of uncertainty.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0005.htm_para19">
<p><a name="07121721000034">The House of Commons Transport Committee echoed those views. I quote from its report:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121721000198">&#147;Regulations and guidance governing local charging schemes must balance the need for consistency, interoperability and fairness against the need to provide flexibility to tailor schemes to local requirements. The strengths and weaknesses of this framework will play a key part in determining whether or not the local schemes are successful. We believe that Parliament should have a clear indication of the framework the Government intends to put in place&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71217-gc0005.htm_para20">
<p><a name="07121721000035">If consistency and interaction between schemes is not achieved, it will become extremely complex and confusing for all motorists; for example, there has to be consistency in terms of technology. If motorists are unable to register with one central scheme for payments, each driver must end up with several black boxes or tags in the vehicle at great expense. There has to be consistency in terms of discounts and exemptions. If discounts do not have a degree of harmonisation, a driver could think that his vehicle, which is exempt for being a low-polluting car, say, under a specific local road pricing scheme, is therefore exempt under all other local schemes. That would equally apply to  100 per cent discounts for hybrid vehicles or blue-badge holders.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0005.htm_para21">
<p><a name="07121721000036">It would be very wrong to expect motorists to check each time they travel somewhere the particular rules and regulations regarding each local road pricing scheme, or for that matter even to know that they exist. Not all road journeys are planned in advance. One could easily leave a motorway to do some emergency shopping in a town only to find that one has inadvertently strayed into a road pricing scheme.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0005.htm_para22">
<p><a name="07121721000037">There has to be consistency regarding equipment and signage. It would be paramount to ensure that all schemes adopt a common approach on road traffic signs warning motorists of the operation of a local road pricing scheme and what they have to do about it. There are also the limits on the charges payable, a degree of standardisation on penalty charges and other provisions in relation to enforcement.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0005.htm_para23">
<p><a name="07121721000038">All in all, this clause, which merely abolishes the need for the Secretary of State&#146;s approval without putting any other effective controls in its place, does

<p><a name="07121721000039">Clause 98 abolishes the power of the Secretary of State to insist on a public inquiry or consultation as regards road charging schemes in England. While I have no wish to force a public inquiry on anyone, I think that proper consultation is essential. I realise that the local authority may still consult and may hold its own inquiry, but I do not think that is good enough when one considers the effects that these schemes could have on those who might visit the urban centre in question, especially&#151;I mentioned this at Second Reading&#151;those who live in the surrounding parishes and who depend on vehicular access to the particular town or city for their livelihood and services, especially services such as health and hospitals.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000042">When I looked at this clause this morning it seemed that the problem could possibly be dealt with by making a small further amendment to Section 170(1) of the 2000 Act, changing the charging authority's duties from &#147;may consult&#148; to &#147;must consult&#148; and possibly adding, &#147;according to guidelines issued by the Secretary of State&#148;. But however it is done, it is essential that there is some form of mandatory consultation on the part of the charging authority, and just to leave it in the air would be a mistake. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

I believe that the Government made a pig&#146;s ear of selling national road user charging to the public and allowed scare stories to prevail.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0005.htm_para28">
<p><a name="07121721000044">The Minister seemed to agree with our view at Second Reading. Indeed, all of the Government's responses agree that consultation is important. Why, therefore, do we have a clause in the Bill to abolish the requirement to consult for English schemes and why are Welsh schemes different? That is very odd. It may be the case that local authorities considering charging schemes are expected to develop strategies for consultation which are best suited to local circumstances. But this is hardly the approach of other parts of the Bill, where comprehensive lists of organisations and people are given in the consultation requirements. Why do quality partnerships and quality contracts have explicit consultation requirements listed in the Transport Act 2000, when road charging has the potential to be much more contentious and directly affects motorists and is proposed to have no explicit consultation requirements?</p>

<a name="71217-gc0005.htm_para29">
<p><a name="07121721000045">In the Government's published response to consultation, it is stated that the general requirement about engagement with citizens in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 will have effect once that Act comes into force. That may be true, but why abolish the absolute requirement to consult? Will that be yet another matter for guidance?</p>

<p><a name="07121721000046"><b><a name="71217-gc0005.htm_spnew11"><a name="07121721000235">Baroness Scott of Needham Market:</b> Sometimes one has to feel sorry for the Government because they are damned if they do and damned if they do not. We spend most of our time complaining that the Government are too centralising and set down too stringent targets for local authorities and on the one occasion when they let something go, we all ask them to put it back. It seems to me that any local authority or ITA that attempted to bring in road user charging without effective consultation would be absolutely mad.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0005.htm_para30">
<p><a name="07121721000047">However, that links back to the point in previous debates about governance. It seems to me, under the current arrangements, that if a PTA, with representation from across the piece, attempted to bring in a road user scheme that did not have the support of the population, those people would fairly rapidly pay the price. The problem with the form of governance allowed in the Bill is that a single person, whose contact with the wider electorate might be quite tangential, would not be so accountable and, therefore, could bring in a scheme against the wishes of local people.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0005.htm_para31">
<p><a name="07121721000048">In a sense, the Government&#146;s bind over this is of their own making, because one can either have robust local democratic arrangements, and leave the local area to get on with it, or, if the Government are to insist on controlling the governance arrangements, this House and, as we have heard, the Transport Select Committee in another place will seek to set limits on how much they can impose on the local area. The Government really need to think very carefully about the relationship between the governance arrangements and what they seek to achieve through road pricing.</p>

Under Section 169 of the Transport  Act 2000, a local charging scheme can come into force only once the order making it has been submitted to and confirmed by the appropriate national authority. As noble Lords have explained, Clause 97 would remove that requirement for schemes in England only, where the appropriate national authority is the Secretary of State. The purpose of local road pricing schemes is to bring benefits to local areas. We think it is right that democratic accountability for the design and implementation of local schemes should be at a local level.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0005.htm_para32">
<p><a name="07121721000050">Removing the Secretary of State&#146;s quasi-judicial role in approving schemes will leave the Government freer to offer support and practical advice at the development stage. That will help to provide clarity for local debate about local scheme proposals, increase the likelihood of sound, locally-supported proposals being put forward, and remove the uncertainty involved in an approval process. There are a number of checks and balances to ensure that powers are used appropriately. That includes comprehensive guidance produced by the department to help local authorities to develop good quality schemes.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0005.htm_para33">
<p><a name="07121721000051">There are also powers for the Secretary of State to make regulations under the Transport Act 2000 proposed in Clauses 100 and 103, which will allow the Government to ensure consistency between schemes where necessary and appropriate. That point was made by the noble Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington. I hope that, in the light of what I have said, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his opposition to this clause.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0005.htm_para34">
<p><a name="07121721000052">On Clause 98, I am grateful to noble Lords for their explanation of their concern. Clause 98 removes the power under Section 170 of the Transport  Act 2000 for the Secretary of State to consult or to require an English local authority to consult or hold an inquiry in relation to a charging scheme. The power for Welsh Ministers would remain. The most important thing to note is that this clause does not remove the ability of a local authority to consult or to hold an inquiry in relation to a charging scheme. The clause sits in partnership with Clause 97, which removes the Secretary of State&#146;s approval role. It is the Government&#146;s view that local road pricing schemes should be free from this national government role and that the power for the Secretary of State to order further consultation or an inquiry should also be removed. We have consistently stated that we expect local authorities to consult fully in relation to a road pricing scheme. We believe that it will be in the interests of any local authority to do so and that it would wish to consult for the very reasons set out by the noble Baroness, Lady Scott. Clearly, any local authority that did not consult properly would pretty soon end up in the dog-house with local voters.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000053">While we believe that it is necessary to consult, the Government also feel that it would be inappropriate to impose a set manner of consultation or set consultees. We want local circumstances to dictate such things, rather than a centralist model. We believe

The current need for the Secretary of State&#146;s approval does not affect that, so the removal of the need is not a change to an existing provision.</p>

Given the existing powers in the Transport Act 2000 and the new proposals in the Bill, we have set aside several powers to ensure that consistency on interoperability between schemes. For example, the Bill allows us to regulate the use of equipment so that standard data formats and equipment numbering systems can be specified, and interoperability between schemes allows a road user to have a single account that covers all interactions with local schemes rather than having to deal separately with each local scheme operator. It is likely that most interoperability issues will be addressed through application of the EU interoperability directive, and that will require electronic charging schemes to be accessible to subscribers through a European electronic tolling service. As yet we have no firm timetable by which the interoperability decisions will be made under the directive but in the mean time we believe that we need explicit powers requiring compliance with the interoperability requirements that apply to all schemes, not just those caught by the directive. So we have included such provisions in the Bill.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0006.htm_para1">
<p><a name="07121721000057">It is also hoped that given the potential benefits to the road user it will be in the interests of scheme operators to offer an interoperable service and it is very likely that allowing interoperability will be commercially attractive to service providers. Therefore, we think that these objectives will be met through close working and co-operation between schemes without necessarily needing to use regulation. In essence, we are approaching this in a deregulatory spirit.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000058">The noble Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington, asked about drivers knowing where road pricing zones start, and mentioned coming off the motorway and suddenly finding yourself in Durham, which I think is the only place apart from London which has a scheme at the moment. Issues such as where schemes start and finish and informing road users are facts to be dealt with in the detailed design of local schemes. It will be for local authorities developing

However, the experience of London, where the scheme is well and clearly advertised, is encouraging. If a charging authority fails properly to promote and identify charging zones, in the final instance the department has the power to direct it to place and maintain traffic signs in connection with a scheme under Section 177 of the Transport Act 2000.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0006.htm_para3">
<p><a name="07121721000059">The noble Lord, Lord Cameron, also referred to rural drivers, as I believe he did at Second Reading. The transport innovation fund guidance on road pricing already recognises that problem. It says that a local authority should consult its neighbouring authorities and use its best endeavours to offer those who regularly enter or have business in the proposed charged area the opportunity to comment on the plans. That sounds as though it does the business. It ensures that they should consult and they would be very foolish not to. I know that it is not unknown for local authorities to fall out but this is an area where it is in everyone&#146;s interests for them to co-operate and work together. If road pricing schemes take off, as I know many wish to see, and bring the benefits that they promise, intra-authority and inter-authority consultation will be very necessary indeed. A duty is also imposed under the Traffic Management Act 2004, which requires local traffic authorities to do all that is reasonably practicable to manage the network effectively to keep traffic moving on their roads, and to facilitate this on the roads of other authorities. There is already an understood obligation.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000060">The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, asked about the difference between consultation on English and Welsh schemes. Welsh schemes will still be subject to approval by the appropriate national authority, so the existing powers of the Transport Act 2000 will still be appropriate. I think that I covered that point earlier, but it was worth reinforcing. There will of course be an overriding import to consult locally when schemes are proposed. I cannot believe that local authorities will not do that, because it would be politically foolish for them to do otherwise.</p>

My point, however, is that in most cases in rural areas it will not be the voters who have not been consulted but, because it is a district council or a metropolitan authority, the people actually using that town or city, who very often fall outside local authority boundaries; the phrase, &#147;No taxation without representation&#148;, springs to mind.

In the case of paying a charge, it is evident that certain methods will be less costly and will have fewer overheads than others. By objecting to Clause 99, I simply wanted to explore the potential implications of allowing the variation of charges. The payment method should ultimately be up to the road user making the payment to decide. For instance, some methods, such as internet payments, may be more appropriate for those who are more technologically able, and some may be less so. The direct debit is the favoured payment method of companies, and of me, as it allows a near guaranteed payment direct from the customers&#146; bank accounts. However, that is not to say that mistakes do not occur, and people sometimes object to direct debits because of their long experience of being wrongly charged. That objection should be allowed to stand. However, payment by other means is often penalised through higher charges that do not reflect the true administrative costs. For this reason, customers may base their decision on cost alone.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000069">By allowing charges to be varied, road-charging schemes could make road users decide their means of payment solely on the basis of cost. Users could actually be coerced into paying in a certain manner to which they may otherwise object. Some sections of the community may not even possess a bank account and will automatically be ruled out of any preferential pricing.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0006.htm_para12">
<p><a name="07121721000070">I understand that administrative costs, payment methods and overheads vary, and that charges should allow them to vary accordingly. Perhaps the clause could be amended to avoid any potential abuse. If an authority were required to demonstrate that the differential pricing that it proposed reflected the true administration cost of certain methods, there would be no potential for penalising certain methods of payment. I reiterate that if a road-charging scheme is to be a success, it needs to be in the public interest and have a transparent approach. The clause could undermine all this.</p>

In other words, you do not need to have six different bits of equipment in your car; you simply have one bit of equipment that can be used everywhere. Europe is scarred with this common system of railway signalling&#151;the RTMS&#151;where there are 20 versions of the same thing. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that there will be one system with which all schemes will have to comply so that you have only one box in your car.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000072">The noble Earl is absolutely right about the different methods of paying for the scheme. There must be different variations for the different types of users, which presumably could be different in different areas, towns or cities. The key is that people know what they are getting and know, as I think the noble Earl also said, how much discount they might be able to get by paying by one means rather than by another. I am sure that each area charging zone will want to charge different rates for different times and different types of car. That is why we are discussing this on a local or regional basis rather than on a national one. For me, the key is to have one family of systems of payment that can be used not only in this country but anywhere across Europe. I hope that the Minister can put my mind to rest.</p>

I have given this a little thought. It took me back to my time as a local authority leader when we used to incentivise different means of payment.

<p><a name="07121721000074">Clause 99 amends Section 171(5) of the Transport Act 2000 by adding a further example of how an authority can vary its road-user charges. It makes it very clear that local authorities can offer different charges for different methods or means of recording, administering, collecting or paying the charge. Of course, this would allow different rates to be applied where a road user chooses his charge liabilities to  be recorded automatically by means of different technologies or to pay by different means, such as by a pre-pay account or direct debit. As the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, rightly said, direct debit is the preferred method of collection for many organisations. It is probably the cheapest and simplest for people to understand, but not everybody has that facility. Clause 99(2) makes a similar addition to the Greater London Authority Act for schemes in London.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0006.htm_para15">
<p><a name="07121721000075">It is important that local authorities have the opportunity to provide incentives to encourage the use of efficient payment methods. This clause removes any doubt that such an approach would be permitted. However, local authorities will need to ensure that, in developing their proposals, they recognise the impact that they could have on all groups. The noble Earl rightly drew attention to the needs of different groups. In those circumstances local authorities must act

If they do not act reasonably they can be challenged for making a decision on the grounds of reasonableness. In designing a scheme they must have regard to all relevant considerations, including the interests of different groups with different abilities to pay. So local authorities have valuable discretion about how they operate. That flexibility enables them to think hard about the impact of road-charging and road-pricing schemes on lower income households.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000077">On the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, I thought that I had made it plain that we wanted to encourage and stimulate the development of schemes where it was much easier for them to be interoperable, where the technology was consistent and so on. Of course there must be some local variations because of local circumstances. The noble Lord made a very important point. As the process unrolls, as guidance is developed and as the technology changes and is refined, those issues will crystallise as local authorities seek to take up the road-pricing opportunities.

<p><a name="07121721000086">I think there is a solid argument for allowing vehicle classification and weight thresholds of vehicles to be regulated nationally. The definition of each vehicle should be harmonised to ensure consistency between charging schemes. There is mention in Section 198 of the Transport Act 2000 of vehicle classifications, but it is unclear what this refers to. This amendment would make it explicit that the appropriate national authority could regulate vehicle classifications nationally.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0006.htm_para23">
<p><a name="07121721000087">If a scheme is to offer a discount based on vehicle efficiency, type or classification, it is vital that the same definitions are used consistently. As I say, this is very much related to the discussion we have just had. I believe that there are numerous existing definitions used in various pieces of legislation, which only causes confusion. In the case of charging schemes, it is important that drivers are well aware of which category their vehicle falls into when travelling between various pricing schemes, and the costs of entering a particular area&#146;s scheme. This amendment will provide clarity for vehicle drivers and operators if variable charges are introduced. I beg to move.</p>

Our overriding concern is to ensure that we have consistency across local pricing schemes to minimise confusion for users. Section 198(3) of the Transport Act 2000 already allows the class of motor vehicle to be defined or described in regulations made by the appropriate national authority. This power applies to any scheme under that Act.

The amendment preserves the legal right for a motorist to put in a defence that he or she was not the owner of the vehicle at the time that the road traffic offence may have been committed. This would occur when the vehicle owner has sold the vehicle but the DVLA has not yet updated its records and registered the new keeper details against the vehicle registration number.

For instance, in both parking and bus lane enforcement, there is an initial presumption that the keeper registered at DVLA is the owner. However, if the registered keeper can show that he was not the owner at the time of the contravention, he will not be liable for the penalty; it will be the liability of the actual owner. At the moment, unfortunately, the Transport Act 2000 is based on a registered keeper liability, as opposed to an owner liability for farms, which can cause problems for car owners and, indeed, for car hire businesses.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000104">The noble Earl said: The amendment is not about the low emission zone in London in general; it is about the adverse effects of the scheme, which have not been properly addressed. The LEZ is clearly aimed at vehicles that regularly deliver in London. These vehicles cover a high mileage, are mostly new or nearly new, and are relatively easy to replace. They can also be used in other parts of the country, although that does of course shift the problem. The Secretary of State has the power to exclude certain vehicles from the charging scheme by virtue of paragraph 11 of Schedule 23 to the Greater London Authority Act 1999. My amendment would invite her to do that.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000105">My amendment refers to three different classes of vehicle: recovery vehicles, preserved vehicles and special vehicles. A recovery operator near London may have some vehicles that comply with the LEZ technical requirements and some that do not. Perhaps he has a heavy recovery vehicle of 60 tonnes gross that is fully compliant with the scheme, so there is no problem there. Perhaps, however, he has a really heavy recovery vehicle of 150 tonnes, which is perfectly safe but is older and non-compliant. It is uneconomic to retro-fit the necessary equipment because it will not be used in London enough. The operator still has a 60-tonne gross recovery vehicle that can do everything that is legally required, so it is simply not worth making it compliant.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0007.htm_para1">
<p><a name="07121721000106">Let us suppose that the operator is called out to a loaded 44-tonne artic on Muswell Hill. Noble Lords who know Muswell Hill will know that it is pretty steep. He could of course dispatch his 60-tonne vehicle, which would comply in terms of its gross train weight, but, as someone who has operated heavy recovery vehicles and moved abnormal loads, I would be much happier putting the 150-tonner, rather than a vehicle that is just strong enough, on Muswell Hill. I would use the vehicle that is the strongest and safest, not the

The danger we have with the LEZ is some perverse incentives that will make recovery operators not have the full range of vehicles, be unable to use the best vehicle and perhaps unable to use the most efficient vehicle at clearing the obstruction. The operator might say, &#147;Well, I will send this less capable but compliant vehicle out&#148;.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0007.htm_para2">
<p><a name="07121721000107">Most lorries are taxed as goods vehicles; that is what the LEZ scheme is aimed at. They are used intensively for business. Each one emits a large volume of emissions on a weekly basis. Vehicles taxed as private heavy goods vehicles on the other hand are used for very low mileages because they are privately funded. An obvious example is a horse box. I know that owners of horse boxes probably will not be voting for Mr Livingstone in the elections.</p>

It is not worth spending &#163;200 to go there; it is a totally disproportionate cost. Another example is the historic London to Brighton run; again, the problem is that the vehicles cannot go.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000111">During the passage of the Road Safety Bill, the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, was extremely helpful to me when I moved the amendment about the effect of EU regulations on preserved vehicles. This is a similar problem, because I and many others operate preserved lorries and trucks. They are taxed as private heavy goods vehicles, with very low mileage and utilisation. The insurance is only &#163;100 per annum, so we cannot be using them very much or our insurance premiums would be much higher. Yes, of course there is a 1973 exemption for vehicles built earlier than that, but a lot of preserved vehicles are much younger. What tends to happen, for example&#151;which is much better&#151;is that a vehicle is taken out of fleet use for preservation, rather than preserve a complete wreck. We need to preserve our transport heritage. There is a huge vehicle preservation movement in Greater London, and it should be supported not penalised. Of course, these vehicles are based within the LEZ, so what are they to do?</p>

<p><a name="07121721000112">There are similar arguments for vehicles in the taxation class &#147;special vehicles&#148;. Again, these are very low-mileage vehicles, mounting specialist equipment which can often be more valuable than the chassis; again, the cost of complying with the LEZ&#146;s technical requirements is far more than is worth doing to the vehicle.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000115">The London low emissions zone is the responsibility of the Mayor, as noble Lords will know, and has been taken forward on his behalf by Transport for London. The aim of the scheme is to improve air quality for those living in, working in or visiting London, as well as to help London and the UK move closer to achieving national and EU air quality targets by deterring the most individually polluting vehicles from driving in the area. The Government support that aim.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000116">While costs to motorists are of course a concern&#151;I take seriously the emphasis of the noble Earl on the problem of the costs to vehicle owners&#151;Transport for London considers that as private HGVs emit the same level of pollutants per kilometre driven as commercial HGVs, they should not be exempt from the zone. The same applies to the other vehicles mentioned in the amendment.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0007.htm_para8">
<p><a name="07121721000117">Recovery vehicles and special vehicles have similar emissions characteristics to the HGVs and LGVs from which they are derived, and as such Transport for London considers that they should be subject to the same emissions requirements under the London low emission zone. Exemptions could erode the benefits that the London low emission zone seeks to achieve. Transport for London has set up a dedicated inquiry service to help operators to understand what the low emission zone means for them and what they may have to do to comply with the scheme. London charging authorities already have the powers to exempt from charging schemes those vehicles they deem appropriate, so that exemption power is there. As with all charging schemes, TfL will keep the scheme under review and will make any appropriate amendments to the scheme design if and when it deems them necessary. Given that explanation, I ask the noble Earl to withdraw his amendment.</p>

The Minister said that private HGVs emit as much per kilometre as HGVs taxed as goods vehicles. I have to be honest and say that the vehicles that I am talking about probably emit slightly more, and maybe in some cases considerably more, because we are talking about quite old vehicles.

<a name="71217-gc0007.htm_para15">
<p><a name="07121721000126">Under the Government of Wales Act 2006, the Welsh Assembly can acquire legislative competence in areas defined in Schedule 5 to the Act. In such areas, the Assembly is effectively a Parliament and can make measures which supplement, amend or repeal any existing Act of Parliament or any subordinate legislation. There are two ways to acquire legislative competence. One is through the legislative competence order, or LCO, procedure, by which the Assembly requests that a matter be added to its legislative competence. The Secretary of State lays a draft order in Parliament. If both Houses approve it the measure is added. Although complicated, we on this side broadly support this process.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0007.htm_para16">
<p><a name="07121721000127">The other is through the direct addition of matters to the schedule through primary legislation. Broadly speaking, we disapprove of this process for three reasons: first, a provision on Wales in a broader Bill may not be adequately scrutinised, especially if the Bill is timetabled in the Commons. Secondly, it involves the transfer of powers that the Assembly has not requested. Thirdly, we suspect a trend in which departments transfer competence rather than draft legislation applicable to Wales for reasons of administrative convenience.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0007.htm_para17">
<p><a name="07121721000128">With regard to the Local Transport Bill, we are concerned that the power transferred appears to have been requested privately by Welsh Ministers and not by the Assembly as a whole. Ministers have not said how or even whether they intend to use these powers. The powers would allow for a Wales-wide system of road charging. At present, Welsh Ministers can only levy charges on trunk roads to support local road pricing schemes at the request of local authorities. We support this limited, localist level of road charging. However, UK Ministers have rejected the notion of nationwide road pricing under considerable pressure from the Conservatives&#151;this side of the House.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0007.htm_para18">

This would be a profound constitutional move as the Assembly, unlike the Scottish Parliament, has no power of taxation. As the only real means of revenue raising, this could mean that road pricing would provide a cash cow for the Assembly. We do not want that, do we?</p>

<a name="71217-gc0007.htm_para19">
<p><a name="07121721000130">The money is only hypothecated to transport, not, as Peter Hain appeared to suggest in the other place, for the maintenance of roads or the funding of new relief roads. In extremis, and this may be dreamlike, it could be used to fund the Welsh Ministers&#146; drivers. Moreover, this limited degree of hypothecation will allow the Assembly to slash what it currently provides from the block grant for transport purposes and use that money elsewhere. Effectively, therefore, the hypothecation would not stop the Clause 109 powers being used as a form of general revenue raising. I repeat, we see this clause as a tax-raising power and believe that it should not be here.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0007.htm_para20">
<p><a name="07121721000131">We are not anti-devolution per se, but we are against the way in which the powers in Clause 109 are framed&#151;its vagueness, its constitutional aspects and its ability to be used to impose an unwanted road charging system on Welsh drivers, farmers, hauliers, tourists et al.

But I know of no proposals to instigate road pricing there. I was however relieved to hear the noble Lord say that the Conservatives were not opposed to devolution per se, which I am sure will be a great relief to his Conservative friends in Cardiff Bay. But I have to warn him that his arguments at Second Reading&#151;I apologise for not being able to attend&#151;can be seen as constitutionally difficult, if not negative.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000133">The noble Lord has carefully set out how the Assembly and Welsh Ministers achieve powers under the Government of Wales Act 2006. As we have heard, there are two routes: that is, the route of the proposed order which, when it comes to Parliament, is a draft order, the so-called legislative competence order, and the route of framework powers. There is nothing new in establishing devolution by framework powers. What is different here is that we are going into a new field where the National Assembly has powers of legislation through measures, but the route&#151;whether it is the route of the order in council or the route of the framework power&#151;ends up in the same way. It produces measures.</p>

To argue that the Welsh Ministers and the Government in Cardiff should not have powers of road pricing, or the potential to produce measures for road pricing, is to argue that a very important tool in the armoury of environmental management of traffic congestion as part of the overall transport planning of Welsh Ministers should not be available to them.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0007.htm_para23">
<p><a name="07121721000135">There is a further argument. There will be a full opportunity for the noble Lord&#146;s Conservative colleagues to scrutinise any measures that will emerge as a result of these framework powers were they to be transferred. I would encourage them to do that when the time comes, but it is there that that should happen. The measures and the results of the transfer of framework powers are for the National Assembly Members, the Ministers or individual Members to propose, and for those who are opposed, to argue. That scrutiny happens there.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0007.htm_para24">
<p><a name="07121721000136">The noble Lord says that there is insufficient scrutiny of the transfer of framework powers, but there is scrutiny in three Assemblies&#151;in the two Houses of Parliament and in the National Assembly&#151;for every one of those things. There is scrutiny of the framework powers as they are developed in UK legislation, and there is scrutiny of the measures in detail when they appear in that form in Cardiff. Therefore, this is not a transfer of competence by default. It is certainly not a taxation power; it is an environmental management power. The idea that tourists to Wales would become indirect taxation payers through the imposition of a heavy congestion charge is totally to confuse the issue. I would advise the noble Lord to consult his colleagues in Cardiff Bay more carefully before Report.</p>

The Government have made it clear that they will draft parliamentary Bills in a way that gives the Assembly wider and more permissive powers to determine the detail of how the provisions should be implemented in Wales. In 2005, we made that clear in a White Paper.</p>

It is a very useful document, and a very helpful practice for Members of your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000142">Welsh Ministers have yet to decide what role, if any, road charging may play in addressing current and future transport challenges. They do, however, wish to have the powers available that would allow the Assembly to adopt a coherent approach towards any road-pricing proposals, or indeed any future UK scheme, that local authorities in Wales may bring forward at any time in the future. These powers are entirely consistent with the further development of a devolution settlement in line with the Government of Wales Act 2006. Clause 109 simply devolves the issue to Wales. The issue has already been devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000143">The Bill does not provide powers to implement a road-pricing scheme on all roads in Wales. That very important point should offer the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, some reassurance. We are not talking about powers to implement a road-pricing scheme on all roads in Wales. New primary legislation would be required to impose pricing on local authority roads, which make up 95 per cent of the road network  in Wales.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000144">Furthermore, Welsh Ministers have made it clear that if they were to take forward a trunk road pricing scheme, it would be focused on the most heavily congested parts of the network, as one would expect. This provision covers most aspects of a trunk road charging scheme. The only exception&#151;and this is for completeness in discussing this clause&#151;is the ability to make provision about traffic signs, apart from placing and maintaining signs. For safety reasons, it is appropriate for UK Government Ministers to prescribe and authorise traffic signs. They are therefore not covered by Clause 109.</p>

This little nugget has come up a few times, so I thought it would be worth addressing it. As I have said, the Welsh Assembly Government do intend scheme proceeds to be applied in the implementation of strategic transport policy, transport services and the transport-related infrastructure.

<p><a name="07121721000147">It is inconceivable that the Welsh Assembly Government would spend any charging scheme revenue on frivolous items or for self-serving purposes. They are elected and accountable to the people of Wales, and any purported unusual application of scheme revenues unrelated to transport would fall outside the scope of the power and would be ultra vires. I hope that that offers the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, some reassurance. To be absolutely clear for the record, these framework powers were requested by the Welsh Assembly Government. There was a debate in the Assembly on 4 December. I have read the transcript, and it was a very good debate.</p>

It is badly drafted, and does not make clear the restrictions that there should be. It is also interesting that the Minister has said that part of the Government&#146;s plan is to enhance the legislative powers of the Assembly. That is fine. That is the Government&#146;s business, if that is how they want to go. However, we are there to contradict that.

The Local Transport Bill is an opportunity that has come about because of the UK Government&#146;s programme. It is a question of where the initiative started. The initiative began with the UK Government, and Welsh Ministers have seen an opportunity to promote the concepts of devolution through the Bill. As the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, pointed out, the end product, if the Welsh Assembly decided to go that way, would be Welsh matters. There are two routes to get there. There is nothing more complicated about it than where the initiation of the process comes; the end product would be the same.</p>

However, the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, believes it is as clear as daylight. We have a duty to ensure that any taxes that might be placed on Welsh people are properly scrutinised and treated and are surrounded by the necessary regulations. That is where we are coming from. Certainly, local authorities have powers already, but when the British Government are not prepared to go down the road of a nationwide scheme, I wonder why the Welsh Government would want to do so for a rather poorer community.

There is a class of disabled people for whom using the car is not optional. In particular, blue badge holders cannot be expected not to use their cars for journeys of less than one mile, nor is it likely that they will readily be able to use public transport. Blind and partially sighted people who are not themselves drivers have considerably restricted mobility and may be similarly dependent on the car.

I welcome the guidance that supports the need to consult disabled people. I note that it will no longer be a requirement for the Secretary of State to approve schemes, including details of any exemptions. I also welcome the fact that guidance on exemptions and discounts will be produced. I am concerned that by removing the requirement for Secretary of State approval, local authorities may produce exemption schemes for disabled people that do not meet the needs of all those who, because of their impairment, are unable to use public transport and are reliant on a private car for their mobility, either as a driver or a passenger. For example, in London the exemption from the congestion charge is based on the possession of a blue

<p><a name="07121721000159">I welcome the assurance from the Minister, Rosie Winterton, in a letter to the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association that the Government will take stakeholders&#146; views into account and that local authorities introducing road user charging will be subject to the provisions of disability discrimination legislation. However, Durham city has already introduced a scheme without exemptions for disabled people&#151;I understand that another is planned in Cambridge&#151;and with the removal of the Secretary of State&#146;s approval for road charging schemes, it will be even harder to enforce good practice if there are no regulations specifying minimum exemptions for disabled people.

<p><a name="07121721000160"><b><a name="71217-gc0008.htm_spnew2"><a name="07121721000263">Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Low, for his explanation of the purpose and thinking behind the amendment. As  the noble Lord has said, the Transport Act 2000 provides the appropriate national authority with the ability to set regulations on exemptions and discounts, and on limiting the charges that local authorities are able to introduce. At this time, we do not think it appropriate to change the legislation to compel the appropriate national authority to make regulations. I shall set out briefly why that is the case.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0008.htm_para7">
<p><a name="07121721000161">On limiting the charges that local authorities are able to introduce, we believe that it is right for the local authority to propose its own charge level. After careful modelling of the congestion problem, an authority will be best placed to set the charge level that is most appropriate for tackling the problems in its local area. We would not want to set an arbitrary price for all schemes across the country when there is a need for difference, which will depend on location, scheme design and scheme objectives. Exemptions and discounts from local road pricing schemes are, in the first instance, a matter for the local authorities considering introducing such schemes. We have been clear to those authorities bidding for transport innovation fund money that pricing structures should be justified against the objectives of the scheme, and that the impacts on congestion and value for money should be understood.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0008.htm_para8">
<p><a name="07121721000162">As part of any stakeholder engagement on a road pricing scheme that a local authority undertakes, it will be important for it to address the exemptions and discounts that a scheme offers. Interested parties will have an opportunity to make their views and any concerns known through the consultation process. It will be especially important for local authorities, as part of the development of a scheme, to assess the impact of the scheme on different groups, including, in particular, those with a disability. In developing local road pricing schemes, local authorities will also wish to ensure that they observe their duties under the

That should ensure that disabled people are not unfairly treated through the introduction of a scheme.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0008.htm_para9">
<p><a name="07121721000163">The Transport Act 2000 already allows for national exemptions. However, we have yet to make decisions on whether, and if so how, we might exercise those powers. It may be more appropriate to issue guidance to local authorities. Section 193 allows the appropriate national authority to issue guidance to charging authorities and the authorities must have regard to it when exercising their functions. This may be a more suitable method of setting out what approach we would expect local authorities to follow.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0008.htm_para10">
<p><a name="07121721000164">The noble Lord, Lord Low, mentioned the need to have a national debate, which I guess is part of what we are doing today. We are very committed to taking into account the views of interested parties as we progress these issues. The department believes that there are a limited number of scheme users where exemptions and discounts might be appropriate. This is an area where we seek to develop consistency and interoperability, and we will take stakeholders&#146; views into account as we progress these issues. We will also be looking at the best way of achieving such aims. That could include issuing guidance on the manner in which exemptions and discounts to a scheme should be administered. We aim to have completed such work well in advance of the introduction of any local road-pricing schemes so that the public and the scheme operator can be clear on what is envisaged. We therefore think it unnecessary to specify in the Bill that the appropriate national authority must make regulations.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0008.htm_para11">
<p><a name="07121721000165">This is a debate we have already had in several different ways. We seek to get the benefit of providing locally for local authorities to shape schemes that they envisage working in their area, and devolving as much of the responsibility for those schemes as possible to them. Of course, we have to accept that this must operate within a framework. What the noble Lord seeks through exemptions may well best be served by having those exemptions exercised and thought through at a local level. That is where people will better understand those issues. That of course means that those exemptions must fall into part of a range of exemptions nationally outlined in general terms. The best way to achieve that end is not through legislation, or at least not by putting it in the Bill, nor by retaining the power as the noble Lord has argued.</p>

For those for whom driving is not optional, this is effectively a tax on disabled people, not a charge on congestion. The Government have recognised as much in the impact assessment on the draft Bill.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0008.htm_para12">
<p><a name="07121721000167">If local road-charging schemes take off, this will be a growing problem. As I said, Durham has already introduced a scheme, so the Minister and his guidance will not be in time to anticipate that. I understand that others are coming up imminently. However, I hear what the Minister says about alternative ways of

I hope that the Minster will keep the matter under review as schemes develop. If it appears to be a growing problem, perhaps the Minister will be prepared to use some of the powers he has referred to in his reply. For the time being, however, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</p>

That is for people with blue badges, and I accept what the noble Lord says about blue badges; that was an interesting point.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0008.htm_para13">
<p><a name="07121721000169">To be fair to Durham, it gave some consideration to these issues. It may be that the noble Lord is right and that consideration should have been somewhat wider, but the fact that it considered the needs of disabled people who might want a parking place actually means that it has given some thought to the general issue of those with a disability who might be affected by the scheme. Clearly, it is for local people to make the case for different ranges of considerations. We certainly expect that those who come forward with a scheme through the Transport Innovation Fund will have done exactly that. We take these issues seriously. Clearly, we want the scheme to be popular, workable, accessible and not adversely impact those who need to have access to areas which those with a disability might.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000175">The noble Earl said: The measures contained within the Bill to allow the DVLA to approach their foreign counterparts for details of drivers who have caused an offence in this country are to be welcomed. Our objection is only to a small part of this clause, which could have very significant implications if allowed to remain. Clause 112(3)(j) allows the Secretary of State to disclose information obtained relating to foreign-registered vehicles to a person whom the Secretary of State is satisfied has reasonable cause for seeking disclosure of the information. I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations 2002, which similarly empowers the DVLA to make available information from the vehicle register to anyone who can demonstrate reasonable cause.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0008.htm_para18">
<p><a name="07121721000176">The present interpretation of &#147;reasonable cause&#148; by the DVLA includes the release of information about a vehicle's keeper to private car park enforcement firms. The Security Industry Authority regulates parking enforcers working on private land by requiring anyone placing a clamp on a vehicle to be trained and licensed, and to pass criminal records checks. Enforcing by ticket rather than clamp means there is no need for staff to have an SIA licence as there is no need to apply a clamp as a means of enforcement. A firm that intends to enforce by issuing tickets can do so by setting up a digital CCTV system to record vehicles entering and leaving a car park; contacting the DVLA to obtain the owner's details of any vehicle they accuse of over-staying, or parking without permission; and issuing a penalty notice by post, often deliberately designed to resemble an official local council penalty notice. As no clamp is placed on the vehicle, there is no need for the firm to employ licensed, criminal-record cleared personnel.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0008.htm_para19">
<p><a name="07121721000177">With minimal overheads, firms can offer their services at zero cost to landlords, potentially undercutting reputable companies which follow the British Parking Association's code of practice and putting them out of business. This business model is only possible because the DVLA makes its records available. It is unacceptable that this problem exists, and that motorists' confidential information can be passed on in this way to an organisation that is not a member of a reputable trade association. It is disappointing that the DVLA regards it as its legal duty to facilitate this. The &#147;reasonable cause&#148; loophole should be closed, and not extended to the provision of information regarding overseas motorists. This again brings me to the point on transparency. With regard to road charging, how are the public to trust the DVLA given its casual approach to privacy? I beg to move.</p>

I am not convinced that the issue he has raised belongs exactly in this clause. Nevertheless, he has raised a topic which has certainly given me great concern in recent weeks; namely, the way in which the DVLA gives information to private companies. Given the amount of anguish that there has been over data protection because of recent events with HMRC, it seems extraordinary that private organisations of all kinds can contact the DVLA and get the home addresses and so on of people who happen to have parked on private land. I wonder about the safeguards in place to ensure what then happens to that data once a private company has the details. I am not convinced this point is in the right place here, but if the Minister is not able to deal with the issue today, we may have to return to it on Report.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0008.htm_para20">
<p><a name="07121721000180">It is worth reminding ourselves about the purpose of the clause, which is to safeguard the rights of the private citizen. For example, if a member of the public is unlucky enough to suffer a &#147;hit and run&#148; involving a foreign-registered vehicle in a car park, the police are unlikely to become involved unless there is some physical injury. If the police were not involved, how else would that person be able to seek justice unless the Secretary of State could disclose information to them? That would be the consequence of accepting this amendment. We need to understand what it would do. Also, citizens currently are able to obtain information from the UK register of vehicles if they can demonstrate they have reasonable cause. However, they do have to demonstrate that they have reasonable cause. It would be inequitable not to allow the same access in relation to foreign-registered vehicles.</p>

<a name="71217-gc0008.htm_para21">
<p><a name="07121721000181">The noble Earl mentioned the operation of certain parking enforcement companies, and I understand why he did so. As a result of the concerns raised two years ago about the operation of the reasonable cause provision, the Government reviewed those provisions in relation to the release of data from the UK vehicle register. As a result, my honourable friend the Minister for Transport announced 14 new measures to protect vehicle keepers from misuse of their information and to provide clear and robust complaint procedures where misuse is alleged, while still allowing those who do have reasonable cause to get the data they need. Those procedures were introduced in October last year and are working well. I assure the noble Earl that those same enhanced procedures would apply to the release of information on foreign-registered vehicles as well.</p>

<p><a name="07121721000182">The department continues to engage with stakeholders on the issue and to work with them to understand their concerns as we develop our thinking on how best to protect privacy, and we work with the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office to ensure that its proposals address privacy concerns and conform in practice with the Data Protection Act. Our guidance to local authorities that seek transport innovation funding on road-pricing schemes encourages scheme operators to offer a range of methods of payment, including options that will allow them to maximise the privacy of personal information.</p>

Can a parking enforcement company get motorists&#146; details in bulk, perhaps by sending a daily CD or by some electronic transfer of data to the DVLA and getting that data back in bulk or on a CD from the DVLA, or does it require an e-mail or specific application for each and every vehicle?

<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"><a name="0712176000091">I have today published a summary of responses received in response to the Government&#146;s stakeholder consultation document <I>Modernising Empty Property Relief</I>, and have placed a copy in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0002.htm_para14">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"><a name="0712176000092">The Government&#146;s proposals for reforms to empty property relief were part of a package of measures introduced in the Budget to help incentivise the efficient use of land, to help increase the supply of commercial property and to reduce costs for businesses. The Government consider that the reforms provide a strong incentive for owners to reuse, relet or redevelop their empty shops, offices and factory buildings, and so improve access to property and reduce rents for businesses. The Rating (Empty Properties) Act 2007, which received Royal Assent on 19 July, gave effect to these reforms, and set a revised empty property rate of 100 per cent of the basic occupied rate.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"><a name="0712176000093">Having considered the responses received to our consultation document, I can confirm that the Government will now take forward a number of additional measures.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"><a name="0712176000094">The consultation document sought views on whether the existing permanent exemption from empty property rates available to listed buildings and those with a statutory protection should continue, or whether it should be varied. I have concluded that, on the available evidence, there can be a greater degree of work involved in bringing empty listed properties back into beneficial use compared to other properties and that the evidence supports such properties continuing to benefit from an exemption from empty property rates.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0002.htm_para17">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"><a name="0712176000095">I have also concluded that companies in administration should benefit from a permanent exemption from empty property rates. This will bring them into line with companies that are in liquidation and individuals subject to bankruptcy proceedings.

The Rating (Empty Properties) Act 2007 gave the Secretary of State, and the Welsh Ministers, the power to make regulations to tackle any such activity. The consultation document set out a number of options as to how such regulations might be constructed if the Secretary of State were minded to make them.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0002.htm_para19">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"><a name="0712176000097">There was a substantial body of comment about the proposed measures. I have concluded, on the basis of those responses, that the likely incidence of avoidance activity following the introduction of the reforms to empty property relief is low. It would be an extreme step for a property owner to go to the lengths of deliberately vandalising a potentially valuable asset so that it is beyond economic repair. This view was expressed by a number of respondents to the consultation document.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0002.htm_para20">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"><a name="0712176000098">Having taken account of all the responses, I have concluded that the existing circumstances do not warrant the introduction of anti-avoidance regulations at this stage. However, I am clear that, if it appears that there is evidence of measures being taken by owners of empty property to avoid payment of empty property rates, the Government will not hesitate to use their powers. We will work with the Local Government Association, the Valuation Office Agency and the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation to monitor the impact of the reforms and assess whether regulations should be introduced in the future.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_75"><a name="0712176000108">The Prime Minister announced last week that the Government would make a statement on the review of pension scheme assets undertaken by Andrew Young.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"><a name="0712176000109">Andrew Young&#146;s report is published today and I am very pleased that we are able to announce a settlement that helps the 130,000 people already eligible for FAS and an additional 11,000 people in some schemes with solvent employers. These have suffered losses, through no fault of their own, as a result of their pension schemes winding up underfunded between 1 January 1997 and 5 April 2005, before the introduction of the Pension Protection Fund.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0002.htm_para29">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"><a name="0712176000110">In his interim report published in July, Andrew Young identified that there was approximately &#163;1.7 billion in assets in affected pension schemes that had not been used for annuity purchase.

This will be subject to a cap of &#163;26,000, the value of which will be protected.Payment of assistance derived from post-1997 service will be increased in line with inflation (subject to the normal rules). Assistance will be paid from the scheme&#146;s normal retirement age, subject to a lower age limit of 60. People who are unable to work due to ill health will also be able to apply for early access to their payments from the age of 60, subject to actuarial reduction.<sup>3</sup>Where their share of scheme funds allows, members will be able to commute some portion of their pension to a lump sum<sup>4</sup>.Assistance will be extended to members of schemes which wound up underfunded (after 1 January 1997 and before the employer was required to meet the full buy-out cost) where the employer is still solvent.

<a name="71217-wms0003.htm_para6">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_101"><a name="0712176000137">The Government set out their vision for postal services in the UK in their 1999 White Paper <I>Post Office Reform: A World Class Service </I><I>f</I><I>or </I><I>t</I><I>he 21st Century</I> and took this forward in the Postal Services Act 2000. The Act had as its prime objective the maintenance of the universal postal service. It was designed to provide both social and business consumers with a more efficient and effective postal service through the introduction of competition and greater commercial freedoms for the Royal Mail to operate within a fully liberalised market while maintaining the provision of the universal postal service. We remain committed to this vision.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0003.htm_para7">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_102"><a name="0712176000138">It is now seven years since the Act passed through Parliament and there have been significant developments since then.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0003.htm_para8">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_103"><a name="0712176000139">The postal services market was fully liberalised by Postcomm nearly two years ago on 1 January 2006. The Government believe that this has brought considerable benefits for the users of postal services. Royal Mail has, through the efforts of management and postmen and women up and down the country, significantly improved its performance, delivering quality of service levels that in the last full year were at record breaking levels. New market entrants are providing increasing choice for consumers and pushing innovation in the industry.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0003.htm_para9">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_104"><a name="0712176000140">The Government have demonstrated their commitment to seeing Royal Mail compete effectively in this new market place through an unprecedented level of additional investment&#151;&#163;2.1 billion in 2007&#151;to enable the company to modernise. The result of the recent ballot on pay and modernisation means that management and staff have given the Royal Mail a mandate for modernisation.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0003.htm_para10">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_105"><a name="0712176000141">It has become clear that the market conditions for all postal service operators are challenging, with growing evidence of e-substitution and more sophisticated use of mobile communication. Postcomm's Strategy Review, <I>Postal Market 2010 and Beyond&#151;Emerging Themes</I>, published in August 2007 noted that the postal market is changing and that they expected market volumes to decline. The European Union, supported by the British Government, recently set a clear timetable for a fully liberalised European postal services market by the end of 2010.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_736"><a name="0712176000779">The Government announced a major package of reforms to the business tax system in Budget 2007. These reforms will enhance the international competitiveness of the UK by encouraging investment, promoting innovation and ensuring fairness across the tax system.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0004.htm_para12">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_737"><a name="0712176000780">The package announced a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax to 28 per cent from 2008, making it the lowest in the G7 and below the OECD and EU15 average. It included reforms to deliver a simpler, two-rate system of capital allowances, to ensure that the tax system better reflects the economic depreciation of capital assets. The package also included the introduction of a new annual investment allowance of &#163;50,000 for all businesses, to promote investment, particularly by smaller firms. This will allow 95 per cent of businesses to write off all of their investment, excluding expenditure on cars, in the year in which it is made.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0004.htm_para14">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_739"><a name="0712176000782">The Government are today publishing a technical note including draft legislation on these changes, reflecting the support of the majority of respondents to this consultation for the Government's proposals.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_740"><a name="0712176000783">This technical note announces the Government's intention to extend the provision that allows capital allowances to be claimed on thermal insulation added to existing industrial buildings to all commercial buildings, at a rate of 10 per cent, in line with the Government's approach to environmentally beneficial features integral to buildings.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_18">
<a name="0712176000787"><b><a name="71217-wms0004.htm_spnew1"><a name="0712176000853">Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My right honourable friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Andy Burnham) has made the following Written Statement.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0004.htm_para19">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_744"><a name="0712176000788">Following representations by political parties in Northern Ireland, the Government commissioned Sir David Varney in March 2007 to carry out a review of tax policy in Northern Ireland. His terms of reference were to examine &#147;how current and future tax policy, including the tax changes announced in the Budget 2007, can support the sustainable growth of businesses and long-term investment in Northern Ireland&#148;. The review has been published today and has been deposited in the Library of the House. I am very grateful to Sir David Varney and his team, and to all those who submitted evidence to the review. Sir David's report provides a valuable assessment not only of business tax issues for Northern Ireland but also of how the opportunities and challenges facing the devolved Administration in developing an investment strategy might best be approached. The Government are fully committed to supporting the Northern Ireland Executive in implementing such a strategy.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0004.htm_para20">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_745"><a name="0712176000789">The Government recognise that, in developing their economic investment strategy, the question of business tax levels in the UK is a particularly important issue for the Executive. I am therefore particularly grateful to Sir David and his team for the considerable depth in which this issue is analysed and explored in the report.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0004.htm_para21">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_746"><a name="0712176000790">He concludes that a policy of a preferential corporation tax rate for Northern Ireland, as compared to the rest of the UK, does not offer the best way forward for building a strong investment strategy for Northern Ireland. He is not convinced that a cut would represent good value for money. In particular, the role of supply side factors needed to be paid due attention, and caution taken on the responsiveness of investment to a cut in the rate.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0004.htm_para22">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_747"><a name="0712176000791">The review examines the tax position in Northern Ireland, in both its international context and in comparison with the Republic of Ireland. It finds that the UK compares favourably with its G7 partners in terms of corporate tax levels. It also finds that the UK has a lower rate of tax than the Republic in areas such as VAT and the top rate of income tax, and offers more generous R and D tax credits and tax relief on dividends.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0004.htm_para23">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_748"><a name="0712176000792">The review recommends a strategy to develop private sector investment in Northern Ireland based on maximising the benefits of the competitive advantages that already exist in Northern Ireland, including current financial investment incentives, and realising the potential further to improve this competitive advantage.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0004.htm_para24">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_749"><a name="0712176000793">The report notes that for many years the Northern Ireland economy has been over-reliant on public sector investment for its growth but that political progress over the past 10 years to end conflict and to transform Northern Ireland to a peaceful, stable society has already helped attract inward private sector investment. The restoration of devolution on 8 May is a major turning point and incentive for such further inward investment.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS91"><b>17 Dec 2007 : Column WS91</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71217-wms0004.htm_para25">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_750"><a name="0712176000794">The report identifies Northern Ireland's key competitive advantages as including:</p>
operating costs which are highly competitive and significantly lower than in the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland;a well developed telecoms infrastructure providing important benefits for business;one of the youngest populations in Europe and high educational achievements; andattractive financial incentives, recruitment and training, research and development and other development support tailored to each company's needs.
<a name="71217-wms0004.htm_para26">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_751"><a name="0712176000795">The report recommends that these advantages can be maximised by a strategy to:</p>
further improve basic and technical skills and retaining the best and the brightest;tackle the size of the public sector and efficiency of the administration;foster innovation through better university and business collaborations; andprioritise trade and investment promotion across government, including working links between Invest Northern Ireland, the Irish Investment and Development Agency and UK Trade and Investment.
<a name="71217-wms0004.htm_para27">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_752"><a name="0712176000796">In short, Sir David Varney's report found that the conditions for economic success for Northern Ireland are more than a matter of tax incentives. There are lessons in terms of improving labour force participation, basic skills, and efficiency and organisation in the public sector; and Northern Ireland needs to move towards the execution of a strategy focussed on business and economic development.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0004.htm_para28">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_753"><a name="0712176000797">In the light of Sir David Varney's report, the Government are working with the Executive to:</p>
strengthen trade and investment promotion by UK Trade and Investment reviewing with Invest Northern Ireland the scope for better marketing of Northern Ireland to higher value-added FDI; andpromote closer working between the UK Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government to promote a coherent overall science strategy, including considering the suggestion of creating &#147;science cities&#148;.
<a name="71217-wms0004.htm_para29">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_754"><a name="0712176000798">This will build on the May 2007 settlement, elements of which specifically focus on issues highlighted in the review as key to a sound and forward-looking investment strategy:</p>
an innovation fund focusing particularly on levering in private sector investment and promoting collaborative research. This includes matched funding of &#163;36 million from the Irish Government targeted specifically on collaborative research and development;a new Northern Ireland corporate tax office to promote the competitive tax position;a local employment partnership that will help create 5,000 jobs for the unemployed in Northern Ireland between five leading employers in the retail sector. The expansion of this initiative to other sectors,

<a name="71217-wms0004.htm_para30">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_755"><a name="0712176000799">The Northern Ireland Executive has put growing the economy at the top of its priorities. This is reflected in the draft programme for Government which was published on 25 October 2007, along with a draft investment strategy and draft budget for 2008-11. I welcome the strategy that this programme sets for building economic success to benefit all communities in Northern Ireland, including the good progress that is being made towards the planned US inward investment conference next year.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0004.htm_para31">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_756"><a name="0712176000800">I have discussed the report and next steps with the executive and I am today announcing that Sir David Varney has agreed to carry out a further review building on his first review and focusing on identifying policies and incentives for strengthening and sustaining private sector growth, investment and employment in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="71217-wms0004.htm_para32">
<p><a name="wms_stpa_757"><a name="0712176000801">Against that background and the desire of the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to work in partnership to create the conditions for sustained economic growth and increased employment opportunities for all, the terms of reference for the second review are:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0712176000834">&#147;In the light of Sir David Varney's review of tax policy in Northern Ireland, published on 17 December and the Northern Ireland Executive's draft Programme for Government and draft Budget published in October 2007, Sir David Varney will undertake a second review. Building on Sir David's earlier analysis and agreement from all parties about the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland (in relation to the opportunities provided by the peace process, the need to strengthen the private sector, to create increased employment opportunities and to reform the public sector) this review will explore in more detail how to expand the private sector and to enhance Northern Ireland's competitiveness. In this context, the review will look at incentives for supporting the sustainable growth of businesses, investment and employment in Northern Ireland and the implications for reducing the historic dependency on the public sector. This will include examination of incentives for growth in Northern Ireland that fall within the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government. Sir David will aim to report in good time for the US investment conference. He will be supported by a small secretariat and will receive direct and regular input from Northern Ireland Executive officials&#148;.</p>
