<a name="60109-01_head0"></a><h3 align=center>EU Budget Reform</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spopq0"></a><b>Lord Dykes  </b> asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What further steps they propose to take in connection with the reform of the European Union budget.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  My Lords, the agreement reached at the European Council in December 2005 on EU funding for the period 2007&#150;13 asks the Commission to undertake a full, wide-ranging review covering all aspects of EU spending, including the CAP, and of resources including the UK rebate, to report in 2008&#150;09. That review will then be given consideration by the Council. The UK fully supports the review and is committed to ensuring that it delivers real reform of the EU budget.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dykes: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that detailed Answer, but was it none the less a colossal mistake by HMG to go on in recent years about being the fourth richest country in the world, and at the same time to insist on our unique and long-standing rebate being fully maintained unless there was a considerable reduction in agricultural support for the eight new central European members? How will the Government now repair the damage with those countries, as there is still smouldering resentment about what happened in those negotiations, which did not go very well all the way through the six-month period? What will now be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_2"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

done? What will the Government&#039;s attitude be to those countries? What other things can HMG offer on a bilateral basis?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I regret so early in the new year to disagree so profoundly with the comment that has been made, but the fact was that there was a very tough negotiation, with 27 different countries, each with our own interests, and pursuing those interests with a great deal of vigour.
</p>

<a name="60109-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>We should look at what the Prime Ministers of those countries have said. The Hungarian Prime Minister said that it was an EU success, which he attributed to the United Kingdom. The Czech Prime Minister said that it was a worthwhile proposal that would bring big money to his republic. The Slovak Prime Minister said the result was better than he had hoped for. I could run through the lot, but I shall not.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spnew2"></a><b> Noble Lords: </b>   Oh!
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I shall not, despite the encouragement. What I do say is that, for a group of aggrieved people, they seem in remarkably perky spirits.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </b>   My Lords, what steps will the Government take to ensure that when the review is conducted by the Commission, the Commission does not on this occasion smother the radical and interesting ideas that were put forward on the last occasion by Professor Sapir, which never got to the table of the Council at all? Does the noble Lord agree that it really is important to get a wide debate going, well ahead of 2008, about not only reforming the CAP, but finding ways through co-financing to reduce the burden that the CAP puts on the budget?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I strongly agree that the earlier the debate gets going, the better it will be. Co-financing is one of the options that needs thorough discussion and must be examined as part of the review. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_3"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 3</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

If co-financing were to be introduced, it would have to be done in a way that ensured there was no increase in the total public spending in the EU&#151;that is, of the EU plus the national budgets&#151;and any move towards co-financing should also not stand in the way of further reform. That reform is plainly necessary, and all these ideas must be explored.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, continuing the spirit of new year agreement, would the Minister agree&#151;as I think most people would&#151;that the last six months of the British presidency was a sadly missed opportunity to get hold of serious reform of the budget? Under the new deal agreed before Christmas, which the Minister has already mentioned, the UK will pay the EU an average of &#163;10.5 billion a year&#151;that is, even after the reduced rate&#151;and then it will get back &#163;4.5 billion a year in EU spending, so the average net contribution between now and 2013 will be an increase each year of &#163;2.5 billion above what we were paying before. Is that right and, if so, what cuts in public services will we make to meet that sum?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I anticipate no cuts in public spending at all. There has always been provision&#151;the provision can be reflected in the fiscal statements made by the Chancellor&#151;for the costs of enlargement. These were never going to be inexpensive. The UK&#039;s net contribution will increase by 63 per cent over the 2007&#150;13 period, compared with 2000&#150;06; that is the cost of enlargement. But all the wealthy countries are contributing. France&#039;s net contribution, for example, will go up by 124 per cent, Italy&#039;s will increase by 126 per cent. All of them see the benefits of a massively enlarged European Union and market.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Marsh: </b>   My Lords&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend accept&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Marsh: </b>   Happy new year.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   Happy new year to you as well. Does my noble friend accept that it would be realistic to recognise that when there are 27 member states, the chance of getting an agreement on anything is pretty remote, particularly in relation to the budget? Is he prepared to say that our policy basically would also be realistic in recognising that we will need to compromise on almost any deal that is possible?
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, that is the very nature of negotiations. As I said, negotiating with 27 players was always going to be a difficult matter. May I draw the House&#039;s attention to the fact that two of the four financial perspectives that have been agreed have been agreed under United Kingdom presidencies after very long negotiations with European partners, whatever the size of the European Union? We have benefited in that we have been prepared to open our markets and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_4"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 4</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

do the deals which go alongside enlargement without some of the fears that you see expressed elsewhere. It is hard to find a Paris newspaper that does not express deep alarm at the presence of a Polish plumber. We do not experience that difficulty in reaching agreements with our partners.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Blackwell: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that up until December the policy of the Government was to seek to redistribute structural funds from the richer countries to the poorer countries rather than to increase the budget and increase contributions? Is that still the case and is the Minister satisfied with the December outcome?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, we said very early on in the negotiations that we were looking for a 1 per cent budget. We ended up with a 1.04 per cent budget. That largely accounts for the additional money. That was considerably below the Luxembourg proposal and very much below the European Commissioners&#039; proposal. What we are seeing is a fair balance at the end of a negotiation. Of course, it is not the same figure as at the beginning of a negotiation and, of course, the discussions were tough&#151;that is the nature of negotiation. People strike positions, they argue about them and they get an outcome.

<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="60109-01_time0"></a><h5>2.44 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Dubs </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Whether they will now consider granting a pardon to the troops serving in the British Armed Forces who were shot for alleged cowardice and desertion during the First World War.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60109-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  My Lords, when he was Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Dr John Reid undertook a very careful and thorough review of the execution of soldiers during the First World War. He concluded that, regrettably, so long after the events, the evidence which survives on the individual cases does not provide a sufficient basis for the Secretary of State to recommend a pardon for most, and possibly all, of these men.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60109-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dubs: </b>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer. Does he agree, first, that Secretaries of State can make mistakes? Secondly, does he agree that we are talking about some 306 men, of whom 26 were Irish, who were shot for offences for which they would not even have been punished in today&#039;s climate of opinion about medical psychiatry? Will he confirm that the New Zealand Government unilaterally gave their people a pardon? Will he also confirm that the Irish Government have made a plea to the British Government&#151;so far unanswered&#151;as to the fate of the 26 men for whom they want pardons? Is it not time for the Government to think again?
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend has asked a number of questions; if I may, I will pass on the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_5"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 5</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

question of whether Secretaries of State can make mistakes. My noble friend is correct that the New Zealand Government have passed an Act granting a pardon to servicemen from New Zealand. It is a question of whether there is a legal basis for such pardons. The department has looked incredibly thoroughly at this matter. The review that was undertaken in 1998, led by Dr John Reid, looked at this very carefully indeed, and no legal basis was found for such pardons.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Maclennan of Rogart: </b>   My Lords, is not the basis of the Government&#039;s conclusions unacceptable, in that whatever the legal position may be there is a moral revulsion against what happened that pervades the whole country&#039;s view of those episodes? It is time to stop looking for evidence in particular cases and to recognise after the event that the people who are still most suffering from what happened are the families, and they will not understand this legalistic approach.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, I understand and appreciate the comments that the noble Lord has made, and I fully understand the concerns that people have on this matter. The soldiers were victims of a terrible war, and we express our deepest sympathy to their families and our deepest regret for their loss of life. However, a pardon is a legal matter, and no legal basis has been found for the granting of such a pardon. None the less, everything has been done short of the granting of a legal pardon to meet the concerns that naturally exist. Recognising that the men were victims, they have now been publicly recognised and their names have been added to the books of remembrance to be remembered as victims of that war.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   My Lords, will the noble Lord answer the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, concerning the Irish 26 and the Irish Government&#039;s request?
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, we are studying the report from the Irish Foreign Minister that seeks pardons for 26 Irish soldiers, and we are keeping the Irish Government informed, through the Foreign Office, of the progress that we have made with the reply. We will discuss the contents of the response with the Irish Government before we issue any formal public statement, and we are looking for a constructive way forward.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend&#039;s response seems to be that we would do it if we could find a way to do it. If the New Zealanders have found a way to do it, why cannot we do so?
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend raises the point relating to New Zealand. A new Act was passed by the New Zealand Government. In our case, the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_6"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 6</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

House will recognise that we have looked thoroughly for a legal solution to this matter, and we have not found such a legal solution to provide a pardon.

</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, were the New Zealanders part of the 300-odd figure that he mentioned, or were they not classified as British Armed Forces? What was the position of those from other Commonwealth countries such as Canada and Australia?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, the New Zealand soldiers were among the 306 whom I mentioned. Other countries, such as Canada, have not issued pardons to their servicemen.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Tordoff: </b>   My Lords, is this not an occasion on which perhaps the Prime Minister should use his well vaunted Royal prerogative to grant pardon to these people?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, the Prime Minister does not have a Royal prerogative in the way in which the noble Lord suggests.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spnew13"></a><b> Baroness Trumpington: </b>   My Lords, is not the Minister playing with words when he says that the issue is a legal matter? Surely other words have been changed from a legal point of view without so much as a cry in the wind or any fuss. As I said, I think that he is playing with words.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Drayson: </b>   My Lords, I assure the House that I am not playing with words. I express to the House my sincerest concern about the matter, but the granting of legal pardons must be based on legal process and must be done in a way that does not in itself create a new legal injustice. In many cases, the evidence relating to the courts martial no longer exists due to damage that was done during the Second World War. We do not have the information to enable us to find a legal basis on which to grant legal pardons.

<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Berkeley </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>What progress has been made in prohibiting through vehicular traffic across Old Palace Yard to improve the security of the Parliamentary Estate and road safety.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My Lords, the installation of Corus steel barriers around the Clock Tower and through Old Palace Yard has already increased the security of the Parliamentary Estate. Ongoing studies are assessing the potential effects of various traffic and environmental enhancement schemes in the area. We are working in partnership with outside agencies and affected parties to ensure that security is fully taken into account in decisions affecting the area around the Parliamentary Estate, including Old Palace Yard.
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spnew20"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for that full Answer. I accept that the new steel barriers improve security around the Parliamentary Estate, but does she agree that they have increased danger for road users, in particular cyclists, and reduced space for pedestrians? Is there not an argument for banning road vehicle through traffic completely from Old Palace Yard and for implementing the second phase of the world squares project, which has been so successful in Trafalgar Square?
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="60109-02_spnew21"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, I know that there has been a great deal of concern over the implications of the work that has been done outside Parliament. I have checked specifically not only with the House authorities but with others about risk to cyclists and, particularly, pedestrians. I can report that Westminster City Council conducted a full safety audit after the construction of the barriers and a number of its recommendations have been put in place, including extra signage, special lines on the lanes and additional markings on the barriers. We will continue to keep the matter under review. I ask Members to report any problems that they experience to the House authorities.
</p>

<a name="60109-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>My noble friend&#039;s second question concerned the world squares initiative. A report is in preparation and will be published later this year, following which there will be a consultation. However, any proposals in the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60109-02_spnew22"></a><b> Lord Campbell-Savours: </b>   My Lords, will my noble friend firmly resist calls to close Old Palace Yard to traffic, if only because it is where, under the new arrangements, taxis have access from the west of London along the embankment that otherwise would have to go round the whole square?

<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="60109-03_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, it is important that the House understands that these decisions would initially be taken by the House Committee, having been briefed on security matters, and would then come to the House itself. There are a number of interested parties in this, including the residents, road users and workers in this area. Of course we need to look at the balance between safety and security, but Members of this House have all expressed their view in the past that Parliament needs to be as accessible as possible. We do not want to make it impossible for members of the public to come to this building.

This seems to have been the most leisurely project ever. We are now told that we are to have a report, and that it will be a long time before anything can happen. What can be done to make this a much less leisurely way forward? Is it possible to have a world square without a world squares project or a world squares initiative?
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="60109-03_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, noble Lords will know that this is an initiative by the Greater London Authority, the first phase of which is what has happened in Trafalgar Square. Proposals have been made with respect to Parliament Square. A report is being undertaken and will be published later this year. There are a range of interested parties&#151;not just the Greater London Authority, but Westminster City Council, the Metropolitan Police, ourselves, the public, tourists, and the people who live in the area. This is not something for the House unilaterally to decide on, and we are discussing it only as a result of the decision of the GLA to have a world squares initiative in the first place.

<a name="60109-03_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, no accidents have taken place, but I and other Members of this House are concerned about pedestrians. We are in a slightly difficult position. As the traffic moves relatively slowly through the control lane, pedestrians feel more secure, which is why they wander across the control lane to take photographs and use the barriers to open their maps to see whether they are in the right place. We shall have to keep an eye on that. We are thinking of putting up more notices, for example, but I think that pedestrians are claiming that space for themselves.

<p><a name="qn_3"></a>
<a name="60109-03_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_3"></a>Whether they will introduce legislation to provide opportunities for legislative scrutiny in the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly comparable to those in the United Kingdom Parliament.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="60109-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, we have no plans to introduce legislation to provide for scrutiny in the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly to be comparable to that at Westminster. While the systems of legislative scrutiny differ between all three legislatures, each system is capable of providing sufficient breadth and depth to ensure effective scrutiny of the legislation in hand.
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="60109-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Llandudno: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. Are the Government satisfied that there are sufficient provisions to ensure that devolved matters, such as health and education, are scrutinised adequately by the Assembly? Only 46 or 47 Members of the 60-Member Assembly are not in government, which is not enough to ensure that there is sufficient scrutiny. Will the Government consider increasing the number from 60 to 80?
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="60109-03_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, the National Assembly for Wales already has strong <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_10"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 10</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

scrutiny procedures and the Government of Wales Bill, which is being debated in the other place today, will ensure that legislation is thoroughly scrutinised when the Assembly acquires legislative powers. At a minimum the Assembly&#039;s new standing orders will make provision for scrutiny on the principle, detail and final text of legislation put before the Assembly.
</p>

<a name="60109-03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>Crucially, the Assembly, in considering the White Paper <i>Better Governance for Wales</i> made no recommendation on increasing the number of Assembly Members. The First Minister, Rhodri Morgan, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;You do not need more Assembly Members, you simply need the existing number of Assembly Members dealing with more important issues which they do not have the ability to do now but they would have the ability to do under the provisions of the White Paper&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="60109-03_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, did the Minister have the opportunity to study the edition of the <i>Scotsman</i> that was published on Christmas Eve? The front page story showed that the total additional cost, over and above the previous cost of establishing and running devolution in Scotland will go over &#163;1 billion in the current quarter? I congratulate the Minister on resisting any temptation to go further down that route.
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="60109-03_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, I wonder how surprised the noble Lord would be if I said that I had read the front page of the <i>Scotsman</i> on Christmas Eve. I wish the noble Lord a happy new year. What I always enjoy about exchanges with the noble Lord is that, whenever Scotland appears on the Order Paper in whatever form, it comes back to a discussion on devolution.
</p>

<a name="60109-03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>It is working well. Scrutiny in Edinburgh is absolutely brilliant. As the noble Lord knows, there are four stages. We have nothing to worry about. We are very, very happy with devolution in Scotland.
</p>




<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="60109-03_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   My Lords, do the present arrangements for the Scottish Parliament include the right of pre-legislative scrutiny?
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="60109-03_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, yes they do.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="60109-03_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Foulkes of Cumnock: </b>   My Lords, scrutiny in the Scottish Parliament is very effective, which is something that this Parliament could well adopt. Does my noble friend agree that there is no need whatever for a House of Lairds?
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="60109-03_spnew19"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, one is perhaps more than enough. I agree with my noble friend that the process of scrutiny at Holyrood is extraordinarily thorough, and it is difficult to see how it could be improved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="60109-03_spnew20"></a><b> Lord Smith of Clifton: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that whatever deficiencies there are in Scotland and Wales, they are as nothing when compared with <br>&nbsp;<br>

the case of Northern Ireland, where Westminster falls down very badly? We have often asked the Government for their suggestions to improve scrutiny because under direct rule it is quite lamentable that Westminster does not give more time to Northern Ireland matters.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="60109-03_spnew21"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful for that comment, which I am sure will be noted by my noble friend Lord Rooker, who is sitting on my right.

<a name="60109-03_spnew22"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, in spite of what we have heard, the commission chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Richard, was critical of the lack of scrutiny in the National Assembly for Wales. It further recommended that there should be a membership of 80 in the National Assembly. Why have we not heard the Government&#039;s arguments against those proposals?

<a name="60109-04_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Richard suggested an increase in number in his report, but, as I said in my opening remarks, it is interesting that the Assembly itself saw no need to recommend an increase in the number of Assembly Members. The Government&#039;s view is that there is capacity for effective scrutiny and it is simply a question of deploying Assembly Members in perhaps a more efficient way.

<a name="60109-04_head0"></a><h3 align=center>National Insurance Contributions Bill</h3>
<a name="time_3"></a>
<a name="60109-04_time0"></a><h5>3.06 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="60109-04_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. It may be helpful if I begin by setting out some of the background to the Bill presently before you, before turning to the details of its provisions. As many of your Lordships will be aware, at the time of the Pre-Budget Report on 2 December 2004, the Government made a statement to the other place. This outlined how, despite the best efforts of successive governments, we continue to be presented with ever more complex and contrived arrangements designed to avoid income tax and national insurance on the rewards from employment. That statement made it clear then that the Government intended to close down this activity permanently.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>That statement mentioned the early attempts at avoidance in this area that took the form of paying bonuses and salaries in gold bullion, diamonds and fine wine. When those routes were closed, employers started to pay bonuses through ever-more sophisticated financial instruments and securities to reduce the amount of national insurance they had to pay, to avoid their obligation to operate PAYE, and to reduce employees&#039; tax bills.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>The tax avoidance disclosure rules introduced in the Finance Act 2004 brought to light a large number&#151;over 100&#151;instances of such schemes being devised or <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_12"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 12</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

marketed by promoters. This showed that a significant minority of employers and their advisers were continuing to devise, operate and market ever more contrived avoidance schemes to disguise what is, in effect, remuneration.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>Our records show that 60 per cent of disclosed employment schemes involve artificially restricted securities. The remaining 40 per cent are fairly evenly split between employee benefit trusts, options and future contracts, exempting income, service companies and other employment products. Only a handful&#151;some 5 per cent&#151;are what we would consider to be other than contrived avoidance schemes.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>That sets out the context in which this Bill is being brought forward. To emphasise this point I would mention to your Lordships that there have been numerous examples of contrived schemes that the present Government have had to contend with since 1997. Examples include contrived schemes involving employee benefit trusts; soft currency loans, such as those denominated in Turkish lira; adjustable options; special purpose vehicles; and artificially restricted shares.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>I do not propose to take up the House&#039;s time with detailed descriptions of these schemes&#151;some of them are very complex indeed. But it is clear that without prompt and decisive action there is a very real possibility of tax and national insurance contributions avoidance schemes continuing, to the detriment of the Exchequer and to the many employers and employees who pay their fair share of tax and national insurance.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>The Government gave notice in December 2004 of their intention to deal with any future arrangements designed to frustrate our intention that employers and employees should pay their fair share of tax and national insurance contributions on the rewards from employment. Where we become aware of arrangements which attempt to frustrate this intention we will introduce legislation to close these down, where necessary with effect from 2 December 2004.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>I emphasise that the Government are resolute about this, and that statement still stands today as strongly as it did when it was made. The Government continue to look closely at what has happened since that date. The Government want employers and their advisers to be in no doubt that, if they continue to avoid their responsibilities or are thinking of doing so in the future, we will not hesitate to introduce further legislation to close down their schemes&#151;if necessary, from an effective date earlier than the announcement of such legislation, potentially from the date of the statement of 2 December 2004.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>As a first step in demonstrating the Government&#039;s commitment to take action, Schedule 2 to the Finance (No. 2) Act 2005 was introduced to strengthen the income tax rules dealing with employment related securities, dating back to 2 December 2004. The Government had already published a draft technical note alongside the Pre-Budget Report in 2004, explaining the proposals, followed by draft legislation in February 2005. Interested parties have therefore <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_13"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 13</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

had an extensive period to scrutinise and comment on the detail of the provisions that were then fully debated in the other place during the Standing Committee stage of that Act.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>The second legislative step demonstrating the Government&#039;s continuing commitment to take action against avoidance is the introduction of this Bill. It is key to achieving the Government&#039;s objectives of fairness and opportunity by ensuring that all pay their fair share of tax and national insurance. It is also an essential element in building a serious and credible deterrent against future avoidance activity.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>The Bill will ensure that the Government can deal with any arrangements that emerge in future that are designed to frustrate its intention that employees and employers should pay the proper amount of tax and national insurance on the rewards of employment. As there is no annual equivalent of the Finance Bill for national insurance, this Bill provides the necessary powers to apply national insurance to payments from these schemes.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>Where the Government become aware of arrangements that attempt to avoid national insurance contributions as well as tax, they will introduce regulations to close them down, where necessary from 2 December 2004. That action will not affect the vast majority of employers and employees who organise their affairs in a straightforward and transparent way. In particular, genuine employee share schemes and share option plans will not be affected. The Bill provides for a power to make regulations in respect of national insurance that take effect on or after 2 December 2004, to reflect backdated tax changes. The power will allow for national insurance liability to be charged from 2 December 2004, if necessary.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>The Bill is needed to extend existing regulation-making powers, and to make it possible to impose a national insurance charge on disguised remuneration that is capable of taking effect from that date. Currently, an NIC liability can usually be charged only from the date of NIC regulations, except in limited circumstances where the regulations can be backdated to the beginning of the tax year in which the regulations are made. This is in contrast to the position for tax legislation, where liability can, if the legislation so provides, be applied back to a date preceding Royal Assent.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>The Bill also allows for consequential changes for the purposes of contributions, contributory benefits and statutory payments to be made where appropriate. For instance, a national insurance charge may be levied back to 2 December 2004, to align with the start date of anti-avoidance tax measures. In this case, the provisions of the Bill, and regulations made under the powers in this Bill, will ensure that those contributions will count for the purposes of contributory benefit and statutory payments.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>The Bill also provides a power to extend to national insurance the avoidance arrangement disclosure rules that currently apply to income tax. Finally, it provides a power to prevent the use of national insurance contribution elections and agreements over shares and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_14"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 14</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

securities that have been targeted by backdated national insurance regulations made under this Bill. That will mean that employers cannot pass on to their employees the national insurance liabilities that they have tried to avoid.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>The provisions in this Bill extend to Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Clauses 1, 3 and 5 are intended to extend to England and Wales and Scotland only; Clauses 2, 4 and 6 are intended to extend to Northern Ireland only; and the remaining provisions of the Bill are intended to extend to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>Your Lordships will of course be concerned to know that the powers provided for in this Bill go only so far as is necessary, and no further. Significantly, the Government have ensured that the Bill also contains important safeguards to ensure that regulations made under the Bill take full account of human rights considerations. This is in addition to the Government&#039;s existing duty to make regulations that are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>The power to make regulations altering liability is restricted to reflecting, so far as is possible, employment remuneration measures in tax legislation&#151;normally via Finance Acts&#151;and is intended only to be used to reflect tax anti-avoidance measures. So where such regulations are made, the other place will already have had the chance to consider any relevant human rights issues on backdated tax legislation during the passage of the relevant Finance Bill or other legislation. Furthermore, to ensure that the regulations under this Bill are subject to parliamentary scrutiny by both Houses, they will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>This Bill also includes a specific provision to ensure that where, for instance, as part of a package of anti-avoidance measures, there is exceptionally a reduction of national insurance liability for past periods, any existing or future benefit entitlement will not be affected.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>The Government are committed to publishing draft regulations under the powers in this Bill a minimum of 12 weeks before they are made so that employers and their representatives have an opportunity to comment on the technical content of any proposed NIC changes. Once this Bill has received Royal Assent, any NIC legislation will have to be laid within 12 months of the corresponding retrospective tax legislation.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>In pursuit of that commitment and to assist in consideration of this Bill, I should mention to your Lordships, if you are not already aware, that draft regulations were published on 14 November in respect of: the first use of the powers in the Bill to backdate national insurance liability to reflect the employment-related securities anti-avoidance provisions in Schedule 2 to the Finance (No. 2) Act 2005; and to prescribe an additional statement to be contained in future forms of national insurance elections that will make clear the election cannot transfer backdated employers&#039; national insurance liabilities to their <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_15"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 15</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

employees. This regulation is to be made using existing powers in the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992; and extends the tax avoidance disclosure rules to national insurance.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Before I conclude, I wish to draw to the attention of noble Lords the report of the Select Committee on Economic Affairs on the Finance Bill 2005. In the Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations, the carefully considered report of the noble Lords said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;We listened with increasing concern to the catalogue of ingenious schemes devised over the years in order to pass remuneration value to employees (particularly bonuses to the higher paid) in a way that attempted to avoid or reduce income tax and NICs. We took note of the view of HMRC that, even after the measures in the present Bill had passed into law, &#039;there will be something new, the whole history of this suggests there will be, and we will have to counter that when we get there&#039;. Given the vast amount of tax at stake and in the light of that history we were persuaded that an exception to the normal approach to backdating was justified. Moreover, it seemed to us that the suggestion that professionals might now find it difficult to advise about remuneration packages that included share schemes and share option plans for the generality of employees was an exaggeration.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>I would take this opportunity to confirm to your Lordships that the Government wholly concur with that conclusion.
</p>

<a name="60109-04_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>In conclusion, I hope I have explained why the Bill is important and necessary to ensure fairness. As I have said, it will not affect the vast majority of employers who do not seek to avoid their tax and national insurance liabilities through avoidance schemes. I have also explained how a small minority of employers have persistently sought to avoid their obligations. This Bill is an appropriate and proportionate response to national insurance avoidance of that kind, and I commend it to the House. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="60109-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   My Lords, the House will be extremely grateful to the Minister for his introduction to this quite technical Bill, but I found interesting what he did not say. First, the Treasury in its current straitened circumstances needs all the revenue it can get. Secondly, until Royal Assent of the Finance (No. 2) Bill to which the Minister referred, what was going on was totally legal. It is one thing to stamp on such tax avoidance schemes at a particular time. I disagree with the conclusion of the committee to which the Minister referred, and which the Government accepted with alacrity, that retrospection is suitable in this particular case.
</p>

<a name="60109-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>As the Minister said, most of the Bill arises from a Government warning in a Written Ministerial Statement that both tax and national insurance contributions would be payable on non-pay remuneration of employees from 2 December 2004. As far as the tax position was concerned this was enacted <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_16"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 16</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in last year&#039;s Finance (No. 2) Bill, which became law last July. It was to be retrospective, as promised, to the date of the Written Statement some six months earlier.
</p>

<a name="60109-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>In my book, retrospective legislation is bad legislation, whether of tax or national insurance. Unfortunately, even though your Lordships&#039; House conventionally rails against retrospective legislation and often votes it down, this House is barred by the Parliament Acts from amending finance Bills and could do nothing about it. None the less, the back-dating of tax on non-pay remuneration is now law and we have to accept that fact. I suppose the Government could claim that it is only for six months so they can get away with it&#151;which they have.
</p>

<a name="60109-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Today we have a totally different situation. We are not concerned with the tax position of employees, we are considering the national insurance charges of both employers and employees. The question arises whether the employer would have remunerated his employees so generously if he had been aware of the extra subvention he would have to pay. It is no good the Minister saying that he was warned. How many employers read Written Ministerial Statements? I suspect very few, unless they have a government relations department that scans <i>Hansard</i> for them. In any event, having been told by the latter or by their trade organisations, they might have felt that they had got away with not having to pay NICs. Is this Bill then due to an afterthought? Why has it taken so long to introduce it? Why could its contents not have been incorporated in Schedule 2 to the Finance (No. 2) Act last July, or would that imply the breaking of a golden rule of social security&#151;that national insurance charges are not a tax? Could the Minister read from the updated brief why NICs are not a tax?
</p>

<a name="60109-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>I was sent a Written Answer at the end of the last Session that is revealing. I had asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government whether the money saved by moving women&#039;s retirement age from 60 to 65 would remain in the National Insurance Fund. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, himself answered that the Government would continue to make decisions on NICs and social security benefits funded from the National Insurance Fund in the Budget and Pre-Budget Report. In other words, the Chancellor is fully prepared to appropriate the money from the fund into general taxation rather than, as sometimes happens, the other way round. I shall have more to say about this when we debate the Turner report in a few weeks&#039; time.
</p>

<a name="60109-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>To return to the Bill proper, much of it is to do with the threat of retrospection&#151;for a minimum of 18 months. Can the Minister give me any precedents for NICs being backdated as far as that? If not, he will surely suffer the condemnation of your Lordship&#039;s committee on deregulation, which I hope will also comment on the word &quot;expedient&quot;, which appears several times in the first two clauses. It would be helpful both to me and to the committee if the Minister said when it will and will not be expedient for national insurance charges to be backdated. Whether they should be at all, I shall leave as a matter for discussion in Committee.

<a name="60109-05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rosser: </b>   My Lords, I express my support for the Bill which, as my noble friend said, is intended to deter employers from using schemes to avoid paying national insurance contributions on the rewards from employment. Whether, if the Bill is passed, that objective is achieved remains to be seen. The tax avoidance planning industry&#151;it is an industry&#151;seems to employ some of the brightest individuals in the country, which speaks volumes about our priorities and culture. No doubt, as one loophole is closed, able minds will continue to seek to open others, as has already happened following previous legislation in this field by the Government.
</p>

<a name="60109-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The battle to persuade a small section within society to pay its fair share has been long running and it would be highly optimistic to believe that the Bill brings an end to the saga, despite intended powers to close down avoidance schemes, introduce national insurance contributions liability effective, if necessary, back to December 2004 and extend current disclosure rules to cover national insurance contributions avoidance schemes. However, it is a battle that should continue to be waged, as what is going on is clearly a slap in the face for the overwhelming majority of employers and employees who pay their fair share.
</p>

<a name="60109-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>I understand that the latest information available shows that a relatively small number of individuals have received considerable bonuses as a means of avoiding paying their fair share of tax and national insurance contributions. Apparently, a few hundred employers are engaged in the use of schemes on the rewards from employment whose purpose is simply to avoid income tax and national insurance contributions. I gather that it is estimated that the measures in the Bill will, if successful, result in additional national insurance contributions running to a few hundreds of millions of pounds per annum.
</p>

<a name="60109-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>National insurance contributions avoidance on a significant basis is usually associated with annual bonuses paid to a small number of highly paid employees and directors, especially in financial services. The financial services industry is a major employer and, as a result of its internationally recognised expertise, brings considerable earnings and other significant benefits to this country. However, that does not mean that some of its practices and parts of its culture should go unchallenged.

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>Last July, I read an article that commented on how often individuals and firms in the financial services industry failed to manage conflicts of interest and chose to better themselves at the expense of their clients. The article then referred to a theory that the root of the problem was that rewards are too great, finance as a whole was insufficiently competitive and made excessive returns and that that had made possible the accumulation of huge wealth and let loose a culture of uncontrolled greed that eventually distorts judgment. The author of the article in the London <i>Evening Standard</i> was the City columnist of that paper&#151;hardly an unsympathetic commentator. He concluded by saying that, whether the theory on the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_18"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 18</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

root of the problem was true or not, unless firms genuinely embraced ethical behaviour so that nothing else was tolerated, they must in time destroy the credibility of the whole sector. I do not think that avoidance schemes on the scale and of the kind that the Bill is intended to end are ethical, even though they may currently be legal.
</p>

<a name="60109-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>National insurance contribution avoidance schemes either reduce the amount of money available for further improving the National Health Service and funding contributory benefits or mean that the overwhelming majority who are not engaged in avoidance have to pay more than they otherwise would to make up the shortfall resulting from the actions of a small minority. It is rather like taking from the less well off, including in this context what is sometimes referred to in the media as middle England, to provide money for the well rewarded: there is nothing very ethical in that. In significantly reducing national insurance contributions, avoidance can result in a better competitive situation cost wise for those who are not paying their fair share, in comparison with the overwhelming majority who do. Once again, there is nothing very ethical in that.
</p>

<a name="60109-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>Addressing that problem, as the Bill seeks to do, will help to restore a level playing field and to encourage proper competition. If we value the goal of a fairer society, we need to address a situation where a small number of those employers or employees who are already well off decide to use their financial clout to pay one of the major accountancy firms to produce contrived and elaborate avoidance schemes of the kind being targeted by this Bill.
</p>

<a name="60109-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>What is happening in this area, where it seems that almost anything goes, is in marked contrast to what happens at the minimum wage end of the employment market where the numbers involved in the avoidance schemes covered by this Bill are likely, shall we say, to &quot;be limited&quot;. I do not have the figures for 2005, but the annual survey of hours and earnings estimates for April 2004 showed that 227,000 jobs were held by people aged 22 and over with pay less than the adult national minimum wage of &#163;4.50 per hour. While it does not automatically follow from that statistic that 227,000 people entitled to the minimum wage were being paid a lower rate, a study undertaken for the Low Pay Commission suggested that there was a high level of minimum wage underpayment in parts of the clothing and restaurant sectors. The incidence of non-compliance with the minimum wage found in investigations arising from complaints continues to be high at around 40 per cent, although no one knows the extent of undetected non-compliance.
</p>

<a name="60109-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a> The last report from the Low Pay Commission referred to concerns that were expressed to it that no prosecution cases for non-compliance had been brought by the Inland Revenue. The commission also noted the weakness of the deterrent to non-compliance and contrasted it with the fact that interest is payable on any arrears of company or individual tax. It recommended the introduction of interest charges <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_19"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 19</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

payable on arrears arising from minimum wage underpayment and financial penalties for seriously non-compliant employers.
</p>

<a name="60109-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Any movement in the national minimum wage is normally made only following a detailed report by the Low Pay Commission. Its recommendations, reflecting the composition of the commission, seek to reflect not just the interests of the low paid but also those of employers. Yet many employers do not seem to carry out even a remotely comparable rigorous, open and transparent exercise to that undertaken on whether the national economy and companies can and should afford a few extra pence per hour for the least well off, when it comes to the very much more substantial, and well above average, improvements that now seem to be made each year in the remuneration packages of those in the board room.
</p>

<a name="60109-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>In addition, in a small number of cases, particularly in relation to bonuses in the City, there are ever more contrived tax and national insurance contributions avoidance schemes designed to increase further the already highly attractive financial position of those employers and employees involved. Although I do not often agree with the City columnist of the London <i>Evening Standard</i>, in this case the thrust of his comments were well directed. If we are to move closer to the goal of a fair society, we cannot allow situations to go unchallenged under which a small minority of the very well rewarded are able to avoid their obligations to society to the detriment of the overwhelming majority. I support the Bill and only hope that it achieves its intended objectives.

<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="60109-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Newby: </b>   My Lords, we also support the purpose of the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said that the Treasury needed all the revenue that it can get. As an ex-Customs and Excise man, my approach is that the revenue department should get all the revenue to which it is entitled. We are talking specifically about contrived schemes. I realise that there is a debate to be had on what &quot;entitlement&quot; means in certain circumstances. But if, as here, we are talking specifically about highly complicated and sophisticated schemes, the sole purpose of which are to avoid taxation, there is no doubt that we are referring to a systematic attempt to reduce the amount of money which should legitimately go into Revenue coffers. It is very important, not just in stopping unfair beneficiaries of such schemes, but for the overall credibility of the tax system. If we expect, as we do, citizens to pay their taxes relatively unquestioningly and as individuals not to go to great lengths to avoid them, it is important that the legislature is seen to be taking steps to bear down consistently on those at the top end of the income scale, who as a result of that position, can employ people who can go to great lengths to reduce their tax liability.
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>I was very pleased to hear the Minister pray in aid of the Bill the support received from the Economic Affairs Select Committee. My recollection is that when <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_20"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 20</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I was a member of that committee&#039;s sub-committee dealing with finance Bills, the Treasury did all it could to avoid your Lordships&#039; Select Committee and treated it at times with near, if not actual, contempt. I only hope that the welcome that the Minister gave to its recommendations in this case signals a broader acceptance of the Committee&#039;s validity and work.
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I was also pleased to hear the noble Lord say that there would be proper consultation on all secondary legislation in the Bill. He mentioned a 12-week consultation period. As I have said before in your Lordships&#039; House, it gives me no great comfort to hear Ministers say that secondary legislation will get proper scrutiny because it is introduced under the affirmative resolution procedure. Given that secondary legislation cannot be amended in any event, the fact that it comes forward under the affirmative resolution procedure is of absolutely no help, in technical matters such as this, in getting the best possible legislation. The Minister says that the Government intend that all secondary legislation will have a 12-week consultation period. I hope that they will stick rigidly to that promise. We are talking about very technical matters which, frankly, very few Members in your Lordships&#039; House or in another place can look at in huge detail. It needs time for the relevant experts to opine on it.
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>A question was raised in another place to which I am not sure a satisfactory answer was given. I apologise if I missed it. It relates to national insurance being claimed back from employees who have now left the company in which they were employed in December 2004. What route is followed in those circumstances, and how easy or difficult is it to get at those employees who may be employed elsewhere in the UK or who may have retired? I would welcome the Minister&#039;s comments. I also welcome the Minister&#039;s thoughts on the comment of the chairman of the Treasury Select Committee that, given the general nature of the legislation, it amounts to a general anti-avoidance rule. The Minister will be aware that there is a debate among tax experts on whether there should be a general rule as opposed to very large amounts of primary and secondary legislation dealing with specific schemes. We on these Benches are looking at this. I see some attraction in moving towards such a general rule, but I wondered whether the nature of this legislation presaged a change of thinking about it on the Government&#039;s part.
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>Finally, on the relevance of this legislation to the tax system as a whole, does the Minister agree with the views expressed by Edward Troup, a leading authority on British tax law who advises the Select Committee in another place. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;The aim of Government should be to . . . do its best to ensure that the &#039;return&#039; from tax planning is as low possible . . . a simpler tax system with fewer reliefs, exemptions and discontinuities would, in the long term, frustrate most of the tax evaders&#039; ploys . . . Management has to decide between whether &#163;10,000 of tax planners&#039; fees is likely to give a better post-tax return than the amount spent on, say, advertising. This judgment is not immoral, it is inevitable&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<a name="60109-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>I am sure that is the case and I hope that the Minister will impress on his Treasury colleagues the need to devote the same kind of priority to simplifying the tax system which latterly they have devoted to clamping down on tax avoidance schemes.

<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="60109-06_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill with his customary precision. I also thank my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale for his succinct and targeted comments on retrospection.
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>The Minister will be aware that in another place we did not oppose the Bill and as a headline that remains our position. But we are not completely uncritical and we have some concerns that we will want to explore in more detail as the Bill progresses through your Lordships&#039; House. It contains a mere seven substantive clauses dealing with three main topics. The easiest for me to deal with is Clause 7, which extends the disclosure requirements that apply for tax purposes to national insurance. The Minister will be aware that these disclosure requirements were controversial when they were announced and to some extent they still are, especially in the light of the Pre-Budget Report proposals on disclosure periods. But this Bill, by adding national insurance schemes, does not add new issues to that and therefore we have no problems with it.
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>The heart of the Bill lies in Clauses 1 to 4, which empower the Treasury to make regulations relating to national insurance contributions&#151;I cannot quite bring myself to call them NICs, even though that would save nine syllables. The regulations will have a retrospective effect going back to the date of the ministerial Statement made on 2 December 2004. That, as my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale has already pointed out, takes us into the issue of the degree of retrospection that can be tolerated within our law. It also takes us into the areas of legitimate tax planning and tax avoidance, as well as the need for certainty among taxpayers. I shall refer to &quot;taxpayers&quot; because &quot;national insurance contribution payers&quot; is rather a mouthful. Also, nowadays national insurance contributions are only a hair&#039;s-breadth away from being a tax. We might as well regard it as such for all practical purposes.
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>It is the tradition of this country, one that can be traced back to Magna Carta, that citizens should not be taxed except by clear words in statute. That has been modified over the years and there has been an increasing acceptance that statutes can apply retrospectively, particularly in the case of tax avoidance, provided that certain tests are met. When he was in another place, my noble friend Lord Rees set out four tests that such legislation should meet in order for it to qualify for retrospective effect. The first of those tests was that warning should be given in another place and that the warning should be precise in form. Back in 1978 he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;A mere suggestion that there are vague schemes of tax avoidance that must be countered should not suffice&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee A, 6/6/78; cols. 718&#150;19.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_22"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 22</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60109-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>That is why the nature of the Paymaster General&#039;s announcement on 2 December 2004 has rightly been the subject of considerable scrutiny.
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>As I understand the Government&#039;s position, that Statement applies not only to the specific avoidance schemes involving securities that were covered in last year&#039;s second Finance Act, as well as in the draft regulations that will come into effect in relation to national insurance contributions if this Bill is passed, but also to any possible scheme which sought to avoid or reduce income tax or national insurance on what the Statement referred to as the &quot;rewards of employment&quot;. The Government&#039;s position is that that should be the case even if such a scheme had not even been thought of in December 2004. We find it difficult to see how that meets a test of precision. It seems to take the principle of retrospection too far.
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>As I said previously, we understand why the Bill includes a specific extension of the disclosure regime. But we find it difficult to understand why the Government find it necessary to introduce an unprecedented level of retrospection&#151;as I believe it genuinely is&#151;without even waiting to see whether the disclosure regime will prove its worth by providing the notice that the Government require to step in and deal with schemes they regard as unacceptable. When put in the light of the reduction in disclosure periods announced in the Pre-Budget Report, it is increasingly difficult to see why this degree of retrospection is reasonable.
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>When the Government introduced the disclosure regime in the Finance Act 2004, it was in response to a conscious decision not to introduce a general anti-avoidance rule. I understand that one reason for that decision was the complexity and cost of introducing a clearance procedure. I do not want to go into the pros and cons of having a general anti-avoidance rule versus disclosure, but I do want to echo a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Newby. In effect, we now have a general anti-avoidance rule for tax and national insurance on earnings, without having an equivalent clearance procedure. That must raise issues of fairness for taxpayers.
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>The taxpayer ends up between a rock and a hard place. Judging by various comments made by senior officials in Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs, that is exactly where they, if not the Government, would like to see taxpayers. I suggest that a tax system introducing such a degree of uncertainty is an unhealthy development and potentially unfair to taxpayers. The Government have made much of how they are entitled to collect a fair contribution in tax and insurance, but they seemingly fail to acknowledge their duty to set up a legal regime which has clarity. Surely it should not be the obligation of taxpayers to pay whatever the government of the day deem to be fair in the absence of clear law. We are essentially talking about clarity.
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>The Explanatory Notes are somewhat unusual, since they contain nearly two pages of analysis of the Bill&#039;s position under the European Convention on Human Rights&#151;the Minister referred to that. But the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_23"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 23</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

length of treatment demonstrates that, if nothing else, the Bill is clearly in difficult territory so far as the ECHR is concerned. I will not go into detail today, but many tax professionals are clear that the legislation will probably be challenged in the courts on ECHR grounds.
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>The Chancellor told the Treasury Select Committee in another place that the convention,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;gives a government the power on behalf of the tax-paying public to raise taxes in a fair and proportionate way&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>So the courts are likely to be asked to rule on whether the blanket retrospection covered in the Bill is fair or proportionate. In the meantime, we have legislation which lacks certainty.
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>I have two detailed questions for the Minister. First, I hope that he can clear up some confusion about numbers; I know that he is very good with numbers. The regulatory impact assessment talks about additional national insurance contributions amounting to &#163;95 million for 2004&#150;05 as a result of the Bill, and &#163;240 million per annum thereafter. Until just before Christmas, the HMRC website referred to &#163;200 million in 2004&#150;05 and &#163;500 million a year thereafter. My honourable friends in another place tried several times to get clarification on that, but they failed. There is a great mystery: during the Christmas recess that reference on the HMRC website to higher figures disappeared without trace. So I am asking the Minister to explain, not the difference in the figures, but what has happened, and also to confirm the Government&#039;s latest position on the estimates of additional national insurance contributions that they expect.
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>My second question is a related one: how will the Government measure how much extra national insurance this Bill will achieve? Will it be based on additional assessments raised under specific regulations made under the Bill, or will it include something for national insurance that might otherwise have been avoided if the 2004 statement had not frightened off employers and employees from doing something fancy? In other words, if I table a Question for the Minister to answer&#151;which I certainly hope to do&#151;will that Answer be real or imaginary?
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>I shall conclude with two general points. First, the Bill continues the blurring of the line between avoidance and evasion that has occurred under this Government. Tax planning is an entirely legitimate activity, which, if successful, leads to the avoidance of tax, and equally in relation to national insurance. It is entirely right and proper that the Government should ensure that the opportunities for avoidance are minimised, and we support them in that. Avoidance is not the same as tax evasion, however, which is not lawful. The Government have never been willing even to measure the scale of evasion, but it is generally believed to be a much greater problem than that of avoidance. Will the efforts of the Treasury and HMRC towards avoidance and evasion be proportionate to the scale of the respective problems? Specifically, what are the Government doing to minimise the much bigger problem of evasion?
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_24"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 24</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60109-06_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>Secondly, many of the opportunities for tax avoidance arise out of tax incentives deliberately placed in the tax code by the Government. The tax breaks for small companies are a recent example. In the early days Government ministers portrayed these as a positive encouragement for unincorporated businesses to incorporate. Now, however, they describe incorporation as an abuse of the system, and have belatedly reversed their own incentive systems. That tells us that tax incentives are only a nuance away from tax avoidance in the Government&#039;s eyes, but also that complexity&#151;which is brought about in part by the Government trying to use the tax system beyond its natural purpose of collecting revenue&#151;is also a root cause of avoidance.
</p>

<a name="60109-06_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>I keep hoping that the Government will find themselves on the road to Damascus, and will be converted to the cause of a simpler tax and national insurance system. That road may well lead to flatter taxes and a reduction in the number of people within the tax net, but it would certainly lead to a reduction in the opportunities and incentives for tax avoidance. It would also lead to a much fairer system that could be achieved without many of the undesirable features of retrospection that have been included in the Bill.

<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="60109-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, this has been an interesting, if relatively confined, debate about an important Bill that is central to the Government&#039;s aim of deterring tax and national insurance avoidance. Before I address some of the specific points raised, I hope your Lordships will permit me to reiterate the purpose of the Bill. It demonstrates our continuing commitment to take action against avoidance; it is key to achieving the Government&#039;s objectives of fairness and opportunity by ensuring that all pay the correct amount of tax and national insurance; it is an essential element in building a serious and credible deterrent against future avoidance activity; and it is needed to secure a total tax and insurance yield of &#163;200 million in 2004&#150;05, and &#163;500 million per annum thereafter. I stress that the figure is for both tax and national insurance.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>As the income tax disclosure provisions have demonstrated, it is not possible to anticipate the range and complexity of these extremely contrived arrangements. The Government intend to close down such avoidance activity permanently, and this Bill will ensure that the Government can deal with any arrangements that emerge in future that are designed to frustrate their intention that employers and employees should pay the proper amount of national insurance on the rewards of employment.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>On the specific issues raised by noble Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, was critical of retrospection in the Bill and disagreed with the view of the economic sub-committee of your Lordships&#039; House. I stress to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, that the retrospection is limited. It is tied to a tax measure which is retrospective, and would have to be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_25"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 25</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

fully debated in another place. It is subject to a three-month consultation process before regulations are made and to the affirmative procedure. It is simply not retrospection at the will of the Treasury.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>It was suggested that the ministerial Statement of 2 December was not widely understood by taxpayers. I disagree. A lot of publicity was given to the Statement and to the issue itself. We should recognise that these are not in-house schemes devised by ordinary small companies or by individuals watching the television while sitting in their living rooms. These are highly sophisticated avoidance schemes, promoted generally by large accounting and legal firms. They are well aware of Statements of this nature and have significant empires directed to all sorts of legislation. To suggest that this measure will not come within the purview of those who will mainly be affected by it is simply not correct.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>I was asked why the measure was being introduced now and whether it was an afterthought. The answer is &quot;no&quot;. It could not be done in a Finance Act; a separate Bill is needed. This is the first opportunity to introduce legislation in the form of a national insurance Bill. That is why on an ongoing basis we need regulations that do not require primary legislation or a slot in the Queen&#039;s Speech and the parliamentary programme.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>It was suggested that the Government need the money. We could spend a lot of time reviewing the Government&#039;s finances but we should recognise that we are one of only two countries in the G7 with net debt below 40 per cent of GDP. We have met the golden rule and the sustainable investment rule. As I am sure noble Lords will readily recognise, that is not an issue; the issue is about fairness.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>I believe it was suggested that the schemes that are now being addressed are not illegal until Royal Assent is given to the Finance (No. 2) Act. That may be technically correct but the purpose of the Statement in December 2004 was to give due notice that these kind of schemes would not be permitted in the future. Although the technical legislation followed, given the nature of these schemes there should have been no doubt that both tax and national insurance legislation would be put in place to counter them.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>I was pressed on the meaning of &quot;expedient&quot;. Frankly, it depends on the particular circumstances. I would not like to define in detail today the circumstances in which, and how, that might be applied. It depends on individual circumstances. It would be wrong to try to pre-empt that by making a statement from the Dispatch Box.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>I have dealt with the suggestion that no one knew about the measure. I believe I was asked whether we could point to any schemes that warranted this legislation. The purpose of the December 2004 Statement, this Bill and the Finance Act 2005 is to prevent such schemes coming forward. There has been a deterrent effect. I listed some of the schemes that have existed since 1997. We believe that without both parts of the legislation they would continue to be devised.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 26</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60109-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>My noble friend Lord Rosser gave strong support to the provision, for which I am grateful. He itemised the funds which are protected by the measure. He rightly pointed out that the avoidance that is going on is associated particularly, although not exclusively, with bonuses, and generally with bonuses comprising significant amounts. The thing about bonuses is that in a sense they are one-offs, so it is easier without provisions of this nature to direct avoidance, because you can plan the point, moment and manner of payment quite precisely. That is why avoidance has grown up particularly around that.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>My noble friend talked about ethical behaviour, and I agree with that. The legislation sends a strong message to employers, the majority of whom do not engage in these sorts of schemes. They can now continue not to engage in them with the added comfort that no one is going to get a competitive edge because others are not prepared to adopt the same ethical standards. My noble friend made some very telling points about the comparisons of non-compliance with low pay and what is happening in the tax system.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, gave his support to the Bill, and I am grateful for that. In a sense it is trying to make sure that we garner the revenue to which we are entitled and which was intended under the legislation that is in place. He stressed that the schemes that these provisions are aimed at are highly contrived. The reality is that we talk about certainty in the tax and national insurance system, but generally people know when they are straying into those areas; I do not believe, if you look at the schemes that have come forward, that employers have unwittingly found their way into those schemes. They do it purposefully and often on the back of very strong professional advice, which I imagine is quite expensive. A consultation period of 12 weeks is a clear commitment in the secondary legislation, and it will follow the debate taking place in another place on the related tax provisions.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>The noble Lord asked me a question about the clawback of national insurance when someone has left employment. An employer will be able to recover the primary NICs from any payment subject to existing limits. The rights of employers have to be balanced with the rights of employees; therefore it is possible that the employer will not be able to recover all the NICs that may be due, but that will not affect most employers, who do not engage in avoidance. I am not sure that deals fully enough with the particular point that was raised, so I will revert to the noble Lord on that.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>The noble Lord touched on issues of general anti-avoidance rules, and some of the difficulties with those and with clearance procedures are well-aired. As far as the Government are concerned, all measures must be kept under review, because we are absolutely committed to making sure that people pay their fair share. I know that there is a big debate about what that means in any given context.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>I would take issue with both the noble Lord and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, on the issue of simplicity. If you look at what has happened to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_27"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 27</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

national insurance, it demonstrates overwhelmingly the reverse of the point that is being made. The complexity has followed the avoidance; not the other way around. You have a relatively straightforward system to start with, someone gets around that with a device that is not caught by it; there is legislation to deal with that; a further measure to get around that; and legislation to deal with that. The complexity has followed the avoidance; not the reverse. Indeed, one of the benefits of this measure is that it negates further complexity because the nature of the retrospection means that it is less likely, going forward, that greater complexity will be needed.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, restated the position of the Conservative Party that it does not oppose this Bill. I understand that position, and I recognise that we will probe some of these matters further in Committee. She agreed that the Clause 7 disclosure requirements do not really add new issues to the matter, which has been around for a little while. She referred to the four tests of the noble Lord, Lord Rees, and the issue of how precise was the warning of 2 December 2004. I argue that it was precise enough. I stress again that employers know when they are getting into the ambit of such schemes. If you look at the history of some of the intricate nature of the schemes, people know what they are doing. It has become clear that the existence of that statement and the legislation that has followed, including this Bill, have helped negate some schemes that would have otherwise gone forward.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>The convention on human rights was touched on. We will have to see how that issue develops, but the clear advice to the Government is that the Bill is compliant and proportionate. I say again that the Bill is targeted on retrospective tax measures, which go through the procedures of another House and the affirmative procedure in this House.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>I hope that I have cleared up the numbers. I think that the &#163;95 million and the &#163;240 million relate to national insurance only, whereas the &#163;200 million and the &#163;500 million relate to national insurance and tax. If I am not right about that, I will write to the noble Baroness. Quite who was diligent enough over the Christmas break to update the Government&#039;s website, I do not know. I have not checked back to see what the sequence was, but I believe that I have given the correct explanation of the numbers.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>The debate about the gap between avoidance and evasion is interesting. I guess that, when push comes to shove, the two can adjoin closely. However, that is perhaps a debate for another day. I reiterate the point that the measures in the Bill are proportionate.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a> The point was made that some of the avoidance issues arise from the incentives that are offered. That underlines the difficulties that the Government face in offering incentives through R&D tax credits and lower rates for smaller companies. If you put in place incentives, for which business often presses, there is a risk that there will be abuses and that the incentives <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_28"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 28</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

will have to be reversed or ameliorated. The more simplicity you have, the more likely you are to have avoidance&#151;the complexity follows the avoidance.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>The question was asked whether the Government are acting proportionately in relation to evasion and avoidance. I argue that they are. The difficulty with evasion is knowing precisely how widespread it is. One hopes that, if you know that there is evasion, it should be relatively easy to tackle it.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>These are big issues. We want taxpayers to be compliant, as I believe people in the UK overwhelmingly are. We should be pleased about that, as it is certainly a contrast to what goes on in some countries, although that does not negate the need for anti-avoidance provisions such as those in the Bill that ensure that people do what they are required to do.
</p>

<a name="60109-07_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>I think that I have dealt with all the points that have been raised. If I have not, I will look at <i>Hansard</i> and write to noble Lords.

<a name="60109-08_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, how will the Government measure how much additional national insurance has been obtained under the Bill? Will there be a proper, auditable measure or will the figure be a product of the imaginative minds of Treasury civil servants?
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="60109-08_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that it will be the product of very able minds in the Treasury and the Civil Service. It will in part be a recognition of what has been stopped, which will clearly be auditable, but it will also reflect a view of what has been deterred, on which it is less easy to be certain. Some of that might relate to disclosures that have been made under the disclosure rules and reflect the extent to which the schemes are not taken forward. I am not sure how easy it will be to audit all that, but perhaps we can revert to the issue at later stages of the Bill. I believe that the figure will be a combination of not just what has been caught and assessed in back taxes and extra taxes, but tax and national insurance contributions that have been protected. There is a good deal of evidence about the matter. The disclosure rules threw up in excess of 100 schemes relating to tax and national insurance that were being promoted and were around in the system. On the basis of some of those disclosures, the belief is that a lot of those schemes had not been taken forward.
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="60109-08_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   My Lords, to save the Minister writing a letter, I should say that I asked him whether there was any precedence for backdating the liability of national insurance contributions for 18 months or so, which is the period that we are likely to be talking about.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="60109-08_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I do not believe that there is, because the legislation does not permit it. That is why we need the Bill. At the moment, tax legislation can be backdated to the start of a tax year and before, through a Finance Bill, but national insurance legislation does not permit that. Obviously, therefore, without this legislation it would not have been possible for that backdating to have taken place. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_29"></a>

We need the Bill to allow it where necessary. There is hope that&#151;beyond the draft regulations already in place that tie up with the Finance (No. 2) Act 2005&#151;we will never need to use the provisions again, because people are compliant and have understood the determination of the Government to tackle the issue. We will have to see.

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>I am grateful for the opportunity to explain the issues that have given rise to the Bill. There are clearly a number of points that we can expect to debate at greater length when the Bill moves to Committee. I look forward to that and commend the Bill to the House.

<a name="60109-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>This short Bill of two clauses comes before the House from the other place unamended and with the support of Her Majesty&#039;s loyal Opposition, who went on record as saying:

</p>

<a name="60109-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>The Liberal Democrats also said: &quot;We support the Bill&quot;. That is fairly clear.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>On 20 September last year, the Government announced our decision to extend the remit of the inquiry by Sir Michael Lyons into local government funding and, as a result, to postpone the 2007 council tax revaluation in England. The Bill is the legislative consequence of that decision. In brief&#151;I will go through the detail for the benefit of noble Lords a little later&#151;it removes the requirement in the Local Government Finance Act 1992 for a revaluation of domestic properties for council tax purposes to be implemented by April 2007. At the same time, it removes the requirement for subsequent revaluations to take place at intervals of no more than 10 years. Also, it replaces both those provisions with another that allows the Secretary of State to set the date of any revaluations, by order subject to affirmative resolution in the other place. That differs only slightly from the existing order-making power in the 1992 Act for the Secretary of State to set the date of a revaluation if it is to be in advance of the 10-year maximum interval.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>It is not the biggest Bill ever to come before your Lordships&#039; House, but it has importance beyond its size for the future of local government in England. That importance comes from the time and space its provisions give us to allow Sir Michael to complete his <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_30"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 30</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

inquiry, and for the Government to properly consider his recommendations and consult widely on them, before moving forward with a reformed local government finance system.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>I do not intend to speak for an overly long time, but I would like to cover three things. First, I would like to remind your Lordships of the background to the Bill and the context within which it sits; secondly, I will outline the specific detail of the Bill and its provisions for the record; and finally, I will address some of the myths and rumours that have sadly circulated since the announcement of postponement and, in so doing, make it clear exactly what the Bill does and, perhaps more importantly, does not do.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>I shall begin by setting the context and by explaining our current reform agenda and the changes that are already under way. We are clear that the future of local government is critical to the future of the country. Local government is at the heart of national life and has a pivotal role in championing the communities in which we live and in helping them to prosper. It plays an essential role in delivering services, leading and co-ordinating the activities of local public, private and voluntary organisations, and making communities more pleasant to live in.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>When speaking at Second Reading in another place, the Minister responsible for communities and local government paid tribute to councillors of all parties and to hard-working public servants for the way in which they have raised standards. Since then we have seen the results of the Audit Commission&#039;s Comprehensive Performance Assessment 2005, which shows that&#151;even under the new and more challenging framework&#151;more than 70 per cent of councils are improving strongly or improving well. That is an impressive performance, and shows clearly that local government is responding to the challenges of leading their communities and tailoring service delivery based on the real needs of local people, while at the same time delivering services that represent good value for money.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>Important changes are under way in local government. The new deal for communities initiative, neighbourhood wardens, and neighbourhood renewal strategies to tackle problems of deprivation and disadvantage have all been taken forward by councils.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>Local authorities are leading new children&#039;s trusts across the country that are bringing together social services, education, health and other services, and local area agreements enabling councils and central Government to recognise and agree local priorities, rationalise funding streams and support greater local leadership. The Government believe that those changes represent not only a big challenge but a massive opportunity for local government, and we believe that that opportunity is most likely to be grasped if local government can focus on service delivery supported by financial stability.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>Underpinning that, the Government announced on 5 December last year the provisional local government finance settlement for 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08. That settlement&#151;the first provisional multi-year settlement <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_31"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 31</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that we shall have delivered&#151;is a further demonstration of our commitment to local government delivering local services. By 2007&#150;08, the increase in government grants for local services since the present Government took office will be 39 per cent in real terms. Through the new settlement arrangements the Government have provided another significant boost to local government with a financial package that is stable, predictable and adequate to meet the pressures that local authorities will face over the next two years, while keeping council tax increases down to acceptable levels. With the move to three-year settlements at the next spending review, that stability and predictability will be even greater.Investment and reform have gone together and have delivered.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>The communities that our local councils serve are growing ever more diverse with a greater range of needs and higher aspirations than ever before. That is something which we should all celebrate. But we should also realise that it means that local government&#039;s role will have to change alongside the communities it serves. That is why we launched a debate on the future role of local government&#151;local:vision. The debate has already generated a number of excellent ideas, some of which are making a difference to people&#039;s lives.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>One of the clearest messages emerging from the local:vision debate, and which was reinforced by Sir Michael Lyons when he met with Ministers in the summer of last year, is that we need to be clear about what the new role for local government will be before taking decisions about individual functions or means of funding. The Government have listened and agree. We believe that we should make changes to local government funding only when we have a clear and complete understanding of what we want local government to do. That understanding must be shared not only by central and local government but by all those who help to deliver services and, most importantly, by the people they are there to serve&#151;the general public. In short, we must settle function before settling funding.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>Your Lordships will be aware that in July 2004 the Government appointed Sir Michael Lyons to carry out an independent inquiry into local government funding, which was originally due to report by the end of 2005. He has made good progress with that remit and has started to work on his extended terms of reference, which the Government announced on 20 September. He is now being asked: to consider the current and emerging strategic role of local government; to review how the Government&#039;s agenda for devolution and decentralisation could improve services; and, in the light of that, to consider how to manage pressures on local services. In the light of this work, Sir Michael will then address critical funding issues, including those of fairness, accountability, clarity, efficiency and effective management. He will produce his final report at the end of 2006.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>As noble Lords will know, Sir Michael published a consultation paper and interim report on 15 December. This set out his approach to his extended <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_32"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 32</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

remit and his preliminary thinking on his work to date. The Government welcome Sir Michael&#039;s publication as a useful contribution to the debate on the future role and function of local government and the way it is funded.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>This is an interim report&#151;not a final one. Sir Michael has not come to firm conclusions, but has elaborated on his thinking to date. However, a number of important messages emerge from it. First, it reaffirms the Government&#039;s view that effective funding reforms must be based on a clear view of what we expect from local government and, therefore, to have proceeded with revaluation of council tax in 2007 would not have been sensible. Secondly, Sir Michael&#039;s research has revealed a weak public understanding of how local government is funded, confusion over how the responsibility for the delivery of local services is shared between central and local government and, in turn, a poor understanding of the cost of public services. Sir Michael suggests that this lack of understanding raises important questions about accountability and transparency.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>With the extension of Sir Michael&#039;s remit, there is now a real opportunity to promote a greater understanding of local government among the public. We encourage all concerned to contribute to the next phase of Sir Michael&#039;s inquiry so that he can offer the best possible advice in his final report at the end of the year. In this way we are confident that Sir Michael&#039;s work will provide the platform for fundamental and lasting reform.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>As your Lordships will be aware, at the same time as the Government announced the extension of Sir Michael&#039;s remit, they also announced that they had decided to legislate to postpone council tax revaluation. As the Government&#039;s announcement of 20 September explained, the case for revaluation&#151;that it is right to maintain a fair alignment between house prices and council tax bands&#151;is linked to wider questions about the structure of council tax and to the operation of council tax benefit. This, linked to the other changes in the local government finance system, such as those that I outlined earlier, all led to the view that to proceed with the current timetable for revaluation would not be sensible. The Government, therefore, concluded that they need the flexibility to revalue as part of a fully developed package of funding reforms, rather than as a precursor to them, and at a moment of greater financial stability for local authorities.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>Although this is a short Bill, it may be helpful to your Lordships if, as I promised earlier, I now explain its effects in some detail. First, it removes the requirement laid down by the Local Government Finance Act 1992, as amended, for the compilation of new lists on 1 April 2007. Clause 1(3) amends Section 22B of the 1992 Act by removing the duty on the listing agency&#151;in practice, that means the Valuation Office Agency&#151;to compile a new valuation list for billing authorities in England on 1 April 2007, and a draft of that list by 1 September this year.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_33"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 33</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60109-08_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>By way of a slight digression, at this point I should reaffirm to your Lordships that, to prevent nugatory expenditure, the VOA stopped work on the revaluation of domestic properties in England immediately the announcement was made. But we should be quite clear that until this Bill&#151;particularly this provision&#151;is enacted the VOA remains obliged to carry out the revaluation. If Royal Assent is not achieved by the Summer Recess, draft valuation lists must be published by 1 September this year.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>The second substantive provision comes from subsection (4) which removes the requirement for subsequent revaluations in England on the 10th anniversary of the previous one, unless an earlier date has been specified by order. Until the Government have received and considered Sir Michael Lyons&#039; final report, we cannot take a view on how frequently revaluation should occur. Therefore, we think it right that we should not be statutorily committed to revaluing on a rigid, predetermined cycle.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>Finally, the Bill replaces those two provisions with a power for the Secretary of State to specify by order the date on which a new valuation list must be compiled. Such orders will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure in another place, following the precedent set for similar provisions contained in the Local Government Finance Act 1992, which provided for the council tax in the first instance. For the sake of completeness, I should make it clear that Clause 2 simply provides for the short title of the Bill and, of course, for its extent.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>As the title of the Bill makes clear, the provisions have effect in England only. It does not in any way affect the approach being taken in the devolved administrations. In Wales, executive local government functions are, rightly, devolved. I can reassure noble Lords that the Government consulted the National Assembly for Wales on the subject matter and extent of the Bill before its introduction in another place, and the National Assembly indicated that it was content that the Bill had no effect on provisions relating to it. The Principality implemented its own council tax revaluation in April of last year.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that the provisions of this Bill have no effect at all on the state of affairs, or local taxes, in Scotland or Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>I conclude by turning to some of the myths and rumours that have abounded in recent months and weeks, some of which have been frankly ridiculous and absurd, and many little more than scaremongering. I will take this opportunity to set the record straight and reassure the House of the actual position.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>I cannot emphasise too strongly that this Bill does three things and three things only. It postpones the 2007 council tax revaluation exercise. Yes, despite the confused messages being fed by some to the press, the Government are postponing revaluation and have made clear that we do not believe that it will now happen in the lifetime of this Parliament. It removes the requirement for subsequent revaluations to take place at intervals of no more than 10 years. Finally, it provides power for the Secretary of State to set the date <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_34"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 34</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of revaluations by order, subject to affirmative resolution, as I said earlier, in another place. That is all it does. It does not legislate for a &quot;snooper&#039;s charter&quot;. It does not give powers to the Valuation Office Agency to forcibly enter homes or to take intrusive photographs at will. It does not change the basis on which a property will be valued.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>The Valuation Office Agency has been tasked to maintain an accurate valuation list for the purposes of fair distribution of council tax liability since the Local Government Finance Act 1992 was first introduced. The VOA has powers to carry out property inspections and, if need be, these powers extend to internal inspections. This is not a snooper&#039;s charter, it is simply necessary to ensure that everyone pays their fair share of the tax. Indeed, the current powers date back to the Local Government Finance Act 1992. In fact, powers to carry out property inspections of this nature have existed since before the Second World War, so reports suggesting that the Government are introducing new powers are simply untrue.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>It is important to recognise, however, that staff and contractors of the Valuation Office Agency have no powers to forcibly inspect a property for council tax valuation purposes. The VOA does not forcibly enter people&#039;s homes&#151;it has neither the legal power nor the desire to do so. Yes, there are provisions in the 1992 Act for fines to be imposed if a valuation officer is refused access, but these provisions have never been invoked. Moreover, internal inspections are the exception and certainly not the norm. Suggestions, which I have read, that all 22 million dwellings in the English housing stock will be individually inspected are frankly absurd.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>As for photography, we have seen ridiculous suggestions that the VOA will be taking intrusive pictures of people&#039;s bedrooms and personal belongings. Your Lordships will wish to be reassured that for a member of the VOA to take internal photographs of a property is extremely rare and would only ever happen with the express permission of the householder. Indeed, the VOA has very clear guidance for its staff about on-site photography, which specifically states that photographs can only be taken with the permission of the householder and that they must not show people, details of security systems, or valuable possessions.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>Finally, I wish to be clear that the basis on which property is valued for council tax purposes is the same now as it was when council tax was first introduced by the party opposite. The VOA seeks to assign a market value based on the variables that operate in the market. If one property has a scenic view and another overlooks a chemical plant, it is likely that the scenic view will attract a higher relative market value than the view of a chemical plant. I ask: what is surprising about that? If one property has an attribute, say an extension or loft conversion, which leads to its market value being higher than that of its next door neighbour, it is only fair that that should be reflected in its banding. That has always been the case&#151;nothing has changed.

</p>

<a name="60109-08_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>The fact that the VOA is capturing property attributes in a database using codes does not indicate some sinister new big brother database. It is simply the most effective and efficient way of capturing data in a form that can be used by its automated valuation software to come up with a fair and justifiable valuation. That process has previously been done manually by a valuation officer. The only difference now is that the valuation officer has the benefit of modern technology to support him in his task&#151;making valuation quicker, more efficient and more consistent. I would argue that that surely is in everyone&#039;s interest.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>For the avoidance of confusion, it is worth my putting on record one or two specific details of the valuation process. For example, all properties are currently valued at 1991 equivalent values&#151;1991 being the antecedent valuation date. This includes new properties. We should also be clear that extending or improving your property does not automatically lead to an increase in council tax. The value and council tax band of a property is only reviewed at the point of a &#039;relevant transaction&#039;, such as transfer of ownership through sale. Also, as council tax is based on bands, a property could rise in value as a result of improvements but remain in the same band, even if it were sold. So it is perfectly possible for a homeowner to improve his property without automatically incurring higher council tax charges.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>Finally, we have also seen stories suggesting that people who are unable to pay their council tax will be sent to prison. That is completely untrue. People who wilfully refuse to pay may be imprisoned, but that is entirely different from the position of someone who is unable to pay. Nobody has ever been gaoled for being unable to pay, nor would they be.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>Two and a half million people aged 60 or over now receive council tax benefit, which provides a rebate of up to 100 per cent on their actual bills. We know that many more who are entitled to benefit do not claim, and the Department for Work and Pensions is actively seeking to address this. It has already made the process for claiming the benefit easier and is working with others to encourage greater take up. In addition, households with someone aged 65 or over received &#163;200 with their winter fuel payments, unless they were already entitled to a 100 per cent council tax rebate.
</p>

<a name="60109-08_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>These myths and rumours have only two effects&#151;they undermine the council tax system and, worse, they frighten vulnerable members of society. I sincerely hope that this scaremongering campaign will stop and that, at least in this House, we will see a return instead to proper debate and dialogue based on fact. I commend the Bill to the House.

<p><a name="st_77"></a>
<a name="60109-09_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill. I welcome him to the Dispatch Box in place of the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews. We express our sympathy and hope that our condolences will be passed to her.
</p>

<a name="60109-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>The Bill is small but we still receive it with some trepidation. It is quite deceptively small but it is, despite what the Minister said, significant and important. I say at the outset that we do not object to revaluation being postponed; in fact, we welcome it; and, indeed, we would be much happier if the whole thing was abandoned. We recognise the sense in waiting for Sir Michael Lyons to have his enhanced review put forward and to seeing the results of that without his being hampered by the revaluation which is taking place.
</p>

<a name="60109-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>The Minister has explained the intentions behind the Bill and that it is essentially a cluster of amendments to other previous pieces of legislation: first, the Local Government Finance Act 1992; and, secondly, the Local Government Act 2003, which we all have fond memories of and which we debated for some time in this House. The Bill will cancel the obligation to compile a revaluation list by 1 April 2007 and separate the treatment of Wales and England.
</p>

<a name="60109-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>The Minister has gone into some depth on myths and mythology. One problem that has occurred is the distress caused in Wales by the revaluation that has taken place. The way that has been handled and how it has been received is not a great arbiter of hopefulness for the future. The revaluation process in England, if and when it ever gets under way again, will no doubt have some of the same connotations.
</p>

<a name="60109-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>We note that the Bill empowers the Secretary of State to determine the date of any revaluation, should it take place, then leaves in his hands any future revaluations, and presumably the timescale between one revaluation and another. I also note the Minister saying two or three times that any further legislation on revaluation will be taken on the Floor of the House in the other place. Do I assume that this will be by affirmative order which is applicable only to the other place? If that is the situation, then we will push hard to ensure that an order comes to this House and receives our scrutiny at the same time.
</p>

<a name="60109-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>We have considerable doubts about the fact that decisions on revaluation should be taken by the Secretary of State himself. It must certainly have the support of both Houses of Parliament and full discussion&#151;full and proper scrutiny. I give notice of the fact that we will be testing that at a later stage. The Minister underlined what his right honourable friend in the other place, Mr Miliband, has said, that it is extremely unlikely that there will be any revaluation before the next election. May we hope that with a different, future government, we will have no revaluation following that?
</p>

<a name="60109-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>The myths and mythology that the Minister describes have arisen from a number of sources. There is no doubt that the postponement of revaluation has <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_37"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 37</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

now raised an enormous number of hares. The reasons behind the revaluation are for Sir Michael Lyons to look into further. The whole question of local government finance, how it is applied and where it comes from has raised the question in people&#039;s minds, &quot;What else, other than revaluation?&quot; There has been a lot of talk about an increase in council tax banding, and the implications that would have in conjunction with revaluation. It is therefore not surprising that concerns have been raised as to what that would mean to people. If there were an increased number of bands, on a higher valuation, it would take council tax way beyond what was ever envisaged for it at its outset.
</p>

<a name="60109-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>Council tax was always meant to be partly a charge on property and partly a charge on one or two individuals who live in that property. As I understand it, it was never meant to be a serious, major taxation on households, but that is what is beginning to appear as a possibility. As Sir Michael Lyons continues his review, I hope he will take into account the fears being raised among householders about what will happen if their property is re-banded and re-valued in line with market valuations, as the Minister has said.
</p>

<a name="60109-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>There is also the question that this Bill brings up, but is not contained in it, of how valuation is done. I welcome the Minister&#039;s comments on that, and the fact that there is no intention to widen the valuation officer&#039;s scope. However, it appears that valuation officers already have rights to enter people&#039;s properties, and that is now being interpreted as something likely to happen on a much wider scale. So one must ask: where has that come from? Why is it being bandied around that that is what will happen? Presumably, press inquiries have elicited the information that that could happen. Whatever happens now, the cat is out of the bag. It is now a major problem of revaluation and what valuation officers are going to do, or going to be able to do. If we are not careful, we will end up with a reaction such as that to window taxes, where people will not make improvements to their properties because they are afraid that the valuation will be increased and that they will consequently find that they are unable to pay the council tax.
</p>

<a name="60109-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>Revaluation has gone away for the time being and we will have wait to see what happens in future when we read Sir Michael Lyons&#039;s report. I was interested that the Minister spent at least 10 minutes of his speech going through the wonderful things that have been done for local government. I do not think that this is relevant to the Bill, but nor was his introduction entirely relevant to it, but I just remind him that there is still a &#163;2.2 billion black hole in local government finance. The Government are still very much in charge of what local government receives, how much money it has to spend and what it must spend it on. So the whole question of local government finance is very much open to consideration and inquiry concerning how much is there to be spent and who is to provide it. That is bound to raise its head as the Bill proceeds.
</p>

<a name="60109-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>I look forward to Committee. It is inevitable that we shall have to debate some of the mythology further so that we can give people the reassurance that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_38"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 38</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Minister has tried to give us this afternoon and ensure that it is made certain to people that they are not at threat from valuation officers, that there will not be a spy in the sky testing their property valuation and that the listing of valuations on IT systems will not link up with other systems so that we end up with the threat that there is over ID cards.
</p>

<a name="60109-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>So there is much that may or may not be relevant. The Bill has raised a number of hares and we will pursue them and try to shoot them in Committee.

<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="60109-09_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   My Lords, while respecting the fact that the Bill concerns council tax revaluation, I should like to raise a wider issue of local authority finance, which I am confident that the Lyons report will also scrutinise. That is the matter of the business rate. The business rate should not only be raised locally but retained locally.
</p>

<a name="60109-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>Before 1990, economic development within local government was enlightened self-interest. A city like mine of Norwich could spend local ratepayers&#039; money on starter units for very small businesses and support services&#151;trying to grow those businesses from two or three persons to 10, 15 or 20. It meant that an authority such as mine could make available key worker accommodation for businesses and companies seeking to expand or to move into the locality. One big decision was that we not only started but, although it was a loss leader, retained an airport because we were told by the head offices of companies located in Norwich that that was a key facility for a city that had relatively poor road communications. We did that. We invested in the local economy of our city because we knew that although that cost rates at the time, down the road, revenues would return to enhance the health of the city and its capacity to be an economic powerhouse for its region. In all the years when I was active, we discussed that business rate with the chamber of commerce. I am sure that the same was true for my noble friend, who is also a former leader of a local authority. Those discussions with the chambers of commerce were entirely amicable and, if it was appropriate, we amended our agenda accordingly. As a result, we could persuade local citizens that what we needed to spend we raised locally and that we were accountable locally. Because most of our revenues were raised locally, there was a transparency between what we did, what we spent, what we raised and what we were held to account for in local government elections.
</p>

<a name="60109-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>Since 1990, one of the most perverse pieces of legislation was the nationalisation&#151;it was about the only thing that was nationalised&#151;of the business rate. I want to address two arguments&#151;the other side of the advantages that we had before 1990. It has resulted in a very serious democratic deficit. Now, something like 85 per cent of local government revenues come from central government. As my noble friend rightly said when discussing the Lyons report, as a result local people do not know what their money buys or the degree to which their local authority is effective, efficient or offers value for money because it is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_39"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 39</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

cloaked, concealed and cushioned by the moneys coming from central government. There is an obscurity where there should be transparency and there is a lack of accountability. There is an erratic volatile quality because, of course, if something like only one-seventh of moneys is raised locally, for every &#163;1 of expenditure that you want to raise, you have to raise &#163;7 locally. There is a very high gearing effect which increases the volatility against which so many people currently complain.
</p>

<a name="60109-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>Therefore, the first problem with nationalising the business rate is the democratic deficit, but the second problem is the economic absurdity of it. There is now no connection between economic development and financial return. Because over many decades my city has invested in its local economy, next year, it will pay into the national economy something like &#163;57 million in business rates and will get back about &#163;37 million in grants from central government&#151;both at district and at county levels on a pro rata population basis. In other words, as a result of the city&#039;s investment as an economy in the past, it exports something like &#163;20 million to other authorities, whereas the adjacent, sometimes rather sleepy, indolent and low-rate and low-activity culture rural districts are doing very nicely, thank you. Next year, one will export &#163;15 million in business rate, but will get double that figure back&#151;&#163;30 million&#151;from central government for doing nothing.
</p>

<a name="60109-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>The consequence of that detachment and dislocation between economic development and the business rate means that whether a local authority invests in its economy and does anything, or does not invest in its economy and does nothing, matters not at all. So why bother? Why should any local authority do anything to help its local economy and business when it will not get a penny piece back in revenues? It is more perverse than that: local citizens will be asked, through their council tax with its very high gearing ratio, to invest in local business, the rates of which are exported to other local authorities. Not only does your own citizenry not benefit from economic development, you end up charging your local citizens for the privilege of exporting more moneys to other local authorities which are doing nothing similar of their own.
</p>

<a name="60109-09_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>Can my noble Lords imagine a more perverse way to calculate a quarter or a third or so of local authority expenditure and financing than a business rate which completely breaks the connection between what a local authority does and what it receives back to support its local community. Are you surprised that local government becomes increasingly indifferent to the concerns of business when whatever it does, positively or negatively, makes no difference for the returns that it gets? It is bizarre, it is perverse. It is surely alien to the issues we want to see resolved in the Lyons report, and also more broadly to encouraging local government to take a comprehensive view across the whole of its city&#151;not just its citizens and residents, but its workers and employers. Bearing in mind the argument of the democratic deficit and of encouraging local government to take a healthy responsibility for <br>&nbsp;<br>

economic activity within its local economy, I hope that my noble friend will restore back to local government its business rate.

<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="60109-10_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </b>   My Lords, it is a great pleasure to follow on from the noble Baroness. On these Benches, we concur with just about everything she said about local autonomy and the importance of financial autonomy to build strong and healthy local government. It is remarkable that this Bill is the only legislation which has come forward from the OPDM in the 15 months since I became a Front-Bench spokesman. It is a modest Bill designed to stop something happening. After a three-year period of review, re-evaluation, more review and assessment, we are still waiting for something to happen. If we had abided by the strict letter of the parliamentary rules of engagement and simply discussed the terms of the Bill, our debate would have been much shorter. The Minister broadened out the debate and discussed wider local government issues and so has rather given us licence to do the same.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>Even in its brevity, the Bill displays one of the saddest aspects of modern local government in that it gives the Secretary of State power to revalue properties when he feels like it. So it is another example of how local government operates at the whim of the current interests of central government, rather than of good local government. The original intention to have revaluation after the general election was always naked self-interest on the part of central government, but it was at least transparent&#151;if you do not mind &quot;transparent&quot; and &quot;naked&quot; in the same sentence.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>The problem with the current system is that it was originally intended to be based on notional values. We would have broad bands which would act as comparators in terms of property values. But as council taxes increased way beyond the levels of inflation and way beyond the levels originally envisaged, the pressure to do something has become greater. We were told in the run-up to this that revaluation was not about increasing the total tax take, but was simply about the way in which this burden would be distributed. It always struck us on these Benches that it was a classic response of this Government to avoid radical reform and instead tweak the existing system. Had revaluation taken place, it would simply have made a bad system more complex and created new inequities to add to the old ones.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>One of the key problems is that the current system is based on property values from 1991. That is for anyone who has not sold their house. If you have sold your house, then your house will have been revalued and you may well be banded completely differently from the identical house next door. As council tax increases, that sort of inequity makes people very cross. It will get worse. If we have no revaluation at all, if it is postponed for 15 or 20 years, the disparities between people who have been revalued and those who have not will simply get worse. The Bill is a fig-leaf to cover the Government&#039;s embarrassment over local <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_41"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 41</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

government finance. It is now so complicated that very few people really understand it. I work for a think-tank that, when trying to obtain figures from departments, simply could not get the Department for Transport figures and the OPDM figures on local government transport spending to meet up and agree, because the system is so complicated. It is no wonder that Michael Lyons has found that the public do not understand local government finance when so many professionals do not understand it either.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>The current system is outrageously unfair and, worse than that, it is now becoming profoundly undemocratic. Local government now raises less than a quarter of what it spends and even that small proportion is subject to government control through the capping regime. Each year in this body, the mother of Parliaments, we hold a debate over whether some small rural district council can spend four pence a year extra per resident. I have to say that it is no wonder local people wonder what central government are doing.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>The situation is deeply unfair to many of the least well-off in our society. Many people now pay something like 10 per cent of their income in council tax. It was never envisaged to be at that kind of level. Any decent review of local taxation should at least examine whether that sort of situation is justified. Hundreds of people living in private rented accommodation pay a tax on an asset which belongs to someone else, so it cannot even be argued that this is a decent property tax. On the other hand, many people have purchased properties at much reduced rates under right-to-buy schemes and now find themselves with an asset that is notionally valued at a level at which they cannot afford to pay the council tax. To deal with many of the worst inequities we have an increasingly complicated system of means-tested benefits which add to the administrative burden of collecting the tax in the first place. And, as we know, there is significant under-claiming and take-up of these benefits, as is always the case with means-tested benefits. People are either nervous about the system or, especially for older people, there are cultural difficulties about claiming such benefits. They feel that it is an admission of failure if they have to do so.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>The position is so complicated that it has allowed scare stories of the sort described by the Minister to take hold. If the situation were more transparent, these stories simply would not hold water. So I do not have an awful lot of sympathy with the department for having got into a situation where newspapers can run stories and people believe them.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>After a full consultation and a White Paper published in 1999&#150;2000, it was agreed that revaluation would take place on a 10-year basis. Members of the Official Opposition agreed that any property tax would need to be subject to some sort of revaluation in the way that rates used to be. The Valuation Office Agency had geared itself up for a national revaluation and spent an estimated &#163;45 million preparing for the exercise. It has now had to make total staff reductions <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_42"></a>

of around 1,250, but at some point all that capacity will have to be restored if the Government decide that revaluation is necessary after all.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>Members on these Benches will support the Bill because we do not want to see revaluation and we do not support council tax at all. We would like to see the Lyons review carried out with nothing ruled in or out, and then a proper national debate on how local services should be paid for. After that, we shall see.

<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="60109-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   My Lords, this has been an interesting short debate and I thank the Minister for his congratulatory remarks to local government. I declare an interest as the leader of Essex County Council, which is one of the councils that rose from three-star to four-star status in a harder regime with a CPA assessment made just before Christmas. We are very pleased about it.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>As has already been acknowledged, Members on these Benches support the general thrust of the Bill, but a number of issues give us cause for concern. As my noble friend Lady Hanham has said, we support the decision to postpone revaluation and we shall support that part of the legislation. But we cannot support the proposal to give the Secretary of State an unfettered power to introduce revaluation, in theory whenever he wishes and particularly without it being given some consideration by this House. We are also concerned about the impact of revaluation on the already hard-pressed council tax payer. Along with one or two other speakers, I shall take a little licence when talking about council tax. Perhaps the Minister can give us a reassurance today that any potential revaluation would not have serious implications for ordinary people up and down the country.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>Council tax is an important issue, because many people feel that the basis of its funding and distribution between various regions of the UK is not fair. As the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, has said, some people now pay perhaps 10 per cent of their income in council tax. Those people believe that the working of the system itself has become fundamentally unfair. Indeed, when one considers that since 1997 council tax has increased by well over 76 per cent, people&#039;s worries can be understood. Many individuals such as pensioners, who are asset-rich but income-poor, have been hit particularly hard.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>Furthermore, there is the gearing effect that the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, mentioned; I may return to some of her issues shortly. That means it is difficult for local authorities to keep the rise in council tax down to the rate of inflation. It is hard indeed to do any of the things that the noble Baroness talked about in her valuable contribution. Indeed, figures from the LGA show that council tax, since its 1991 inception, has risen from covering 21 per cent of local government expenditure to 25 per cent. It is particularly relevant to what the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, said in that business rates have fallen from 28 per cent to 21 per cent. So, the contribution from the ordinary council tax payer to local expenditure has <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_43"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 43</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

increased considerably while the business contribution has fallen back. I support most of what the noble Baroness said today.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>It is perhaps worthwhile to indicate why we are considering the legislation today. As the Minister said, council tax revaluation is being postponed; but the Government have set up the Lyons inquiry, which I support. When announcing the council tax revaluation postponement, they asked Sir Michael Lyons to look into the structures&#151;which, again, one can support. Sir Michael gave an interim report, to which the Minister referred, and I want to comment on some things said in it.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>He stated that a significant number of households would be paying significantly more in council tax, due to the decision by the Government to abandon revaluation. However, in all the models that he looked at, Sir Michael assumed that the revaluation would be revenue neutral, which&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, said&#151;is the Government&#039;s assertion. Of course, in the 2005 Welsh council tax revaluation and the 2005 English business tax revaluation, the Government&#039;s claims that revaluation would be revenue neutral turned out to be false with, for example, average bills in Wales increasing by some 8 per cent. On that level, some of Sir Michael&#039;s assertions and models would be inadequate. Revaluation could also be a bad thing because the Government would not do what they promise. If that happens, it would not be revenue neutral but would be increasing the tax burden by stealth.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>In the interim report, Sir Michael analysed a straightforward national revaluation using existing bands. In that model, 19 per cent moved up bands and 17 per cent down bands. In London, the worst hit, 11 per cent would move down while 35 per cent would move up. Either way, even if it is revenue neutral, Lyons concedes that some regions like London would be badly hit and that under the standard revaluation model there would be more losers than winners.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>Sir Michael then modelled his revaluation with extra bands. For example, one model had 12 bands including three new top bands, with the top band paying 400 per cent of the Band D rate, compared to 200 per cent at present. In that model, Sir Michael says that 4.6 million will move up and 6.5 million will move down; that is the source of some press reports. However, one should take in mind that a lot of those houses moving up would be those that I referred to before as being asset-rich and, perhaps, income-poor. Increasing taxes for these people would be extremely unfair. Families who had worked hard to improve their homes would face soaring bills, up to the equivalent of perhaps &#163;5,000 a year. That would be getting towards the old rates system which became so unpopular, because people would be paying even larger amounts of their income in that sort of tax model. It all points to the fact that the whole thing needs totally rethinking and redoing.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>Sir Michael then says that higher bands do not improve equity, as I have just said, and that the best way to improve fairness is to sort out the failing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_44"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 44</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

council tax benefit system, which the Minister referred to, and which I again support. Perhaps there will be some measures to improve that, even before we get to the Lyons review. In short, revaluation will not itself produce more winners and losers&#151;even Sir Michael admits that&#151;and so far the Government&#039;s revaluations have been tax-raising, not tax-cutting.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>I shall move on to one or two other issues. In 2004, the Government estimated that revaluation would cost &#163;108 million. In 2005, the cost was up to &#163;178 million&#151;an increase of around 60 per cent. We are looking at something like the Scottish Parliament problem, with continued escalation of what it might cost. As the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, has referred to, the Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, confirmed in November that the Valuation Office Agency had incurred around &#163;60 million in costs and contractual liabilities on the revaluation up to that point. The noble Baroness&#039;s answer mentioned that some &#163;45 million of this figure would be of potential use in the future. However, given that this Bill cancels the requirement for any form of revaluation indefinitely, we have absolutely no idea when this outlay will be utilised, if ever. Surely the work done in the last year or so will be out of date by the time Sir Michael&#039;s inquiry publishes the final report.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>Furthermore, I was informed in a reply to another Written Question that the immediate impact of this cancellation was that approximately 400 staff working on casual and fixed-term contracts at the Valuation Office Agency have been given notice to leave, and that an early departure scheme for permanent employees is taking place. What estimate has been made of the costs caused by these redundancies, particularly in terms of compensation and other payments, and are they included in the figure already stated of the cost of the aborted revaluation exercise?
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>As I set out in my introduction, the Bill contains the power for the Secretary of State to authorise a revaluation whenever he or she wants. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the position: how soon after the conclusion and publication of Sir Michael&#039;s final report do the Government envisage that a revaluation will occur? A lot of the problems and inequities we have discussed&#151;including the lack of business contribution towards development in localities, which the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, talked about, and escalating council tax bills, which I mentioned&#151;will clearly be with us for several years. As the Minister said, there will be no revaluation in this Parliament. Therefore, these anomalies and problems look like being with us for at least two or three years. They are a problem.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>We did not need a Sir Michael Lyons review to say that the public do not understand the system. We could all have told him that years ago. It is unfortunate that it looks like being at least three or four years before there is any real change, and the public understand and local government gets better treatment on raising money locally. It is sad that at this stage all we have had is a postponement of revaluation, which we can support. I said when we debated the Local Government Bill that all governments that had <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_45"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 45</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

carried out revaluation had lost the subsequent election. That is one of the reasons it was not done now. I still think the Government will lose the next election anyway, so it may be that another party will have to pick up this mess.
</p>

<a name="60109-10_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>I would like the Minister to say a bit more, rather than the platitudes he gave about local government to start with. We will have three or so years of uncertainty, which will not help local government or the public to understand what local services are being paid for and how they are provided. It is going to be an interesting debate. This is only a small Bill, as has been said. We will question in particular the part of the clause that gives those powers to the Secretary of State, and I am sure that will be an interesting time in Committee. I shall be supporting my noble friend Lady Hanham.

<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="60109-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I ought first to express my gratitude to all noble Lords who have spoken in this debate. It presages an interesting Committee stage, not least because of the quality of contributions. I think we have had four leaders or ex-leaders, and one leading member taking part, and perhaps more will join us when we look at the detail of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60109-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>I am also grateful for the support in broad terms that both major opposition parties have given to the Government&#039;s proposition. That tells me that we will have an interesting and challenging time in Committee discussing what we all accept is a sensible but short measure. I was interested to hear my noble friend Lady Hollis speak from her particular perspective. I shall discuss her contribution when responding to various points. We have had a useful start and I look forward to the detailed examination that will occur&#151;in which no doubt I shall play a small part&#151;when my noble friend Lady Andrews returns to take control of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60109-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>We believe that the provisions are essential if we are to formalise the postponement of revaluation announced last September. As it stands, revaluation must happen on 1 April 2007. It is only through the provisions of this Bill that the Local Government Finance Act 1992 will and can be amended and postponement formalised and achieved.
</p>

<a name="60109-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>As I said earlier, the Bill provides the time and space for Sir Michael Lyons to complete work on his extended remit to publish his final report at the end of the year. Beyond that, it gives us the flexibility&#151;that is very important&#151;to revalue as part of a fully developed package of funding reforms. The Government have been asked on many occasions to predict when they believe revaluation will happen. That has been repeated this afternoon. I am sure noble Lords will recognise that, just as we now recognise that 2007 is not the right time, we cannot sensibly gaze into the future and say now when the time will be right and appropriate. We have a lot more work to do and we will want to take very careful account of, and see a wide-ranging debate on, the fruit of Sir Michael <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_46"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 46</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lyons&#039; later report. When and how to revalue will depend very much on the wider picture that emerges in the light of Sir Michael&#039;s recommendations. As the Minister for Communities and Local Government said at the time of the announcement on 20 September last year: first, function, then, finance, then, revaluation. That is a very sensible formulation. That provided us with the opportunity to say that we did not think that revaluation would occur in the lifetime of this Parliament. That position is backed up by the Bill which maintains the principle of revaluation but allows sufficient flexibility for it to happen at the most appropriate time.
</p>

<a name="60109-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>Indeed, by removing the requirement for there to be no more than 10 years between revaluations, the Government are seeking to provide that maximum flexibility not only in the timing of the first, but of each subsequent revaluation. If we accept that it is right not to set a date now for the first revaluation, it follows that it would not be sensible to seek to predict when would be the right time for the second or subsequent revaluations. To remove the date of the first revaluation without in turn removing the predetermined time-frame for future revaluations would greatly reduce the Government&#039;s flexibility in an entirely unnecessary form.
</p>

<a name="60109-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>A number of questions were asked that were either directly or indirectly related to the Bill. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, made a point about secondary legislation that I anticipated she would. I confirm that the situation is as she describes. This merely follows the precedent of other comparable secondary legislation in the original 1992 Act, such as bringing forward the date of future revaluations from the 10-year maximum or changing the number of valuation bands. The noble Baroness speculated what the effect of the additional council tax bands would be. Again, that is a matter on which we shall have to await the findings of the Lyons&#039; report. But it is essential to understand that the existing bands could be revalued at the same time as property so, other things being equal, if a property has not risen in value by more than average, it should not end up paying more tax.
</p>

<a name="60109-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>The noble Baroness made the assertion that revaluation in Wales can be taken as an indicator of the effect of revaluation in England. Wales cannot be seen as any indication of the way revaluation will be carried out in England, or of its effect. The Government are committed to revaluation in England being revenue-neutral. I made that point at the outset; and that is the situation. That is our intention and our desire.
</p>

<a name="60109-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>The noble Baroness also referred to the powers of valuation officers and the assertions in the press that those powers are increasing. Many of those assertions seem to have been stimulated by the very active role taken by Ms Spelman in another place. Valuation officers have the same powers now as they were given by the party of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, back in the Local Government Finance Act 1992. Nothing has changed, and there are no plans to extend their powers. It is a matter of regret that much speculation and falsehood about the way in which the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_47"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 47</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

tax works has been dangerously stimulated by some commentators and some politicians. Ultimately, that can only damage the tax and its credibility, and that is not in anyone&#039;s interest. I would have thought particularly for the party opposite, which is committed to council tax, that to undermine its credibility does nothing to help the tax in the longer term. I would not have thought that was a desirable outcome, and I would caution against a campaign that operates in that way.
</p>

<a name="60109-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>The noble Baroness also made a passing point about the alleged &#163;2.2 billion hole in local government finance. This Government have provided substantial additional funding for local government in the provisional settlement announced in December, and we have made it clear that there will be stability in local government by announcing a two-year package, which by and large has been welcomed. We have had a 39 per cent real terms increase in support for local government since our Government came into office in 1997; something which I do not think could have been envisaged had the party opposite continued in office from the 1997 general election.
</p>

<a name="60109-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, also made a point about the Valuation Office Agency embarking on a widening scale of taxes, window taxes and so on. She referred to press inquiries about &quot;spies in the skies&quot; and the linkages of different IT systems. There have been press inquiries and parliamentary Questions, which have promoted information. It is clear and unequivocal that less than 1 per cent of properties are internally inspected annually by the Valuation Office Agency, and it is a sad fact that has not been reported. Much of the press speculation seems to rest on the assumption that it will be a universal approach. It is not a universal approach; it is not universally necessary and nor is that the way in which the Valuation Office Agency operates. I want to kill off this issue about there being a &quot;spy in the sky&quot;. The Valuation Office Agency has no contracts with any organisation undertaking aerial photography and no intention of using that in the way in which has been erroneously reported in many sectors of the press.
</p>

<a name="60109-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>The IT system built for the Valuation Office Agency only contains information that the VOA already holds. It has simply digitised that information and employed new technology to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. It should be congratulated on that, and I have no doubt that it will have longer-term benefits, particularly when at some later date a revaluation exercise has to be undertaken.
</p>

<a name="60109-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>When the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, finished, my noble friend Lady Hollis made a very important contribution to the debate about the importance of local accountability. I recognised a lot of the arguments that have been deployed, familiar as I am with local government and coming from a strong local government background. It would be surprising if I did not express some sympathy with those arguments, particularly on the importance of local accountability in the funding of local government.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_48"></a>

</p>

<a name="60109-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>I agree in part with what the noble Baroness said. Sir Michael Lyons picked up the issue in his interim report. Of course, the arguments are complex and there is surely a strong case, too, for a system of equalisation. Indeed, I sense that the noble Baroness supports the principle of equalisation, which is certainly easier to implement in the nationalised system of business rate collection. There is no doubt in my mind about the value of equalisation, although I recall raising questions about the system at the time of its introduction. Before the nationalisation of the business rate, many local authorities had within their boundaries the capacity to raise substantially greater revenue than did local authorities whose areas had a poorer business base, whether that related to offices, factories, workshops or whatever. I remember some of those inequities and I believe that the nationalisation of the business rate ironed those anomalies out.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60109-12.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="60109-12_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the fact that local authorities had offices and factories in their areas was not an anomaly? Those authorities worked for and built that base. That is not an anomaly; it is a reward for activity and energy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="60109-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I certainly agree that local authorities, including those of the noble Baroness, me and many others, encouraged and stimulated business growth and development. Indeed, we saw that as a badge of pride and as an important element of the local economic development strategy. Perhaps I should have said more precisely that that approach could lead to disparities, if you like, in the wealth generated from the local business rate; the lack of an even base for taxation could lead to severe constraints on the development of local services.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>The Government have taken measures to increase and stimulate co-operation and liaison between local authorities and local businesses. We have attempted to provide a background to stimulating local economic activity; we have been at pains to ensure that local authorities are not hampered in that regard. Additionally, we have put in place schemes such as the local authority business growth incentives scheme and the business improvement districts scheme, which have now begun to bring some benefit. We recognise to a degree the issues that the noble Baroness raised. Beyond that, we should perhaps await the outcome of Sir Michael Lyons&#039;s final report, as I have no doubt that he will focus time and energy on those important issues.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Scott, made a valuable contribution. I am grateful for her support for the principles of the Bill, even if that support comes from a different perspective, with which I would probably take issue. She said that, when properties are sold, they are revalued to current values. That is not the case. When a property is sold on and there have been improvements, it may be revalued, but it will be revalued to 1991 values, not to current values.
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="60109-12_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </b>   My Lords, my point was that if the house next door, to which the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_49"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 49</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

same improvements have been made, is not sold, the cost of the improvements will not be reflected in its value. Therefore, there can still be a disparity between identical neighbouring houses, depending on whether one has been sold. My point was that that is arbitrary and not clear to the public.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="60109-12_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, that may well be the case, but the system is as I described: it is based on bands and those bands will not necessarily change even after a review. That is an important point to remember. Also, all values are related to the 1991 values.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>The noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, made some observations about the impact on Valuation Office Agency staff of the Government&#039;s decision to postpone revaluation. Future revaluations are likely to require fewer staff in any event, as the benefits of the technology that I talked about earlier will ensure that there is less manual preparatory work and a speedier response to the call for revaluation. Of the expenditure on preparation for revaluation as it would have been, &#163;45 million will be reusable.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>The Valuation Office Agency had about 1,400 people employed on revaluation work when the postponement was announced. Immediately following the announcement, the agency took steps to reduce continuing expenditure and the opportunity to reshape the agency to fit the new situation. Some 420 staff employed as casuals or on fixed-term contracts would have left the agency by the end of November last year, and a voluntary early departure scheme has been announced, with 600 staff expected to depart between March and June this year. Coupled with natural wastage, we expect the total reduction to amount to some 1,250 staff. There is a careful management process in place designed to ensure minimal damage to the work of the organisation, but to take account of the fact that work flows have changed and will not be as originally predicted.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Scott, and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, made perfectly respectable points about pensioners and low-income taxpayers not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_50"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column 50</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

taking up council tax benefit. The Department for Work and Pensions is taking very active steps to improve take-up, as I explained in my opening contribution, and as the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, will be well aware from her important work in her time in the department. That includes a positive approach&#151;ringing pensioners whom it believes may be entitled but are not claiming council tax benefit, taking details over the phone and then sending completed claim forms, which the pensioner need only sign to get their benefit. In the longer term, the department aims to make getting the benefit as automatic&#151;in other words, passported&#151;as possible.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, made some important points based on his continued and in-depth knowledge and experience of local government, for which I pay tribute; he does a first-rate job in representing Essex County Council, and I am grateful to him for his insights. I take issue with his assertion about Wales being a precedent; as I said, it is our intention that any revaluation in the future be revenue neutral. In basic terms, the Bill&#039;s provisions are very close to the existing legislation. Without the Bill, we would be obliged to continue with the process as it is. We do not want that to be the case. It is important that we move on and provide ourselves with the space to take account of Sir Michael Lyons&#039;s final report and review. I simply ask the noble Lord to be patient; it is a great virtue and one of which we in local government have long experience. This is an important moment for us to take time and reflect on where we go with function and funding. Those two elements are very important to the longer-term future and the debates that take place over local government and its continued and important role as part of the machinery of government in this country.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>I am grateful to those who have contributed; it portends well for an informed and orderly debate on a Bill that is essential for us to achieve a purpose that has had universal support, even if it is for different reasons, from the major parties in your Lordships&#039; House.

Clause 1(3) removes from the list the decision in Section 82(2)(e), variation of a person&#039;s leave if, when the variation takes effect, the person has no leave to enter or remain&#151;that is, a decision that would shorten or &quot;curtail&quot; the person&#039;s remaining leave.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>Clause 1(4) then inserts into the list of immigration decisions two provisions for preserving rights of appeal against particular variation decisions. The result is that people who receive such decisions can appeal against them in-country with the terms and conditions of their leave preserved until such time as they do so. The immigration decision set out in new Section 82(2)(fa) is needed because this summer, the Government decided that refugees should be given five years&#039; leave and not indefinite leave to remain, as before. The effect of creating the new Section 82(2)(fa) is that a person who has been recognised as a refugee but is then refused further leave as a refugee can appeal in-country against the decision and continues to be recognised as a refugee, with the terms and conditions of their leave remaining the same until the appeal is finally decided.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>The new immigration decision created in Section 82(2)(fb) is different. It does not identify particular groups whose rights of appeal against the refusal to vary their leave will be preserved, but instead gives the Secretary of State the power to grant and remove first rights of appeal by making orders. While under the subsections to be repealed people have a right of appeal against a refusal to vary their leave only when the result of the refusal is that they have no leave to remain, in practice this does not bar people from appealing. If I have 12 months&#039; leave, ask for it to be extended to 18 months and the decision is refused when I still have one month&#039;s leave left to run, there is nothing to prevent me making a second application, albeit I shall have to pay the Home Office fee again. By the time the application is decided, in practice the situation is unlikely to arise. However, the Home Office guidance asks people not to apply to vary their leave until 28 days before the period is due to expire. This helps the Home Office to prioritise cases; it is in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC3"></a>

the applicants&#039; interests too, because if refused after their original leave expires&#151;which would be usual if they applied only 28 days before&#151;they would get a right of appeal.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>An out-of-country appeal is not an effective remedy against refusal to vary leave, because irreparable damage is done before the appeal can be heard. In the light of this, and the high current success rate on these appeals, with more than one-third succeeding, the Government cannot justify these restrictions on appeal rights. The necessity of a justification was pointed out by the House of Lords Constitution Committee in its letter of 13 December 2005.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>Will the Government amend the Bill as they have been requested to do by the Constitution Committee in its letter of 13 December 2005 to give effect to the view of the Council on Tribunals, as endorsed by the House of Lords Constitution Committee in its letter, that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;rights of appeal should be defined in primary legislation and not in secondary legislation, capable of being added to or cut down by regulations&quot;?</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-12_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>Will the Government amend the Bill to ensure that order-making powers can be exercised by the Lord Chancellor and not by the Secretary of State for the Home Office? The Home Office is a party to the appeal and, for substantive fairness and for the appearance of fairness, should not be able to create and deprive people of the right of appeal.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>Furthermore, these powers are likely to affect the workings of the AIT, increasing the number of out-of-country appeals, and of the higher courts, because the AIT appeal will not be a sufficient remedy. Therefore, those responsible for the court system need to have oversight of these powers. I refer Members of the Committee to Section 53(6) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 as a precedent; it provides that regulations governing bail hearings require the approval of the Lord Chancellor.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 8 is to probe the Government&#039;s intention by illustrating that existing powers are sufficient to create a one-stop appeal. The amendment looks complicated but the principle is simple. It is no more than a probing amendment because the powers to which it refers already exist. It amends the list of immigration decisions in Section 82(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act by inserting a reminder that the Secretary of State can deny a subsequent appeal against removal to a person who has already had an appeal against refusal to vary leave by issuing a certificate to say that these matters could have been raised at an earlier stage. The amendment must be read with Amendment No. 1, which preserves an in-country right of appeal against refusal to vary leave.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>At Second Reading, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;I am particularly inviting suggestions from your Lordships that might identify an alternative approach that creates what is central to this part of the Bill&#151;an effective, one-stop appeals process but one that might confer in-country appeal rights on a wider range of cases.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 6/12/05; col. 578.]</p>

<a name="column_GC4"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC4</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60109-12_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>This is our first response.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Three paragraphs of Section 82(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 deal with appeals against removal: Section 82(2)(g) deals with overstayers; Section 82(2)(i) deals with family members of overstayers; and, finally, Section 82(2)(ia) deals with seamen and aircrews who have overstayed as a special category. By operation of Clause 11 of this Bill, people refused a variation of leave will become overstayers. Thus the amendment lists exhaustively all those who might have been refused a variation of leave and now face removal.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>The Home Office wants to ensure that people do not have two appeals&#151;one against refusal to vary leave and one against the decision to remove them from the UK. But it already has power to do that. The Secretary of State already has power to select who shall have a right of appeal at all by virtue of Section 88 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The Secretary of State can set down in the immigration rules mandatory requirements for varying leave&#151;for example, prohibiting extensions beyond a certain time or switching between particular categories. Thus he already has enormous control over who has a right of appeal and who does not.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Then, in Section 96 of the 2002 Act the Secretary of State has broad and flexible powers to deny a person a right of appeal where the person could have raised the matter at an appeal at an earlier stage, whether or not he or she exercised that right of appeal. Some extracts from Section 96 show just how broad the power is:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;An appeal . . . against an immigration decision . . . may not be brought . . . if the Secretary of State or an immigration officer certifies . . . that the person was notified of a right of appeal . . . against another immigration decision (whether or not an appeal was brought . . . )&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-12_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>and that the claim or application could have been raised in an appeal against the old decision and that, in the opinion of the Secretary of State or the immigration officer, there is no satisfactory reason for that matter not having been raised. There are more powers to the same effect. So the Secretary of State can say, &quot;Give me all your reasons for wanting to stay in the UK when you appeal against a refusal to vary your leave. If you do not, I shall issue a certificate to bar you from raising them at a later stage&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>The amendment allows for the possibility of preserving the appeal against removal as a safeguard in cases in which the Secretary of State recognises that such a safeguard should be available. When a version of this amendment was laid in Committee in the Commons, the Minister of State said only:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;Nor do I accept, for elaborate reasons that it would take me more than 12 minutes to explain, that Amendment No. 77 is a clear and valid alternative to what we are trying to do.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee E, 18/10/05; col. 36.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-12_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>I shall address three main points in relation to this amendment. We agree that the amendment is based on current legislation. It is designed to illustrate how much power the Secretary of State already has to control appeal rights. If he has not used these powers <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC5"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC5</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to date, we must ask why he comes to Parliament seeking new powers. Perhaps, in fact, the system works better as it is.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>Circumstances can change between the making of a decision to refuse to vary leave and a decision to remove a person from the UK. But that is because the Home Office takes such a long time to issue the decision to remove. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State told us at Second Reading:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;Part of the rationale behind the provisions is to allow the refusal and curtailment decisions to be made simultaneously&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 6/12/05; col. 579.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-12_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>As to judicial review, yes, the Section 96 certificate can be judicially reviewed. Such a review would be on the grounds that a matter could not have been raised earlier&#151;not an easy point to prove.
</p>

<a name="60109-12_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>In summary, why have the Government done so little to date to bring about the situation that they say they are seeking to bring about by this clause? They have the necessary powers and they have not used them. I beg to move.

<a name="60109-13_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Sandwich:</b>  In general, I fully support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. The amendments would preserve in-country appeals and avoid eroding our present appellate system any further. I will specifically speak to Amendment No. 16, which has become lost in the groupings and probably should be spoken to now as a consequential amendment.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Is it appropriate, as has already been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, for the Secretary of State for the Home Office to make regulations granting or taking away rights of appeal, given that the Home Secretary is a party to the appeal? The Select Committee on the Constitution commented to the Minister in its letter of 13 December that in its view, following the Constitutional Reform Act 2005:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;primary legislation such as this should make clear whether a particular power can be exercised by the [Home Secretary] or by the Secretary of State who also holds the office of Lord Chancellor&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>This may clear up the confusion. The Constitutional Reform Act contains several functions that are vested in the Lord Chancellor which cannot be reassigned by a decision of the Prime Minister.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Other organisations are equally concerned about the human rights aspects of these clauses which continue the process of dismantling previous Bills. The removal of appeal rights and the substitution of an out-of-country appeal as a remedy are likely to increase the number of cases going to the higher courts, so the provision will have an effect on the workings of the courts. The Immigration Law Practitioners&#039; Association, among others, considers that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;even if the Home Office is leading policy in this area,&#151;</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;for the sake of substantive fairness and the appearance of fairness final authority to make regulations should be given to the Department for Constitutional Affairs.&quot;</p>
</ul>

<a name="column_GC6"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC6</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60109-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>It appears that the order-making powers on appeals in Part 1 of the Bill are to be exercised by the Secretary of State for the Home Office rather than the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs. I understand that that situation has arisen in previous Bills but has not been fully debated. I can give two examples. Section 53 of the 1999 Act to which we shall return in a later amendment on bail states that the Secretary of State &quot;may by regulations&quot; make provision for bail hearings instigated by the applicant, but Section 53(7), notes that the Lord Chancellor must approve the regulations. Section 53(8) brings in the Scottish Ministers as well.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>Section 60 of the 1999 Act, which is now repealed, set out that family visitors would have a right of appeal, but the Secretary of State and not Lord Chancellor was given the right to set fees for family visitors under Section 60(6). There is therefore considerable ambiguity in this Bill and its predecessors about whether one Minister or another is responsible or whether there should be dual oversight. Even if plans are drawn up in the Home Office, they should be approved by a Minister outside the Home Office and presented to Parliament by that Minister. There are also serious practical considerations in the case of out-of-country appeals. I am sure that the Minister will clarify the position with reference to that.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>The Select Committee also comments&#151;and this appears in many of the briefings&#151;that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;it has long been the view of the Council on Tribunals . . . that rights of appeal should be defined in primary legislation and not in secondary legislation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>In the view of the Select Committee some provisions in the Bill infringe that principle. As a member of the Committee, I should be interested to hear the Minister&#039;s view or some hint that the Government will introduce appropriate amendments to cover that point.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Unfortunately, I have not had time to study the Minister&#039;s reply to the comments from the Constitution Committee, which arrived only this morning and have still to be seen by the chair and discussed by the committee next week. I believe that the committee is likely to make another comment before the next sitting of this Committee. At first sight, her answer is disappointing, as there is only one paragraph dealing with the technical point. I do not believe that the Committee will feel that that is adequate. However, the letter is potentially positive about the categories under Clause 1(4). After discussing humanitarian protection, it says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;Other categories may be designated under this power, such as unaccompanied minors. The order-making power allows appeal rights to be conferred on a well defined range of cases that may be amended in future to reflect changing circumstances without amending primary legislation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>I understood that the Minister had previously said that other categories would be designated under this power, so I should be grateful for more clarification on that. I look forward to the Minister&#039;s comments.

<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60109-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   I start by echoing what my noble friend Lord Dholakia has said about the impropriety <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC7"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC7</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of sending this Bill into Grand Committee when there are so many contentious issues to discuss, many of which my noble friend and the noble Earl have mentioned. I understood that it was the practice of the House to send Bills to Grand Committee only when there was very little likelihood of matters arising during Committee on which Members would feel it necessary to divide. In the few minutes of debate that we have had today, I believe that we all understand clearly&#151;if we did not already do so from what has been said in the other place&#151;that this is a highly contentious Bill.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>I simply cannot understand how it got into the Government&#039;s head to propose that it was sent to the Committee or that it was agreed by anyone in the Opposition. We certainly did not hear about it; the first that I knew about it was when I saw on the Order Paper that we would be dealing with it in Grand Committee. If we get no further than we did in the other place in trying to improve the Bill, we shall have wasted over the next two weeks some 24 hours, while sitting here and speaking about it without having the slightest effect on the final state of the legislation. That would be most regrettable. Noble Lords may think that in future, when the Government propose to send these Bills to Grand Committee, we shall have to establish some mechanism of wider consultation so that people who take an interest in particular issues can have their say about whether these matters are dealt with on the Floor of the House or in Grand Committee.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>Before I discuss Amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11, I shall say a few words about matters that were raised by my noble friend Lord Dholakia. Section 82 of the 2002 Act preserved the right of appeal that people always had against an immigration decision, except in the case of decisions that a person&#039;s presence in the United Kingdom was non-conducive to the public good, when that person had been required to leave the UK or was refused leave to come here. In those cases, there has never been a right of appeal, and the person concerned is never even allowed to know what was alleged against him that led to the Secretary of State&#039;s opinion that his presence would be non-conducive to the public good, even though in many cases&#151;such as the US professor, Steven Best, who was barred following a statement at an animal rights rally that activists were justified in digging up people&#039;s graves&#151;it was pretty obvious why the Secretary of State decided to make the order. Best wanted to attend a rally to mark the closure of Darley Oaks Farm in Staffordshire, which had been a target of animal rights extremists for many years. I make no objection to that use of the Secretary of State&#039;s powers under the 1971 Act and, more generally, when people have incited others to commit criminal offences while here, it is reasonable to exclude them or to refuse them a variation of their existing need to remain without an in-country right of appeal.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>But here we are dealing with a vastly different matter. In Clause 1, the Government propose to remove people&#039;s rights as they have always existed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC8"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC8</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

since the dawn of immigration control in 1962 and as were reiterated as recently as the 2002 Act. As the Minister is aware, and as we have heard already, the Joint Committee on Human Rights in its 5th report, published last month, questioned whether the removal or restriction of rights in Clauses 1, 3 and 4 was compatible with Articles 2, 3, and 13 of the ECHR and questioned the violation of the common law right of access to court. After careful analysis it concluded that requiring appeals against variation of leave to be brought out of country was &quot;likely&quot; to lead to incompatibilities with Articles 8 and 13 of the ECHR.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>That was strong language for the JCHR, which, regarding the 2003 Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, Etc.) Bill, referred in a number of cases to a significant risk that particular articles of the convention would be breached, whereas, more commonly, the committee simply draws matters to the attention of Parliament without giving its own opinion. Here, by contrast, the committee asserts that the Bill is &quot;likely&quot; to lead to incompatibilities. That raises the question of whether the Lord Chancellor, in reaching decisions on compatibility for the purpose of certifying Bills, is taking advice from lawyers who understand the ECHR. The Joint Committee is composed of 12 Members of both Houses, from all parties, including experts such as my noble friend Lord Lester and the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, who I am glad to see in his place. They are distinguished experts on human rights. The unanimous opinion of the committee is that these provisions are likely to get us into trouble in Strasbourg&#151;if, indeed, our own courts do not rule against the Government on judicial review.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>How can the advice given to the Government be so out of line with the opinion of those experts? Do the Government agree that the frequency with which that happens, as underlined here by adding to the JCHR&#039;s previous comments on the proposals for the deprivation of citizenship and right of abode regarding the unilateral narrowing of the definition of a refugee in the Government&#039;s interpretation of Article 1E of the convention, gives rise to dissatisfaction with the quality of the advice being taken by the Lord Chancellor and other Ministers who sign such certificates in relation to Bills?
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>We now have the additional and almost equally weighty advice of the Select Committee on the Constitution, whose letter of December 13 has been quoted. As that letter states, practically everyone except a recognised refugee loses the right to appeal in-country to an immigration judge against refusal to vary leave to enter or remain. The exceptions are to be contained in orders which specify circumstances that are not defined in the Bill itself or the Explanatory Notes, but are, so far, left to the absolute discretion of the Minister of the day. That contradicts the principle, referred to by the Select Committee, originally laid down by the Council on Tribunals, that rights of appeals should be defined in primary, not secondary, legislation. Your Lordships should be under no misapprehension about what the Government are proposing. If we agree to this, we would not only <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC9"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC9</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

remove the particular rights of students or close family relations, for example, but give the green light to future Governments to modify all and any rights of appeal by secondary legislation on the basis of the precedent that we are now creating.
<a name="time_1"></a>
<a name="60109-13_time0"></a><h5>4 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60109-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>As for the exceptions, the Minister spoke for three quarters on an hour at Second Reading, but the only one she mentioned was that unaccompanied asylum-seeking children would have a separate right of appeal against refusal or curtailment of leave, as has already been announced in another place. It was not clear whether, in ducking the whole question of in-country appeals, their scope and their process, she did so because she did not have the answers or because she was conscious of the time. But if it was the latter, we certainly have not heard from the noble Baroness on the subject during the Recess&#151;a bad sign for the productivity of our work this afternoon when we have nothing to work on. If the Government are determined not to move on any other categories besides persons with humanitarian protection and unaccompanied asylum-seeking minors, we might as well not have bothered with these issues in Committee. However, the Minister said that the Government were only wedded to the idea of an effective one-stop process for appeals and not to the notion that the appeal should be exercised from abroad, and she invited us to come up with an alternative approach that would give the Government what they wanted. I hope that in tabling these amendments we have been successful in doing that.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>It would be useful if we could get it on the record from the Minister that to a large extent, a one-stop appeal system is already in place. As my noble friend mentioned, there are the provisions of Section 88(2) of the NIA Act 2002, which forbid appeals by persons who do not satisfy particular requirements as to age, nationality or citizenship specified in the rules and who do not have the required documents and so on. Clause 5 adds a new document which has to be produced when required by the rules, a medical certificate or report. So failure to comply with any of these provisions means that the person concerned has no right of appeal.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>Then there are the provisions of Section 96 of the 2002 Act, which preclude an appeal where the Secretary of State certifies that a person was notified of a right of appeal against the decision in question in connection with another immigration decision, whether or not an appeal was actually brought or determined.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>Thirdly, there is Section 85 of the 2002 Act, which allows the IAT to treat an appeal as including an appeal against any other decision in respect of which a person may have an appeal right, and to consider any matter constituting a ground of appeal and any statement or evidence arising after the date of the decision. ILPA tells us that the Home Office appeared not to be aware that the IAT already consolidates variation and removal appeals where the person is not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC10"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC10</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

within any leave to remain as a result of the refusal, and it cites a particular 2004 case which the Minister may now have had drawn to her attention. I hope so and I hope that she can comment on the misunderstanding that appears to have arisen in the Home Office on this matter.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>Amendment No. 8 amends the list of immigration decisions in Section 82(2) of the 2002 Act by stating clearly that the Secretary of State can issue a certificate forbidding a second appeal against removal where the person has already lost an appeal against refusal to vary leave to remain. The amendment covers overstayers, family members of overstayers, seamen and aircrews. Since under Clause 11 any person refused an application for variation of leave becomes an overstayer, the amendment is exhaustive, as my noble friend emphasises. The Secretary of State already has the power under Section 88 of the 2002 Act to determine who has any right of appeal, whether in-country or exercisable from overseas, and he or she can also lay down mandatory requirements in the rules, failure to comply resulting in the forfeiture of any appeal right.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Amendment No. 8 also allows for the preservation of appeal rights in the few cases where the Secretary of State considers they ought to be allowed and where he may decide to refrain from exercising his Section 96 powers. That idea was raised by my honourable friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon and dealt with not in Committee, where my honourable friend and others would have had a chance to come back with further arguments, but afterwards in a letter, in which the Minister said that the amendment restates existing powers; that because circumstances might have changed between the decision to curtail or refuse leave to extend leave, and the later decision to remove, it was not possible to issue a certificate under Section 96; and he did not want to open the route to judicial review, which certification would afford.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>If for the sake of argument we concede that our Amendment No. 8 was a restatement of existing powers, we must ask the Minister what statistics she has on the use being made of them. What number of appeals would have been prevented by the full use of the 2002 Act powers in 2004, for example, taking the last calendar year for which figures ought to be available? What additional number does she estimate would have been prevented if the Bill had been in operation? The number of appeals has been rising steeply from 35,000 in 1997 to 108,000 in 2003, but last year it levelled off. Within the total, asylum cases fell sharply between 2003 and 2004 and that was counterbalanced by an increase in entry clearance cases, which is simply a function of the large number of people who wish to come to this country for perfectly legitimate purposes.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>As regards the gap between refusal and removal, the Minster said at Second Reading that part of the rationale behind the provisions is to allow refusal and curtailment decisions to be made simultaneously. What has been stopping the IND from doing that as soon as the appeal has been lost? Is not the lengthy gap <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC11"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC11</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

due to the inefficiency of the IND rather than any fault of the appellant? With regard to judicial review, it is of course a theoretical possibility but it would have to be on some matter that could not have been raised earlier, not easy to prove if the decision to remove had been made promptly after the appeal. We say, in any case, that the possibility of judicial review is inherent in the system devised by the Government in Clause 1. Variation decisions may involve consideration of human rights issues and any decision that such a case is clearly unfounded, barring an in-country appeal, could potentially be subject to judicial review, as could any case where an appeal from abroad is not an effective remedy.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>However, we must be realistic and recognise that the Home Office is not likely to accept our contention that if existing powers had been used more effectively, it might have been unnecessary to consider new legislation. Amendments Nos. 9, 10, 11 and 34 therefore provide for a one-stop appeal covering the decision to refuse a variation of leave and the decision to remove and for existing leave to continue on the same terms and conditions until the appeal is determined. That is our response to the invitation issued by the Minister at Second Reading when she asked us to propose an alternative approach by which we preserve the central principle in the Bill of creating,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;an effective one-stop appeals process that might confer in-country appeal rights on a wider range of cases&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 6/12/05; col. 578.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-13_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>I say in passing that it is not the job of the Opposition or of my party to construct the Government&#039;s legislation. If the Government were willing to consider ways in which a one-stop system could be devised while preserving in-country rights of appeal, they have the resources to do it. There is a whole battery of lawyers in the Home Office who could have come up with a solution more effective than ours&#151;although we believe that our proposals would fully satisfy the Minister&#039;s requirements. The approach in these amendments certainly complies with the conditions in Mr McNulty&#039;s letter to my honourable friend. It is different from the system that he says is not working, even though it was the Home Office&#039;s own idea only three years ago. It deals with the objections that circumstances can change between refusal of leave and decisions to remove, by providing the single right of appeal, and it does not involve certificates which are open to judicial review.
</p>

<a name="60109-13_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>When similar amendments were moved in Standing Committee in another place, Mr McNulty said that they were not &quot;substantive&quot; without elaborating further, except to say,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;It cannot be right&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee E, 19/12/05; col. 60.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-13_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>He evidently did not understand that what is proposed is an appeal at the end of the process against both the refusal of leave and the decision to remove or deport. As I hope the Minister is aware, the Law Society has declared that an appeal mechanism is vital to immigration decision-making as it allows challenges to wrong decisions and encourages the making of <br>&nbsp;<br>

consistent initial decisions. It believes that the concern about multiple appeals can be dealt with effectively in the manner we are proposing and that the inadequate safeguards against the criminalisation of persons awaiting appeal in Clause 13 would be unnecessary under this scheme.

Obviously, as is usual, correspondence will now ensue&#151;very much, I expect, in the light of the discussion today. As a member of that committee, there is not much that I ought to say other than that I wholly agreed with the recommendation and that, as a lawyer, I cannot for the life of me understand why appeals against removal and against refusal to remain should be tampered with in any way. It does not seem reasonable or human. However, I merely turned up to find out what was going on; there is very little of any use that I can add and I shall say no more.

But, listening to the debate, it strikes me that it is quite strange that the most enormous issue about human rights, on which a committee of our House disagrees with the Government, should be discussed tucked away in the Moses Room instead of in the Chamber. We should think seriously about that; I believe in Grand Committees&#151;they lend themselves to certain sorts of discussions of certain sorts of Bills&#151;but I question whether this is the right place to be debating these issues, whatever one&#039;s view of them.

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, made a particularly interesting point in questioning whether rights of appeal should be defined by secondary legislation. That seems a very important question, and I hope that the Minister will comment on it. He gave the source of his remark, which I did not note down, but it is an interesting point that one&#039;s whole future life, on which an appeal may hang, can be decided in Parliament by secondary legislation, which we know does not receive full discussion of all the issues.

<a name="60109-14_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   I find myself in general agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, on the whole group of amendments. He made a particularly good point about the need for a genuine one-stop appeal system. I am also fully in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that this is a highly controversial Bill and should have been considered on the Floor of the House.
</p>

<a name="60109-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>My Amendment No. 28 I believe to be parallel in effect to Amendment No. 10. Perhaps I should have tried to amend Clause 1 or, indeed, Clause 11, or previous Acts. I have, however, accepted the best advice I could obtain from the Public Bill Office and put down this new clause. Its purpose is to improve the situation of people who are in this country perfectly legally, for example, under temporary or short-term <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC13"></a>

leave to remain, and no doubt in many non-asylum cases, including spouses and students. When they are refused an extension, or even a variation of their stay, they cannot under the Bill make an appeal against the refusal. However, they have every right to appeal against a removal notice whenever that may be issued. No one can say how long the interval between the refusal of an extension and the removal notice is likely to be. However, experience of the Home Office and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate indicates that the interval may be quite long&#151;months or even years. During that interval, the aggrieved person will be left in limbo, unable, in theory, to work or to obtain benefits. The right of appeal against removal gives him or her a perverse incentive not to go voluntarily and contest the refusal from overseas, which is always a difficult procedure, but to remain here to contest the removal notice. I think that I have been extremely moderate by including subsection (2) in Amendment No. 28, which limits the scope of the in-country right of appeal. It may well be that the amendment should have gone wider. However, I hope that I have shone a spotlight on an inconsistency and on an unintended consequence of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60109-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>The Immigration Advisory Service rightly points out that if the Government want to establish a genuine one-stop appeal, it should be against the refusal to vary or extend. The IAS stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;Turning those who have abided by the immigration rules into criminals when they can do nothing about it does not engender confidence in immigration control or enhance the respect for the UK&#151;especially if they are students who then become influential in their own countries&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>I therefore trust that the Government will consider this matter very carefully.
</p>

<a name="60109-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>Amendment No. 29, which is tabled in my name, deals with a separate matter, but as it has been placed in this group I do not mind discussing it now. New Section 87A in the 2002 Act is designed to meet the need for accurate and independent advice about the actual situation on human rights at any time in particular states and parts of states. This need has been experienced for a good many years, partly because of divergent and conflicting analyses made by the Foreign Office and the Home Office, neither of which necessarily has personnel on the spot in remote parts of very large countries. At Second Reading, I gave Zimbabwe and the so-called Democratic Republic of Congo as examples of these difficulties. In this country, we have a lot to learn from Canada, which has had such an independent source of advice in operation for some years. Information could perhaps be gained from the Canadians and experience could be shared with other Commonwealth and EU members, to the benefit of all. Intelligence could be drawn in from the more reliable national and international non-governmental organisations. New subsection (1) empowers the Secretary of State to set up and fund a source of independent foreign country advice. I am mildly surprised at my moderation in not making this mandatory. I therefore ask the Minister to give the most careful consideration to this as something that is needed now, but which may become even more necessary in future. New subsection (2) seeks to ensure <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC14"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC14</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that the available independent advice will be taken into account when tribunals and others are considering appeals.

<a name="60109-14_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   I added my name to Amendment No. 10 and it was only after I saw the Marshalled List that I appreciated that I should have added my name to Amendments Nos. 9 and 34, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury has pointed out, are integral to Amendment No. 10.
</p>

<a name="60109-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, said, a very technical explanation is needed in support of this large group of amendments and I am grateful to the Immigration Law Practitioners&#039; Association for, as ever, its exemplary briefing to those of us who are not lawyers who have to grapple with matters such as this. Like other noble Lords I wanted to find another solution to the problems posed by Clause 1 and the subsequent new Clause 13. We all agree that there should be a one-stop appeal system, but the Government&#039;s chosen solution is unattractive.
</p>

<a name="60109-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>The Government are making, not only in Clause 1, but in Clause 4, sweeping changes to an appeal structure before we are sure how a new points systems will operate. It is a question of putting the cart before the horse and our work throughout this Grand Committee will be to try to ensure that that cart stays upright and safe for the thousands of people who seek to come to these shores both to work and to study. At Second Reading, speakers around the House supported the Government in their attempts to have one-stop appeal. We all spoke in favour of people coming to this country. We know that they enrich both our social, cultural and economic life. There are very few, such as the Columbians who were sentenced last week for drug running, who give immigrants a bad name. The vast majority enrich this country. We are trying here to ensure that that migration to this country continues in a proper, fair and humane manner.
</p>

<a name="60109-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>I accept that the Government showed goodwill in another place when they introduced what is now Clause 13, by trying to ensure that overstayers were treated better than would otherwise have been the case under Clause 1. But the old saying is that if you are trying to get to Newcastle you would not start from here. The problem is that Clause 1 starts from the wrong place. Clause 13 is a patch-up job which leaves overstayers in an unpleasant and wrong position by rewarding them, in a sense, for being difficult and hanging on, whereas, if they are honourable and straightforward, they may be in the most difficult position of having to leave and to institute their appeal proceedings from overseas. If someone&#039;s passport is endorsed for overstaying, they face a bleak future, given all the problems they will face. It will not only affect their future travel if they go elsewhere and try to return here, it also means that they are in limbo here by being unable to work, receive benefits or healthcare pending their removal.
</p>

<a name="60109-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>I made it clear at Second Reading, and will repeat, that the debates in another place have persuaded us that there is a good reason to retain an in-country right <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC15"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC15</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of appeal, but it is a matter of how we achieve that. While we agree with the Government that it is important that decisions are made in the right way first, they must be made expeditiously and it should be possible to remove quickly those people who should be removed. Our preferred solution is that adopted by the first group of amendments, which seeks to find another way of ensuring a one-stop appeal system. The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, mentioned that at Second Reading the Minister said that she was in listening mode and wished to consider alternative proposals that could be acceptable. I hope that this group of amendments may provide a constructive way of beginning those negotiations, because nothing happened between the Bill leaving another place and coming here.
</p>

<a name="60109-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>I see this Grand Committee as representing a helpful period where we now have time to reflect. But we know that if we do not manage to have negotiations instituted quickly between ourselves, outside organisations such as ILPA, and the Government, time could fast run out. We appreciate that if the Government are able to make any movement, all-departmental agreement must be reached through the Cabinet. So I am very much aware that the Minister is not in a position to yes or no today; at least, I hope that she is not in a position to say no, and I hope that she may later be in a position to say yes. I hope that the Government may be persuaded to institute detailed discussions on these matters.
</p>

<a name="60109-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a> In passing, I refer to two issues. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, referred to children of asylum seekers. I have amendments in the next group, or my noble friend Lady Morris has, which adopt specifically the issue of children, and I shall leave my remarks on children until that stage. In addition, I have tabled amendments in the second group that address specifically the issue of students. I agreed with the Bill team that the grouping should be as it is on the Order Paper, because I agreed that it might be helpful to set the scene in the first group to consider what kind of appeal system there should be. Is it right, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said, that certain procedures should be left to secondary legislation? That matter of principle is raised in the first group, but I shall hold my fire until we get to the matter of practical application under the second group, because that becomes pertinent only if the Minister says to us at the end of this sitting that the Government will not agree to any changes. If she says, on the other hand, &quot;We do not agree to making changes today, but we shall think about it&quot;, I shall tempt her with further examples as to whether students and children should be exempted, under the general umbrella of saying that there is something not right in the current drafting of Clauses 1 and 13.

<a name="60109-15_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   In speaking to amendments in this group, I declare an interest as chief executive of Universities UK. Together with a long list of other organisations, that organisation supports the purpose behind these amendments. The aim is to seek a better means of achieving the one-stop shop appeal <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC16"></a>

system that the Government seek to create with respect to applications for variation of leave and leave to remain.
</p>

<a name="60109-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>As I hope that I made clear during Second Reading, I do not oppose the Government&#039;s purpose in Clause 1. Currently, unsuccessful applicants for leave to remain or variation of leave have two opportunities to appeal against refusal, once at the point at which the decision is made and once against the subsequent decision to remove the applicant from the UK. The Government, rightly in my view, seek to simplify the system so that unsuccessful applicants have just one opportunity to appeal. However, it is clear from what every noble Lord speaking in the debate has said that there are some major problems with the mechanism used to achieve this aim as the Bill is currently drafted. While the Government have gone some way to address the problems that have been identified, I do not believe that we are quite there yet. In tabling amendments in this group, noble Lords seek to lay out alternative means of structuring provisions in Clause 1 to achieve the aim of a one-stop appeal without the difficulties created by the scheme as currently drafted.
</p>

<a name="60109-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>As other noble Lords have said, there are two principal difficulties with the Bill. First, failed applicants for variation of leave or leave to remain will be able to exercise their appeal only when they have left the UK. That is unsatisfactory for a number of reasons, particularly in relation to international students. About 30 per cent of international students seek leave to remain during their time in the UK. Common reasons are: to finish a PhD, to attend a viva or a graduation ceremony, or to move from one course of study to another. It used to be the case that students were commonly given an inadequate period of leave on their original visa, and so had to extend to complete a course as a result of a mistake on the part of an entry clearance officer. I am happy to say that that happens much less frequently now as a result of recent efforts made by UK Visas. But in the circumstances that I have described, having to leave the UK to appeal against a decision not to grant leave to remain could seriously damage an international student&#039;s studies, perhaps even preventing them completing their studies or graduating. For students from China who want to stay an extra couple of weeks to attend a graduation ceremony, the expense and delay occasioned in returning home to lodge an appeal could probably mean that they missed that ceremony. That may seem a narrow point, but it is worth bearing in mind that 51 per cent of applications for leave to remain come from students. So I think it is extremely important that the one-stop appeal that the Government seek to create should be exercisable in the UK.
<a name="time_3"></a>
<a name="60109-15_time0"></a><h5>4.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60109-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>The second problem with the scheme set out in the Bill as currently drafted relates to the operation of Clause 1 together with Clause 11, which removes the provisions that allow for leave to continue pending appeal. Without that provision, applicants for leave to remain whose leave expires while they are awaiting a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC17"></a>

decision would become illegal overstayers as soon as they are told that their applications had been unsuccessful.
</p>

<a name="60109-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>This point was made powerfully during Second Reading, but what it means in practice is that even the most law-abiding individuals, who pick up their bags and head straight to the airport as soon as they discover that they have been refused, would leave the country as illegal overstayers. In all probability that fact would be stamped on their passports on their way out of the country, although I understand that in a letter from the DCA it is said that they will not be stamped. It would be helpful if the Minister could provide clarification on that point because, as other noble Lords have said, if that were to be the case, it is very likely to influence immigration applications and could well restrict ability to travel in the future.
</p>

<a name="60109-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>The Government have already gone some way towards recognising that this was not the intended consequence of the Bill. Clause 13 has been introduced to ensure that applicants in this position will not be liable for prosecution. That is helpful, but not sufficient. Applicants with no legal right to be in the UK have no right to work or study or to receive primary healthcare. It is important that such applicants have continued leave pending the outcome of their appeals.
</p>

<a name="60109-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Again, I should like to remind the House that more than half of the applicants we are talking about are international students. The Government have made it clear that they do not wish to criminalise such students, but can the Minister go further and reassure the Committee that it is not the Government&#039;s intention to prevent them from studying or receiving healthcare, or to prejudice their chances of getting other visas in the future?
</p>

<a name="60109-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>I hope that the truth is that there is broad agreement on the principle that the one-stop appeal should be exercisable in the UK and provide for the continuation of leave until the appeal has been determined. If that is so, I believe that the amendments now before us offer some workable mechanisms to achieve that.
</p>

<a name="60109-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>Amendment No. 1 is the bluntest approach. It simply removes subsections (2) and (3) in Clause 1. Subsection (2) would remove the right of appeal set out in the Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 against a refusal to vary a person&#039;s leave to enter or remain in the UK. Subsection (3) would remove the right of appeal against a,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;variation of a person&#039;s leave to enter or remain in the UK&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>So the effect of Amendment No. 1 would be to restore the status quo. That is a possible solution because, under Section 96 of the 2002 Act, the Government already have the power to deny a person who has already had an in-country appeal against refusal to vary leave a subsequent appeal against refusal.
</p>

<a name="60109-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>Amendment No. 1 also paves the way for Amendment No. 8 and others and it probes further the question of whether the Government could use existing powers to achieve the one-stop appeal. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC18"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC18</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Amendment No. 8 makes the proposed mechanism explicit but does no more than the existing legislation allows.
</p>

<a name="60109-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>Amendment No. 10 takes us into slightly different territory. This amendment, though not technically effective, outlines an alternative scheme. The scheme would enable the Secretary of State to give notice that an application had been unsuccessful and, simultaneously, serve a removal notice. The applicant would have one opportunity to appeal against both decisions, in the UK, and his or her leave would be deemed to continue until that process had been exhausted.
</p>

<a name="60109-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>Amendments Nos. 9 and 11 are an attempt at an effective means of achieving the scheme described in Amendment No. 10 and, in my view, offer the best and most comprehensive solution to the problems that have been identified. If the Minister is unwilling to adopt such a far-reaching solution, later amendments standing in the names of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, will offer the opportunity to deal at least with the problems the scheme set out in the Bill would pose for international students.
</p>

<a name="60109-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>I shall listen with interest to what my noble friend the Minister has to say in response to the various schemes that have been proposed. I hope that some mutually acceptable compromise can be reached.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60109-15_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   Perhaps I may add a word before the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, gets to his feet. The first half of the speech by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick&#151;all of which I agree with, I hasten to add&#151;concentrated quite rightly on the issues that directly affect students. She tempted us to look at the issues raised by my Amendments Nos. 2 and 6. She asked some very proper questions, but they would put the Minister in a difficult position. It might be possible for the Minister to answer those questions when we come to the second group, if the noble Baroness feels that that is acceptable.

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>It has been argued that this is the wrong place to be engaging in this debate&#151;it should be taking place in the Chamber&#151;but when I look up at the picture facing me I appeal to the Minister to sit watching it as a matter of conscience and not to have these people rushed away to doom without a proper appeals process. I wanted to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, not out of interest on behalf of higher education but on behalf of a broader United Kingdom <br>&nbsp;<br>

interest. It is particularly relevant to mention international students because half out of the 150,000 appeals a year is an enormous number.
</p>

<a name="60109-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>These students do not do us a favour in coming here. They pay very well for the opportunity. Not only do they pay well, but they contribute immensely to the development of our research base. The noble Baroness said that one third of research students are international. In engineering, 50 per cent of the PhD students are from overseas. These are young people of the highest quality coming at the height of their intellectual development, ability and imaginative thinking to contribute to our intellectual capital. So we have a major national interest in economic terms&#151;to which I will return in a moment&#151;and in developing our intellectual capital to ensure that, as has been argued in this debate, we have an appeal system which facilitates them making their cases effectively and economically by an appeal in this country rather than having to go abroad and argue it from there, which is a disaster for them. In terms of trying to attract students from the world, to know that they face such a hazard&#151;extensions, for particular reasons, are necessary in about half of all cases&#151;is an own goal.
</p>

<a name="60109-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>I will mention more explicitly the national rather than universal interest. I am not making a political point&#151;heaven forfend&#151;but the last year that this country had a positive balance on trade and services happens to have been in 1997. In 1998, the deficit rose in round numbers to close on &#163;10 billion. In 2000, it was &#163;20 billion. In 2002, it was &#163;30 billion. In 2004, still rising, it was &#163;40 billion. We desperately need to foster ways of earning overseas currency. It behoves us to think very carefully about how we can foster the development of overseas students coming to this country.

<a name="60109-16_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I do not wish to speak for any length of time. I am also interested in the case of international students and I echo the remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, and the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. I take on board what the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said about considering student issues in relation to the second grouping, so I will not say much now. The best case, which applies particularly in relation to the point just made by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, is that we should have an in-country appeals system. This is what I understand the first group of amendments to be about. From the point of view of those of us on these Benches, that would be a better solution than making exceptions, which is what, as I understand it, amendments in the second group do. Our preference would be for a good, clear answer on this first group of amendments.

It was due to what an Italian correspondent once descried to me in a letter as &quot;the exigencies of the epoch&quot;, which he spelt without an &quot;h&quot;. Those exigencies also applied when I spoke at Second Reading of the Bill, when I had left the keys of my locker at home and therefore was somewhat strained, in terms of speaking with any relevance to the <br>&nbsp;<br>

matters in front of us. I shall be very brief, but if there is a tinge of Second Reading to my remarks, I hope I shall, in the circumstances, be excused because of my previous omission.
</p>

<a name="60109-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>I think I am right in saying that I am the only Member of the Committee who served as Higher Education Minister. At that stage, we were seeking to increase the number of overseas students coming to this country. It was a fact that 24 heads of state&#151;in what was a rather smaller United Nations in those days&#151;had been educated in the United Kingdom and there is no question that people coming here to be educated has greatly benefited British trade thereafter. However, I implemented regulations introduced by my predecessor that overseas students had to pay full costs. It could be argued that our ambition and that provision were contradictory. I well remember the Commonwealth education ministers&#039; conference in 1984, which was the first opportunity the Commonwealth had of expressing an opinion on the subject. My right honourable friend Sir Keith Joseph was averse to attending conferences of that sort and so sent me in his place. The conference was a rerun of the Battle of Rorke&#039;s Drift and I would not have missed it for anything, but I could not deny that we were creating a major obstacle to our ambition then. I am delighted to say that we have overcome it by the system of scholarships that we have used.
</p>

<a name="60109-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>The rules then involved a commitment on the part of the student to leave the country after his studies had been completed. I can remember any number of students who approached me as a constituency Member of Parliament to ask whether there was any way in which they could subvert that rule. Speaking very generally, it could be said that the Bill restores some aspects of those rules by making it more difficult for the student to achieve that ambition. I shall be interested in the Minister&#039;s reply when she comes to make it&#151;I think she may make it as soon as I sit down&#151;and, unless this stretches her terms of reference, her view of how the Government square the provisions in the Bill with seeking to solve the problems of the NHS by persuading doctors and nurses to come to this country when they are badly needed in the third world.

<a name="60109-16_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  I am grateful to all Members of the Committee who have spoken. I should begin by saying that there is no attempt at impropriety in having this Committee in this room. In fact, I argue that it is an advantage. I say to the noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Dholakia, that it has been my experience that the general policy of the Liberal Democrat Party in the Lords has been to use Committee to probe, not to vote, in order to extract from Ministers, with great success in my case, the concessions or explanations that are appropriate in a Committee. I hope that the intimacy of being in this room will enable us to explore these issues in greater detail. My understanding is that as soon as the Committee appears on the Order Paper it is open to any noble Lord to question or challenge that it is held <br>&nbsp;<br>

here and I understand that that has not happened. Therefore, we are here by virtue of the procedure having worked appropriately and properly. I should add that the last person in the world with any say in where the debate happens is the Minister. However, I am personally delighted that we are in Grand Committee, because it gives me the opportunity to go through in great detail the issues that noble Lords are concerned about, to listen very carefully, as I hope that I have always done, and to seek to make changes when appropriate, within the confines of government policy, but recognising the expertise that noble Lords have.

<a name="60109-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a> I am grateful to noble Lords who have already had conversations on this Bill with me, and to the organisations whose members have come to see me, and who are coming to see me again next week, who have proved invaluable not only in raising issues of concern for them but also in giving me ideas and thoughts about what might be done around the Bill, or beyond the Bill. As with all legislation, a great deal can be achieved outside the legislation; sometimes, one might even argue that more can be achieved in ensuring that systems work well, especially in this area of policy.
</p>

<a name="60109-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, said, we are in correspondence with the Constitution Committee. I am very happy to meet representatives of the committee and to discuss in further detail my response to its letter, and to enter into further correspondence with the noble Lord, Lord Holme, or other members of the committee, if that would be appropriate. I am very happy to do that at any time. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, is no longer present, but as regards the Joint Committee on Human Rights, I understand that the correspondence is currently with the Home Secretary, who will reply shortly to the report. I received the report when I went on what was, as it turned out, a very short Christmas break; none the less, I know that my right honourable friend the Home Secretary will deal with that as soon as possible.
</p>

<a name="60109-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>The discussion about students is an important part of the next group of amendments. I appreciate why the matter has been raised; indeed, when we considered how to group these amendments, I knew that there was always a danger that we would end up with one huge group. However, the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, was right in saying that her agreement was to explore the principles first before looking at the matter in more detail, so I shall resist the temptation to say too much about students, although I shall do so fully under the next group. I hope that that is acceptable to the Committee. Noble Lords may wish to raise other points in the later debate, so it might be more appropriate and proper to discuss the matter then.
</p>

<a name="60109-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>I must tell the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, that the painting that he mentioned&#151;and I am very grateful to the right reverend Prelate for going to look at it for me&#151;is on the parable of forgiveness. It is the story of someone who has been forgiven for refusing to forgive someone else, and so being condemned. There must be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC22"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC22</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

so many analogies with regard to that picture for Ministers in their operation in your Lordships&#039; House. I shall not attempt to deal with that matter, but it will come back to me; I shall keep it with me for the duration of the Bill, and find ways in which to bring it in at appropriate moments.
</p>

<a name="60109-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>I am pleased that there is a general agreement that the principle behind the Bill of a one-stop appeal has been accepted across the Committee. Although the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, in particular, and other noble Lords, have felt that the Bill was controversial, that is the fundamental issue behind the Bill and we have a degree of agreement on it, which is important in considering the other aspects of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60109-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a> I made the invitation at Second Reading very deliberately to noble Lords to come back on the question of in-country appeals. That was not because we are incapable in Government of coming up with solutions; but noble Lords bring to Committee experience and expertise that ensures that our legislation is better at the end of the day. It was on that basis that I made the invitation, so I am sorry if the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, felt that somehow I was not doing my job properly. It is always my experience that we have an enrichment of the legislation as a consequence of what noble Lords bring to the debate, and this is no exception, in that noble Lords have rightly spelt out some of the issues and rightly come forward with ideas and proposals that I can take away and consider. So I put on the record that I propose to take away and consider properly Amendments Nos. 1, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 34, as being a route to achieving what I want to achieve, but in an understanding of what noble Lords seek to do.
</p>

<a name="60109-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>I shall go through each of the amendments, because other amendments, such as those of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, are not covered in the package that I have just described. I shall go through why I am not accepting the amendments <i>per se</i>. As I always have to declare immediately, I am not the Minister responsible for this policy&#151;I am not even in the department responsible for the policy. I am a volunteer in doing this Bill. Will I regret it? We shall find out. I therefore know that Members of the Committee will understand, particularly in these circumstances, it is right and proper that my role is to consider carefully with them what we might do but to take it back to the appropriate department with the degree of commitment that I can give in those circumstances. I am sure that that is understood, but I felt it right and proper to volunteer for this Bill in view of the incredible workload being undertaken by my noble friend the Minister for the Home Office. Our difficulty with Amendment No. 1 is that it does not remove the problem of the separation of the different decisions. So the fundamental principle to which we must adhere is the one appeal. That is why the amendment as it currently stands does not quite work for us.
</p>

<a name="60109-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Dholakia, talked in great detail on Amendment No. 8  and I want to consider carefully some of the technical points they raised. The difficulty with Section 96 certification on which this part mainly relies is that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC23"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC23</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

we end up with two appeals. That is why the legislation needs to be updated and changed. I am sure that Members of the Committee will appreciate that if we did not have to do this, we would not do so. Existing legislation does not achieve the same thing. I do not have the statistics requested by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. I do not know whether I can obtain them for him, but I shall undertake to try. Our desire to ensure that we get a single appeal in place prevents those two amendments working as effectively as they might.
</p>

<a name="60109-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Amendments Nos. 9, 11 and 34 work better in creating an effective single appeal mechanism. The noble Lord said that Amendment No. 11 is the main part of that package, creating a new power to remove someone from the UK notwithstanding that they have continuing leave under the proposed provision until the appeal rights are exhausted. The variation decision does not trigger the right of appeal, but the removal decision would by virtue of Amendment No. 9. I will look carefully at whether the package works. I do not believe that it does, but on the intention behind it we would have to ensure that we could instil the degree of flexibility used. I am not sure that we achieve that with the package as it currently stands. However, I am certainly very keen to go away and consider the intention behind the amendments.
</p>

<a name="60109-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>Amendment No. 10, like a number of others, was supported by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. I accept that it is important because it recognises the importance of the one-stop appeal system we are trying to achieve. There are some technical problems with it, which is why I cannot say that it is fantastic and I will take it away. However, I entirely accept the intention behind it.
</p>

<a name="60109-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, drew to my attention to the fact that Amendment No. 16 is not grouped with Amendment No. 5. I wondered because my speaking notes for both are pretty much the same. The noble Earl will discover that he is leading the group headed by Amendment No. 16 and I should be grateful if he said something so that our procedures work. I hope to deal effectively with the same question. The noble Earl is right and I looked at whether the Constitutional Reform Act, which is engrained forever in my soul as important legislation, was strictly relevant. He will know better than I that the term &quot;Secretary of State&quot; in legislation refers to a Secretary of State. In the Constitutional Reform Act, we have been clear about the circumstances in which the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs has a particular role to play. However, when I examined the issue carefully, it seemed that the policy that is the fundamental part of the legislation&#151;that is, maintaining effective immigration controls and looking at secure boarders&#151;rests with the Home Office. Obviously, a critical part of that is consultation with the stakeholders involved. It is right that the requirement to make orders and regulations needs to rest with the Secretary of State for home affairs.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60109-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>If the noble Earl does not mind, I would be very keen to discuss this issue beyond the Committee. This is about making sure that the appellate system maintains its independence from policy formulation and that the lawyers implement it justly and effectively. We have tried to ensure in the way the Bill works that the correct role of the Secretary of State for home affairs is policy formulation and determination and that the role of the Department for Constitutional Affairs is, in a sense, looking after the appellate system and making sure that decisions are taken appropriately and fairly while not interfering in any way with judicial independence. I think we have got that right but I would be interested in talking further with the noble Earl if, on reflection, he feels that there is more work to be done on the issue. If the Constitutional Committee picks up on this again, I am sure that my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor would be keen to have that discussion. It is, of course, for him to determine ultimately whether we have got this right, and thus far he believes that we have.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>The Constitution Committee is clear that we need to specify and understand the policy and the practical implications of the role of the Lord Chancellor and the role of the Home Secretary. This has become very clear under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005.
</p>

<a name="60109-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>The point at issue is that Section 90 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 2002 deals with family visitor appeals and Section 112 gives a general power to make regulations under the part on appeals to the Secretary of State. The Lord Chancellor is given specific powers in Section 81. There is therefore a clear division, as has been mentioned. Will the Minister look at this aspect and come back on it? I well understand the distinction she mentioned, but there is a need to ensure that it is specified in primary legislation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60109-17_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am very grateful to the noble Lord for his intervention. My position is that I have looked at this and think that we have got it right. But the noble Lord makes an important point about the 2002 Act and, as I have indicated, I am more than happy to invite my noble and learned friend, in particular, to discuss the matter more fully. If that were to be suggested by the Constitution Committee or the noble Earl, perhaps we could, having had that conversation, make a note of it in the form of a letter to the Committee so that noble Lords can see where we have got to on the issue.

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>There is not a resistance in the Government to a role for the Lord Chancellor/Secretary of State for Constitutional affairs where appropriate, but, in this particular case, it seems to us that it is important that the structure for immigration policy in particular needs to rest in one place&#151;and that place, most <br>&nbsp;<br>

appropriately, is with the Secretary of State for home affairs. I undertake, of course, to look at the issue again.
</p>

<a name="60109-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>As to Amendment No. 28 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, I had the benefit of meeting the DIS&#151;it was one of the organisations which came to see me&#151;and I am grateful for its contribution to our deliberations. We have no intention of trying to turn any individual who is compliant with the law as it stands into a criminal. Indeed, I shall say that in very loud terms, particularly in regard to our discussions about students. My difficulty with the noble Lord&#039;s amendment is that it creates a discrete right of appeal against refusal to vary leave on human rights grounds only. As the noble Lord will appreciate, it makes an incentive for appellants to go down that route, whether genuine or not, in order to extend their stay in the country.


</p>

<a name="60109-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>In this legislation and the work that accompanies it we must try to ensure that we have the best possible opportunity for appeals to be heard in appropriate circumstances. That must be true of human rights appeals. In other words, flooding appeals into the category of human rights, because that is the way that people feel that they can appeal, whether appropriately or inappropriately, does not do the system any good and it does not deal with some of the important issues. However, I have indicated that the groups of amendments that relate to in-country appeals will address the underlying point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. I want to explain why his amendment does not stand but shall do so in the context of indicating that I will look more fully at the matter.
</p>

<a name="60109-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>Although I accept the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, that Amendment No. 29 could have been in a different group, this is an important opportunity to talk a little about the way that the Home Office seeks to get information. In doing so, we can address some of the concerns that have been raised. This was a learning experience for me, too, in discovering precisely what happens. The system has moved on and is different from the system that I remember from some years ago.
</p>

<a name="60109-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>Noble Lords will probably know that country of origin information is compiled from a wide range of sources. That obviously includes the Foreign Office, the UN High Commission for Refugees, human rights organisations and the media. It does not contain any Home Office opinion or policy. The independent Advisory Panel on Country Information has been set up, in part to ensure that the Home Office&#039;s country of origin information is accurate, balanced, impartial and as up to date as possible. The panel&#039;s role is to review and provide advice on the information produced by the Home Office. The panel provides expert external scrutiny to ensure that the information meets the high standards and that an appellant is able to use any information produced anywhere by any organisation&#151;governmental or non-governmental&#151;about the situation that he may wish to bring forward and to ensure that the best possible information is available to him in making his case.

</p>

<a name="60109-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>The panel is chaired by Professor Stephen Castles, who is a director of refugee studies at Oxford University. Representatives include academics and people from organisations with expertise and experience in country information and refugee fields, including the Refugee Council and the UN High Commission for Refugees. We have now created a much better system. When my right honourable friend Des Browne was the Minister responsible for immigration and asylum policy, he announced that the country information and the policy functions carried out by the Country Information and Policy Unit would be separated. He accepted the advisory panel&#039;s advice that, as a matter of good practice, these functions should be undertaken by different parts of the organisation because of perceptions that the Home Office country information material would not be impartial while it was produced by a unit engaged in the development of the country&#039;s asylum policy. That change has now happened and the information has been transferred to a different section, which operates as a service in itself.
</p>

<a name="60109-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>We have now created the opportunity for high-quality, impartial, balanced and accurate information to be made available. On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment because we think that we have achieved what he seeks. I am happy to provide the noble Lord with more information about that if it would be of any use to him or other Members of the Committee.
</p>

<a name="60109-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>Finally, exemption from prosecution as an overstayer is the subject of Amendment No. 30. As noble Lords have indicated, Clause 13 creates three conditions that need to be fulfilled for a person to be exempt, including that a removal decision must have been made. As I have indicated, if we are looking at in-country appeals, the amendment becomes redundant because it would have a huge effect on what happens in Clause 13(2). If people are allowed to stay in the country to appeal, the issue goes away. Regardless of that, the Government have no desire to criminalise anyone who complies with what he is asked to do within a reasonable timescale. I will look at the amendment in the context of what I have said on the other amendments.
</p>

<a name="60109-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>I hope that this has been useful in considering the overall, overarching policy. I look forward to the next group of amendments when we will be considering particular groups of individuals. Members of the Committee will no doubt make a very strong case, which will be useful as I discuss with Ministers in the Home Office how we take this forward. I hope that that is helpful and, on that basis, that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.

<a name="60109-17_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   I should like to make a couple of points on the Minister&#039;s very helpful speech. On the correspondence of the Constitution Committee, the noble Baroness said that the reply would be made as soon as possible. We need to know whether it will be available to this Committee in time to discuss it. The same applies to the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which the Minister said was on the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC27"></a>

point of being sent. We need to have that in front of us. Unless we have an official reaction from the Government to both important documents, we cannot decide properly the context in which the various amendments which have been discussed this afternoon should be seen.
</p>

<a name="60109-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>Obviously, we are grateful to the Minister for saying that she will look at Amendments Nos. 1, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 34. My only problem is that we have heard that before. I have lost count of the number of times the Minister in the other place, Mr Tony McNulty, said that he would look at issues that had been raised, and nothing emerged. Many of the undertakings given by Mr McNulty still remain to be fulfilled.
</p>

<a name="60109-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>I must acknowledge that the country of origin information unit has improved enormously. The Advisory Panel on Country Information is also a very useful government initiative. I have had recent contact with officials on these matters and I find they are very receptive. If you point out errors or omissions in the documents, which are all available on the Home Office website, they will look at those matters carefully. From my own experience, they do a far more thorough trawl of the independent literature which is available from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the UN Commission on Human Rights than used to be the case. Even more importantly, they reference the documents so that you can go back to the originals if you want to see the context in which they were written. I congratulate the Home Office on the enormous improvements that have been made in this area of its work.
</p>

<a name="60109-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>My anxiety is that immigration judges do not look at the vast documents available to them. I had occasion to get out those on Nigeria and Ghana in connection with their recent addition to the safe list. Each was roughly 100 pages long. I am afraid that busy immigration judges and officials do not read the documents as carefully as they ought to, nor are they always as well evidenced in cases taken before immigration judges as one would like. That is a matter of mechanics; it is not the fault of the information policy unit or the advisory panel.

<a name="60109-18_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I have to reply to the noble Lord.

The problem has been Christmas: I got the Joint Committee on Human Rights document as we left and I know that noble Lords will not mind even <br>&nbsp;<br>

the Government having a Christmas break. It is my intention&#151;this always happens&#151;that all correspondence will be copied to all Members of Committees. Members of the Committee who have not worked with this Minister on the Bill may find that they drown in correspondence before the end of the Committee stage.
</p>

<a name="60109-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>Secondly, I have said that I will consider the amendments and I will do so. This Minister says that this Minister will consider them and this Minister will. It is with the blessing and support of my honourable friend Mr McNulty that I will do so, as I would not dream of saying that otherwise. I mean that, and I will ensure that that happens. I hope that noble Lords will accept that I will do it.
</p>

<a name="60109-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>Too many Members of the Committee have theological ability for me to go there. However, as a Minister I know how many times noble Lords, Ministers, officials and voluntary organisations, in particular, regret having to wait for a Bill to come round to change or amend something or to recognise a new position. The flexibility of secondary legislation should not be underestimated. I think that your Lordships&#039; House takes its role on secondary legislation just as seriously as it does on primary legislation, and I would be very worried if noble Lords felt that putting matters in primary legislation for all time was the way forward on something as important and dynamic as this policy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60109-18_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   I thank the Minister for her helpful explanations on a number of the amendments that we tabled. I shall highlight the key issues very quickly. The first is that a number of noble Lords have made comments and the Minister has said that she will consider them. If at all possible, it would be very helpful if responses could come from the Home Office during this Committee rather than waiting for Report.
</p>

<a name="60109-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>Secondly, the technicality of the issue that we are discussing clearly demonstrates the need for some consolidation of the immigration legislation&#151;a matter which my noble friend Lord Avebury has raised on a number of occasions. As was the case with the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, the help of the ILPA just about saved my Christmas holiday by enabling me to know what I am talking about. It would be helpful if the Government could give some consideration to consolidating the legislation.
</p>

<a name="60109-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>Thirdly, the one issue that has come up most in this discussion is one-stop appeals. I ask the Minister to consider the arguments that we have put forward. Proper scrutiny of administrative decisions does not disrupt colleges, businesses or family life and it can be fed back to improve their quality. It does not put appeal rights into secondary legislation or turn people with valid leave to be here into overstayers, and it does not blur the distinction between those who comply with immigration control and those who do not. If we can move on that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_23"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 2, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 6, 31 and 33, which are supported by the noble Lords, Lord Dholakia and Lord Avebury. With the leave of the Committee, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 7, 32 and 35, which stand in the name of my noble friend Lady Morris of Bolton. My noble friend sends her apologies to the Committee because she is unexpectedly unable to be here, and she has asked me to speak to her amendments.
</p>

<a name="60109-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>Our lengthy but, I hope, very constructive and productive debate on the first group of amendments has served as a proper backcloth to this second group. I have made it clear that our preferred solution would be to find a way to ensure that the appeals system works effectively for all. My argument now is that if the Government feel that they are unable to move ahead with changes to Clause 1&#151;and I am very heartened to hear what the Minister said about looking at Amendments Nos. 9, 11 and 34 between now and Report&#151;then there are certain groups for which exceptions should be made. The narrowly drawn categories referred to in my amendments are students and children in certain circumstances. The contributions made in the last group by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick of Undercliffe, and the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, were very helpful in setting the tone for this group of amendments.
</p>

<a name="60109-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>These are people who have entered the country legally in the first instance. The disruption that they would face if forced to leave the UK could cause administrative problems and give rise to successful human rights claims in the courts. The exemption for students in the amendments would not prove to be costly or overburdensome for the Home Office and, quite simply, it would be the right thing to do. Real examples of potential iniquity abound, and I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick of Undercliffe, could give specific examples of when real hardship would follow.

<a name="60109-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>In the past I have quoted the example of a Chinese PhD student who was wrongly refused leave to extend his stay by just three months to complete his work or attend a graduation ceremony. He would, perhaps, have to go home to Shanghai to institute appeal proceedings and in the mean time would lose his opportunity to attend the graduation ceremony or complete a course. That simply lacks sense. Where is the evidence that there is a serious problem with variation appeals in relation to students?
</p>

<a name="60109-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>Certainly, I am grateful to all those who have briefed on these issues in addition to those previously referred to, including the Refugee Children&#039;s Consortium. We have had very helpful briefings from ILPA, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC30"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC30</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Universities UK and UKCOSA, all of which support the amendments in this group. I purposely tabled two different kinds of amendments relating to the problem of students. It may appear that I was being otiose but Amendments Nos. 2 and 6 were tabled to provide a different approach. I hope that the Minister can address all the issues in one go when she responds.
</p>

<a name="60109-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>Amendment No. 2 gives a right of appeal against a refusal to vary leave to those whose original leave was granted for them to study at an education institution on the approved register. I accept that one criticism of this amendment is that it looks at past leave to study at a recognised institution, whereas the application for future leave could be for a purpose unconnected with study or with that institution. So Amendment No. 6 offers a solution to that position. It protects those who move from one course to another or who change institutions or attend a viva voce examination, graduation ceremony or other such event directly connected with the course. Because it creates a new paragraph, (fc), it does not in itself provide for an in-country right of appeal, nor does it address the problem of a person becoming an overstayer between refusal and appeal. Having created a problem in that amendment, to fill the gap I tabled the two consequential amendments to Schedule 1 to ensure an in-country appeal and a continuation of leave pending appeal.
</p>

<a name="60109-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>Amendment No. 31 would ensure that, pending the final decision on an appeal under new paragraph (fc) inserted by the amendment, the appellant&#039;s leave will continue on the same terms and conditions. I note that paragraph 4 was inserted in Committee in another place by government Amendment No. 59. The effect of that amendment was that, despite the provisions of what is now Clause 11, those appealing against a decision to refuse to extend their leave following their recognition as refugees or because they have been given an in-country right of appeal by an order made under the proposed Section 82(2)(fb) would retain their current leave with the attendant rights&#151;for example, to work or to family reunion&#151;during the period between refusal and final determination of the appeal.
</p>

<a name="60109-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>In the debate, the Minister said very little in speaking to the amendment and, for reasons we do not understand, spoke to it in a group on Clause 4 of the Bill, describing it as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;consequential to many of the other elements in clause 4 and should have been included when we drafted the amendments&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee E, 20/10/05; col. 133.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>That appears to be incorrect: new paragraphs (fa) and (fb) of Section 82(2) are inserted by Clause 1 and have nothing to do with Clause 4. The Bill team has confirmed to ILPA that government Amendment No. 59 relates to Clause 11.
</p>

<a name="60109-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>Amendment No. 33 ensures that an appeal under new paragraph (fc), inserted by the amendment, will be in-country.
</p>

<a name="60109-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>I turn to the amendments standing in the name of my noble friend Lady Morris of Bolton. I am grateful in particular to the Refugee Children&#039;s Consortium for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC31"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC31</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

its briefing. It states that these measures are ill-conceived, punitive in nature and will have a hugely detrimental impact on those who are in an already vulnerable group. It goes on to say that the changes will do nothing to improve the protection needs of children, contrary to the explicit duties placed upon public authorities by the Children Act 2004 to safeguard children. In both Houses, the Government have stated that they will ensure that the appeal rights of children and children who have reached 18 years of age will be preserved and continuity of leave protected pending appeal. I welcome that commitment and that it has been honoured as regards continuity of leave and support by the insertion of paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 in another place.
</p>

<a name="60109-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>However, as was pointed out by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, the commitment regarding the substantive appeal right has not been placed on the face of the Bill. It has been indicated in debate that &quot;children&quot; would almost certainly be one of the categories to be later specified as exempt by the Secretary of State. I believe that Members of the Committee will agree that the term &quot;almost certainly&quot; is not the strongest assurance available to the Government. I hope to elicit from the Minister a response that she is able to go significantly further.
</p>

<a name="60109-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>I return to the general theme, having looked briefly at my noble friend&#039;s notes and ensured that I have not omitted anything essential. I note that other noble Lords have tabled amendments underlining that the new system will adversely affect other groups, too. At Second Reading on 6 December, at col. 543, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford asked why we should allow international students to be exempted from the rigors of Clause 1 and about other groups, too. I welcome the fact that other noble Lords have stated that other groups would also be disadvantaged. I shall listen carefully to the arguments put forward by the noble Lords, Lord Dholakia and Lord Avebury.
</p>

<a name="60109-18_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a> Overall, it is clear from what has been said today that this is not a party-political issue. There is agreement around the House that we need to find a common way forward and it is a case of how we will do that. I hope the answer is, &quot;Soon&quot;, and that in government terms that means very soon. I beg to move.

<a name="60109-19_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   I was waiting to contribute to the debate about students, but Members of the Committee who know far more about it than I do have already shot my fox. I do not resent that in any way because the points have been put. However, I reiterate that the effect of the Bill on students is of enormous importance not only to universities but to our reputation abroad among people who will become influential. It is most important. If the issue can be resolved by altering the whole system to an in-country decision-making one, perhaps these amendments are not relevant. But if that is not going to happen, they are very relevant. Students should be exempted from the provisions.

<a name="column_GC32"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC32</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60109-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>I do not know whether Members of the Committee realise the enormity of the contribution made by overseas students throughout the country. That is particularly the case in Scotland where there have always been a large number, particularly of post-graduates. Indeed, some of our universities in Scotland are becoming dependent on the anticipation that they will increase their funding by increasing the number of such students.


</p>

<a name="60109-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>The cost of visas for students has been very important and that issue has been discussed in the House on a number of occasions. However, the Bill will also have a big effect because the news will get round about what happens if you are told you have got to go and you cannot appeal until you get home. Students will understand that and an increasing number of students are already going to Australia or the United States rather than this country, which is alarming universities for a number of reasons.
</p>

<a name="60109-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>The Bill will be wrong in a number of ways from a student&#039;s point of view. Noble Lords have talked about the human rights issue, which matters very much when countries abroad hear about how we are dealing with it. I think figures have been given on the funding question&#151;I am not sure whether the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, reiterated them&#151;but we need to remember that 11 per cent of all students in higher education pay full fees. They pay the whole cost of their course. I think I am right in saying that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60109-19_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   Will my noble friend accept an intervention? I think my noble friend will find that the definition of full cost is left to the institution and that it varies from institution to institution.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60109-19_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My noble friend has day-to-day contact with universities on this matter so he knows that very well, but the point is that the funding is far greater for overseas students and in the universities that I know well it covers the costs. Overseas students account for 11 per cent of all students and they are often paid for by the governments of the countries from which they come, so the governments are watching what happens on this, not just students and their families. Eight per cent of the higher education budget and 38 per cent of the budget of post-graduate students comes from overseas students, so this is a big issue.
</p>

<a name="60109-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>It is not just costs; these people enormously enrich our universities. The universities in Scotland that I know well would be different places if overseas student numbers were reduced. Overseas students enrich the experience of university for home students and are very valuable to people overseas. Above all, we in this country make friends for ever by providing a satisfactory educational experience for overseas students. This may be Second Reading stuff, but if the Bill stays as it is, the experience will not be a happy one for a large number of people.
</p>

<a name="60109-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>The most disillusioning thing for students from abroad, and for the countries from which they come, is when they realise that 25 per cent of decisions have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC33"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC33</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

been reduced on appeal. That is an alarming figure. What is going on when so many decisions are found on appeal to be wrong? What on earth was going wrong in Sheffield when the figure was 90 per cent? Those figures were given at Second Reading. It is extremely shocking. If that is happening, our reputation will go downhill.
</p>

<a name="60109-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>We are losing overseas students in this country&#151;the numbers are reducing. The students are going elsewhere and that will continue if we do not do something about it. I think that the Government should take this matter extremely seriously. This is not just university talk; this is a clear issue that really matters. Anyone who is connected with universities knows how much it matters. I hope that the Minister will look at this issue and solve the problem one way or another&#151;either in the way suggested in the amendments or in the way that we discussed earlier.

</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60109-19_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   First, I apologise for slightly derailing the Committee and concentrating on issues that arose in the first debate. I do not want to repeat the points that I made during that debate; I simply reiterate that Amendments Nos. 2 and 6 would exclude international students from the scheme set out in the Bill and would deprive applicants for leave to remain or variation of leave of an opportunity to appeal against refusal from inside the UK. As I said, that approach would ensure that unsuccessful applicants for leave would be able to stay under the same terms until they had exhausted their appeals.
</p>

<a name="60109-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>I should like the Minister to confirm a point that she did not address in her response to the first question and perhaps I may repeat it now&#151;that is, that the terms under which students stay will be on the same basis as those when they have leave pending the outcome of their appeal. In other words, the in-country right of appeal would include the right to study, the right to work and the right to healthcare, pending the outcome of the appeal.
</p>

<a name="60109-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>I have already set out why I think that the scheme introduced by the Bill is damaging to students. I remind the Committee that it is enormously valuable potentially to prevent the situation whereby students who apply for leave to remain and are wrongly refused are unable to complete courses, attend graduation ceremonies or examinations, move from one course to another or finish writing up their PhDs. I very much appreciate the support for that point made by other noble Lords.
</p>

<a name="60109-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>I do not wish to dwell on the argument that the UK&#039;s reputation as a study destination may be adversely affected by perceptions that the UK is becoming less welcoming. However, I very much support the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, on that basis and I echo them.
</p>

<a name="60109-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>I am delighted that the Minister indicated her willingness to consider a more comprehensive solution. These amendments refer only to students. A more comprehensive solution would be a considerable <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC34"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC34</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

step forward and would ensure that all categories of applicant enjoyed a one-stop in-country appeal. I hope that that will also allow for the continuation of leave pending appeal. Again, perhaps the Minister can clarify that. International students will obviously need to wait to see the terms in which the amendment is brought forward, but it sounds as though they may well be protected from the problems that we and others have anticipated. I look forward to seeing the text of the amendment from the Minister and I hope that the Committee will permit me to return to these issues if any outstanding matters are not addressed in her reply.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="60109-19_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   The names of my noble friends Lord Dholakia and Lord Avebury are appended to the amendments put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and that signifies that they have full support from these Benches.
</p>

<a name="60109-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>At Second Reading we had a very full discussion on all these issues relating to international students. The Minister indicated that she was cognisant of the problems that have been raised here and that she would probably bring forward some fairly positive suggestions. I shall be listening with great interest to her response to these amendments.
</p>

<a name="60109-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>It is worth reiterating the points made earlier during our discussion on the first group of amendments by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and recently by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, about the importance of the contribution made by overseas students to our universities. That is the case not just in financial terms&#151;although it is important in financial terms&#151;but in terms of the diversity of the student body and the wealth that that brings to our own students here in the UK. That point was made many times at Second Reading but it is worth reiterating. This country benefits enormously from the presence of those students.
</p>

<a name="60109-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>With regard to our science base, our scientific effort would be very much reduced without the contribution of overseas postgraduate students. We need to recognise how important those students are and often how difficult it is, particularly in relation to a PhD, when making an initial application to identify precisely how much time is needed. The standard time is three years, but frequently if one is studying for a scientific PhD the experiments may not go as hoped and a little extra time will be needed to finish it. The Minister indicated that she recognised how important that was and how futile it would be to send those students home to reapply for extensions to their visas. Similarly, those who want to stay on for another couple of months to get their results or go through their vivas and then stay for graduation should not be sent home in the mean time. We all recognised that those were fair issues to which some solution was needed.
</p>

<a name="60109-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, was right when she said that we should recognise how quickly information gets around among the student community. There has already been a significant dip this year in the number of applications from overseas <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC35"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC35</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

students, and that harm is being done by raising visa fees. The Government have been too brazen in saying that that significant dip in the number of applications does not matter. Some people might say that we already rip off such students with very high fees; there is no reason why we should also rip them off with the cost of visas. That point illustrates how word has already got round among the international student community. If we make it very difficult to apply or reapply for visas, we shall lose even more students. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to our pleas.

<a name="60109-20_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   I should like to speak to Amendment No. 7 in this group, which has already been referred to in the introductory remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. I had not intended to speak on this matter until I received a briefing from the Refugee Children&#039;s Consortium and noted that among the organisations concerned was Save the Children&#151;an organisation with which I have been connected for a long time. It seemed to me that what was said in the briefing was very important.
</p>

<a name="60109-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>Like the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, I welcome the statement clearly setting out that it is accepted that the category of minors reaching the age of 18 will be regarded as exempt. I am very grateful for that. On the other hand, the view of the consortium, with which I am inclined to agree, is that children&#039;s rights are too important to be left to ministerial discretion and affirmative orders. The consortium thinks that the assurances do not enable Parliament to scrutinise the ambit of children&#039;s appeal rights which may be provided during the passage of the Bill. It therefore thinks that it is important that the position of children is made absolutely clear in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60109-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>In its briefing the consortium attaches some horrendous reports of cases where unaccompanied children have suffered grievously. In particular, a child of 17 was trafficked to the United Kingdom after being sold to the trafficker by her father. She managed to escape and tried to claim asylum. Her application was refused and she was granted discretionary leave for one year only. She applied to extend this leave but had no response. She was eventually evicted from her room and started to sleep rough. Last week, she was spotted near a soup kitchen by one of the gang of traffickers from whom she escaped and was abducted again. That no doubt is an extreme case. On the other hand, it shows that there are problems with unaccompanied children and that it should be clear in the Bill that it is the Government&#039;s intention to ensure that there are exemptions.

<a name="60109-20_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Listowel:</b>  I support Amendment No. 7 and what the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, said. I welcome the news that such children are almost certainly to be exempt from the loss of a right to an appeal.

I listened carefully during Second Reading when the matter was discussed and thought that a powerful case had been made by those involved with our educational institutions across the country. We have no difficulty because Clause 1 takes away the rights that have been enjoyed in particular by students. We agreed to put our name to the amendments for a clear reason: that it gives all students studying at an approved institution an in-country right of appeal against a refusal to vary leave.
</p>

<a name="60109-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>Clause 1 abolishes most existing appeals against decisions to vary leave. The amendment provides a new right of appeal on the face of primary legislation. It meets the Government&#039;s five-year strategy on immigration where they clearly state the need for sponsorship. Where sponsorship is available, I see no reason why it cannot work with the general strategy in the five-year plan which rightly places a greater emphasis on the role of sponsors. If work to identify responsible sponsors is successful, and a recognised educational institution wants a student to stay and that student wants to stay, there should be an opportunity to challenge a refusal before it takes effect and the student is forced to leave the UK. The Minister should consider that point in responding to the amendment.

<a name="60109-20_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   I apologise for speaking in the wrong place and shall try to speak briefly in the proper place. I hope that the Minister will take it from me, who was in the Civil Service brigade for 30 years, that when a civil servant has responsibility for a Bill one needs sharp elbows to get the blessed thing through. Too many amendments are not welcome. Perhaps if I were that civil servant, I should be saying, &quot;This is the higher education lobby at it again&quot;. That is not the case in my mind or, I believe, in the mind of others. The issue is material to enabling one of our few leading world-class industries to contribute to the national income we have a growing negative balance of trade in services and goods. It is a highly competitive industry in which states are vigorous in seeking to increase market share, and ours is declining. I hope that this broad national interest, on top of that of the universities, will be borne in mind by the Government.

Department of Health&#151;as well as local authorities whose duty it is to provide the required protection on the ground. I would be most grateful if the Minister would take back with her the need for real joined-up government and co-operative working.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60109-20_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   I shall ask one question and make two observations. My question, which follows up on something that was said earlier in this Committee, is how many other countries which have a substantial higher education hinterland have a provision of a similar nature to the one brought into play in the Bill? If the answer is only a small number, then that reinforces the points that have been made about the likelihood of our having a declining share. Of course I acknowledge that my supposition may be wrong, but it will be easier if we deal on the basis of facts.
</p>

<a name="60109-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>My two observations are that I am conscious that all the figures we have show that the proportion of overseas students among post-graduates is much higher than among under-graduates. I understand the resentment among some British families with children of higher education age that they are being excluded from courses because of the weight of higher education applications from overseas, but I think that that is an under-graduate rather than a post-graduate issue. On post-graduate figures, it is quite clear that our institutions are massively dependent on being filled by people from abroad. This is obviously highly subjective, but I cite a single statistic from 10 or 15 years ago. My middle son did a taught MBA in Scotland in a course of 180 students, of whom 30 were British and 150 were from abroad. It was to the credit of the Scottish institution that it attracted 150 students, but it has reached the point where, if there are only 30 British students among the 180, there is a risk of diminishing the Britishness of the experiences. That was a post-graduate case.
</p>

<a name="60109-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>My other observation is that when I was in the private sector I always invested a day every year in going to listen to the late Herman Kahn from the Hudson Institute in the United States, who was one of the futurologists of the 1960s and 1970s. I recall him saying that the British had nothing to worry about in the post-industrial society because their reputation in government, education and medicine would give them a pre-eminent place. If our market share is slipping in one of those areas, then it is a cause for concern for the Government and for higher education institutions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="60109-20_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   I do not want to belabour Amendment No. 2, which has already been dealt with very thoroughly, except to point out that we got over the problem that at one time there were colleges that were operating mainly by way of enabling people claiming to be students to gain entrance to the UK. As the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, told noble Lords when we were considering the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill in 2004, the Government dealt with that problem as part of the managed migration review by creating a register of approved providers, which he said would be operational by the end of 2004.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC38"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC38</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60109-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>The Minister will no doubt confirm that any person entering the UK as a student has to be enrolled at an institution which is listed in the register of education and training providers and that she is satisfied that effective arrangements are in place to ensure that the institutions themselves are effectively monitoring that their overseas students are not abusing the system, as outlined in the Home Office&#039;s <i>Selective Admission: Making Migration Work for Britain</i>, which was published in July last year. That Home Office document refers to the register of learning providers, which is a different title from the one used in the rules. It is a small point. They are no doubt referring to the same register and I suggest that the wording might be harmonised.
</p>

<a name="60109-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>As regards Amendments Nos. 6, 31 and 33, we wholeheartedly agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, even though those amendments have a more limited effect than Amendment No. 2 and would be seen as a second best&#151;or, rather, a third best because we really want the Minister to agree to alter Clause 1. This would avoid all the discussions on different categories that we are having now. We consider that even more than the sponsors of workers and the self-employed, educational institutions that are on this register should be trusted to ensure that students leave at the end of their course of study or, where they apply for an extension, that it is with the support of the sponsoring institution. There is a list of requirements that have to be satisfied by a student applying for an extension under the rules. Rule 60 contains eight different provisions that have to be satisfied&#151;for example, the student has to have performed satisfactorily both in attendance and exams. If he does not comply with any of the eight conditions that are listed there, he is not entitled to appeal anyway. If the Minister can satisfy the Committee that there are other requirements that ought to be complied with in granting an extension, she could produce a text and the Committee could consider whether they ought to be written into the rules.
</p>

<a name="60109-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>We agree with amendments Nos. 7, 32 and 35 and I draw attention to the fact that at Second Reading the Minister reiterated the undertaking originally given by Mr McNulty that former unaccompanied asylum-seeking children will have a separate right of appeal against refusal or curtailment of leave. At Second Reading the Minister undertook to raise this matter in Committee, so it is disappointing that there is nothing in the Minister&#039;s name on the Marshalled List for us to look at today&#151;unless, of course, she is going to stand up and accept the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, or say how she intends to fulfil her promise after we have left this clause. It might be rather difficult to come back to it at a later stage in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60109-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>Any child who originally applied for asylum should have an in-country appeal against refusal of variation whatever the length or nature of the leave he was given on entry. That right should extend to any person who had not reached the age of 18 on the date of the original application. It should be maintained whether <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC39"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC39</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

or not the person reaches the age of 18 before the application for variation and irrespective of the purpose for which the variation is sought.
</p>

<a name="60109-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>Going back to Amendment No. 3, I do not understand why the Government want to deprive spouses and civil partners of a right of appeal against refusal of indefinite leave to remain under Rule 288 of the rules, which says that ILR may be granted if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the conditions in Rule 287 are satisfied. Any person who does not comply with those conditions is already disqualified from appealing under Section 88 of the 2002 Act. So here we are talking about someone who has been living with his or her partner for two years, under the same roof, in accommodation that they own or occupy exclusively, and who has not had recourse to public funds over that period.
</p>

<a name="60109-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>If circumstances other than those need to be incorporated in the rules, let us do so, but almost every refusal against an application for an extension in circumstances where someone has complied with every condition in the rules will be on Article 8 grounds. It is difficult to imagine a set of facts where the parties are fully in compliance with Rule 287 and yet the Secretary of State could certify that the case was clearly unfounded. Therefore, extinguishing the existing right of appeal of this category of applicants is not likely materially to reduce the number of appeals but merely to ensure that all of them are based on Article 8, with added potential for embarrassment for the Government if any of those cases go to Strasbourg.
</p>

<a name="60109-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>What we are saying about spouses and civil partners seeking ILR also applies to spouses and partners who are bereaved during the probationary period of two years, children or adopted children asking leave to remain with a parent or relative, and parents, grandparents and other dependent relatives. In all those cases, as the Minister can well imagine, Article 8 considerations are likely to arise and the Government&#039;s draconian proposals will therefore not achieve a material reduction in the number of appeals.

<a name="60109-21_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   I have not talked about Amendment No. 4. The purpose of this amendment, which stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Avebury, is to give business people a right of appeal against refusal to vary, including to extend their leave. The conditions of having invested &#163;200,000 and creating two jobs for people in the United Kingdom are taken directly from the requirements set out in Rule 206 of the Immigration Rules. Also, by virtue of paragraph 4 of Schedule 1, the amendment solves the problem created by Clause 11, which makes people overstayers between the refusal and appeal stages.
</p>

<a name="60109-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>This amendment mirrors the one relating to students. It creates a new immigration decision in Section 82(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, and this has the effect of creating a new right of appeal on the face of primary legislation.

</p>

<a name="60109-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>While much attention in debates on this Bill has focused on students, the effects on other groups are just as dramatic. The Government&#039;s five-year strategy acknowledges the benefits to Britain of economic migration, as highlighted by the requirements of the amendment. A business person who was forced to leave the United Kingdom and was technically an overstayer here by operation of Clause 11 could not continue to run a business, and the two or more people employed would also be likely to lose their jobs. Even if the business person had an in-country appeal on human rights grounds&#151;on the basis of, for example, unjustified and disproportionate interference with his right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions&#151;being an overstayer under Clause 11 he could not continue to run his business in the mean time. A victory at appeal would come too late as the business he was seeking to retain would have been destroyed. Such uncertainty would inevitably be a factor that people take into account in deciding whether to base themselves in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="60109-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>There is also the likelihood that some would seek judicial review on the basis that the out-of-country appeal would not provide an effective remedy and that successful appeals would then found claims for compensation and damages.
</p>

<a name="60109-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>While the amendment focuses on the one category of people with their own businesses, it provides an opportunity to raise the difficulties that Clauses 1 and 11 will create for all categories of self-employed people and workers. The Government&#039;s five-year strategy suggests a greater focus on sponsors and that they intend to create a register of employers, just as they have created a register of educational institutions.


</p>

<a name="60109-21_para4"></a>

It creates a new immigration decision in Section 82(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which has the effect of creating a new right of appeal in primary legislation. I am raising this issue because the matter was discussed at considerable length at Second Reading by the noble Lord, Lord Chan, who cannot be with us today. I was approached by several Chinese businesses who are represented by Christine Lee & Co (Solicitors) Limited which has presented a case in relation to the Chinese community in this country.

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>Representatives of the Chinese community had a meeting with the noble Lord, Lord Chan, on 1 December and had the opportunity to speak to him about the effects of the Bill. I am told that:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;the Chinese are generally a reserved community who have never before made public complaints to the British government. However, for the first time in the history of the Chinese <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;The Chinese community firmly believe that the drafters of the Bill have failed to appreciate the serious implications and repercussions which the Bill is likely to have on the ethnic community wishing to invest, work or study in the United Kingdom as well as the adverse effects on the image of the United Kingdom on the international front.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;The Chinese community firmly believe that we are not the only ethnic community whose interests would be adversely affected by the passing of this Bill into law.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;However, the Chinese community are mounting a strong protest against the Bill as it would have wide repercussions on us and our way of life in this country: it would devastate the catering and restaurant industry, discourage Chinese investors from investing in the United Kingdom and greatly reduce the number of Chinese foreign students who believe the British education system is the best in the world.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;Further, the Chinese employers, who are traditionally reliant upon Chinese foreign workers in their restaurants and businesses, are legitimately concerned about the burden and sanctions which this Bill seeks unjustifiably to place upon them. Their concerns about the Bill, which seeks to impose an undesirable and unnecessary role upon them as . . . immigration officers, are real and justified.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;Finally, the removal of appeal rights in relation to both in-country and out-country immigration decisions raises . . . deep-rooted concerns in the Chinese community, particularly when the quality of first-instance immigration decisions are clearly questionable, as evidenced by this high rate of successful appeals overturning such initial decisions.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;Since the Chinese employers in this country have learnt about the potential implications and effects of the new Bill, they have become increasingly concerned about their business interests and the manner in which this new Bill would adversely affect&quot;,</p>

<a name="60109-21_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   I would like to remind the Minister of what the noble Lord, Lord Chan, said at Second Reading, apart from the representations that my noble friend received from the Chinese community. The noble Lord, Lord Chan, pointed out that the Chinese food and catering industry was worth &#163;1 billion a year to the Treasury through the taxes that it pays. He mentioned a survey that he had conducted as long ago as 1987. He found that fewer than 5 per cent of the children of the owners of these businesses wanted to follow in their parents&#039; footsteps. The Chinese community is well known for its love of education and a very high percentage of the children of immigrants go to university, acquire professional qualifications and move out of the industry. That means that the retiring owner has to find a buyer when he decides to retire. The only potential purchasers are normally people from either China or south Asia. The noble Lord explained that those people tend to come in for one year to make up their mind about buying the restaurant, which is usually below the limit of &#163;200,000 that would allow them to enter as business people.

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>If the prospects of getting an extension of their leave to remain at the end of that period are jeopardised, as they see it, the seller will not be able to realise the proper value of the business and may be impoverished in his retirement when he ought to be enjoying the fruits of many years of hard labour. I thought that it was worth reminding the Committee about what the noble Lord, Lord Chan, said about a particular difficulties of people trying to dispose of the business on their retirement to someone who, by definition, is likely to be coming in as an immigrant for a short period of time to ascertain that he is willing to pay the price that has been asked and is capable of running the business effectively.

I therefore have quite substantial form on the area. Their community has a remarkable word of mouth capacity for communicating with each other, so word goes round extremely fast. One of my enduring memories of profound affection was of being entertained by the Chinese community in basement rooms in Soho restaurants where absolutely everybody in the room was on a mobile phone.

Before I go into detail, I want to reiterate what I said in response to the earlier group. I want to consider the principle of extending the ability to appeal in-country in a much broader way. That will be the basis of the discussions that I intend to have with colleagues in the Home Office. I know that noble Lords would prefer that option although for very good reasons they have concentrated on particular groups. I am extremely grateful for those contributions because noble Lords have indicated some of the issues and concerns, with which, inevitably, I would not be as familiar as noble Lords who have studied them.
</p>

<a name="60109-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>This is an incredibly important contribution to the deliberations that I will have. I am sure that noble Lords will agree that my personal view is that to extend for one group over another is a difficulty when one is looking to see whether one can extend more fully. Therefore, I am not accepting the amendments on the basis that the way in which I want to go forward in my discussions with colleagues is to look at an extension that would cover all the groups that noble Lords have mentioned, not one above the other, for reasons that should be obvious.
</p>

<a name="60109-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>I will spend a little time talking about the groups that noble Lords have mentioned, and I begin with students.

with the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, who was a joy to work with on the Higher Education Bill, although he gave me quite a hard time. I completely accept the point that noble Lords made that this is not just about the higher education lobby; it is far wider than that, although I am pleased to see that noble Lords who were very effective on higher education will once again be working together to ensure that the Government take seriously their particular questions.
</p>

<a name="60109-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>If I were the higher education Minister, I would want to challenge a few of the assertions that have been made. I hope that the noble Lords who made them will not mind if I say that there are a number of reasons why the figures, and the way in which higher education is being enriched, as the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, said, by overseas students is changing, not least by competition from elsewhere and because, in some countries, home-grown universities are attracting their own students. I only make the point&#151;without going into details because I am not an expert on it&#151;that there is no need to over-make the case. There are interesting reasons why we need to consider carefully how we make sure, as the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, said, that we keep our market share, in terms of students, recognising that we may need to look further afield as the market changes. I would not want to lose that.
</p>

<a name="60109-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>When we come to consider the other issues concerning students, we need to look carefully at the points-based system that we are proposing to introduce more generally for students. I look forward to the representations from Universities UK, in the shape of my noble friend Lady Warwick and others, and to looking at what we might do to make sure that the system works effectively.
</p>

<a name="60109-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>I accept the point about word of mouth in various communities. I also believe that we have a huge responsibility across the higher education sector to talk up Britain and to make sure that students recognise the advantages they get. We are enriched and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, said, you make friends for life. Friendship, in a broader sense, is also about our relationships with other countries. I endorse all those sentiments, as I do our desire to make sure that students who come here enjoy the experience and enrich our universities and our lives. Some of the proposals made in the Budget by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer to enhance opportunities, particularly in shortage areas, enabling students to stay for 12 months and work, are very important.
</p>

<a name="60109-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>My noble friend Lady Warwick spoke about students&#039; passports being endorsed when they leave the UK. There is no intention of doing that. Assuming that people are compliant and do not break the law in any way, they will not have their passports endorsed if they leave the country voluntarily within the context of this Bill&#151;I am not talking about what we might change in the Bill. My noble friend asked specifically about continuing leave during an appeal. Under the Bill, appeals will be made from outside the UK unless they are on asylum or human rights issues. Therefore, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC44"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC44</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the position would be different. I am keen to listen to proposals on that when we put this in the context of the one-stop appeals system and of my discussions with colleagues in the Home Office about how this might change. I would like to do that as soon as possible. We already have a date in the diary to do that this week, and I will make sure that the Committee is kept fully informed.
</p>

<a name="60109-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>In introducing the debate, the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, spoke about Amendment No. 59. It is not in my brief, but I understand that it was wrongly grouped. That was half the problem during the Commons stage. The ILPA briefing that I have seen, which the noble Baroness may have been quoting, partly reflects that. Just for the record, the purpose of that was to provide that a person who had leave as a refugee or leave of a type designated under Clause 1(4)(fb)&#151;for example, humanitarian protection&#151;would have continuing leave if he was refused variation of leave during any period in which an appeal could be brought and in which any appeal was pending. I hope that clears the matter up, but the noble Baroness will let me know if it does not.
</p>

<a name="60109-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>I accept that we must make sure that we have an attractive, thriving market so that overseas students come to Britain and study and, where appropriate, stay and enrich our society. The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, spoke about the NHS and about doctors and nurses. He indicated that I probably could not give him the kind of reply that would be as adequate as it might be, but I will write to him. The Government have been very clear that to do anything other than make sure that countries in need of home-grown doctors and nurses get that opportunity is not the way forward. We have an incredible track record in training and supporting doctors and nurses in this country and we want to continue to get that balance right. I will, of course, ask my colleagues in the Department of Health whether there is anything further I could add that would be sensible.

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>As to the question raised by the noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Dholakia, in regard to civil partners and spouses, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, quite rightly indicated that many, if not all, of them would appeal under Article 8&#151;the right to family life&#151;in any event. That is what I would expect them to do. On that basis, they would remain here while their appeal was being dealt with. But I say that within the indication I have already given of looking more broadly at what we can do to address these issues.

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>As to the amendment brought forward by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and the question of business investors, I am grateful to him for raising again the points that the noble Lord, Lord Chan&#151;who we are sorry cannot be with us today&#151;raised because they are very important. I have had representations from the Chinese community and my office, I hope, has already set up meetings with it, or is in the process of doing so within the next few days, to discuss this with it in great detail.

<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="60109-22_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   I am aware of the meeting and I am delighted that it will be taking place. I remind the Minister that the amendment does not deal with only the Chinese community.

<a name="60109-22_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am aware of that.

</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="60109-22_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The noble Lord anticipates me. I was going to say that the noble Lord himself made the point that, in a sense, singling out the Chinese community was to describe by example something that is a pertinent point across all of our minority ethnic communities. At Second Reading and in certain other debates, the noble Lord has made clear&#151;I wholeheartedly support him&#151;the contribution made by so many of our communities.
</p>

<a name="60109-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>I also pay tribute to the Chinese community for the educational achievements of its children which, from my memory as an education Minister, were outstanding. Inevitably, I suppose, that means that such young people will move on into different parts of our society and enrich those too.
</p>

<a name="60109-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>It is very important that we ensure that the ability of people to invest in our country&#151;to bring their business acumen and their skills to this country&#151;should continue. That is, in a sense, the whole basis of why we think that a points-based system may take us in a more objective direction. We shall come on to discuss that, but I shall be delighted to meet with the communities to discuss these issues in greater depth and to make sure that they are fully recognised.

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>On behalf of her noble friend Lady Morris&#151;who I fortunately met just before coming into the Committee and was able to have a brief conversation with her&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, raised the important point of extending leave granted to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. I did not say to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, at Second Reading that I would put this on the face of the legislation, for reasons that I will come on to. I did say that I would make sure that it was very clear that we intended to do this. As I said to my noble friend Lady Turner, I, too, met with the Refugee Children&#039;s Consortium last week. I do not know how to put this, but I will be as clear as I possibly can be: they will be designated under the order-making power in Clause 1(4)(fb). There is no question but that this category of children will be designated&#151;full stop.

</p>

<a name="60109-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>The reason I cannot accept the amendment is because it is broader and refers to children who are part of families. That raises different issues and, as I am sure noble Lords will understand, puts the children in a slightly different place. The reason I do not want it on the face of the Bill is reflected in the point I made about Moses and the tablets and secondary legislation versus primary legislation. Particularly when one is dealing with children and young people, flexibility to ensure that we have got this right is essential. It will be carried out by the affirmative procedure. I have already indicated that in my experience as a Minister, and also in my view, the opportunity to look back and have the regulation-making power made by an affirmative regulation of both Houses is very important. It is something that I take very seriously because it is appropriate to ensure that we are able to respond to changing circumstances, as I have indicated.
</p>

<a name="60109-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>There is no question but that we will make sure that these children are covered in the way that I have said categorically, 100 per cent, will be done. As I indicated to the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, outside the Committee, and to the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, that is what we will do.
</p>

<a name="60109-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>So that is the context in which I am very grateful for the contributions on this group of amendments. I think I have addressed most of the points that have been raised&#151;I am sure noble Lords will indicate if I have not&#151;and, on that basis, I hope the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<a name="60109-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   I asked my noble friend whether she would allow me to intervene briefly before she responded herself. I thank the Minister for what she said. She notionally quoted her colleague, the higher education Minister, in suggesting some of the things that we had said might not be strictly accurate. As we higher education Ministers must stand together, I think that in one respect the noble Baroness may have committed a fallacy, which he would not necessarily endorse. She argued that the number of international students was shrinking because people were staying in the universities of their country. That may well be true&#151;I have no problem with that&#151;but it does not ease the problem of our market share shrinking if it is doing so in a market which is itself already shrinking because people are staying at home.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="60109-23_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I was very careful to say that I was not the higher education Minister and I do not suggest that my honourable friend would endorse any of my comments. I merely pointed out that during discussions that I have had with individuals involved with universities, it has been indicated to me that some nations&#151;noble Lords involved in higher education nodded when I said this&#151;were interested in growing their own universities in a much stronger and bigger way. Of course, the noble Lord is right that that does not address the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC47"></a>

point, but I was trying to say that the reason students might not be coming here was not to do with this system but with what was happening back at home.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="60109-23_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   If the noble Baroness goes into the matter, she will find that the number of international students in the United States and Australia has gone up. Those countries have increased their market share when ours is shrinking. Therefore, it is a significant issue and it does not have very much to do with the fact that more people may be staying in their home university.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="60109-23_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am not disputing what the noble Baroness says. The issue is why it happens, not the fact that it does happen. Again, from talking to other people I understand that some quite aggressive marketing is now taking place in certain nations to attract students, and that was not the case previously. The point that I am trying to make is that one has to be cautious about the rationale behind why the market share is altering. It does not mean that we should not address the matter; I am simply saying that I understand that there are a number of reasons and I would not want any impression to be given that somehow this system was the only or major reason. It is clear that we need to think carefully about a number of factors, of which this is one.
</p>

<a name="60109-23_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   After such a full and frank exchange of views, it would be improper if I were more than brief in summarising one or two matters before withdrawing the amendment, as one must in Grand Committee.
</p>

<a name="60109-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>First, with regard to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, I certainly welcome the Government&#039;s move to more robust language in saying that children will be designated. I shall certainly ask the Refugee Children&#039;s Consortium to look at the noble Baroness&#039;s response today to see whether there is anything further that it wishes to bring back with a strong case on Report. However, the noble Baroness was absolutely right to point out that my amendment on children went further than the objective that I was seeking to attain because it was not a probing amendment.
</p>

<a name="60109-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>I welcome the fact that the noble Baroness reiterated that she is in favour of the principle of extending in-country appeals more widely rather than, as she said, having a list of exemptions. It is also the first choice of all noble Lords here that there should be a wide extension of in-country appeals. But we have to work on the basis that we may not get our first choice&#151;hence these amendments.
</p>

<a name="60109-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>The cross-party speeches today from around the Committee from many noble Lords who are strongly in favour of exemptions, particularly with regard to students, will leave the Government in no doubt as to the strength of feeling at later stages of the Bill. I hope that it will be possible to come to an agreement by negotiation. We all hope that agreement will be reached by the discussions that are being held by the Government, by all groups in-house and also&#151;far <br>&nbsp;<br>

more importantly&#151;with expert groups outside. I also welcome the approaches that I have had from the Chinese community. I received a letter today from Miss Lee and I have asked her office to set up meetings with that community.

(   )   following a course of study of more than six months&#039; duration at an institution on the approved register for which the person has been accepted&quot;

<p><a name="st_53"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment is supported by the noble Lords, Lord Dholakia and Lord Avebury. I have also added my name in support of Amendment No. 14. We now, after three hours, leap from Clause 1 to Clause 4, but our hearts are still very much concentrating on how one should have an appeals system and whether appeals should be abolished in this primary legislation. In Clause 1 we were looking at the appeals system as it applies to people who are already here legally. We are now looking at the appeals system as it applies to people who hope to come here, who make apply for a visa. My Amendment No. 12 would preserve a right of appeal against refusal of entry clearance to a person who has been accepted on a course of study lasting more than six months at an institution that is on the approved register.
</p>

<a name="60109-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>I have concentrated on students yet again. I am not part of the higher education lobby but I am happy to reflect the views that the lobby has put to me, not because I always reflect its views but because it is right, which is always the best reason for tabling an amendment. Students will be adversely affected by the removal of appeal rights in Clause 4.
</p>

<a name="60109-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>Government figures have shown that 25 per cent of international student appeals against visa refusals are successful. Universities UK believes that the number of decisions reversed before reaching appeal is much higher&#151;up to 90 per cent at some institutions. I have raised in debates on other matters the fact that problems may arise when temporary staff are sent to places such as Chennai to deal with log jams of applications. They simply do not have the expertise to be able to make appropriate initial decisions.
</p>

<a name="60109-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>I was impressed with the evidence given by Fiona Lindsley, the out-going Independent Monitor to the Home Affairs Select Committee on Tuesday, 13 December. I am grateful to our Opposition Whips Office, which was able to send a researcher to take a note for me, because I was not able to attend. Miss Lindsley pointed out that ECOs are not trained properly to conduct the 10-minute interview: they <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC49"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC49</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

should identify the key issues before the interview, for example, and it is very hard to make a good quality decisions as the process stands. She recommended that there should be a formula to identify the reasons why a person might be unlikely to return home and to address those issues in the interview so that the applicant has an opportunity to defend himself. As she says, ECOs need a lot of confidence to do this and currently have only three weeks training. ECOs have no opportunity to get to know the appellant community. They live an expat lifestyle with six-week postings and do not have good training in local standards. Also, she says, ECOs do not record enough information in the file on the basis of their decisions.
</p>

<a name="60109-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>There is ample evidence that ECOs refuse visas for often highly subjective and sometimes entirely inappropriate reasons. Reasons mentioned in the Independent Monitor&#039;s latest report and in evidence provided to Universities UK include that the ECO: does not believe that the student has applied to study an appropriate course; doubts that the student will complete the course or return to their home country; believes that the cost of the course is not commensurate with the benefits that the student will receive; believes that the cost of the course will impose an additional financial burden on the student&#039;s family; or does not believe the course is appropriate for the student&#151;because they could study the same course in their own country more cheaply, or because they have not studied a similar subject in their home country.
</p>

<a name="60109-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>Universities UK&#039;s member institutions have supplied further anecdotal evidence, for example, of students being told that they do not have the financial resources to follow a course, even when, as in one case, the student has submitted evidence of a UK government-funded scholarship covering the full tuition fee plus maintenance costs. Why have the Government not considered, at the very least, delaying the removal of the right of appeal until there has been a demonstrable improvement in decisions made by entry clearance officers? That would not of course solve the underlying problem that would arise if we abolished the appeal system, but it would be better than nothing.
<a name="time_10"></a>
<a name="60109-23_time0"></a><h5>6.30 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60109-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>The Minister in another place, Mr McNulty, said in Committee that it was unlikely that the provisions of Clause 4 would commence immediately following the passage of the Bill, but he gave no commitment on timing. I agree with Universities UK that it would be better if the Government returned with primary legislation at a later date to abolish appeals only when they can demonstrate that the quality of initial decision-making has been improved significantly by the introduction of a points-based system.
</p>

<a name="60109-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>The Government have argued that international students who are refused visas may simply reapply. We do not agree that that is a satisfactory alternative to the right of appeal. Immigration history is taken into account during the consideration of these applications, so an unjust refusal of a visa could have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC50"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC50</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a permanently negative impact on an individual&#039;s chance of successfully applying for other visas, whether for the UK or elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="60109-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>The UK should be doing all that it can to attract international students; we are at one with the Government on that&#151;it has been proved by our debates this afternoon. The Government&#039;s argument that if other countries do not offer the rights of appeal that they are abolishing here, there is no problem in our abolishing those rights of appeal, does not wash as an argument with me. If others choose to have a flawed system, that is their choice; we should not follow it. There is a danger that if one removes a student&#039;s right of appeal when initial decisions are often flawed, the consequence is quite simply that the quality of those initial decisions will become even more flawed and arbitrary. If no appeal is permitted, there is a clear danger that the person making that decision will be less likely to think that it is a priority to get the decision right in the first place. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="60109-24_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   The clause sweeps away the right of appeal against refusal of entry clearance for abroad, notwithstanding the fact that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has already pointed out, according to the independent monitor, more than half the appeals dealt with in 2004 were successful. There are some posts abroad which make wrong decisions of a much higher percentage than that, yet the Minister has the effrontery to ask your Lordships to extinguish the rights of all those people.
</p>

<a name="60109-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>The same argument applies to the eradication of appeal rights under this clause as under Clause 1, as expressed in the weighty opinion of the Select Committee on the Constitution in its letter to the Minister of 13 December 2005, to which reference has been made several times already. We deplore the wholesale eradication of rights, and we condemn the Government&#039;s partial restoration of rights to undefined categories of entry clearance applicants in secondary legislation, which nobody has yet seen. That committee emphasised that ever since the system of immigration control first came into force some 30 years ago, decisions by immigration officials have been subject to appeal, helping to ensure that standards of decision-making were maintained. But in the case of entry clearances, standards are already unacceptably low, and to paraphrase the committee only slightly, it is perverse beyond belief to remove these particular rights. The committee demanded the Minister&#039;s observations on the matter, and we hope that we shall have those observations in good time to be able to take advice before we return to the subject on Report, as we shall inevitably have to do.
</p>

<a name="60109-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>As your Lordships are aware, the independent monitor, Ms Fiona Lindsley, whose contract has not been renewed following the expiry of her two-year term of office in November last year, perhaps because she was doing her job too well, told the Home Affairs Committee in another place that there is an institutional problem with certain nationalities; that the rising refusal rate overall, from 6 per cent up to the year 2000 to something like three times that level in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC51"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC51</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

past year may be due to a fall in the quality of applications, but it may due to other less justifiable factors; and that as long as there are appeals, at least we have statistical evidence that might throw light on the quality of decision making. There is a provisional transcript of her replies to the questions put in that committee. If a particular post lost 56 per cent of appeals, which was a typical figure, there would be <i>prima facie</i> grounds for saying that poor decision-making was a factor in the outcome. The independent monitor pointed out that the National Audit Office had said the same thing.
</p>

<a name="60109-24_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>In another reply, Ms Lindsley said that in paper-based appeals, where the immigration judge saw exactly the same evidence as the ECO, 37 per cent of appellants were successful. She added:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;To me, that is pretty damning&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>Ms Lindsley said the Government had not consulted her about the decision to take away appeal rights in entry clearance cases, but she estimated that over the three reports she had submitted during her term of office, about 46,000 people had been wrongfully denied their rights of appeal because they had nobody to advise them, and that she would oppose removal of appeal rights because it would mean the loss of information about the quality of decision making. The only conclusion that one can draw, after reading that submission and Ms Lindsley&#039;s report of February 2005, is that the system of entry clearance applications is grossly defective, and that the Government have systematically and in some cases deliberately ignored the monitor&#039;s recommendations.
</p>

<a name="60109-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>In the February 2005 report, the independent monitor had to repeat in annexes all the recommendations made in her previous two reports, and in the case of statistics collection, when she had got Ministers to agree that statistics on family visit appeals from the 10 largest family visit refusing posts should be collected, the data were gathered but never analysed, due to pressure of work, and UK Visas had told her that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;the analysis, which was commissioned by Ministers, was not intended for publication&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>Yet in family visit cases where the appellant was represented by IAS, the success rate was 79 per cent in 2002&#150;03 and 83 per cent in 2003&#150;04. In the case of students, the figures were 38 per cent and 49 per cent in those two years, and those figures are another indication that the quality of the decisions is going downhill. It is no wonder the Government want to remove these rights, and no wonder that they decided not to insist on the analysis they themselves had commissioned.
</p>

<a name="60109-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>I do not know whether the Minister has read the reports of the independent monitor, but I draw her attention to paragraph 102 of the February 2005 report, when the monitor says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;Specifically I find it unacceptable that students should be refused because they have not studied the subject in their own country/ should have studied the subject there more recently; because they could study the subject in their own country more cheaply . . . because in the opinion of the ECO they should study <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_GC52"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC52</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>in a third country rather than the UK; because they do not &#039;need&#039; to study and because they have failed to obtain a level of proficiency in their own country through studying there. All these reasons proliferate particularly in the refusals of English as a Foreign Language students in refusals in 2002 and 2003&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>Has the Minister looked at that report? If she has not, I honestly suggest that it would repay her to read it and come back to the Committee, and see whether she could honestly say that the removal of the rights of appeal in these entry clearance cases is justified.
</p>

<a name="60109-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>In our amendments, and those of the noble Baroness, we are trying to undo some of the damage done by this egregious clause. Amendment No. 13 gives the Secretary of State power to prescribe further categories of people to whom rights of appeal may be restored, as is done in Clause 1, and in the family visitor provisions of this clause. The categories might include students coming for longer courses of study, who have been accepted by a registered educational establishment; innovators, ministers of religion, working holidaymakers, and applicants for settlement. If the Minister is not inclined to accept Amendment No. 15, dealing with people whose rights the Minister acknowledges, this would be one means of restoring what is otherwise being unlawfully taken away from them by this clause.
</p>

<a name="60109-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>Amendment No. 14 deals with returning residents who are in compliance with the immigration rules. That means they have been granted ILR but do not hold a British passport&#151;and I personally know of people who have been here for 25 years without feeling the necessity to acquire British citizenship. The bizarre position is that a dependant of someone resident in the UK has a right of appeal, but the resident does not, and we hope that the Government will agree to put this right. In another place, the Minister, Mr Tony McNulty, said this amendment was otiose, because returning residents would not need to apply for entry clearance. However, he is wrong; such cases do arise, and ILPA has given us examples, of which I will only mention one&#151;but there are others, if the Minister wants to see them.

While they were there, a son still resident in the country of origin was killed, and the couple stayed to find out how the tragedy had occurred. They became involved in legal proceedings and were away for five years. When they applied for entry clearance as returning residents they were refused on the grounds of their long absence, no account being taken by the ECO of the exceptional circumstances. Of course, they were successful on appeal, but if this clause had been in effect they would still have been stranded there.

<a name="60109-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>Amendment No. 15 covers the restoration of appeal rights where that is necessary to give effect to obligations under European Community law. This is another case in which Mr McNulty gave an undertaking to consider it when it was raised in Committee in another place; but as with all his promises, nothing has materialised. The reason why the amendment is necessary is that certain rights of free movement guaranteed by Community law are set out <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC53"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC53</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in part 7 of the Immigration Rules, rather than in the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations, under which there is a right of appeal which is unaffected by Clause 4. There are at least three groups of people who are potentially affected: nationals of Switzerland, which is not a member of the EEA but whose citizens have the same rights of free movement as EEA nationals; non-EEA nationals who are the primary carers of children who themselves have rights of residence in respect of whom there is a European Court judgment in the case of Chen. I have that judgment in my papers here somewhere, but the Minister probably knows it. Also affected are nationals of countries with relevant association agreements with the EU such as Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, seeking to enter for purposes of business or self-employment.
</p>

<a name="60109-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>If the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment, we shall find ourselves in conflict with Community law, and there is likely to be expensive litigation. The Minister, after agreeing to look at this matter in Standing Committee E said on Report that the necessary appeal rights could be provided otherwise than by amendments to the Bill. He wrote to my honourable friend, Dr Harris, on 24 November, as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;I also said that I would write to clarify why it has been decided that no amendment to the Bill is required to incorporate Community law rights. We do not propose to amend current provisions in the Immigration, Nationality and asylum Bill&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><i>sic</i>&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;to preserve existing appeal rights for these cases but will instead provide the necessary rights of appeal either administratively or through secondary legislation. We may achieve this through existing powers, possibly with some reliance on current Bill provisions in respect of amendments to section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>He got it right the second time.
</p>

<a name="60109-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>But the Minister cannot rely on the powers in Clause 1 to make regulations under the new Section 82(2)(fb) of the 2002 Act, because Clause 1 is confined to variation appeals, and cannot be used to solve the problems that arise from this clause. So I hope, now that there has been an opportunity for reflection, the Minister will agree that our solution is the right one.

<a name="60109-25_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe </b>  : This brings us to the major issue in the Bill, as far as I am concerned. A large number of organisations, including universities, colleges and students as well as business leaders and immigration law practitioners, firmly oppose measures in Clause 4 that would abolish the right of appeal in entry clearance cases.
</p>

<a name="60109-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>I am delighted that the Minister has agreed to talk again to her colleagues in another place about appeals in Clause 1, but I wish to make it absolutely clear that, from my point of view, Clause 4 appeals are a much bigger and more fundamental issue. So far, we have not been given any reason to hope that the Government are willing to move away from the principle that there should, in future, be no appeal in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC54"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC54</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

entry clearance cases. Like other noble Lords, I hope that the Minister will be prepared to reconsider, because I think it is absolutely clear that to abolish the right of appeal when there is currently no confidence in the quality of decision-making in entry clearance cases would be a grave mistake.
</p>

<a name="60109-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>The Committee is, by now, familiar with the arguments. More than 25 per cent of student appeals against refusal of entry clearance are successful. That is an astonishing rate, indicating a high proportion of bad decisions. What is worse is that when one looks behind those figures, it is clear that the real number of bad decisions in respect of students, certainly those in higher education, is much higher. As has already been said, the University of Sheffield has told us that it successfully overturns 90 per cent of refusals, either on appeal or before they reach that stage.
</p>

<a name="60109-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>Universities UK has gone to some lengths to establish the reasons for this high rate of success on appeal. What it found only goes to support what the Government&#039;s own independent monitor in entry clearance cases has found: inappropriate reasons for refusal are routinely given. The entry clearance monitor&#039;s report has been refereed to by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and I do not wish to repeat the trenchant comments they quoted. But the evidence that Universities UK has gather entirely confirms the independent monitor&#039;s conclusion. I do not wish to reiterate the cases to which I referred at Second Reading. Several examples were cited in that debate and I shall not repeat them here, but I am sure that Members of the Committee will be aware of the appalling examples that were used not only in my contribution but also in contributions made by other noble Lords. However, I can not resist repeating the astonishing example, given by the noble Lord, Lord Laird, at Second Reading, of a student from Cameroon who was refused a visa to study at an English language school in Northern Ireland and was told:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;You have further stated that you intend to study this course in Northern Ireland so that you can also improve your English. If this is your aim and English is not your first language, I do not find it credible that you would choose a school in Northern Ireland to do these studies&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 6/12/05; col. 570.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>I should say that although I have not given at Second Reading or here in Committee the names of the institutions which provided examples, Universities UK would be happy to provide the Minister, in confidence, with evidence supporting them. The arguments produced by the independent monitor are enormously important here.
</p>

<a name="60109-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>The argument which Universities UK and others have been having with the Government rests on a very simple consideration: the Government intend to introduce a new points-based immigration system, that they hope will improve the quality of initial decision-making, which they acknowledge to be variable. They assert that the abolition of appeals at this point is appropriate because the new system will remove the need for appeals. For my part, I am not so confident. We hope, and believe, that the new system <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC55"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC55</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

will improve decision-making. Indeed, through the Joint Education Task Force and other routes, we are working with the Government to ensure that it will. However neither we nor, I suggest, government Ministers really believe that the new system will solve all problems overnight. Indeed, I have doubts that the new system will be able to remove the kind of subjectivity which inevitably leads to decisions which are open to challenge.
</p>

<a name="60109-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>The Minister Tony McNulty has admitted that; he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;100 per cent objectivity is a fool&#039;s errand&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>It is not at all clear how it will be possible to avoid subjective judgements about, for example, intention to leave the UK. But even leaving aside the question of whether the new system will be perfect, there remains room for human error. The examples I have given of reasons why some students have been refused visas generally relate to circumstances where the facts of the case were plain, and yet some piece of evidence already in the hands of the ECO was ignored or overlooked, or they relate to cases where ECOs have failed to follow their own rules or to use the appropriate criteria for refusal.
</p>

<a name="60109-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>How will the new system avoid this? I would argue that it cannot. Where subjective decision-making and human error are in play, it cannot be right to abolish the only means by which a student refused a visa may formally seek redress. The Minister has already undertaken to bring forward proposals for an administrative review of immigration decisions. That is very welcome, but on its own, it is not enough. The experience our universities have had suggests that pre-appeal review works because there is the formal mechanism of an appeal hanging over ECOs. What will be the incentive to review decisions when appeals are gone? How can it be satisfactory to allow ECOs and their managers to be the final arbiters in decisions that they have taken themselves? Where I would agree is that a robust pre-appeal review procedure would reduce reliance on appeals, and hence the administrative burden on UK visas. Since reducing the administrative burden appears to be the only reason why the abolition of appeals has been suggested, I see this as a solution that would potentially benefit all parties.
</p>

<a name="60109-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>I hope that the Minister will be persuaded that this is not the right time to take away appeal rights in entry clearance cases. If not, I hope that at the least the Minister will consider international students as a special case: after all, there is no manifesto commitment to abolish the right of appeal in the case of students. Amendment No. 12 provides this opportunity. It would retain appeal rights for students who wish to follow courses lasting longer than six months at institutions on the approved register. That would weed out the more suspect operations, while protecting bona fide students at bona fide colleges and universities. This would be a small concession. It would recognise that it is vastly in the UK&#039;s interest to attract international students&#151;as has been advocated so passionately by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, who, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC56"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC56</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

sadly, is no longer in his place&#151;and it would not put unnecessary barriers in their way. It would recognise that the administrative costs in providing an appeal would be more than offset by the economic and financial contributions made by international students. It would recognise that the danger of pressing ahead with these measures is that bona fide students who have been offered and have accepted places at British universities will be turned away at the visa stage. Poor decisions will go unredressed. Students who have been refused visas will go elsewhere, carrying with them what has been called the &quot;mark of Cain&quot;, the stigma of having been refused a visa.
</p>

<a name="60109-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>It cannot be right to approve this feature of the Bill currently before us. So I believe that Ministers should introduce the new immigration system and demonstrate that it works before legislating to remove appeals. As things stand, the appeals mechanism is a very necessary constraint on a system that would otherwise fail thousands of potential students and the universities who seek to attract them. I hope that the Government will be persuaded to reconsider.
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="60109-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, quoted at significant length from the transcript of Fiona Lindsley&#039;s examination by the Select Committee on Home Affairs and from the reports she had written. I am a bear of very little brain and I cannot claim to have done either of those two things, but I did sit next to her during the admirable briefing arranged by my noble friend Lady Anelay. She spoke for 10 minutes with extreme eloquence and articulacy and conveyed an immense amount of information in a very short space of time. If my notes incorrectly render what she said, I apologise to her as well as to the Committee.
</p>

<a name="60109-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>Fiona Lindsley alluded to the fact that the number of monitors was being expanded, and that is to the Government&#039;s credit. She also said that the monitors have few powers, so that it is not a significant advance in terms of the process of checking. I understood her to say that a monitor was expected to take into account 50 cases a day which is a 25 per cent growth on the 40 cases a day which an entry clearance officer takes. Forty cases a day is a substantial number to go through in the course of a working day. Anybody who has dealt with surgery cases in a constituency knows that it is a very weary process to do effectively. She had looked at 4,000 cases during the course of her work, which is a pretty substantial universe on which to draw. The rise in refusals which the noble Lord, Lord Avebury quoted, from 6.5 per cent to 19 per cent since 2000, means, because it is a larger figure, that the refusal figure of 25 per cent is also much larger than it was in 2000. It is not merely 6.5 per cent, it is now 19 per cent. I have a simple question for the Minister: what is the Government&#039;s explanation for what has happened over the past five years, as reported by an extremely vivid and vibrant witness?

<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="60109-26_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I endorse the remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick. She is absolutely right that Clause 4 is the vital clause in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC57"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC57</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Bill in relation to international students. The refusal of entry visas and the taking away of the right of appeal are key issues. It is vital that for the health of the body of international students we reverse this, or at least see some reversal during our discussions.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>The Minister has written to me on this subject. I should like to quote the relevant paragraph in her letter. While it helps us to understand a little of the argument taking place behind the scenes, it also reinforces the argument that it is vital that we see the new system working before we are prepared to see the withdrawal of a natural right of appeal. The paragraph reads as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;We recognise that the degree of subjectivity in entry clearance decision making, which the current Immigration Rules provide for, has been an area of concern and are taking steps to address this, both in terms of improved training given to entry clearance officers and in the design of the points based system. As has been discussed in the Joint Education Taskforce, under tier 4 of the points based system, it is our intention that sponsorship by an approved educational institution will act as a proxy for intention and ability to study and that a closer relationship between the Home Office and education institutions will enable a light touch approach for students sponsored by respected institutions such as the University of Sussex&#151;&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>I think that was in response to my asking why not accept this&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;with a proven track record&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60109-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>That is what we would like to see develop. But it is important that we see a better track record in decisions. Yes, there should be more training for entry clearance officers, but let us see the system working and let us see the new light touch approach beginning to work before we give up the right of appeal.

<p><a name="st_58"></a>
<a name="60109-26_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Sandwich:</b>  I should like to add one point to what has been said so powerfully by many Members of the Committee. I support the amendments fervently. I refer to the visa queue times. Although I have read and reread it in the Immigration Advisory Service briefing, I simply could not believe that there are three countries where you have to wait three months to get into a queue. Most of us are used to going to India House and complaining that we have to wait 48 hours. But if you are a student and you have been refused or an overstayer, it is no good, as the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, said earlier, saying you have to go back to the beginning, because the whole opportunity of higher education is lost when one of these decisions is made. The case for looking again at the training of ECOs is overwhelming.
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="60109-26_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to Members of the Committee who have spoken in this important debate. For those involved in the Committee, this is at the heart of concerns about the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>I want to set out how the new system will work and then look at why we think we will be in a position to remove appeals. The principle is to make sure that the resources we use on appeals are used appropriately. I take what the noble Lords, Lord Brooke and Lord Avebury, said about the need to look at all the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC58"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC58</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

evidence and at how the system has been working. I hold no brief for the system historically; I accept completely all the anecdotal and other evidence and information about some of the decisions that have been made. The critical aspect is to consider what the system will look like in future and to be clear that a lot of the concerns that noble Lords have rightly raised can be resolved by a better system. In other words, people end up appealing because the system does not work very well. All Members of the Committee have indicated their concern about how the system works and have given evidence to that effect.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>We need to develop, for students in particular, the relationship they have with the institution where they will study. Members of the Committee have indicated&#151;in particular, my noble friend Lady Warwick&#151;that the subjectivity of the way in which entry clearance officers might consider whether a person would be able to take a particular course could be inappropriate or wrong because they did not have the expertise necessary. There is no question that the institution to which they were applying could do that. Institutions have always had a degree of subjectivity and can determine whether an individual has the necessary qualifications and whether they want to offer him a course.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>My noble friend referred to the task force and I pay tribute to the work that Universities UK has done within that. The work is very important in identifying the relationship between the institution, the student and the Home Office. As institutions can deal with students effectively, as I said in my letter to the noble Baroness, the approach can become much more light touch.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>The first argument I would use is that the critical relationship becomes the institution to the student in terms of whether the person fits the criteria and can take up a course. The entry clearance officer is looking at the information that has already been provided, such as the certificate of sponsorship&#151;the proxy for the ability and the intention to study&#151;and the relationship between the institution and the student. The officer checks that the student has sufficient funds, which is usually done by bank statements. There are issues about documentation in various parts of the world&#151;none the less, that is the usual way of doing it. The officer has to ensure that students have the documentation necessary to show their educational qualifications. That will form most of the basis upon which the entry clearance officer will make the decision. The situation will much better for the individual student because they will be looking at the same criteria. In other words, a points-based system will be clear to the individuals who apply in terms of what they are required to do. That will be huge change and goes a little, if not a long, way in making sure that people feel they have to operate effectively when they do not have the fact that they could have their decision appealed hanging over them.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>The second aspect regarding that is the administrative review, because in my experience from talking to noble Lords and institutions&#151;and I am always willing to talk further about this with either <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC59"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC59</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Universities UK or individual institutions&#151;the ability of the individual to recognise what is required, and the way in which they are able to relate to the system and the process will be critical as they move forward, is central and fundamental. So they will be able to identify before they apply whether they are likely to be able to get a place on a course, what the criteria and the relationship between the individual and the institution will be. That is central to how we want to deal with the issue.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>The administrative review comes about because much of the evidence that has been put forward was about information that was wrongly understood or written, or simply, as in one case, the university was not recognised by the entry clearance officer, who assumed that it did not exist. These are very clear administrative, factual and straightforward matters that relate to form-filling. It was important to make sure that the process was fit for purpose in terms of the review, and I took on board the points made by noble Lords at Second Reading. It is not an appeal in the traditional sense, but it is an important concession, because I said at Second Reading that I would be keen to look at this matter. It is an important way by which the Government are seeking to address the particular point raised by noble Lords. Unless noble Lords indicate otherwise, in Committee or elsewhere, that seems to address the vast majority of the problems that they have raised, and combines an objective points-based system, the role of the institution, the fact that all students see whether they will be eligible with everyone looking at the same criteria, and the opportunity to review the decision in an administrative capacity.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, will not feel that this Government are asking the Committee to solve their problems, but that genuinely those organisations and noble Lords who have experience in this field have a major contribution to make in helping the Government to think through what that review might look like. I again pay tribute to Universities UK for providing information which I have not yet studied in detail, but has arrived and for which I am grateful. There is much that we can do as a Committee in considering what that administrative review might look like and achieve. That and the system that is being put in place&#151;the role of the institution and the administrative review&#151;should go a substantial way in addressing noble Lords&#039; concerns.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>The question underpinning all of that is whether people have confidence in the system. That was raised by noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, and most noble Lords agreed. We have provided in Clause 52 the opportunity to make sure that we introduce this in a measured an appropriate way, and pilots around the point-based system are already taking place to good effect.


</p>

<a name="60109-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>Of course we are looking to bring this in appropriately. The measures can be introduced in what one might describe as a staggered way, but I am not suggesting that we will bring one in and then wait forever to bring the next one into the appeal system. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC60"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC60</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I am saying that the system will come in as a whole at an appropriate moment. We will want to work very closely with stakeholders to make sure that, as the Bill completes its passage through Parliament, we have everything in place. It may be a helpful reassurance to noble Lords that I am very happy to go away and consider this with my colleagues in the Home Office.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>Noble Lords are right to assume that the Government have no intention to move away from the fundamental aim of Clause 4, which is to remove the right of appeal. Of course students may reapply. That is very important. There is no desire to stigmatise students in any way if they are refused&#151;unless of course that refusal went alongside forged documents or some other inappropriate behaviour. That would be a different matter. There is a desire for a system that is transparent, objective, easy to understand, easy to follow and very clear. There is also a desire to ensure that those working in the system are able to do so as effectively as possible.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>We also plan to make sure that the quality of the expertise available is enhanced. Noble Lords have indicated that the current independent monitor&#039;s contract expired in November, as I understand it, and the plan is to have a full-time independent monitor. I have no idea whether the person concerned will apply for that position. The plan is to make it a full-time position where, for three months of the year, there will be an opportunity for the independent monitor to travel and make reports much closer to real time. I am sure noble Lords will accept that that is a much better proposition than the rather long annual reports&#151;helpful though they may be&#151;because it will enable us to speed up the responses to any lapses in quality identified in the reports. So there will be a new role for the independent monitor in the sense of being able to produce his reports much more quickly.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>I have indicated already that we are looking to pilot what is happening, testing the policy against cases in the UK and overseas, refining and retesting. When this goes live, it will go live having been well established and we will be able to show that there are no unanticipated outcomes as a consequence.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>We are also looking to make sure that the quality of decision making is as good as it can be. Reviews are going on and quality assurance forms have been introduced for completion by appeals presenting officers to provide feedback on the quality of decision-making. We have an expanded network of regional operations managers looking at best practice and making sure that we improve the quality and consistency of decision making. They will visit key posts in the next few months to support our entry clearance officers and managers in the work that they do. Entry clearance manager training is being expanded, appeals outcomes are monitored and key determinations are fed into the training courses. There is a whole range of different ways in which we are trying to support managers and entry clearance officers in the work that they do.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>We recognise the need to make sure that quality is of the highest order. We accept and understand why noble Lords have concerns in this area but we believe <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC61"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC61</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that the new system which is being brought into play will address those concerns effectively. I have already indicated that we are able to bring the system in within timescales determined post the Bill. I am happy to discuss that with noble Lords if it would be helpful.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>Turning to the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, in Amendment No. 15, I agree with the principle of what the noble Lord said. We are trying to achieve the same end in a different way. I shall read a very short note, just to put it on the record, and I should be grateful if the noble Lord would tell me, either now or later, whether there is anything he is still concerned about as a consequence.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>An EEA national and family members have the right to be admitted to the UK, as the noble Lord said, in pursuance of a treaty right, such as the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2000, as amended. As the noble Lord also said, an appeal right is conferred through these regulations. The amendment of course deals with non-EAA nationals. Following a recent European Court of Justice judgment, we accept that for Bulgarian and Romanian nationals who apply to come to the UK to self-establish under the relevant provisions of the respective European Community Association agreement, there should be a right of appeal against a decision to refuse entry clearance. We will reinstate these rights, which are to be removed under this Bill, using secondary legislation.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>At present, we do not accept the settled Community law which generally requires any other class of applicants to receive an appeal against a decision to refuse entry clearance to the UK, but if Community law develops and the right of appeal is extended, then of course that will be given effect. Again, that makes the case for doing this through secondary legislation. That takes us to the same point that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, wished to reach, but by a slightly different route, although I would be grateful if the noble Lord would let me know if he feels that that is not the case.
<a name="time_13"></a>
<a name="60109-26_time1"></a><h5>7.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="60109-26_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>Clear criteria are set out in paragraph 18 of the Immigration Rules about returning residents. In order to qualify as a returning resident, the person must have had indefinite leave to enter or remain when they last left the United Kingdom, should not have been out of the country for more than two years, should not have received assistance from public funds towards the cost of leaving the UK, and must now be seeking admission for the purposes of settlement. Returning residents who are refused entry clearance would retain a limited right of appeal on human rights and, of course, racial discrimination grounds. I accept that not everyone wishes to do that, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said. Those who have indefinite leave also have an opportunity to apply for citizenship. That largely reflects the current position.
</p>

<a name="60109-26_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>I hope that I have addressed all of the issues raised by noble Lords although I am not sure that have in any way satisfied them. But our ambition is to create a new <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC62"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC62</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

structure and a system that will deal with all of those issues in a positive, consistent and transparent way, and give us the benefit of people who wish to come and study or work in the United Kingdom. On that basis, I hope that noble Lords will withdraw their amendments.

<a name="60109-27_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   The noble Baroness puts huge weight on the points system, which she thinks will be easier to operate. However, someone who thinks that it is wrong to study English in Northern Ireland will not be able to operate a points system. It is extraordinary that such a person should have such a job&#151;and that is not an isolated example. The independent monitor listed many outrageous examples of mistakes. A points system will have traps, because it tries to standardise decisions. No two cases will be identical. People will have to be matched to the points system and that will require a great deal of mental dexterity on the part of the person making the decision. So the Government must not just comfort themselves by saying that if such people are trained to operate a points system everything will be all right. It will be a difficult job, because so much depends on it and there will be such a variety of decisions to make. I may have misunderstood, but I worry about this.
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="60109-27_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The noble Baroness would be right to worry, but, looking outside the system, the principal important change, as I see it, is in the role of the institution. The noble Baroness rightly raised a ludicrous example and a ridiculous decision regarding Northern Ireland. But if an institution is working with the student and says, &quot;This student should come to this institution because it seems to us that they have the qualifications to do so and we are keen to have them&quot;, the person has that institution behind them and will play a much stronger role in determining whether the student will comes there&#151;not the entry clearance officer. I said that the role of the officer is largely about asking whether the student has the sponsorship of that institution, whether they can demonstrate that they have the funds to come here and study in that institution, and so on. It is a different position which determines, after all, what the right relationship between the university and the student should be&#151;which is what happens internally in the UK: you get an offer from a university and what is looked at is whether you can afford to be there and so on. That is the right relationship.
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="60109-27_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   Does the Minister not accept that the record is bad? What she describes as the relationship between the institution and the prospective student is obviously absolutely right but, given the very poor record and given that it is the same people, subject to training, who will be taking those decisions, at the end of the day we want to see the new processes working before the right of appeal is given up. That is the key issue here.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="60109-27_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I take that point completely. The noble Baroness echoes the point made by my noble friend Lady Warwick about wanting to have faith in the system. But I disagree with her that it <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC63"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC63</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

is the same people taking the decisions. The point that I am trying to make is that, if you have an objective, criteria-based system, not a purely subjective one&#151;although it is arguable that it ever was that&#151;it is much easier to be very clear when someone fits the criteria. As the noble Lords involved in institutions will recognise, the critical relationship between the institution and the students, by which the student can come to the institution because he clearly fits the bill as someone that it wants to have, is central to the new proposition. We are checking the system out. I would argue that, as we refine the system more and more, I need to look for opportunities with noble Lords to demonstrate the system in action, how it is working and what the differences are. I am not sure how to do that yet&#151;but I shall certainly think about it.
</p>

<a name="60109-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>I accept that we need to ensure that the quality of decision-making is fantastic. I also accept that because the issues that have been raised are largely of an administrative kind, if you take away the factor of subjectivity&#151;that whether someone can do a course rests with the institution&#151;getting the right kind of review in place will tackle those questions very quickly. Speed is everything in that regard. I shall seek to persuade noble Lords that that combination of concerns&#151;whether the system is working and whether we can demonstrate when it comes in it will be a good system&#151;plus the right kind of review, is the right combination to ensure that the system works effectively, rather than going back to an appeal system, which was relevant because of how decisions were made, but will not be relevant in the same way on this basis. That is the critical difference.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="60109-27_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   I do not disbelieve what the Minister says. She is absolutely right about the need for quality of the highest order and transparency of the procedures. However, the noble Baronesses, Lady Carnegy and Lady Sharp, and the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, gave example after example. That clearly demonstrates that the changes proposed do not seem to be filtering out to people taking decisions, either at British posts abroad or in the IND in this country.
</p>

<a name="60109-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>I am in the privileged position of having followed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act since 1962, when it was first established, and I can give example after example. One does not have to go far for them; one can go to the Immigration Advisory Service and have a word with Keith Best, or talk to the Refugee Council or the Medical Foundation. But I can give personal examples. When I sit as a magistrate in court, people listen to what I have to say; but if you tried to tell the same story to the immigration officer, they would not believe you.
</p>

<a name="60109-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>The point that we are coming to is that, if you look at the investigation that was carried out as early as 1980 by the Commission for Racial Equality on the immigration control procedures, and if you look at the situation now, the examples cited now are exactly the same as we talked about in those days. There is a need for a culture change, which is why we have tabled <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC64"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC64</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

this amendment. That culture change will come about only when there is a lead at the top in terms of being positive about immigration, and the contribution that people make. More importantly, it is worth bearing in mind the extent to which large numbers of people make a positive contribution in this country that is negated by the way in which politicians handle matters of immigration and asylum.
</p>

<a name="60109-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>I have a lot of sympathy with the way in which other Members of the Committee have given example after example. I hope that the Minister is right, and I hope that I can take her at her word that there will be that culture of change over that period of time, so we have a better operated system and a civilised way in which to deal with these issues.


</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="60109-27_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   I shall take only a couple of minutes because I have some extremely important guests arriving for dinner at half-past seven. I simply wanted to let the Minister know that I was going to raise the question of the monitor if we had reached the amendment that deals with her appointment. But since we have not got there, I give the noble Baroness warning that I am very upset that the former monitor, Fiona Lindsley, relinquished her post on 1 November and that her replacement has not yet been appointed. When I rang up this morning to find out what was going on, I was told that the appointment was being submitted to the Minister. I take it that that is our colleague the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, because he deals with consular matters, but as he returned to the office only this morning, he has not yet had an opportunity of looking at the recommendation. So there has been a gap of two and a half months during which no independent monitor has been in place.
</p>

<a name="60109-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>If the Government were really serious about making the improvements that the noble Baroness has suggested, the first thing she and her colleagues would do would be to ensure that there was continuous monitoring by an independent person instead of allowing a gap of two and a half months&#151;probably three by the time the person takes up the post&#151;to occur. I am surprised that the noble Baroness has not had word from her department that I would raise the matter if we had reached the amendment in question, because I asked the office of the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, to inform her that I would. I would like to know why the Government allowed this gap to occur when they knew perfectly well that Fiona Lindsley&#039;s contract was not being renewed for reasons that we can perhaps go into on another occasion. They apparently took no steps to interview or to attempt to discover a suitable replacement until some time after she had left office. That is a matter the noble Baroness will want to explore.
</p>

<a name="60109-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>I cannot say that I was satisfied with what the Minister told Members of the Committee concerning Amendment No. 15, which would take care of any changes in European law in the future. If she is concerned only with certain limited rights for these persons, as they are at the moment, that will not satisfy the need. I hope that she will think about our proposal which would be a far more comprehensive way of <br>&nbsp;<br>

dealing with the matter than the one she suggested. I shall read very carefully what she said and, if necessary, come back to her in writing.

<a name="60109-28_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I should like to respond quickly to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury&#151;I am conscious that he has important guests. On his latter point, my ambition is to achieve the same thing; I will pick that up with the noble Lord and see how we do it. We are simply doing it in a different way. On his former point, I was not informed that the noble Lord was going to raise his point. I am grateful to him for giving me notice and will ensure that I have discussed the issue appropriately before we reach that point and may talk to the noble Lord outside the Committee as well.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="60109-28_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   I should like to check with the Minister about one point she made in her reply. While she placed enormous importance on the role of the institution, is she intending by that to say that if a student is offered and accepts a place at a recognised institution which is on the register, they will automatically be granted entry clearance? There is no assurance in that unless that is the case.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="60109-28_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I indicated that the other factors to be considered would be whether individuals were able to sustain themselves economically and had the correct certification which was valid for their qualifications, which the institution may or may not have looked at. I cannot say that the institution says only, &quot;You have the appropriate qualifications on the basis of what you have said to be able to come to this institution, and we would like to have you&quot;. It will be making sure that all the other pieces of information are accurate. Perhaps we can talk about this further and make sure that we have all those points nailed to ensure it is clear where the entry clearance officers will be playing a fuller role, and where the institution will, and how the points might add up on that basis.

</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="60109-28_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe: </b>   Forgive me for pursuing this but it seems to me that it is in those areas where many of the issues that we have raised, the examples that have been used by the independent monitor and the examples that have been produced by the universities, are found. Even if there is a more secure choice of decision being made because of acceptance at an institution, if these other areas of discretion and potential arbitrariness remain, our concerns will remain. That is the point I want to make.
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="60109-28_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The noble Baroness is, of course, right to raise the matter. We have to make sure that there is no arbitrariness to those decisions but that they are based on sound facts and a clear evidence base which will enable us to have this system. It goes back to what I said before: it is important that I find ways in which we can demonstrate, to the noble Baroness in particular, what the system will look like&#151;I do not know whether or not the Joint <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC66"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC66</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Education Task Force is doing this&#151;so that people can see what the points-based system will do, and who will be responsible for which aspects of it, to achieve its aims.
</p>




<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="60109-28_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   That last interchange with the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, is crucial because it goes to the very heart of the problems that I have with the Government&#039;s response to my amendments in this group. On the one hand, I have listened to the cogent argument made by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, about the existing problems with the system; and then of course the Minister said, &quot;Ah! But we are planning this wonderful new system whereby there will be an administrative review which will work properly. It will work hand-in-glove with the recognised institutions&quot;.
</p>

<a name="60109-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>We all want the system to work. The difficulty lies in what will happen in the transitional period while it is being brought in. Is the lack of an appeal going to be seriously damaging? My answer at the moment would be, &quot;Yes, it is&quot;. Secondly, is it still important to have an appeal system after this new system comes in? At the moment, in the absence of knowing what the new system will be and the absence of confidence in it working, I would have to say, yes, an appeal system has to be there because of the ultimate rigour that it supplies.
</p>

<a name="60109-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>I have a difficulty with the generous offer made by the Minister&#151;I know she meant it to be generous&#151;when she said that she wants it to be possible for the Committee to look at what the administrative review might be, how it might work and whether it will be the right kind of review. I am not sure how we can achieve that in Committee because we are now passing the point in the Bill where we might write in clauses. We might try to put on the face of the Bill an enabling clause about having an administrative review but, even if I could rustle up one in the next half-hour&#151;I hope we will finish on this group of amendments&#151;it would be too late to table it for consideration on Wednesday. Even if the Public Bill Office were happy with a manuscript amendment, I am sure other noble Lords would not be so happy. I understand the Minister&#039;s offer&#151;I know it is well meant&#151;but it means that we would not be able to come up with something until the Report stage, and we are now beginning to run out of time.
</p>

<a name="60109-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>I do not know whether the Minister wishes to comment on that but, obviously, we will look to having constructive talks with her department between now and the Report stage&#151;outside organisations will do the same&#151;to see whether there is some way in which we can take up her offer in a proper manner.
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="60109-28_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I apologise because I think I put my proposition badly. I was trying to indicate to the Committee that we recognise the importance of the administrative review and the issues that have been raised, both in your Lordships&#039; House and outside. I want to use the experience and expertise available on the Committee for help and support. It will be for me to convince noble Lords between now <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC67"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC67</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and the Report stage that we have come up with a review that is appropriate and suitable and, with any luck&#151;although I am never that hopeful&#151;persuade them that it will do the job, or at least will be a part of doing the job, and that it will resolve the issues that noble Lords face. Whatever happens, it will be for me to demonstrate that that review is appropriate and in place. If noble Lords have any ideas and views on this, I am very keen to incorporate them into our thinking.
</p>




<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="60109-28_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   It was helpful of the noble Baroness further to explain her offer.
</p>

<a name="60109-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>I come to the final issue: what happens if we do not agree on the administrative review being an appropriate solution? It would be up to noble Lords to decide what, in their various approaches, they may want to do with it, but I have a significant question to ask. At Second Reading, the Minister carefully prayed in aid the manifesto commitment with regard to Clause 4 but not with regard to Clause 1. Today, the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, made the confident statement that this was not a manifesto commitment. I seek guidance as to whether the Minister has line reference to that commitment. Obviously, it will have an impact on some of us who are bound by the Salisbury convention, but not on all of us. I look at the Minister to see whether she wishes to quote the Labour Party manifesto at me.
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="60109-28_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I find it hard to quote in exact detail. It certainly is in the manifesto and I apologise that I do not have a copy. I carry it at all times, as noble Lords would expect, but, sadly, I left it in my office today. It is a manifesto commitment, but I do not hold that above the heads of Members of the Committee, other than to say that in formulating the policy in this area, it was a strong Government commitment that we take seriously and would wish to see enacted. We will not move from that commitment.
</p>

<a name="60109-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a> However, I hope that I have indicated that within that context I am keen to ensure that the system we put in place is as robust as possible and addresses the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC68"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column GC68</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

genuine concerns that have been raised across your Lordships&#039; House. We are keen that it is a system in which noble Lords can have great confidence and in order to achieve that we shall consider when we introduce it. I do not want to say that I am not willing to discuss anything, but simply make the point that it is a manifesto commitment. I am conducting the Bill on behalf of another department and it would be right and proper to make it clear that it is at the heart of what the policy tries to achieve.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="60109-28_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </b>   That was a generous way of dealing with the matter. I whisper it lightly, but I seem to carry the Labour Party manifesto more often than I carry my own&#151;but be that as it may. I certainly would not wish to read out the party&#039;s manifesto&#151;that would be testing my patience too far, let alone that of the Committee. Suffice it to say that when I read the commitment, if I were a normal person voting&#151;I never use the word &quot;ordinary&quot; because that sounds rude&#151;it would not scream at me that applications for visas for students to come here were being abolished just like that. I certainly will be interested to discuss with the noble Baroness the commitment as it is phrased.
</p>

<a name="60109-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>I appreciate exactly what she says: she is making an honest offer to the Committee to try to persuade us of her point of view. However, she has heard firmly today of the reservations that exist within the Committee. No doubt we will return to them and on that basis I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="60109-29_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Charles Clarke) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60109-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>I am today placing in the Libraries of both Houses a <a href="/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/60109ws1.pdf">letter from Louise Arbour, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a>, on the Terrorism Bill.
</p>

<a name="60109-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>I am grateful to the high commissioner for her letter. She suggests that the Bill would benefit from further scrutiny. The Bill is of course currently before the House of Lords where it being subject to detailed consideration.
</p>

<a name="60109-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>The high commissioner has a number of specific concerns about the Bill. We do not believe that these are justified.
</p>

<a name="60109-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>She suggests that the Bill lacks a precise definition of terrorism. In fact, the Bill draws on the definition of terrorism contained in Section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2000. As has been made clear during the Bill&#039;s parliamentary passage, the Government do not believe that a better definition of terrorism can easily be created but we have asked the independent reviewer of our terrorism legislation, Lord Carlile of Berriew, to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS2"></a>

<b>9 Jan 2006 : Column WS2</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

conduct a review of the definition of terrorism used in legislation. He has said that in doing so he will consult widely and will report within a year of commencement of the new Act.
</p>

<a name="60109-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>The high commissioner is concerned about Clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill. The Government have made a number of changes to these clauses during the Bill&#039;s parliamentary passage and given indications of further planned changes. These include imposing an intent test, with subjective recklessness, in Clause 1 and widening the defence of non-endorsement in both Clauses 1 and 2. The Government are satisfied that these clauses constitute a proportionate and necessary response to the threat of terrorism.
</p>

<a name="60109-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>The high commissioner queries Clause 21, which extends the grounds for proscription to include those organisations that glorify terrorism. The Government believe that such organisations can create a climate in which terrorism can flourish and their activities need to be restricted. The full safeguards, including parliamentary approval subject to the affirmative resolution and appeal rights, will apply to any groups proscribed under these powers.
</p>

<a name="60109-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>The high commissioner expresses concern about the proposal to extend the maximum pre-charge detention period in terrorism cases to 28 days. This has been extensively debated in Parliament and the Government accept Parliament&#039;s decision in this matter. The Government are satisfied that the safeguards in place, including regular judicial oversight, mean that an extension to the maximum pre-charge detention period to 28 days (as would an extension to 90 days) would be compatible with the UK&#039;s international human rights obligations.

<a name="60109w01_sbhd0"></a><h3 align=center>Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy</h3>


<p><a name="wa_qn_0"></a>
<a name="60109w01_wqn0"></a><b> Lord Avebury </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>What pilots the Department of Health has commissioned on targeted screening and brief interventions in accordance with the Government&#039;s Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy, to ascertain whether and how the various models can provide value for money in terms of cost savings to the National Health Service; and why there is no coherent alcohol strategy for hospitals.  [HL3116]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="60109w01_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  The Department of Health has completed a tendering process and has selected a consortium, led by Newcastle University and St. George&#039;s Medical School, University of London, to operate a programme of pilots (now referred to as trailblazers). This will let the Government know whether and how the various models of alcohol screening and brief interventions can provide clinically effective and cost-effective interventions within the National Health Service.
</p>

<a name="60109w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>The contract has still to be finalised, but the pilots will operate in three settings: primary care, accident and emergency and criminal justice settings. Current evidence indicates that alcohol screening and brief interventions can be effective in some hospital settings such as accident and emergency, fracture clinics and facial injury clinics, but the evidence is inconclusive for other general hospital wards.
</p>

<a name="60109w01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>The department recently launched <i>Alcohol Misuse Interventions: Guidance on Developing a Local Programme of Improvement</i>. This provides those responsible for the planning of health services, including hospitals, with guidance to improve local arrangements for delivering alcohol interventions.

Act 2003 distinct from changes resulting from other influences. The Government take alcohol-related crime and disorder seriously and through the Licensing Act 2003 introduced a range of new closure powers and increased penalties to enable swift action to address problems. The impact of the Act on levels of crime and disorder will be evaluated in due course, though this will not include an analysis of the cost of alcohol-related crime and disorder. To date, there is no clear evidence that levels of alcohol-related crime and disorder have changed as a result of the Act.

Westminster council has agreed to address aggressive begging as a specific target and is currently an anti-social behaviour trailblazer area. It has been allocated &#163;100,000 from the Home Office to assist it in its activities. In a meeting with Westminster City Council on Thursday 1 December, progress to tackle aggressive begging in Victoria Street and around Westminster Cathedral was discussed.

The services, in particular the Army, would be unable to man current structures and maintain current capabilities. It is probable that, should the minimum entry age be raised, good quality school leavers would settle into other careers and thus be lost to the services.

The right of appeal will be exercisable within the UK unless the asylum and human rights claims are certified as clearly unfounded under Section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. A claim will be certified under Section 94 only if the Secretary of State finds it to be clearly unfounded on its individual merits. This applies regardless of the nationality of the applicant or the basis of their asylum and/or human rights application.

<a name="60109w02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>Health advice was contained in a range of gold control press briefings issued from 8.55 on 11 December through to 10.15 on 14 December. The health messages were added to websites, including that of the HPA.

At 10.15 on 14 December the message was changed; people were advised to go about their normal business unless they were in the immediate area where smoke plume was falling to the ground, or they experienced an increase in strong fuel-like odours. In this event people were advised to go indoors and shut windows and doors until the smoke had cleared.

misuse problems. For example, the FRANK helpline offers honest, credible advice to young people, their parents and carers about illegal drugs and has attracted more than a million calls and over 6 million website visits. Class A drug use among young people aged 16&#150;24 is stable. Internationally, through the Concerted Inter-Agency Drugs Action group (CIDA), UK law enforcement agencies are working together, and in partnership with those in South America, the Caribbean, Spain and the Netherlands, to tackle the supply of cocaine to the UK at all stages of the chain. Between April 2001 and December 2004, CIDA agencies seized 52 tonnes of cocaine bound for the UK market and recovered over &#163;94 million of drug-related criminal finances, as well as disrupting or dismantling 605 drug trafficking organisations. They have also increased substantially the number of cocaine swallowers detected in Jamaica.

<a name="60109w03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_15"></a>Nationally, individuals charged with certain offences in the 97 areas with the highest levels of acquisitive crime are tested for class A drugs under the Government&#039;s drug interventions programme (DIP). This is one of a number of interventions aimed at identifying drug misusing offenders and moving them away from crime and into treatment and support services. From 1 December, Greater Manchester, Nottinghamshire and South Yorkshire police have the power to test for class A drugs on arrest for certain trigger offences. Those testing positive are required to attend an assessment with a drug worker. These new powers will be expanded further from 31 March 2006. For drug treatment, heroin misuse has been the main problem and the focus of services. This situation is changing. The number of stimulant users (e.g. crack cocaine) presenting to treatment services is slowly increasing and effective interventions with this group include counselling or residential rehabilitation services. Most users use a range of drugs and drug services need to focus on individual clients&#039; needs, not the drug of misuse.

<a name="60109w06_spmin8"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  Until December 2003, the Lifer Management Unit was part of the Lifer Unit in Prison Service headquarters and was responsible for the    arrangements relating to the transfer and categorisation of life sentence prisoners. On transferring to the Home Office in December 2003, the Lifer Unit was renamed the Lifer Review and Recall Section (LRRS) and then became part of the National Offender Management Service. The main functions of LRRS are confined to dealing with lifer parole review casework and life licensee casework. With effect from 1 February 2004, the responsibilities for transferring and categorising life sentence prisoners within the closed lifer estate passed from LRRS to the Prison Service operational line. Consequently, most decisions on such matters are now taken by senior managers in prisons. Details of those changes are contained in Prison Service Instruction 08/2004, copies of which are in the House of Lords Library. Prison staff will continue to be responsible for managing lifers through sentence on the basis of the life sentence plan (LSP). The LSP provides a structure for staff to plan, monitor and record the way in which individual lifers can address and reduce their risk factors during sentence. The LSP will continue to be kept under review in the light of the development of risk assessment models and the impact of the population trends for lifer and indeterminate sentence prisoners.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_53"></a>Under what terms aircraft owned by, operated on behalf of, or operated at the request of the United States Government or any of their agencies are permitted to land at military airbases in the United Kingdom; and for how long such permission has been granted.

<p><a name="wa_st_52"></a>
<a name="60109w07_spmin6"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  Since 1949 US military and state aircraft have had clearance to land at military airfields in the United Kingdom under a reciprocal arrangement. Application of the arrangement has evolved over the years. Current practice is that aircraft carrying dangerous air cargo or VIPs must notify the MoD prior to arrival.

<p><a name="wa_st_53"></a>
<a name="60109w07_spmin7"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  The Immigration Service may require passenger information in respect of any person arriving in the United Kingdom by ship or aircraft, including transit passengers, members of the crew and others not seeking to enter the United Kingdom, in order to determine whether they are eligible for leave to enter. However it is not the practice of the Immigration Service to require the details of passengers unless they intend to disembark in the UK. The Immigration Service considers its powers sufficient for the purposes of maintaining an effective immigration control.
