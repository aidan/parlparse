They are explaining it properly for the first time since Edward Heath&#151;many years ago. There are 1 million British companies now in the EU doing business; nearly 2 million Brits living in other EU countries, including Spain; 3.5 million jobs directly linked to membership of the EU; and 50 million individual journeys to EU countries, mostly on low-cost airlines, were taken last year.

Is it therefore any wonder, now that they are waking up to it, that our people do not like not being able to sack those who make most of their unwanted law? However unpopular the system is down the other end and in this House, at least the British people can get rid of them. They cannot get rid of their law-makers in Brussels.</p>

Should we not review thoroughly the whole approach of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to the European case, to remove some of the lukewarm attitudes reflected in the devastating figures given by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart? When the Foreign Office goes into bat on European issues, it should be rather more forward in promoting our links with the Commonwealth, which covers almost one-third of the human race. We notice that our French friends always turn up with arguments for the Francophonie but the British always seem to be phased by how to please the French and the Germans rather than how to promote our worldwide network of the Commonwealth.

This approach has been reinforced by our ratification of the Council of Europe convention against human trafficking which came into effect on 1 April and which strengthens our identification and protection arrangements for victims.</p>

I have a number of concerns but will confine myself to two points. First, bearing in mind that victims of human trafficking are all over the country, what is being done to ensure that training is provided to all the police forces? Secondly, as human trafficking is a global problem, what liaison is being maintained between us and other European countries and other foreign countries?</p>

<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="0905117000022"></a><b><a name="90511-0001.htm_spnew20"></a><a name="0905117000543"></a>Lord Brett:</b> My Lords, I agree entirely with the noble Lord on both the points he makes. Our strategy regards the fight against human trafficking as a core part of police business, and the training of all police officers in all regions is an essential part of that. Providing funding for that activity through the core funding of police is also important. The noble Lord makes a very important point; in many cases we are a destination country for trafficked people. Some years ago when I chaired a major conference with Interpol I came across the most horrific story involving deaf and dumb people who were trafficked from Russia to sell dolls in France, and the evidence suggested that they never returned to Russia if they failed to sell the dolls in question. It is most important that we use Interpol and our European colleagues and the UK is playing a leading part in that task.</p>

The key aspects of the convention include: the granting of a 45-day recovery and reflection period for identified victims during which removal action is held in abeyance&#151;the convention requires only a 30-day minimum; the issuing of one-year residency permits for identified victims, crucially entitling the identified victim to access public funds&#151;the convention requires a minimum of only six months; and the establishment of a national referral mechanism which allows for the systematic identification of victims by the competent authorities and their onward referral for support. We have established two competent authorities based in the UK: the UK Human Trafficking Centre and the UK Border Agency.</p>

The noble Baroness may be referring to a horrific case that was brought to our notice by the media some weeks ago involving young Chinese girls who were brought into the UK via Heathrow Airport and subsequently trafficked. They were brought in believing that there was a better life here for them and they joined the people trafficking them in the hope of finding that better life, which does not exist. I am pleased to say that, in tackling this, the police have reduced the number of such children coming in through Heathrow from some 70 or 80 cases to only a small number, none of whom have subsequently disappeared from local authority homes. So it is a success.</p>

We are on our guard: we are forewarned, we are responsible for the Olympic Games, and this matter is at the forefront of our strategy. We have already been successful but it is still right to ask what we are doing. The Metropolitan Police will have responsibility for this in the London area and we are strengthening provision for them in the next 12 months to ensure that they are prepared.</p>

Secondly, with regard to Hillingdon and other local authorities which look after the children once they arrive, if the children were dispersed away from Heathrow&#151;or Gatwick as the case may be&#151;would it not be far more difficult for the traffickers to prey on them in the children&#146;s homes where they are located?</p>

One aspect is that the traffickers&#146; agents&#151;not agents in a welcome sense&#151;and false travel bureaux issue false documents. There is also the transport aspect whereby the child&#146;s nationality is changed en route. It is an unfortunate fact of life that most immigration officers in Europe cannot tell a Korean from a Chinese, and quite often a Korean passport is used to bring somebody in and then recycled to bring in someone else. As for how we deal with it, I do not

We have had great success in tackling the issue of children coming in via Heathrow simply because we have got to them and counselled them through social workers. As they have not then sought to leave, the traffickers are deterred from sending more children because they lose the asset if the child is persuaded that they will be regarded not as part of a trafficking crime syndicate but rather as a victim of trafficking and as someone we will take care of.</p>

When I responded to our debate on 22 January, when this issue arose, I pointed that my experience in the United Nations&#151;I look for an affirmative nod from noble friends around me&#151;has shown that it is easier to build on what is there than to change, because the consensus required would involve the vast majority of nations which have ratified the conventions. Therefore, when we sought in Vienna to investigate these areas we found no consensus in the United Nations forum for a review of the kind proposed, therefore it would not seem the most productive route to take.</p>

What further action does he think this country can take nationally to reduce the illegal importation of drugs?</p>

Much like trafficking, it requires the co-operation of countries of origin, countries of transit and countries of destination. Through the United Nations and the European Union, therefore, and indeed through our relationships with Governments across the world who share this problem in one form or another, that is the way forward. I have to say we were not particularly enthused about the meeting in Vienna. The outcome was not as positive as we would have liked&#151;we would have liked a more positive declaration to use&#151;but we will seek to use the declaration we have to ensure a managed approach in all the other fora of the United Nations where drugs are the issue of the day.</p>

When do the Government intend to follow the lead set by the United States, Canada and Sweden and ban the dangerous drug GBL which has been responsible for the deaths of many teenagers in this country and which the Government&#146;s own advisers recommended should be classified as a class C drug nine months ago?</p>

On the other hand, we do not accept the case for decriminalisation and we believe that a balanced approach carried forward with our European partners, who are broadly in agreement with us, is the best way to tackle this international and domestic problem.</p>

Does he not think it is about time that the Government had yet another discussion with the Senlis Council in regard to transferring drugs that are produced in Afghanistan to licit use, particularly to deal with the global shortage of opiates, and to see what contribution that can make to stemming the flow of drugs coming into western Europe?</p>

The issue in Afghanistan is that the Government of that country have said it is not in a position to administer a licit programme, the danger being greater commercialisation. The point he raises, however, is a good one. There are policy changes and considerations at all levels that need to be taken into account. It is an ever-changing problem both in terms of countries of origin and countries of destination. I am sure the points he made will be carefully considered.</p>

They give them the drugs that they need and decriminalise them. The result of that has been a great reduction in crime and the increased social and physical health of those hardened addicts. Are the Government looking at the policies in those countries and considering their merits?</p>

We are in favour of fact-based research programmes and of looking at any that might provide an answer to our problems that look more advantageous than the solutions that we are currently dealing with. I am sure that that review will continue. If proposals come forward within a balanced approach, this Government favour the introduction of harm-reduction policies but, at the same time, do not believe that we can desert the argument that we need to contain the spread of drugs around the world.</p>

The Government have no plans to respond to the interim report. However, when the panel publishes its final report in the summer, the Government will make a full response.</p>

<p><a name="st_51"></a>

The Cabinet Office interim study confirms a picture of apartheid Britain, painted so vividly by my noble friend Lord Adonis some years ago, with over 50 per cent of the most senior positions in the law, the media, the financial services and the Civil Service occupied by a privately educated 7 per cent minority of the population&#151;a sort of self-perpetuating closed shop. First, does she agree that the relatively limited opportunities for the 93 per cent in state education and the hugely disproportionate opportunities for the 7 per cent who went to public schools are inevitably two sides of the same question? Secondly, to do something about this stranglehold, would Her Majesty&#146;s Government encourage those involved in the final stage of the study to examine the charitable status of public schools with a view to tax relief being gradually withdrawn from schools that do not have at least 50 per cent of their pupils and governors drawn from the community as a whole?</p>

I thank the panel for the work that it is undertaking; it is doing a splendid job. We await the panel&#146;s report but, in the mean time, I shall of course take back the issue about taxation raised by my noble friend.</p>

Would it not be more sensible for all of us to concentrate all our efforts on ensuring that the standards in schools are so improved that every really able young person has the chance to get the qualifications necessary for entry into our best universities?</p>

However, things like health inequalities are important, too. Then there are things such as Sure Start. The gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged children kick in as early as 22 months, which is why I am very proud of the Sure Start system that this Government introduced, as it means that all children will have more opportunities in their later life.</p>

However, medicine involves a very long training and one barrier to students doing that training is the debt that they incur.

That means that the vast majority of people in the professions have left school at 18 to do a three-year full-time course and often have gone on to a one or two-year postgraduate course. Is it not important to remember some of the lessons of the past, where many professions were open to people via different routes? Those people had often left school earlier, at 16 or 18, gone into different jobs, and may have decided in their 30s to go into the professions. If we are to widen access, is it not essential that we ensure a variety of entry methods?</p>

We are having 35,000 more apprentices this year, many of whom will, I hope, have access to the professions. Just last week in Knowsley, I met a fantastic bunch of apprentices and I am sure that two or three of them&#151;for example, one working in accountancy and another in the media&#151;will ultimately reach the top of their professions.</p>

Does the Minister agree that it will be important for the panel to do an extremely careful audit of what all the professions are doing to encourage access? We need a thorough look at what is already being done&#151;and a great deal is&#151;before the panel can come to conclusions and enable the Government to consider, in due course, the recommendations that it makes.</p>

<a name="0905117000059"></a><b><a name="90511-0002.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="0905117000585"></a>Lord Clarke of Hampstead:</b> My Lords, the first amendment in this rather large group deals with the ownership of Royal Mail and the vexed problem that people like me face on the question of its privatisation. Amendment 1 seeks to remove the Government&#146;s Clause 1 and replace it with the proposed new clause as printed on pages 1 and 2 of the Marshalled List. It would remove the distinction between the Post Office and Royal Mail companies and the differences in their ownership. It then provides for the transfer of all the property rights and liabilities of Royal Mail Holdings plc to a newly-formed company, limited by guarantee, which is to be nominated by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="90511-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="0905117000060"></a>I have placed these amendments deliberately in the hope that our Government are both listening and learning and are prepared to rectify the serious mistake they are likely to make if they continue on their present journey. Growing numbers inside and outside this House, and in the other place, are against the Government&#146;s proposals for privatisation. This opposition is very soundly based and has been reinforced by evidence and events since the Bill was first introduced to the House.</p>

<a name="90511-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="0905117000061"></a>Noble Lords will recall that the Government, without pause for reflection, and on the same day that the Hooper report was published, announced their support for all the recommendations of that report, including privatisation. This was, we were told, a coherent package of measures which had to be taken together. It was based on analysis that was supposed to demonstrate that the Royal Mail was both the least profitable and the least efficient of the European postal providers. On such a basis, radical surgery in the form of a strategic partner from the private sector was necessary. The industry is to be part-privatised, with just less than 50 per cent being offered to the partner.</p>

<a name="90511-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="0905117000062"></a>December 16 seemed a day of great and clear purpose for the Government. How have the analysis and the proposals held up since that time? First, we have to note that the Bill departed from the strictures  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_821"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 821</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Hooper, being a package from which no departure was allowed. The Bill includes a facility to establish a universal service support fund. I endorse that facility, and it has been endorsed by the people who work in the industry. Hooper explicitly rejected the establishment of such a fund, characterising it as counterproductive.</p>

<a name="90511-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="0905117000063"></a>Despite Hooper&#146;s certainty that the Government and their advisers were less clear than Hooper that the only distortion to the postal industry was the public ownership of the Royal Mail, somewhere there was a nagging doubt&#151;that the mistakes of Postcomm had been underplayed by Hooper in his final report; an impression that will be reinforced by rereading Hooper&#146;s earlier and superior report. That is the interim report, which mysteriously got changed after certain interventions by government people. Be that as it may, the Government allowed themselves this exception, despite Hooper insisting that his report could not be taken a la carte. I suggest that the Government should recognise their mistake in their hasty endorsement of the rest of Hooper, because everything since 16 December tells against the supposed integrity of Hooper&#146;s analysis.</p>

<a name="90511-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="0905117000064"></a>For example, in April the Universal Postal Union published an important report: <I>The </I><I>g</I><I>lobal </I><I>e</I><I>conomic and </I><I>f</I><I>inancial </I><I>c</I><I>risis: </I><I>I</I><I>nitial insights into </I><I>its impact on</I><I> the postal sector</I>. That interesting report analyses the impact of the recession on all major postal operators in the world. In this sense, it is an important corrective to the Hooper report, which fails to suggest what impact the recession was having on Royal Mail and the mail market in general. In fact, Hooper&#146;s report tends to view declining mail volumes as essentially a result of e-substitution. However, the UPU report is notable for giving a context for changes in postal traffic and thus a greater explanation. It is clear that the postal industry, like other industries, is suffering from the impact of the recession. The report indicates that there has been a sharp decline in domestic letter traffic of an average of 5.9 per cent during the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the previous year. Express activity suffered even more sharply, dropping by 7.9 per cent on the same year to year basis. Parcels traffic has suffered least from the crisis, displaying a strong resilience, despite the economic downturn, and saw a 1.1 per cent growth during the fourth quarter of last year.</p>

<a name="90511-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="0905117000065"></a>What is very positive in the report is that it gives those figures an even broader context by comparing the position to that of the Great Depression in the 1930s. Of course, such comparisons are freely drawn by many commentators when trying to analyse the current recession and crisis in the financial sector. I am convinced that such a comparison is also helpful in understanding the real state of the postal industry today.</p>

<a name="90511-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="0905117000066"></a>How does this comparison work in the postal sector? In the United States Postal Service, revenue declined by 12.3 per cent between 1931 and 1932. In Germany, letter postal volumes declined by 16.6 per cent between 1930 and 1931. In France, there was a 15.5 per cent drop in franking revenues between 1929 and 1930, leading to a 24.8 per cent drop in these revenues between 1931 and 1932. This allows us to see that, despite Hooper, there is a clear cyclical element at work in mail traffic variations in line with cyclical  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_822"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 822</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>developments in the rest of the economy. We can therefore say that Hooper&#146;s report has failed to locate the problems facing the postal industry in the context of the international economic recession.</p>

<a name="90511-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0905117000067"></a>It would be a great mistake for the Government to ignore this new material and to assume that Hooper has the final word on future trends in traffic. It would certainly be foolish to fail to anticipate Royal Mail&#146;s contribution to the economic recovery. It may be said that this is interesting but not the most significant element of Hooper&#146;s analysis. We must then return to other elements, including the suggestion that Royal Mail is both the least profitable and the least efficient of European postal operators. I say that again, because if a lie is told, as somebody in fascist Germany in the 1930s said, and you repeat it, it will be believed. The suggestion that Royal Mail is both the least profitable and least efficient of the European postal operators is simply not true.</p>

<a name="90511-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0905117000068"></a>Last week, first quarter results were published by a number of European privatised postal operators. TNT saw a year-on-year drop of 58 per cent in operating profits. Posten, in Sweden, suffered a drop of nearly 50 per cent in operating earnings. Post Denmark saw its profits drop by 52 per cent. Deutsche Post has yet to publish its first quarter results, but in the last quarter of 2008 it reported a &#8364;3.16 billion loss. In comparison, Royal Mail has increased its profits in both quarters and is expected roughly to double its profits for the full year. So much for Royal Mail being the least profitable operator.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90511-0003.htm"/>


<a name="90511-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="0905117000069"></a>What has been demonstrated is that Royal Mail is weathering the recession better than its supposedly superior rivals. It was never the case that Hooper had made the definitive analysis that the Government saw there. I remind noble Lords of what the Business and Enterprise Committee of the other place wrote in its verdict on the Postal Services Bill on 1 April:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="0905117000205"></a>&#147;We agree with two key aspects of the proposals. First, that the Government should take responsibility for the historic pensions deficit. Most of its liabilities stem from Royal Mail&#146;s time as a monopoly provider. It needs to be freed from them, as many of its European counterparts have already been freed. Moreover, pension fund members deserve to know that their pensions are secure. Second, we also agree that a new regulatory framework, in which postal services are viewed as part of a wider communications market, is entirely appropriate&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0905117000179"></a>The report continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="0905117000206"></a>&#147;However, we do not consider either the Independent Review or the Government has properly made the case that these two reforms, about which there is a broad consensus, can only be made as part of a package which includes the third reform, the involvement of a private sector equity partner in Royal Mail. Similarly, we are not persuaded that the provisions contained in the Bill allowing such a partnership are necessary or desirable&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0905117000180"></a>Those are the words of a committee in the other place.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0905117000070"></a>The report also indicates that the Government have been entirely unclear about the issue of investment, which undermines the suggestion that privatisation is necessary. The report also makes important contributions as to the lack of rationale regarding splitting Post Office Ltd and the Royal Mail Group. Nor have the Government indicated what the impact on competition will be if, as seems likely, the chosen partner is already active in the UK mail market. The report points out how completely unclear any partnership agreement  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_823"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 823</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be in terms of further capital injections and actual control of the company. I endorse one of the final points in the summary, which says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="0905117000207"></a>&#147;We are left with the conclusion that either the Government has not fully thought through its position about future share sales, or that it has done so and is refusing to reveal its hand&#148;.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0905117000071"></a>To date, the Government have not responded to this report. The opportunity exists for the Government to examine this important piece of work and to consider taking a step back before proceeding further with a Bill whose credibility has now been seriously weakened. My amendment offers a potential way forward for the Government, not to satisfy me or my emotional ties with the Post Office&#151;I should have declared an interest but I am sure that most noble Lords know it by now&#151;but as a way for the Government to disengage themselves from an argument that is not wanted by members of the Labour Party, members of the public or Members of Parliament down the other end. I want them to examine this important piece of work again and, I hope, the existing elements of the Bill which have been endorsed by the Business and Enterprise Committee and by the majority of opinion in this House.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0905117000072"></a>We have made good progress in Committee in how we tackle the whole question of pensions and regulatory activities. However, I greatly fear that the Government do not yet recognise how unkind these past few months have been to Hooper&#146;s proposals. We recently had a statement from Deutsche Post. We remember Deutsche Post from the early days in December when everyone was flurrying around to get a grip on our wonderful, profitable post service. What does it say now? We have a statement that it has no intention of bidding for Royal Mail. It has been rattled by its recent results, which followed hard on the heels of DHL withdrawing from the North American inland express market with huge losses, so it is concentrating on putting its basic business right.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0905117000073"></a>Surely there is a lesson for the Government here. Deutsche Post&#146;s statement means that, unless the Government inform us otherwise, there are only two potential partners interested in acquiring Royal Mail: the private equity firm CVC and, of course, the one that keeps cropping up and is likely to get the job if we ever let this go through, TNT. On the second day in Committee, the Secretary of State would not be drawn into commenting on TNT&#146;s suitability for partnership with Royal Mail. He said,</p>
<ul><a name="0905117000227"></a>&#147;we are undertaking a fair competition to identify a suitable partner for Royal Mail&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 31/3/09; col. 967.]</ul>
<a name="90511-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0905117000074"></a>My question still is, and I put it today, whether the Government are now prepared to admit the failure of such a search. After all, if TNT is the sole suitable bidder, then the competition has indeed failed. Since 16 December, when the predators were circling like vultures, TNT has been involved in illegal acts including the falsification and backdating of documents. The company was forced to pay back &#163;49 million to the Revenue, including unpaid tax penalties and interest. There were similar inquiries into its tax affairs with other EU countries, although we do not know whether they resulted in further payments or disciplinary action.   


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_824"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 824</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The current chief executive of TNT, Mr Peter Bakker, was in post at the company at the time that those illegal acts were undertaken.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0905117000075"></a>We have also learnt that the chief executive of Royal Mail, Adam Crozier, has accused TNT of trying to poach customers from Royal Mail&#146;s profitable European parcel subsidiary, General Logistics Systems. We know that Adam Crozier sent an e-mail to the Government about this, but have yet to learn whether the Government responded to that correspondence. I confess that I do not read the weekend papers, but others have told me since they came into this Building today that we have learnt a bit more about TNT.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0905117000076"></a>TNT is now considering its position. When the &#163;3 billion figure is cited, it makes this whole thing look even sorrier than it was to begin with. If we were going to sell off our birthright for &#163;3 billion then, in the words of that great Conservative Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, it would be like selling the family silver. It is not right to sell off such a profitable post office.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0905117000077"></a>Since then, we have witnessed further evidence of the unsuitability of TNT as a strategic partner. Towards the end of April, the European Court of Justice ruled against a challenge by TNT to have Royal Mail&#146;s VAT exemption lifted. The European Court of Justice ruled that Royal Mail had an important obligation in the form of the universal service, and that, therefore, the role of TNT and Royal Mail were not comparable in the UK. So we see a potential partner with partnership skills that include trying to force Royal Mail to charge considerably more for its service. We have seen press reports that, in the potential negotiations, TNT insists upon guaranteed earnings from any future stake in Royal Mail. Presumably TNT expects the taxpayer to subsidise its acquisition of Royal Mail, as we have been subsidising its work through the downstream access ever since Postcomm made its original decisions on the tariffs to be charged.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0905117000078"></a>I did not read it, but somebody I trust implicitly said that we have learnt from the <I>Sunday Telegraph</I> that TNT wants Royal Mail&#146;s profitable European parcels arm, GLS. Well, of course it does! Anybody with half a brain would see what it is up to. If something is profitable, they want it. We would be daft if we let them have it. Further, it is suggested that TNT&#146;s offer falls well short of the Government&#146;s anticipated &#163;3 billion for a 30 per cent stake.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0905117000079"></a>Finally, I read in the Library a report in yesterday&#146;s <I>Observer</I> that some of TNT&#146;s own bill investors are moving to reject the acquisition of Royal Mail. The paper says that Jan Keuppens, representing the firm Robeko, one of the top 15 shareholders, believes that TNT&#146;s management should focus on reversing the 58 per cent slide in its own profits reported last week. According to the article, Jan Keuppens said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0905117000228"></a>&#147;&#145;buying a stake in Royal Mail would be a distraction ... They should not do it, unless they can agree a really good price and conditions. Many investors are saying that, even at a cheap price, TNT should not do a deal&#146;&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90511-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0905117000080"></a>This is the reality of the potential partner, TNT. Surely this should give the Government pause for thought. Yet it appears that the Government have yet to consider the value of examining an alternative. Last week, Compass published its pamphlet <I>Modernisation  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_825"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 825</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by Consent.</I> It is proposing the establishment of an alternative structure for Royal Mail, maintaining it in the public sector, while ensuring sufficient investment through the direct investment of profits raised. Unfortunately, the Government&#146;s response, identical to their immediate response to Hooper, was to reject it out of hand. Apparently this proposal is &#147;a political fix&#148;. From where I am standing, the Government are in need of a few political fixes.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0905117000081"></a>I have drawn up these amendments to demonstrate how the proposals raised in the Compass pamphlet could be introduced. I am not saying they are the last word, but they could be introduced. There is substantial room for further discussion, particularly on the type of governance that a company limited by guarantee with no share capital would require. Not only would such a move offer an alternative route to a successful Royal Mail in the public sector, it would also be popular, allowing Royal Mail, including the post office network, some stability, with new elements of accountability in governance possible.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0905117000082"></a>Yesterday I noted in the <I>Sunday Times,</I> again from our lovely Library, that the most recent poll on Post Office privatisation indicated that a mere 20 per cent of those questioned were in favour. Sixty-nine per cent wanted the structure to remain the same or to be turned into a publicly owned, not-for-profit company. All those years that I have been involved in the Labour Party and listened to pollsters, there is always an inherent group in any polling that would oppose anything at all, but is 20 per cent any basis for moving towards the destruction of the wholly publicly owned Post Office?</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0905117000083"></a>I desperately want to see a fourth term for a Labour Government. That alone distinguishes me from some of the siren voices egging the Government on in this pursuit for privatisation. But all the published evidence is that privatisation of Royal Mail is deeply unpopular and will be hugely damaging to the Government&#146;s electoral prospects.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0905117000084"></a>From our debates in Committee, we learnt that the current modernisation proposals for Royal Mail management are fully funded. Indeed, despite agreement being reached with the Government in the financial year 2006-07, management have yet to acquire or deploy the walk-sequencing machines.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0905117000085"></a>I shall now go off the brief I prepared for myself. On the last day of Committee, this House was assured that it would get the details of what modernisation meant, the cost of the machines and their make, and where they would come from. This gives me the opportunity to repeat what I said in Committee. The Secretary of State said at Second Reading the machines were here and in wraps. There is nobody in this country who can tell you where those machines are&#151;not a company that says it has supplied them. Again I ask: where are those machines? Where are the wrappings? How much did they cost? When were they ordered? What is the lead time in getting delivery?</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0905117000086"></a>We have also learnt that the Government assuming responsibility for the pension fund deficit results in the company having an additional &#163;280 million capital per year for the next 14 years. If Ofcom ends this subsidy given to competitors via access arrangements, Royal Mail would have a further &#163;100 million capital a year  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_826"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 826</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on top of the additional &#163;280 million. This means that there is no financial imperative for privatisation, so perhaps privatisation is just a &#147;political fix&#148; after all.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0905117000087"></a>We know that the time for a sale, even if it were the right thing to do, would not be now. The Compass Group recently demonstrated that a sale now would yield only 50 per cent of what would have been achieved a year ago. Therefore, for reasons of public need, the integrity of the industry and its workforce, and financial prudence, I urge the Government to forgo the policy of privatisation. There is an alternative: all that it needs is for the Government to display the will to take it and the will to carry out their own manifesto commitments. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0905117000093"></a>Of course, the optimism shown by the noble Lord, Lord Clarke of Hampstead, and other Labour Back-Benchers is understandable because this is exactly what happened in 1998. I do not know whether the Secretary of State will remember that on 7 December 1998, when he was Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, he promised &#147;radical reforms&#148;, which included the possibility of part-privatisation. I quote his words:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="0905117000210"></a>&#147;I should make it clear&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="0905117000182"></a>this is more than 10 years ago&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0905117000229"></a>&#147;that we certainly do not rule out the possibility of introducing private shareholding into the Post Office&#151;for example, through the sale of a minority stake in it&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 7/12/98; col. 21.]</ul>
<p><a name="0905117000183"></a>Of course, all we got were 10 wasted years.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0905117000094"></a>Conservative support for genuine reform was not enough to bolster the resolve of the Secretary of State then, but I hope that it will be more successful now. I hope that, in responding to these amendments, he will respond also to our clear message of support for part-privatisation with a clear commitment that he, the Prime Minister and the Government will not waver. He must not once again be bullied into half-hearted reforms that will fail to deliver. That is why I do not support these amendments.</p>

I am not sure that the admonitions were aimed at the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, or indeed at me. However, as another principle of what we should do on Report&#151;that we should not repeat Second Reading speeches&#151;has been broken by the noble Lords, Lord Clarke and Lord Hunt, it behoves me to set out the Liberal Democrat position on the Bill. It is very clear: we agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Clarke of Hampstead should not be supported. We agree that the Government should not make the concessions that he is asking for.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0905117000096"></a>However, as the Minister is aware, there are two critical issues on which we require movement if we are to support the Bill, both of which will come up in later amendments that we have tabled. Depending on the Government&#146;s response, we will decide, here and in another place, whether to support the Bill. Our position is that we support the principle of what the noble Lord, Lord Clarke of Hampstead, calls part-privatisation; but we will not support the Bill unless the two critical amendments that we seek are adopted.</p>

I listened to my noble friend Lord Clarke making what I thought was an extremely reasoned appeal for moderation on the part of my noble friend the Secretary of State. He mentioned the efficiency of the Post Office, but he could also have made the point that we have all been talking about efficiency rather than price. Royal Mail has been portrayed as inefficient, which it untrue. We have one of the cheapest and most efficient postal services in Europe.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0905117000101"></a>I want to go over some of what my noble friend said about TNT. When the Minister replied before, it appeared that TNT was extremely interested in taking a 30 per cent stake in Royal Mail. I warned then that what it was really interested in was General Logistics Systems, the European parcels system, which is the jewel in the crown. Now that that is out in the open, perhaps my noble friend will say whether the press reports that a condition of the bid was that TNT would have control of GLS were true. That would be extremely serious news for Royal Mail because one development of the fall in the number of letters was to be an extension of the parcel service, but that would not happen if GLS were part of TNT.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0905117000102"></a>TNT&#146;s interest is waning because the financial position is worsening. I believe that its profits are 50 per cent down, so many of the shareholders are saying that, in the first instance, it must concentrate on putting its own house in order. I can only rely on the comments in the press. I know that my noble friend has said that he cannot discuss the details of any negotiations he may have had with interested parties. Once again, it is being said that &#163;3 billion was asked for but my noble friend Lord Clarke said that that was a giveaway. I understand that the offer is less than &#163;3 billion, which makes the situation even worse. Perhaps my noble friend will comment on the fact that the offer is nowhere near the &#163;3 billion valuation, which I understand was the Government&#146;s figure.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0905117000103"></a>Right now, Deutsche Post has fallen away and, if it is true that TNT is no longer very interested, the only remaining contender is CBC Capital, together with the Belgian post office. People do not appear to be queuing up to buy it and, when the market is at its lowest, it is the worst possible time to be offering it for sale. Apparently TNT is not prepared to offer anywhere near that price, which again is bad news for my noble friend the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0905117000104"></a>On the offer from the Opposition&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;I would like to see these unlikely partners marching together through the Division Lobby. I would be delighted to think that a manifesto proposal from the Labour Party is being defeated with Conservative support. That is not the kind of thing that I want written in the annals of the Labour Party. If we believe in something we should stand up for it. When we were talking about a planned programme of post office closures, we knew where the Liberals stood, but I did not know where the Conservatives stood. We shall come on to that. Perhaps the noble Lord opposite, who I know is always willing to reply, would reply in due course on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0905117000105"></a>My noble friend will speak to Amendment 92 shortly, but my name is attached to it and, although I must allow him to make his case himself, I think it is a very modest proposal. I do not see why the Secretary of State could not accept it because all it does is put off Part 1, dealing with part privatisation, for three years and it asks for three conditions to be met. The first is,</p>
<ul><a name="0905117000230"></a>&#147;the full implementation of the Pay and Modernisation Agreement&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0905117000184"></a>and it asks that it be signed. Secondly, it asks that, within three years of the passing of the Act, that funds be made available to Royal Mail, either through a national loan plan or through private capital, to which I referred previously. Thirdly, within three years the pension scheme will have passed over to the Government and, if all these aspirations are met, it can only strengthen the position of Royal Mail.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0905117000106"></a>The Hooper report has been referred to, but Royal Mail&#146;s financial position is different from what it was when the report was being prepared: all divisions are now profitable and will continue to make profit. It is going the right way and, with the removal of the yoke of the pension fund for which successive Governments were responsible, it will be in a far better position to go forward.</p>

<a name="90511-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0905117000107"></a>I hope that my noble friend will not listen to the siren voices on the Benches opposite offering their full support but listen to what we are saying. There are other ways of achieving our aims&#151;for instance, by continuing with the manifesto promise and with modernisation. A new factor is the waning interest of the people who might come in to take over through part privatisation. I look forward to hearing from my noble friend, as always. I hope that he has listened to what we have had to say and will be able to offer us hope for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0905117000110"></a>Everyone is in difficulty about one principal point of the Bill: that is, the issue of ownership. There are different schools of thought with different strengths behind them, but no one is quite certain whether part privatisation is the best way forward, whether the approach adopted for Railtrack or the BBC is the best way, or whether there might be considerable advantages in the status quo continuing, at least for a period.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0905117000111"></a>My noble friend Lord Clarke has pointed out that the weekend polls showed only 20 per cent support for privatisation. I do not wish to spend time on that but public opinion in either direction could easily change if, for example, Royal Mail did not change and we were faced with significantly higher costs of postage. Such charges are not so readily accepted here as they are in European countries, including Holland,  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_830"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 830</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Belgium and France. However, on the other side, there would be a reaction if there were a significantly poorer delivery service, as is the case in mainland Europe.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0905117000112"></a>My amendment offers a breathing space and a way through this difficulty. We should have one more shot at moving Royal Mail along under its present ownership, and three years is the best estimate that I have been able to obtain of the time it would take to complete the job. I do not accept that the present management has failed&#151;that has been repeated over and over again&#151;and I do not accept that its business plan has been lacking. Royal Mail is now profitable; it employs 50,000 fewer people than it did at the outset with only one compulsory redundancy; it is building new revenue streams and by 2012 parcels will represent 50 per cent of revenue and 75 per cent of profit. I hope that my noble friend the Secretary of State will at least reassure us that under no circumstances will the parcels business be part of any sale.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0905117000113"></a>Royal Mail has achieved that in the face of unfair competition. It could not have done so had the Communication Workers Union been as uncooperative as it has been painted. For a start, there is a long Royal Mail pay and modernisation agreement which was agreed in 2007. It is worth reading the introduction to that agreement, which in one sense says it all. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="0905117000211"></a>&#147;In order for Royal Mail to thrive as a business and to ensure that it remains able to compete effectively it is recognised that change is going to have to happen and at a scale and pace never experienced before.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="0905117000212"></a>Both Royal Mail and the CWU are jointly committed to working together to deliver that change by agreement, continuing to protect jobs (in line with our commitment in MTSF)&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="0905117000185"></a>which I do not understand&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0905117000231"></a>&#147;and provide high-quality terms and conditions for all employees.</ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="0905117000213"></a>Both parties recognise that a fresh start is needed and are committed to moving away from the adversarial relationships that persist in too many parts of the business. This needs to be replaced by respect for different viewpoints and a determination to work together to find common sense solutions that are mutually beneficial. This agreement lays the basis for changing how we work to ensure a successful future for this business, its employees and how the business and the CWU will work together&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0905117000114"></a>That was an extremely good start, and indeed it must have worked for a time, but somewhere along the way there must have been a stumble. Maybe it is a matter of&#151;in the old, trite phrase&#151;it takes two to tango. But I will come back to that. First, I would like to address one or two other aspects.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0905117000115"></a>On 24 February, Mr Crozier, chief executive of Royal Mail, gave evidence to the House of Commons Business and Enterprise Committee. On pages 40 and 41, Roger Berry MP asked:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="0905117000214"></a>&#147;Why does Royal Mail Group so passionately believe that a minority shareholding is necessary?&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0905117000186"></a>Mr Crozier said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="0905117000215"></a>&#147;As part of Hooper we said that in our view it boiled down to three requirements: equity capital, the pension solution and the change in the way we were regulated and the fairness of it in the wider market&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0905117000187"></a>Later, Mr Berry asked:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="0905117000216"></a>&#147;To cut to the chase, you have referred to equity capital, not private equity capital&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0905117000188"></a>Mr Crozier said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="0905117000217"></a>&#147;We did not in our submission&#148;,</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_831"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 831</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="0905117000189"></a>to which Mr Berry said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="0905117000218"></a>&#147;Exactly. Increased Government equity would be a possibility, would it not?&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="0905117000190"></a>to which Mr Crozier replied:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="0905117000219"></a>&#147;It is not for us to say from where it comes&#148;.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0905117000116"></a>I fully understand why Royal Mail would prefer equity capital. It is cheaper than borrowing, although it is a paradox that private enterprise itself so often eschews equity, usually because it diminishes the value of the present shareholdings. I sense that private equity capital carries with it clear potential risks for Royal Mail&#146;s long-term future, a risk over which perhaps we would have little influence. It may well be significant that Royal Mail and Mr Crozier have never once raised the question of private equity capital.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0905117000117"></a>As has been said, Deutsche Post does not seem to be at the table. TNT, which is always referred to, has an extremely bad reputation on trade unions and has recently announced a 5 per cent pay cut with certain threats attached. Its profits for the first quarter of this year have fallen by more than 50 per cent and its own unions have rejected the new pay agreement. The <I>Financial Times</I> updates what the noble Lord, Lord Clarke, said and has spoken to Robeco, one of the top 15 holders. Robeco told the <I>Financial </I><I>Times</I> that the chances of doing a deal are small. The reasons given were price, relationships with government and unions.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0905117000118"></a>I have grave doubts whether the Secretary of State will be able to strike a deal at 30 per cent, because one of the arguments advanced by one Robeco representative is that that would not give it sufficient power to bring about the change that is, in its opinion, required. I have mentioned the parcels issue, which is repeated in the <I>Financial Times</I> today. CVC is the remaining named applicant, though there may well be others we have not heard about. Has it got a record which provides us with what we need? It is a private equity company. Do private equity companies, and does CVC, invest for the long term? Am I right in saying that CVC has already sold off a large part of its mail investment? What future share sale or further buying rights would any private equity company seek?</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0905117000119"></a>Perhaps we, too, are overlooking the great differences between other European states and the United Kingdom in what, in this context, I will call downsizing legislation. EU experience, based on Eurogovernment requirements and Eurogovernmental financial contributions, will not be found in the United Kingdom. I wish my noble friend who was the general-secretary of the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Brussels was here, because he had to deal precisely with this issue when he was appointed essentially to run down his office. It took nearly two years. In one sense, this is easier, because the Government pick up a big proportion of the cost. But the benefits to workers make them more willing to go than they otherwise might be. There is nothing like it here at all. I ask the House to consider&#151;to the extent that there is, inter alia, a union problem&#151;whether it is really likely to help take Royal Mail forward if we parachute in a TNT or CVC Ross Kemp. I do not think so.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_832"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 832</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0905117000120"></a>So where are we? Earlier in my contribution I suggested that one more shot at moving Royal Mail along under present management was worth while. Again, I am encouraged by some of the evidence given by Mr Crozier to the Commons committee, one short extract of which is worth repeating. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="0905117000220"></a>&#147;Do we need to find ways to improve it&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="0905117000191"></a>that is, the relationship&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0905117000232"></a>&#147;and bring people with us? Absolutely. When we look at it, what kind of expertise do we need going forward? Like all big companies, we need more and better project directors and in any situation like this people who are experienced at brining in the kind of technology that we are about to use. This is not a kind of NHS IT issue. The machinery and technology we need to bring in exists and works so the risk is not to do with the machinery and the kit itself; it is the management capability in installing it. Do we need increased numbers and better skills in HR? Yes, we do. We know that we need to improve and we have been doing it steadily over the past few years. Like any company, we need to bring in skills at all levels of the business&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0905117000192"></a>I challenge whether we need to do that by selling off shares in the company. I am for allowing him to try and do what he said. This amendment provides that without losing the Government&#146;s goal if a last chance fails; rather it keeps semi-privatisation as a spur.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0905117000121"></a>This is not just a challenge to Mr Crozier, although he needs to assess objectively how Royal Mail&#146;s management style could improve. I guess that he and his senior managers should also get round their staff a bit more, perhaps, on appropriate occasions, with corresponding levels from the UCW.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0905117000122"></a>As an aside, when there were dreams about putting pay-as-you-earn on to computers, the board of the Inland Revenue and the union, the IRSF, moved the whole of Scotland&#146;s PAYE operation and the staff to East Kilbride by using the approach I have suggested, and there was no serious opposition. It can be done.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0905117000123"></a>I suspect that the union in this case, the CWU, will have to reassure us that it is ready, able and willing to continue modernisation. That means not just the executive committee but branches and members as well.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0905117000124"></a>I conclude with a personal thought for the Secretary of State. His grandfather, Lord Morrison of Lambeth, has been referred to previously in these debates. Despite the age gap, he was a good friend of mine. He gave me a copy of his autobiography, which I had a look at at the weekend. Herbert had several paragraphs on nationalisation, but this Bill is the other side of that coin. Herbert wrote:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="0905117000221"></a>&#147;In all nationalisation schemes, there is a moral question as well as an economic one&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0905117000193"></a>He explained that the Labour Party saw nationalisation as an end in itself and saw no need to carry out what we would call today a risk assessment. Have we carried out a risk assessment for this enterprise? If we have, I have not heard about it. I suggest that my noble friend the Secretary of State should reflect on his forebear&#146;s wisdom.</p>

So I am at least being consistent with my grandfather&#146;s views.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0905117000126"></a>I shall, if I may, pick up just one or two points from the remarks made by one or two of my noble friends. I shall not be drawn on the references to TNT, as my noble friend Lord Clarke invited me to do, except to say that it gives a taste of what potential bidders are up against when they show an interest in this. However, I simply do not accept either the premise or the import of my noble friend&#146;s remarks&#151;although whether TNT is a suitable bidder will remain to be seen.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0905117000127"></a>On the specific question concerning GLS, I can say that the Government&#146;s focus is on finding the right strategic partner for Royal Mail to help it modernise its core business in the UK, not on selling GLS. My noble friend Lord Clarke argued that, contrary to everything that I have said during our debates in this House, it is the global recession which is responsible for the fall in mail volumes. I agree that economic conditions will have an impact on postal volumes, particularly courier services for businesses, but Hooper found in his analysis that the traditional link between letter volumes and GDP began to fall away in 2003. Volumes have been falling since then.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0905117000128"></a>My noble friend also suggested that Royal Mail is now making more than its continental competitors. With respect, I think that he rather misses the point. Royal Mail&#146;s margins are less than 1 per cent for its letters business. Deutsche Post and TNT are facing tougher market conditions but they remain more profitable than Royal Mail, with profit margins of 12 per cent and 14 per cent respectively, and even with the declines in profit levels recently reported.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0905117000129"></a>Before turning to the detail of these amendments&#151;there are very many of them and I will ask the forbearance of the House if I respond with some substantial reasoned argument in the light of the case that has been made against the Bill&#151;I should first remind the House of the objectives behind this legislation.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0905117000130"></a>The legislation arises from the Hooper report commissioned by the Government in line with our 2005 manifesto and urged on us at the time, incidentally, by the CWU. The Hooper report was not specifically about ownership. At its heart was the universal postal service and how to maintain it. That drives the entire report from start to finish. Hooper found a Royal Mail which was critical to our country but which was labouring under several huge burdens, including the decline in the number of items sent through the post due to the shift to new technologies and a substantial and volatile pension deficit. While the company had a modernisation plan, in reality chronic industrial relations and obstruction at local branch level by the CWU, as the noble Lord, Lord Christopher, has mentioned, have meant modernisation is too slow and too often bogged down in a draining attrition between union and management.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0905117000131"></a>Hooper made his recommendation about a strategic partnership to help drive essential change&#151;the most controversial aspect of his report which was as a result of his analysis, not at the outset of it. He did not begin there. Of course some people find it easier to agree  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_834"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 834</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with the review&#146;s other parts&#151;on pensions and regulation&#151;than on the need for a strategic business partner, but Hooper was clear that all his proposals were a package to be taken in total not as individual parts.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0905117000132"></a>The Government could have ignored Hooper&#146;s findings and his recommendations. We could have found the nearest shelf, cleared a space, commented on the interesting nature of the report, patted Mr Hooper on the back and moved on. That response is not exactly without precedent, but what would have been the result? The Royal Mail we knew was in decline, with the universal letters delivery service under threat, put into the &#147;too difficult&#148; box because the Government of the day did not have the courage or the energy to take on the task. In the Government&#146;s view that is simply not an alternative; it is a dereliction of duty. The Cabinet was not prepared to see that happen.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0905117000133"></a>I might say, I did not seek this issue. Incidentally, I did not seek a quarrel with anyone. The subject came on to my watch after I returned to Government. Our postal service is too important, however, for me to accept the advice from one ardent critic of the Bill which was to leave well alone and &#147;manage decline&#148;. Our postal service and the public demand better than that.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0905117000134"></a>That is why we are discussing this package of change today. We cannot turn the clock back. We cannot wish away the internet, direct debit or any of the other liberating advances in technology that have freed up time for hard-pressed people. There is no going back. Life has changed. This is about a Royal Mail for the 21st century. There will be no managing decline sought by this Government if we can possibly do anything about it.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0905117000135"></a>Our goal is to put a publicly owned Royal Mail on a clear and swift path to modernisation and in so doing to secure the future of the universal postal service. That was our 2005 manifesto commitment, which said&#151;perhaps it is as well to quote from it:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="0905117000222"></a>&#147;Our ambition is to see a publicly owned Royal Mail fully restored to good health, providing customers with an excellent service and its employees with rewarding employment&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0905117000194"></a>In other words, there were two parts to our manifesto: commitment one, keeping Royal Mail in public ownership, which we are doing, and, secondly, to restore it to good health. Simply to leave it at public ownership without taking the further measures to restore it to good health would be irresponsible and an abdication by this Government in respect of our 2005 manifesto commitment.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0905117000136"></a>As Hooper outlined, to deliver the modernisation it requires, Royal Mail needs commercial confidence to act freed from the perception of political interference and through constructive engagement with the workforce rather than the mutual suspicion that we have today; it needs expertise from a postal or other network operator with a sound commercial track record; and, finally, it needs access to fresh capital&#151;hence the partnership approach for the company.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0905117000137"></a>My noble friend Lord Clarke&#146;s amendments reject our and Hooper&#146;s partnership proposals and instead would provide for the dissolution of Royal Mail Holdings plc and its replacement with a company limited by  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_835"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 835</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>guarantee. Perversely, my noble friend&#146;s suggestions remove the very important protections on future ownership of Royal Mail Group Ltd and Post Office Ltd enshrined in the Bill. In turning Royal Mail Holdings plc into a private company limited by guarantee, the amendments remove this company from public ownership and hence also remove Royal Mail Group Ltd and Post Office Ltd from public ownership. That is a rather surprising effect sought by my noble friend who, throughout, has been attached to 100 per cent public ownership. It is also counter to our key objective for the Royal Mail group of companies which is that they should remain publicly owned, with Post Office Ltd owned in its entirety by the Crown. I therefore could not support the amendments for that reason alone. However, there are other concerns.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0905117000138"></a>Typically the company limited by guarantee structure is used for smallish charitable bodies and membership organisations. We have some limited experience in a commercial environment, in Network Rail and Glas Cymru&#151;Welsh Water&#151;which are the usual examples used to illustrate the alternative to the Hooper recommendations. Neither Network Rail nor Welsh Water, unlike the Royal Mail, is in the public sector. They are private companies, and monopolies with fairly stable demand; all their earnings are determined by economic regulators, not by the choices of individual customers. They are run on a &#147;not for dividend&#148; basis and are accountable to a board of stakeholder members rather than to shareholders. Both those businesses rely heavily on contracting out the actual provision of services&#151;in the case of Welsh Water it is 100 per cent. That is hardly right for Royal Mail.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0905117000139"></a>Whatever the merits of Network Rail and Welsh Water as a model for the railway and water network, I do not believe that the model would work in the increasingly competitive and fast-changing environment of the postal market. A successful Royal Mail needs a different model that addresses each of the issues. First, where does the needed investment come from? Funding for Welsh Water and Network Rail comes from regulated charges, government grants and external debt, but Royal Mail could not rely on these for its funding needs. Royal Mail is not a monopoly, but operates in a competitive market place. As Hooper made clear, it faces competition not just from the postal sector but from the broader communications market. It cannot meet its investment needs by hiking up prices. Customers would just switch, increasingly, to alternatives. And Royal Mail cannot tolerate more debt. Although it has an extensive property portfolio, its existing debt is already secured on this. There are no further assets to offer as collateral. However, the proceeds from a new private sector partner for Royal Mail would fund modernisation.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0905117000140"></a>The second issue that needs to be addressed is where the necessary experience to drive modernisation would come from under the alternative model being proposed. There needs to be a major step change in Royal Mail&#146;s performance. Today&#146;s constraints on progress need to be countered by effective management and significant change in the industrial relations environment and union practices. To get this, we  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_836"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 836</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>need the practical, corporate experience of transforming a network company that only a commercial partner could bring. Bringing in more consultants or changing one or two of the senior management will not suffice.</p>
<a name="time_11"></a>
<a name="90511-0004.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="0905117000246"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0905117000141"></a>Thirdly, where would the impetus or the drive to modernise come from? I simply do not believe that a company limited by guarantee model would provide that impetus or that drive. Accountability to a group of stakeholders with disparate interests would not provide the strong and focused leadership that Royal Mail needs. That organisation needs to change and become more efficient, not stand still. &#147;Stakeholders&#148; would be no substitute for shareholders&#151;the Government and a strategic partner&#151;with capital at risk and a strong incentive to secure change. A company limited by guarantee model would depend instead on the regulator to drive change and improvement. Experience shows that effective regulation is vital but is not sufficient to drive necessary change in such a large and complex organisation.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0905117000142"></a>My view is that this amendment&#146;s proposition is led by politics first and what is necessary for Royal Mail a distant second. We can all vote for all sorts of nice-sounding structures, but the bottom line is: do they offer a convincing chance of delivering the very urgent modernisation which a Royal Mail remaining in public ownership requires? I suggest that the answer is no. I accept that the thinking behind the amendment is not opposed to collaboration between Royal Mail and any outsiders, as such, but on what basis would such a partner enter the business or be incentivised to drive the modernisation that the company needs?</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0905117000143"></a>The reality is that only a partner with an equity stake in the business will be motivated to help deliver the change needed in the timeframe required, because the business&#146;s success would produce a return on its investment. I hope that your Lordships will understand why the Government, after due consideration and discussion last week that involved the Prime Minister, have concluded that the alternative approach outlined by the Bill&#146;s opponents is unworkable and does not meet the challenges that Royal Mail faces. The best course for the Royal Mail to take is the one that this legislation sets out, as soon as the Bill is enacted and can be subsequently implemented.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0905117000144"></a>The Government&#146;s rejection of the other amendments in this group, which cover the commencement of Part 1 of the Bill, flows from the conclusion that we have reached and that I have now described. We cannot afford to take a wait-and-see approach by building in a three-year delay, as the amendments suggest; we have been waiting many years as it is. The evidence is clear that we must act as soon as market conditions and the bidding process allow. We want to see Royal Mail become a leader in the postal market, not spiral into decline. To do that, we must not build in any further delay.</p>

<a name="90511-0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0905117000145"></a>Partnership offers a fresh start for Royal Mail. It is the best way to meet the requirements for transforming Royal Mail that Hooper highlighted and which the Government accept: commercial confidence, access to  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_837"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 837</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>capital and experience of managing change. Action on pensions and regulation alone will not modernise the Royal Mail. That provides no incentive for Royal Mail to change or the external drive and push to make it happen. Only the full package of measures which the Government propose will deliver our objectives in full and secure the universal postal service. With all due respect for the sincerity of the amendment&#146;s mover and supporters, I call on my noble friend to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Let us go back to the beginning, when the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, made it absolutely clear that we are discussing a Conservative Party policy. I am delighted that he still shows the same clear insight into the problem that he did in Committee. It is to his credit and that of the party he serves that they know what they are about; I wish that I could say the same for ours. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, is looking for a guarantee of no U-turns. I do not know about those, but sometimes if you can make an argument that is better than the cobbled-together idea of selling off a valuable asset, it should be examined.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0905117000146"></a>In the past few moments, we heard that last week the Prime Minister said that there was no alternative. That was before today&#146;s amendments. There we are; it is a closed mind and no doubt we have heard, &#147;There is no alternative&#148;. People have said that in the past. It was known as &#147;TINA&#148; at the time: There Is No Alternative. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, understands the attitude of people and the feelings of private shareholders.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0905117000147"></a>As always, the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, is straight to the point and does not go round China to get to Chatham. He came straight out with it and gave us a little telling-off for making Second Reading speeches. When a number of amendments are grouped together like this, it is not possible to stick to one avenue of argument. The noble Lord said something that resonated with me as an old working-class socialist. He said that he does not think that we should be bullied. He also wants two commitments from the Government as we go through the rest of the Bill. I wish him the very best of luck. If they find favour with me, I will troop through the Lobby with anyone who seeks to protect our wonderful, valuable Post Office.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0905117000148"></a>My noble friend Lord Hoyle gave voice to the problems of TNT once again and spoke about the clarification of the &#163;3 billion. Throughout five days of Committee, Second Reading and today, we still do not know what they are talking about in terms of the money that they need. We know that what has been suggested was a sale to TNT, if the newspapers are correct; but I do not believe much in them anyway. My noble friend talked about the siren voices of the Opposition. That is what they are there for. That is their policy. You cannot blame the siren voice of someone seeing an opportunity to get their policy on the back of a Labour Government&#146;s proposal.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0905117000149"></a>My noble friend Lord Christopher addressed the ownership question in his amendments towards the end of the group. He asked whether British people would stand for poorer deliveries. They have stood for  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_838"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 838</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>them since the 2000 Act, haven&#146;t they? Who gets their mail at a reasonable time these days? Who gets their mail before they go to work? That does not happen any more. Under these proposals, if the Dutch operator comes in, it will be even later. We have heard a lot about dates and today, 11 May, I give noble Lords another forecast, which I made seven years ago. Mark my words, if this goes through, postal deliveries will get worse, they will be later and there will be erosion of the service that we provide, whether on collections, distribution or delivery.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0905117000150"></a>My noble friend also mentioned modernisation. I did not mention the CWU/Royal Mail modernisation agreement. I will put it on the record, since it has been mentioned in the debate, that 50,000 jobs have gone since the infamous Postal Services Act 2000. In the past few moments, we heard again about inefficient management, where we will have to bring people in who have expertise. Expertise in what&#151;sacking more people? The modernisation agreement has already penetrated more than 90 per cent of the whole of the operations of Royal Mail. To listen to some people today, you would think that Royal Mail has failed miserably. There are still more than two years of that agreement to run. I do not know whether it is too long an agreement, or whether it should have been shorter. I did not negotiate it, but the people who did so did a good job, and they honoured it. As my noble friend Lord Christopher said, 50,000 jobs disappeared&#151;that is 50,000 duties and posts, but only one compulsory redundancy. Does that smack of obduracy, obstruction and difficulties? Or does it say that there was common-sense working to get this agreement through in various places? I am the first to admit that there are some areas where it is difficult for people to vote to lose their own jobs or to change their own jobs. That is not easy.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0905117000151"></a>My noble friend Lord Christopher also mentioned differences in the European Union. I said so much in Committee to prove that this country of ours has a postal service as good as you will get anywhere, especially for the price. That is often forgotten. This is the cheapest country in Europe for post at the basic rate or the first step up. Some of the competitors that we hear about already have a monopoly for those letters posted at the basic rate.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0905117000152"></a>The Secretary of State said that private companies are faced with these different proposals. He said that he would not be drawn on the references to TNT, but why not? Are the British people not entitled to know that that firm has a rotten record of industrial relations, a rotten record of increasing its postage and a record of reducing its service? Are the British people not entitled to know that that is the company some people want to get into bed with? It is not good enough and we should be able to say it. Later on someone mentioned one ardent critic&#151;surely that is not referring to me. I do not suppose that TNT is worried about an ex-postman from Hampstead. It is more worried about the money that it will invest and the returns that it will get when it starts stripping the company that it wants to get hold of.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0905117000153"></a>We did not receive a clear answer on GLS focus. The Government should tell us clearly that GLS, as a profitable parcel service that is serving Europe, with  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_839"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 839</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the possibility of expansion and greater profitability, should be a no-go area for any sale that might take place. It is not good enough to come here and say that we will be focused. It makes me very cross.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0905117000154"></a>The global recession was mentioned. Hooper started in 2003 and in 2002 I was telling the Government that the main problem was the loss of revenue due to the unfair and biased regulator, which thankfully, later in the Bill, is being replaced by Ofcom. Not before time, Postcomm will get its marching orders, although not before the &#163;100 million a year lost by the Post Office in the past 10 years on top of the money that had to be paid into the pension scheme.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0905117000155"></a>It is easier to talk about pensions and regulations in the abstract. As a former trustee of the Royal Mail and Post Office BT schemes, I know exactly why the Government have the responsibility for any deficit. It is quite clear that the regulation that allowed them to take a pensions holiday for all those years was the same regulation that allowed them to suspend payments because they would be responsible for the deficit. I remember going to the lawyers on behalf of my colleagues to say that it was unfair. We were still paying 6 per cent of every member's money into a pension scheme and the employers were doing nothing.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0905117000156"></a>We are told that the Government did not have the courage, but what courage is needed to renege on a conference decision? You just cock a snoot to those people who diligently went along to the policy forum of the party and sat down and argued the case at what is known as the Warwick agreement and understood that there would be a wholly publicly owned Post Office. It does not need courage.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0905117000157"></a>We talked about bringing in other expertise, but I could rattle off a list of names of decent people who were got rid of by the Post Office&#151;people such as Brian Thompson, Jerry Cope and Brian Roberts. They could not manage because political interference at the time would not allow them to manage as some people would have wanted them to. There were people who could have solved these problems and it is not good enough to blame union agreements and obduracy in a couple of areas for all the problems.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0905117000158"></a>I am shocked that the Prime Minister could say last week that he rejects any alternative when there is a sensible alternative, although not necessarily mine. We will find out in a few moments whether it has any support. Certainly, my noble friend Lord Christopher has spent hours trying to understand how we can get out of this impasse&#151;the Government have painted themselves into a corner. I have no pleasure in saying that I will divide this House, and I may be the only one. I think we have to have two.</p>

I apologise somewhat to the House for tabling Amendment 3 at this stage. I should probably have done so in Committee, but afterthought is a great thing. The amendment concerns a small point and I suspect that, when he responds, the Minister will give the answer set out on page 41 of the Government&#146;s response to the Select Committee report. There, they state clearly that there will be a new board for Post Office Ltd with a non-executive chair to provide a new level of support and challenge for the Post Office&#146;s management team.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0905117000162"></a>When we reflected on the Bill following Committee, it seemed important to include in it the commitment that Post Office Ltd will have a separate board of directors. If a minority investment is to be brought into Royal Mail, it is important that Post Office Ltd has a separate management. The structure should be such that the minority shareholder should not be able to influence decisions made by Post Office Ltd, because under the reforms that the Government wish to bring in, Royal Mail and the Post Office will be separated structurally. As I said, perhaps I should have tabled this amendment in Committee but I should welcome the Minister&#146;s opinion on whether it is necessary for that requirement to be put into the Bill.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0905117000163"></a>Amendment 63 is much more fundamental, and it goes to the heart of the remarks that I made during the interesting Second Reading-type debate that we had on the previous amendment. As the Minister is well aware, as a fundamental condition of our supporting the Bill, we require significant assurances that this is a one-off opportunity to secure the independence and financial security of the post office network for the foreseeable future. We debated this at great length in Committee, and we have slightly altered the amendment here. In Committee, we suggested a figure of &#163;2 billion in order to try to flush out from the Government what investment they thought was necessary to produce a secure post office network, but we have not put in a fixed figure in this amendment. On the other hand, we feel that, if the Bill is passed, it is critical that it should contain significant assurances about the long-term future of the post office and sub-post office network. That is our reason for tabling Amendment 63 at this stage. I beg to move.</p>

Anything that gives the Post Office a secure future has my total support. We are talking here about the possibility of increasing the figures in the future and applying them to the areas of the country that are most in need.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="0905117000165"></a>When we previously debated this matter, I received an assurance from the Secretary of State about planned post office closures. However, we did not get Conservative  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_843"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 843</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>support for that from the person speaking from the Opposition Front Bench. Are the Conservatives in favour of that position or not? When the noble Lord replies from the Conservative Front Bench, can we have an assurance that they join the rest of us in being against future post office closures? The Opposition have made a big case of saying that they support the Post Office and that they are against closures, but we have not heard from them here. We heard from the Secretary of State, who gave me that assurance, and that is why I did not table another amendment. He has repeated that assurance but, as I said, we have not heard anything about the position of the Opposition Benches. Therefore, I should like to know from whichever noble Lord is speaking from that Front Bench what their position is on future closures.</p>

I apologise for not taking part in the debates on the Bill. As noble Lords know, I have long been interested in the Post Office, and in particular in the post office network in rural areas. However, working on two Bills at once is a challenge.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="0905117000167"></a>The references in my noble friend&#146;s amendment to,</p>
<ul><a name="0905117000233"></a>&#147;the services the company&#146;s post offices may provide to the public under arrangements with a government department&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="0905117000196"></a>and,</p>
<ul><a name="0905117000234"></a>&#147;any additional services the company&#146;s post office may provide to the public&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="0905117000197"></a>underline my conviction that we need a secure post office network. Over the years, we have seen many closures. There were closures when we were in government, and there has been a horrendous number of closures since this Government have been in office.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="0905117000168"></a>Perhaps I may also raise with the Minister the future of postal card accounts. I have been fighting on this issue since 2000, when the Postal Services Bill went through. I am sorry if this matter was dealt with in Committee, but I could not be here. It is crucial in some areas for people to be able to access their benefits through the card account. I and many others believe that a lot of pressure has been put on individuals to receive their benefits in other ways, such as having them paid into a bank. As noble Lords know, this has had a huge effect on the profitability of sub-post offices.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="0905117000169"></a>I accept that it costs more to put business through the post office network; but it seems odd that we cannot find a system for the postal account that does not cost the amount quoted over the years of 99p per transaction. I understand that that is unacceptably high. I raise this because we have seen, and continue to see, many closures of rural post offices. At the same time, there are very few banks left in rural areas, so many people, particularly older members of the community and those with young children, find accessing their entitlements extremely difficult. I hope that the Minister will give me a reassuring answer about the Government&#146;s thinking on this.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="0905117000170"></a>More importantly, I hope that we will free up the Post Office to find new work: that is what the Bill is about. I cannot remember the figures, but the Post Office is one of the biggest providers of foreign currency to those who travel overseas. Local authorities also  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_844"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 844</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have big role to play in helping post offices to help themselves. It is difficult to be specific: I accept the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, that none of us wants to see further closures. However, sadly in some places there will be further closures, and they will not necessarily be in rural areas; some of them will be in urban areas. The Government gave a commitment that there should be a post office accessible within three miles of every person. When we debated this previously in the House, we said that if you are elderly or pushing a child in a pram, three miles is actually six miles. These are practical issues.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="0905117000171"></a>I apologise to noble Lords for my intervention, but I am very concerned about the future of the Post Office card account, and hope that any new business will benefit not only the Post Office itself, but also those who use post offices, and particularly the most vulnerable users. I heartily support my noble friend&#146;s Amendment 24.</p>

<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="0905117000172"></a><b><a name="90511-0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0905117000601"></a>Lord Hunt of Wirral:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, for his amendment. It represents a real step towards addressing the concerns which we raised in Committee about the post office network. I shall also respond to the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, and praise my noble friend Lady Byford who has a tremendous track record in fighting for the future of post offices, the Post Office card account and to secure the future of the post office network. I thank her for her contribution, not only in her support for Amendment 24 in my name and that of my noble friend Lord De Mauley, but also for making her point about the need to free up post offices to provide other services which are much needed in the community.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="0905117000173"></a>As was said in Committee, post offices were very under-represented in the Bill. As we pointed out in the previous debate, after some 10 years of neglect, Royal Mail is being dealt with and put on the path to success. I should like to see the same amount of attention and support given to post offices. We have had some useful assurances from the Secretary of State, in particular the promise that no more programmes of closures are being planned, which is very welcome. Quite enough damage has been done to the network already by this Government.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="0905117000174"></a>In Amendment 23 the Secretary of State has made a very welcome move to bring forward the need for annual reports on the post office network. That was not in the Bill but we all pressed for it. The way in which this is set out in Amendment 24 could be improved but, at last, we have post offices in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="0905117000175"></a>The duty to report on the network is one which we on this side hope will keep the issue of closures alive. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, that not only do I want to see the existing network maintained and improved, but ideally I should like to see many of the closures reversed. I am very happy to put that on the record. For that to happen much more attention needs to be paid to the matters that my noble friend and I have raised in Amendment 24.</p>

<a name="90511-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="0905117000176"></a>Our amendment seeks to extend the reporting requirement to cover the services which post offices are liable to provide. In Committee, we had a number of questions about the future of what was called post bank. Since then, we have heard a number of important  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_845"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 845</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>items. It may be that the Secretary of State will refer to that. I was particularly pleased to hear Alan Cook, the managing director of Post Office Ltd, when giving evidence to the Select Committee in the other place, announce details and disclosure of the plans for current accounts to be available in post offices. Apparently, full details have now been published so the Secretary of State might like to refer to that. That is exactly the kind of initiative which should be brought forward and which should continue in the future.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90511-0006.htm"/>


<a name="90511-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="0905117000177"></a>However, my amendment makes it clear that it is not just financial services which will ensure the long-term future of the post office network, but also the business which government departments are able to put the way of the Post Office. The report we are now talking about would be a very useful way of seeing whether the enthusiasm which the Secretary of State has said that the Government have for post offices leads to revenue being sent their way. The amendment in my name and that of my noble friend would ensure that there is some scrutiny of how the reorganisation of the Royal Mail group will affect the post offices. Even with a wealth of financial services and government business crossing their desks, post offices will, of course, always be about post. Any weakening of that relationship, especially when it leads to a reduction in the most secure and reliable of Post Office revenue, needs to be known about and acted on.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09051114000001"></a>I was pleased that the Secretary of State fulfilled his commitment to this House to publish the Government&#146;s response to the Select Committee in the other place before we reached Report stage. It may have been a fine line&#151;it was published today at 1 pm&#151;but the House is grateful for that commitment being fulfilled and the response being published much earlier than would otherwise have been the case. That shows a tremendous amount of respect for this House and I am grateful to him for it. In that light, I hope he will accept my amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09051114000002"></a>On the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, I agree with the noble Lord, as I did in Committee, that it is very important that the Post Office company has its own board of directors. I would welcome any assurances that the Secretary of State can give on the Post Office&#146;s freedom from political interference in the future. I also agree that the Post Office network should be given the government support it needs, including, if possible, for the reopening of post offices that were shut down in the face of so much public opposition in recent years.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09051114000003"></a>However, there must be no further delay to this Bill. It has already come several years later than we would have liked and Royal Mail needs sorting out immediately. Although I completely agree that many improvements could and should be made to government policy towards post offices, I do not agree with holding Royal Mail hostage as a method of getting them, as I am afraid Amendment 63 does. I therefore have much pleasure in urging on this Chamber Amendment 24.</p>

<a name="09051114000006"></a><b><a name="90511-0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09051114000276"></a>Lord Mandelson:</b> My Lords, I shall respond first to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. The Government announced in November that the Post Office would be awarded the successor contract for the Post Office card account and that this will run from 2010 to 2015, with the possibility of a two-year extension beyond that. So the card account is now safely re-anchored and the Government do not encourage any failure to use it in smaller or rural post offices. The noble Baroness is right that the Post Office is the leading provider of foreign exchange in the UK. That goes to show that it has an untrumpeted role and record of achievement in this area which it is as well for us to recall from time to time.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09051114000007"></a>This group of amendments covers a variety of important issues which need to be addressed individually. The requirement in Amendment 3 concerning the Post Office board is already met through the current Post Office board. Since Post Office Ltd was incorporated in 1987, it has been subject just like any other private limited company to company law requirements about the minimum number of directors it should have. Company legislation subject to detailed scrutiny in this House and the other place is the right place to define the appropriate corporate governance principles for companies, and Post Office Ltd&#146;s current board far exceeds statutory requirements. It has nine directors, including Donald Brydon, whom we recently appointed as interim chair. This amendment would not require nearly as extensive a board for the Post Office. It would, in a sense, mark a step back.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09051114000008"></a>Nevertheless, we have committed to reconstitute this board with a full complement of non-executive directors, starting with the permanent appointment of a non-executive chairman. The new board will benefit from the operational expertise of the existing management and the combined wisdom and experience of the new non-executive appointees.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09051114000009"></a>Amendment 63, concerning an investment fund, talks about opening up new post office branches where there is a defined need. This already happens. The access criteria that we have set ensure that all areas will continue to have reasonable access to post office services. At the end of March, 93.3 per cent of the total population across the UK were within one mile of their nearest post office outlet and 99.7 per cent were within three miles. There is also a criterion that prescribes access to post offices in each and every post code district. When the access criteria were introduced exactly  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_847"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 847</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>two years ago, 18 postcode districts did not comply. The Post Office has systematically introduced new services in these 18 areas so that by 12 May there will be a service available in each of them. That is a remarkable achievement. However, this is an ever-evolving obligation for the Post Office. In some very remote communities the closure of a single branch can lead the Post Office to fail to comply with the access criteria. Post Office Ltd must, and does continue to remedy this in each case by finding ways to re-establish and maintain services in all areas.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09051114000010"></a>On investment capital, as part of the discussions that we will shortly have with the Post Office regarding its next funding deal, we will consider the case for new investment in both Crown and sub-post offices to modernise and improve the quality of service for customers, for example by reducing queuing times. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, will welcome that, because it is potentially a very important commitment which I discussed only last week with the National Federation of SubPostmasters. Such investment might help attract more business, strengthening the viability of individual branches. I hope that noble Lords will agree that it would not be appropriate to commit to a particular type of investment in isolation from considering the broader needs of the network.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09051114000011"></a>This amendment also calls on us to put more government services through the network. Since Committee, there has been yet further evidence of the Government&#146;s commitment to the network, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, was kind enough to acknowledge. The Identity and Passport Service has announced that it is working with the Post Office to ensure that people can apply for new biometric passports and ID cards at their local branch.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09051114000012"></a>On financial services, as I said, we need to think carefully about whether we are in danger of reinventing the wheel. On 21 April, Alan Cook, managing director of Post Office Ltd, told the Business and Enterprise Select Committee in another place that, in effect, a post bank already exists. As he set out, Post Office Ltd already offers an extensive range of financial services products: savings, insurance, mortgages, credit cards, and more than 1,400 free-to-use cash machines providing further access to cash across the network. The Post Office also supports work to increase financial inclusion by providing access to basic bank accounts from 17 different providers. The Post Office therefore plays a vital role providing access to financial services through its network of 11,500 branches.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09051114000013"></a>We are keen for the Post Office to increase its financial services offering and to use its unrivalled network to put a wider range of services within reasonable reach of the whole population. So we are currently exploring new possibilities on financial services with the Post Office. As part of this, Alan Cook, the managing director, has said that it has an aspiration to expand its mortgage business and&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, said&#151;to launch a current account which is available in every branch next year. The Post Office is also in discussion with the Association of British Credit Unions to see what opportunities there might be for the two organisations to work more closely together to increase financial inclusion.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_848"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 848</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90511-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09051114000014"></a>Finally, we must also consider the wider effect that this amendment would have on Royal Mail&#146;s transformation. The amendment would prevent implementation of this Bill, and therefore the transformation of Royal Mail, until the Government made an order describing the detailed terms of its future investment in the Post Office. However, if we are unsuccessful in reversing the decline in Royal Mail&#146;s business, the Post Office&#146;s business will decline too. The two things are connected. It is in the interests of both Post Office Ltd and its network of post offices to see Royal Mail&#146;s finances turn round and its business transformed. Therefore, to hold up the transformation of the Royal Mail in the way that we are currently seeking&#151;for the sake of the Government setting out even more clearly on top of what they have already stated and described as their investment plans and commitment to the Post Office&#151;would have a detrimental effect on the Post Office itself and would not be desirable.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09051114000015"></a>The Government have already provided funding of &#163;3.5 billion to Royal Mail. In spite of this, the company has failed to transform fast or far enough adequately to respond to the ongoing digital revolution. The market within which Royal Mail operates has changed irrevocably and continues to evolve. Action&#151;not to build in delay, as is conceived in this amendment&#151;is needed now. It would be irresponsible of the Government to allow delays to the suite of measures needed to reform Royal Mail and secure the future of the universal postal service.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09051114000016"></a>The Post Office&#146;s current comprehensive &#163;1.7 billion funding deal lasts until March 2011. While discussions about the next funding deal will begin shortly, their completion should not hinder the drive to transform Royal Mail that this Bill would bring. The sooner these are implemented, the sooner Royal Mail will be modernised and the sooner the risks to the Post Office of Royal Mail declining in the mails market will be removed. Any delay would merely serve to threaten the sustainability of the network.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09051114000017"></a>I turn to Amendments 23 and 24; first to the one that is in my name. I think that we are all in agreement that the post office plays a critical role in our communities; that post offices are vital in providing access to Royal Mail&#146;s postal services; and that the network has a wider social and economic role providing vital access to services throughout the UK, particularly for vulnerable consumers and small businesses. Given this, it is important that both the Government and Parliament receive robust information about the size, location and accessibility of the post office network. Amendment 23 will require Post Office Ltd to provide exactly that. This amendment goes further than the current information duty on Postcomm. There will be a statutory duty on Post Office Ltd to produce an annual report which must contain information about the accessibility of post offices to particular groups of consumers and any other information requested by the Secretary of State. The report must also be laid before Parliament.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09051114000018"></a>I welcome the support from Age Concern, Help the Aged, the Federation of Small Businesses and the CWU for this amendment. I hope that the many noble Lords who have previously spoken on the importance of having such information available, will also support it.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09051114000019"></a>I turn to the amendment of the noble Lords, Lord Hunt and Lord De Mauley. I agree that the report should also provide information about the critical services offered across the post office network. I would therefore like to consider the noble Lords&#146; amendment in detail and shall come back to the House at Third Reading.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09051114000020"></a>I therefore propose that my new clause should stand part of the Bill and ask the noble Lords not to press their amendment. For the reasons I outlined earlier, I also ask the noble Lords, Lord Razzall and Lord Cotter, not to press their amendments.</p>

I think that we have unanimity in your Lordships' House on that issue.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09051114000023"></a>As far as our Amendment 63 is concerned, we have a bit of a difficulty. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, is concerned about it, because he thinks that the Government have delayed for far too long in introducing the reforms that the Royal Mail needs and that this is therefore a distraction, holding back the amendments that are required for the Royal Mail. We think that that is exactly the point, because this is the moment at which we can pressurise Her Majesty's Government to ensure that there are commitments in the Bill for the post office network. It has been several months since the Secretary of State came to this House with his Statement on the post office network and, of course, he is a very busy man. I have no doubt that he is completely committed to trying to sort out what should happen to the Post Office, but I am sure that he could produce a list of 20 other things that he also has to sort out. We are nervous that if we do not force through some amendment of this nature at this time, the issue of how to deal with the Post Office will be kicked into the long grass in the way that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, has accused the Government of kicking the Royal Mail into the long grass and not grasping the nettle&#151;if that is not a terrible mixed metaphor. We feel that this is the moment for putting in the Bill a commitment as to what the Government are going to do about the post office network.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09051114000024"></a>I accept that this may not be the best amendment, but we shall not get to voting on it&#151;assuming we divide the House&#151;until Wednesday. Therefore, it certainly is not too late for the Government to think whether there is some form of words that would satisfy us, because this is a fundamental point for these Benches. We feel that for far too long good words have been said about the Post Office&#151;indeed, until the Secretary of State came into office, there were post office closures, but we accept his integrity and determination to do something about the post office network. If this is not the right form of words, let us try to find one. There is general feeling on these Benches that we ought to try to find something to put in the Bill to secure the future of the post office network. In the mean time, I am happy to withdraw Amendment 3.</p>

It became clear in Committee that as regards the final shape of the deal, the Secretary of State is keen to keep as much flexibility as possible in the Bill. Although that is understandable, there is a clear need for the details to be made as transparent as possible and to be available as soon as possible, and for the appropriate people to be fully accountable for the way in which they have disposed of shares in a public asset.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09051114000026"></a>The Secretary of State helpfully proposed in Committee that he would make a Statement to this House when the deal is concluded. We welcome that assurance. We hope, however, with this amendment to ensure that the  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_851"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 851</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>debate such a Statement will undoubtedly trigger is as informed as possible. A Statement, while entirely appropriate for allowing this House the opportunity to question the Government on their actions, cannot contain the level of detail that we and the public need to know.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09051114000027"></a>There is more to this deal than just the question of how much money was got for how many shares, although this will be one of the critical questions. For example, we have particular concerns over whether the private partner will be able to take the necessary decisions. The Secretary of State has been at great pains to reassure those sitting behind him that the Royal Mail will remain a publicly owned and controlled body. Unfortunately, he has done so much in that direction that we have concerns about whether the private partner will have any power at all to make politically unpopular decisions. Ambiguous words like &#147;a meaningful say&#148; and &#147;shared responsibility&#148; can mean very different things to different people.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09051114000028"></a>As we will be making clear in a later debate today, we are also keen on the establishment of an employee share scheme. We would be extremely unhappy to find that the Government have negotiated away the possibility that one could be set up. I hope, therefore, that the Government will accept our amendment and will also take this opportunity to give this House any further information that the Minister can about what sort of deal the Government are working towards. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09051114000029"></a><b><a name="90511-0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09051114000280"></a>Lord Mandelson:</b> My Lords, this amendment looks to introduce requirements for Government to report to the House on the issue and disposal of shares or rights in the Royal Mail company and the ability of the private sector partner to meet certain selection criteria. As I said during debate in Committee, I recognise your Lordships&#146; legitimate interest in any partnership deal and that you would wish to be assured, and rightly so, that Government are meeting the objectives they have set out for the transaction. I said that we would need to report to both Houses on the deal.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09051114000030"></a>The transaction process is continuing and we remain committed to finding the right partner for this business and ensuring that any deal represents value for money for the taxpayer. I have already provided the House with details on our current intentions in relation to a partnership deal and committed to provide further updates throughout the passage of the Bill. I understand that noble Lords opposite remain keen, however, to have what further detail we can provide. The agreement with any partner will, as I have said, be subject to negotiation and will be covered by a legally binding agreement. I have already explained that this agreement will make clear what the buyer can do, for example on board appointments, and what it cannot do, for example by placing restrictions on sales of its shares.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09051114000031"></a>Perhaps it might be helpful if I outline some of the other areas the agreements will cover. The shareholder agreement will set out those matters requiring shareholder consent. I previously mentioned the company&#146;s future business strategy but other areas are likely to include any acquisitions or disposals, future incentive schemes, future funding of the business, key executive appointments and dividend policy. The detail on the treatment of  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_852"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 852</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>these issues will be subject to negotiation with any partner but, as I have already made clear, we expect the agreement to reflect that this is a partnership, giving the partner a real, genuine say in the running of the business&#151;after all, otherwise what on earth would be the point. The agreement will ensure that there can be no perception of political interference in the operations of the company.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09051114000032"></a>We have seen time and again, when management of the Royal Mail has sought to introduce modernising changes within the business, that the union has approached or politically invited the Government to intervene and operate in a way that, frankly, does not leave the management the proper freedom it needs in order to take the business forward. A partner would not accept that sort of practice, and neither would we.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09051114000033"></a>The agreement would also cover transfer restrictions on the shares sold to a partner. For example, it will ensure that they are tied into the business for an appropriate period to meet our objectives for modernisation.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09051114000034"></a>On the specifics of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, given my commitments to be transparent about the deal, I wholeheartedly support the intention behind the amendment. However, I see two issues with this particular amendment. First, it would require the Secretary of State to report to Parliament before issuing or disposing of any shares or rights to a private partner. There are significant disadvantages to this approach, which could effectively act as a potential barrier to a deal being struck.</p>

<a name="90511-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09051114000035"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, made an important point in Committee, which I believe is relevant here. He highlighted the differing role of Parliament versus the Executive. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="09051114000070"></a>&#147;There is a point at which the role of Parliament is to define objectives and give the Government permission to take a course of action ... in some of the things that we are asking to be brought back to Parliament, such as negotiation details and choice of partner ... we might be crossing the line by getting Parliament too involved in executive matters of judgment and discussions&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 31/3/09; col. 967.]</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90511-0007.htm"/>


<a name="90511-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09051114000036"></a>Therefore, while I have said that I agree that the Government should report to both Houses on any partnership deal, I believe that it is more appropriate that this should be after the Executive have done their job and a legally binding deal has been agreed with the partner. To erect a parliamentary barrier to any such agreement would operate as a powerful disincentive to any negotiating partner with which we are reaching an agreement, and I would not wish any reporting provision in the Bill to delay a deal being agreed and signed.</p>

<a name="90511-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09051114000037"></a>Secondly, the amendment sets out the criteria which we have outlined will be used to assess the current partnership proposal. But under this amendment, the obligation to report on these criteria would apply to any potential share sale. It would not necessarily follow that these same criteria would apply to any future sale of shares under the Bill. Therefore, while I support the intention behind this amendment, and indeed do not believe that the noble Lord and I are too far apart on the issue, I cannot support it as drafted. I am, though, happy to agree to consider a variation of the amendment and come back to the House at Third Reading. In the light of this I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I quite understand that when a workforce feels that it is being challenged or pushed to modernise or bring about change by the management, and feels that the management is being unreasonable or is not taking into consideration the workforce&#146;s or its union&#146;s views, the temptation is only too great and too obvious to go to the shareholder&#151;the Government&#151;and say, &#147;Come on, give us a hand here, get the management to see things more our way or ask the management to delay this until they&#146;ve consulted us&#148;. That is the sort of process that has inhibited change in the Royal Mail for too long and it really has to stop.</p>

This technical amendment changes paragraph 4 of that Schedule. It may be helpful if I explain the purpose of that paragraph before I turn to the detail of the amendment. The movement of assets between companies in the same group is generally tax-neutral under existing tax rules. However, anti-avoidance degrouping rules can cause a tax charge to arise when a company which received an asset is subsequently regarded as leaving the same tax group of companies.</p>

<a name="90511-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09051114000047"></a>As we have previously outlined, the introduction of a partner will require a reorganisation of the current group under Royal Mail Holdings. This restructuring and the subsequent sale of a minority stake in Royal Mail Group Ltd to a partner could result, for tax purposes, in Royal Mail Group Ltd or one of its subsidiaries being regarded as having left the tax group, hence triggering a tax charge. Paragraph 4 is intended to prevent a tax degrouping charge from arising in the case of a subsidiary of a Royal Mail company that is publicly owned. Royal Mail Group Ltd will remain publicly owned, unless primary legislation is introduced to change that. Subsidiaries of Royal Mail Group Ltd that are not themselves designated as Royal Mail companies could, in theory, cease to be publicly owned. We have no plans to do that but, should it occur, the subsidiary would be treated as leaving the tax group at that time.</p>

<a name="90511-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09051114000048"></a>Turning to the amendment, although the intention of paragraph 4 is relatively straightforward, the possible application is not. A range of possible scenarios could arise, depending on which subsidiaries are affected and the timing of asset transfers and degrouping events for tax purposes. We have now identified that although paragraph 4 as drafted delivers the appropriate tax treatment for the majority of those scenarios, it does not do so for all. Failure to address that could result in an unintended tax advantage for the subsidiary leaving the group and the buyer. We therefore seek to replace paragraph 4 with an amended version, ensuring that the appropriate tax treatment will apply in every case. I beg to move.</p>

We have long argued that one reform essential for Royal Mail Group Ltd is to introduce a significant element of employee ownership. We have talked about that as a John Lewis-type trust ownership, or co-operative organisation, and we are suggesting that at least 25.5 per cent of ownership of Royal Mail should be held by the employees. Since we started arguing this, three or four years ago, the decline in the success of the traditional capitalist structure demonstrates even more readily why this model of ownership would be good for the Royal Mail group.</p>

<a name="90511-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09051114000050"></a>The arguments that have been used against us, in no particular order, are, first, that the union does not want it&#151;well, they wouldn&#146;t, would they? The second argument is that there is no evidence that the employees of Royal Mail Group Ltd want it, which is a dubious argument. The third is that were 25.5 per cent to be put into the shared ownership trust, leaving up to 49 per cent held by the private sector&#151;TNT, or whichever partner is brought in&#151;and only 25 per cent in the hands of the Treasury, then the organisation would no longer qualify as a public sector one. We do not accept that argument, because it would be easy to amend the legislation to ensure that that would not be the case. We have argued this long before the Bill came to your Lordships&#146; House; we argued it in Committee, and I do not wish to argue it again at length. I beg to move.</p>

He talked about the John Lewis trust. I understand that if you leave John Lewis, you are not able to have the shares; they have to remain behind. What concerns me about employee ownership is that when the bus companies went into being owned by employees, as soon as a good offer came from Stagecoach they were quite prepared to sell them. That rather defeated the objective of an employee-owned company or employee shares. I am interested in how the noble Lord would safeguard against that.</p>

I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, for speaking in support of Amendment 18. As both noble Lords will know, we raised the question of employee share ownership schemes in Committee. The amendment tabled by the Government gives us some reassurance, but does not go as far as we would like.</p>

<a name="90511-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09051114000056"></a>On these Benches, we feel that employee share schemes are one of the most effective ways of engaging employees in the development and success of their employer. By being encouraged to take a stake in the overall profitability of the company, employees are able to share the benefits of Royal Mail&#146;s transformation. However, on this matter I do not see quite eye to eye with the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, and his colleagues. Their preferred type of employee share scheme is not ours. I feel strongly that the incentives and benefits are best enjoyed when the scheme involves ordinary, fully transferable shares. Past examples of employees&#146; enthusiasm, when offered the chance to take up a proper share in their employer, support our view.</p>

<a name="90511-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09051114000057"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clarke of Hampstead, has just raised, as I understood it, the existence of Colleague Share. The existence of that need not present an insuperable obstacle. Given its popularity, I cannot imagine that members would pass up the chance to upgrade their phantom shares into real ones; that is what I mean.</p>

<a name="90511-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09051114000058"></a>Having said all that, the amendment does not go as far as we would like, although it is a welcome reassurance for Royal Mail employees to realise that the Government have not totally closed off all chances for them to buy into the future of their company. Sadly, it does not promise that the Government will actively support such a scheme. That is a pity, and I hope that the private partner will be much more enthusiastic about pursuing such a worthwhile route.</p>

As I said in Committee, Royal Mail&#146;s workers are the backbone of the company, so where those employees contribute to business success, they should rightly share in the benefits it delivers. There was broad agreement across the House on this point, suggesting that employees should receive a stake in Royal Mail as part of the partnership proposals that we are currently considering.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_857"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 857</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90511-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09051114000060"></a>As the Secretary of State has explained, the Government believe that it is vital that the workforce has a serious stake in Royal Mail&#146;s success, and that is why we have the existing Colleague Share scheme. That runs from 2007 to 2012 and includes for each worker up to &#163;1,600 in profit-related bonuses payable over the life of the plan&#151;half of which has already been paid&#151;plus up to &#163;3,700 for the &#147;capital&#148; value of the shares payable in 2011 and 2012. This could give each employee up to &#163;5,300 in total. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, pointed out that this could be swapped from phantom shares into real shares but, because this would not be a listed company, the net effect of its transferability would be exactly the same, so we do not believe that it would make any significant difference.</p>

<a name="90511-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09051114000061"></a>We will not at any point entertain changes to the existing incentive arrangements that would be to the detriment of the workers. The company has commitments which it will have to keep. But we do wish to discuss the future of the existing incentive arrangements and any alternatives with any partner before reaching a view on what best incentivises performance and delivers value for money going forwards in the modernisation plan. This might be continuation with the current scheme, or the introduction of new arrangements that offer better returns to workers, company and shareholders alike, whether through an employee share scheme or otherwise. Whichever route is chosen, the goal has to be a strong workforce with a stake in the company&#146;s success.</p>

<a name="90511-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09051114000062"></a>The Government therefore believe that it is very important that this legislation allows for an employee share scheme to be introduced. There was some confusion in Committee about whether this was the case. The new clause introduced by Amendment 22 makes it clear that the establishment of an employee share scheme for Royal Mail employees is permissible under the provisions of the Bill. However, it also importantly ensures that any scheme must not breach the requirements in Part 1 of the Bill that the Crown must own, directly or indirectly, more than half of the company. Amendment 18 would make it possible under legislation for the Government to control less than half of the shares in Royal Mail. This is not something that can be dealt with by amending this legislation, as the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, suggested. The classification of the company, whether it is public or private, is determined independently and not by legislation. Amendment 18 would therefore stop the company from being publicly owned, which is not something that the Government are willing to countenance.</p>

<a name="90511-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09051114000063"></a>Given that the existing Colleague Share scheme is only part-way through and that our discussions with potential partners are ongoing, now is not the time to debate or commit to the precise nature of future incentive arrangements. That is why the Government&#146;s amendment is permissive without being prescriptive. I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

The model that we are trying to persuade noble Lords to adopt is what I would describe as the John Lewis model. I now realise that I thought that it was an issue of semantics between us, the Conservative Party and the Government. It is not; it is an issue of principle. We are not talking about an employee share scheme. An employee share scheme is where individual members of staff are given incentives to participate in the ownership of the business. We are actually talking about a very radically different approach, which is a John Lewis-type employee ownership trust.</p>

We are not talking about an employee share scheme, where of course they will have an interest, as any minority shareholder coming into an organisation is concerned, as to what proportion of the profits of the business are being allocated to an employee share scheme. Of course they have an interest in that; but that is not what we are talking about. We are talking about the principle of a shared ownership trust. This is fundamental to the arguments that we on our Benches have made long before this Bill was introduced. I suspect that I do not have support from the other parties, but I feel that it is important on this issue of principle to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<a name="09051132000001"></a><b><a name="90511-0008.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09051132000190"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My Lords, the Government are proposing this amendment in response to an amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Clarke of Hampstead during discussions of the Bill in Committee. It clarifies on the face of the Bill the proposed treatment of benefits built up within the Royal Mail pension plan through additional voluntary contributions or AVCs.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09051132000002"></a>As I explained during that earlier debate, members of the scheme can at present make additional contributions in order to increase their provision for retirement. They can do this either through contributions for the purchase of &#147;added years&#148; of reckonable service, which are invested with the Royal Mail pension plan&#146;s main assets, or by investing in a range of pooled investment vehicles as part of a &#147;money purchase&#148; arrangement, separately from the main assets of the scheme.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09051132000003"></a>The amendment reflects the Government&#146;s policy intention as I set out in responding to my noble friend&#146;s earlier amendment. Where AVCs have been paid prior to the qualifying time for the purchase of added years, it is right that the additional service already bought before the qualifying time should transfer to government with the other qualifying accrued rights. That is because the purchase of &#147;added years&#148; relates closely to the defined benefit provisions in the main scheme, and carries many of the same risks in terms of longevity and investment returns.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09051132000004"></a>In contrast, the investments related to money purchase benefits do not have these same characteristics. The assets falling into this category&#151;which totalled &#163;84 million in respect of additional voluntary contributions as at March 2008&#151;are held separately from the main assets of the scheme. The intention, reflected in the amendment, is that they should not be included within the scope of the qualifying accrued rights to be transferred to the new public service scheme, and should therefore remain with the Royal Mail pension plan, as is the case at present.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09051132000005"></a>In addition to money purchase AVC-type arrangements within the RMPP, there is a small number of other categories of money purchase benefit that may apply to a limited number of members. These include transfers in from other schemes, where these include benefits provided on a money purchase basis, and special employer contributions for certain members of the scheme. In these cases, the Government consider that such money purchase benefits should be treated consistently, according to the principles I have set out in relation to AVCs. This is why the amendment refers to money purchase benefits in general.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09051132000006"></a>For members entitled to money purchase benefits, this amendment means that the responsibility for paying those benefits will continue to rest with the administrators of the Royal Mail Pension Plan, as at present. Given that the Government are already planning for the close co-ordination of the administration of the new public service scheme with that of the Royal Mail Pension Plan, we are satisfied that the effect of the

I stress that members&#146; total benefits, comprising both payments in relation to their core defined benefit entitlements, and money purchase benefits, will not be adversely affected by this amendment, and will continue to be covered by the protection set out in Clause 19.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09051132000007"></a>I hope that this explanation is helpful in setting out the purpose of the amendment. I would like to thank my noble friend Lord Clarke for raising the issue originally. I beg to move.</p>

Amendment 33 deals with senior executive staff. Royal Mail sponsors three occupational pension schemes other than the RMPP. First, there is the Royal Mail Retirement Savings Plan, which is the full name of the defined contributions scheme that was created when RMPP was closed to new employees in April 2008. As a defined contribution scheme, it can never have a deficit. We may have strong views about the decision to close RMPP and to set up a defined contributions scheme for new employees, but there is no need for it to become involved in any restructuring of the Royal Mail.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09051132000009"></a>Secondly, there is the Royal Mail Senior Executive Pension Plan. This is a defined benefits scheme. The regulatory impact assessment said that there are no plans to change it, but no explanation is given. My noble friend, Lord McKenzie, said the same thing on 20 April, col. 1281 of <I>Hansard</I>, but did not explain why. The valuation of the senior executive scheme, as at 31 March 2006, showed that it had a deficit of &#163;43 million. It costs &#163;5 million each year to pay off the deficit. The cost of providing the scale of benefits in the senior executive scheme for future service, ignoring any question of the deficit, is 48.2 per cent of pensionable pay.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09051132000010"></a>I ask the Minister, why is it being treated differently from the RMPP? Its deficit is also a millstone around the neck of Royal Mail, and it ought to be dealt with in the same way. My amendment would mean that if a new public sector scheme is created under Clause 16, the qualifying accrued rights of the senior executive scheme will be transferred to it, just like the RMPP. If there is to be no new public sector scheme, and instead the qualifying accrued rights of the RMPP are transferred to a new government-sponsored section of the RMPP  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_863"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 863</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>under Clause 17, the past service deficit of the senior executive scheme will be transferred into the new government section, just like the deficit in the RMPP.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09051132000011"></a>Administrative savings could be made if the schemes were amalgamated so that the assets and liabilities of the senior executive scheme were transferred into the RMPP. There would be one fewer firm of actuaries, one fewer firm of solicitors and accountants, all of which cost money, and it would be much more sensible to be under one scheme. More importantly, it would also be seen as fairer to the ordinary members of the RMPP if the senior executives were earning their pensions on the same scale as the ordinary members. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="09051132000012"></a><b><a name="90511-0008.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09051132000193"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, in response to the points raised by my noble friend Lord Clarke, the Government cannot accept the amendment proposed by him. I hope that my comments will set out clearly the reasons for this. I understand that, in part, my noble friend is probing the position. I revisit the rationale for the measures set out in Part 2. They provide the Government with powers that, subject to conclusion of a partnership agreement for Royal Mail and to state-aid clearance from the European Commission, we intend to use to take responsibility for the historic pension liabilities within the Royal Mail Pension Plan that relate to benefits accrued by members of the plan prior to 16 December 2008.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09051132000013"></a>The Government&#146;s view is that such action, taken as part of a package of measures including partnership and a new regulatory regime, is essential in ensuring that Royal Mail can modernise its operations and respond successfully to the challenges of a rapidly changing market. It must also be balanced against the interests of taxpayers, for whom the implications are significant, and of members of the scheme who may be affected.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09051132000014"></a>In relation to the Royal Mail Senior Executive Pension Plan, the Government are clear that there is no convincing value-for-money case for equivalent action to that proposed for the RMPP. As Richard Hooper&#146;s report set out, it is the size of the RMPP&#146;s liabilities relative to the size of Royal Mail&#146;s business that is at the core of the issue in relation to pensions faced by the company and the postal market more generally. Given that the total liabilities of the Senior Executive Pension Plan are around 1 per cent of the liabilities of the RMPP, the same arguments cannot be applied to the Senior Executive Plan.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09051132000015"></a>Accordingly, in policy and value-for-money terms, the Government&#146;s view is that there is no equivalent argument for intervention in relation to the Senior Executive Pension Plan. This fact is based not on the relative pay, status, or role of members of the plan. It is based on the relative size of the plan compared to the RMPP, and the risks this presents to the Government&#146;s proposals in relation to the modernisation of Royal Mail through a strategic partnership.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09051132000016"></a>In relation to the interests of members, it has been suggested that members of the Royal Mail Senior Executive Pension Plan will somehow be worse off as a result of the proposals set out in the Bill. I do not accept that proposition. There is nothing in the  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_864"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 864</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government&#146;s proposals that will adversely affect members of the plan. For both the RMPP and the Senior Executive Pension Plan, the Government are not proposing any changes, whether enhancements or reductions, to the individual pension entitlements of members of either scheme, for either past or future service.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09051132000017"></a>The Senior Executive Pension Plan has, since April 2008, been closed to new members, with future benefits being accrued on the basis of career average-related earnings, rather than final salary. These changes are in line with those made to the RMPP. Importantly, this will reduce the future cost to Royal Mail as the sponsoring employer. Further, Royal Mail will, by virtue of the Government&#146;s proposals on pensions and in relation to the measures set out in the other parts of the Bill, be in a much better position to meet its obligations to both schemes. In the unlikely event of Royal Mail&#146;s insolvency, members of the Senior Executive Pension Plan would be entitled to protection from the Pension Protection Fund, as is the case now.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09051132000018"></a>Both of these facts are relevant in reassuring members about the Government&#146;s broader proposals. I hope, on that basis, that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment. The amendment, should it be accepted, and we are not able to do so, does not say anything about assets transferring, only liabilities. Of course, if the Clause 17 route were adopted, it would not provide for the sectionalisation of the scheme to take account of the Clause 17 provisions. I hope that also for those added reasons, my noble friend will not press his amendment.</p>

I noted again this argument about the Government&#146;s view that Royal Mail can modernise its operations. What on earth has that got to do with fairness within a pension scheme? We still have not had any real details of the modernisation but that is another subject. When discussions between not just the union of the pension scheme members but the trustees take place on the structure of their pension scheme, it is difficult to argue that they can have two schemes: one that appears to favour senior management and one that is good enough for the rank and file workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09051132000020"></a>I understand what my noble friend has said. Obviously, I will take that away. I do not know whether there will be an opportunity in the future but, on the basis of fairness, the Government should be looking at a scheme that treats all of the employees, from the chairman of the board down to the newest member of the pension scheme, the same. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09051132000022"></a>Amendments 34 and 35 are about strengthening the protection for members in the new public scheme. In previous debates, my noble friend Lord McKenzie has said that there is no reason in principle why the new scheme cannot operate on a pay-as-you-go basis, just like some of the major public sector schemes such as those of the Civil Service and the National Health Service. The Minister said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a><a name="09051132000150"></a>&#147;The interests of members are reflected through statutory protection for benefits, and through other stakeholder consultation arrangements as part of the broader governance of the scheme&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051132000121"></a>He also said that the governance of the new scheme would follow the model used in other public schemes. He stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a><a name="09051132000151"></a>&#147;Given the nature of the liabilities that will be transferred to the new scheme, and the protection for members provided through the Bill and in the related secondary legislation, the Government regard the established model for governance of public service schemes as the most appropriate model to be applied&#148;. &#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/4/09; col. 1284.]</p>

<p><a name="09051132000122"></a>However, members of the other public sector schemes, such as the Civil Service and NHS schemes, have some of the rights and protections of members of private sector trust-based schemes. For instance, they have the automatic right to the disclosure of information. That is because they fall within the statutory definition of a &#147;public service pension scheme&#148;. Some generally applicable legislation applies to public service pension schemes, such as the disclosure of information regulations, and some does not, such as Section 67 of the Pensions Act 1995, which was much discussed in Committee and will not apply to the new scheme any more than it applies to, for instance, the Civil Service or NHS schemes.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09051132000023"></a>The new statutory scheme is neither fish nor fowl. It will clearly not be a trust-based scheme but it does not fall within the definition of a public service pension scheme like the NHS or Civil Service schemes because it has not been set up by an employer. The purpose of Amendment 34 is to bring the new scheme within the statutory definition in Section 1 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993. That would mean that, just as my noble friend Lord McKenzie indicated, it would be subject to the same protections and rights as other public schemes.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09051132000024"></a>Secondly, although my noble friend Lord McKenzie said that the new scheme would follow the established model for the governance of public service schemes, there is, in fact, no such single model. Each scheme has a slightly different arrangement. For local government and NHS schemes, for instance, there is a statutory obligation to consult trade unions and employers before any amendments are made, but the power to amend is in the hands of the relevant Secretary of State. That protection is contained within primary legislation: the

For the Armed Forces pension scheme, by contrast, there is no statutory obligation to consult in the primary legislation although, in practice, there is a consultative committee.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09051132000025"></a>We said on numerous occasions in Committee that we want to see a protection of the accrued rights transferred to the new scheme. I am danger of trespassing upon the next amendment so, for the moment, I simply beg to move.</p>

My noble friend and I are not far apart in what he seeks to achieve through the amendment, but the Government believe that it is unnecessary.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09051132000027"></a>In the relevant legislation, &#147;public service pension schemes&#148; fall within the broader category of &#147;occupational pension schemes&#148;. As a group, they benefit from certain exemptions from requirements in pensions legislation&#151;my noble friend referred to this&#151;that apply to occupational pension schemes in general, where those requirements relate to trust-based schemes operating on a funded basis. The relevant schemes are not, in general, designated as public service pension schemes in the legislation under which they are established. Rather, they qualify as public service pension schemes by virtue of the fact that they meet the requirements set out in the Pension Schemes Act 1993. The new scheme that the Government propose to establish under Clause 16 will share many of the features common to other public service pension schemes&#151;indeed it, too, will satisfy the key requirements of the definition of public service schemes as set out in the 1993 Act. That is the sense in which I previously described it as a &#147;public service pension scheme&#148;. Having established these key definitional points, I will explain why the Government consider that the amendment would not in practice deliver any beneficial effect over and above the Government&#146;s existing proposals.</p>

<a name="90511-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09051132000028"></a>Clause 16(4) has the effect that the scheme will be capable of being treated as an occupational pension scheme for the purposes of the relevant legislation. These purposes will be set out in secondary legislation, following consultation with the RMPP trustees. As I have just mentioned, it is this treatment as an occupational pension scheme that is the key in terms of the application to the scheme of wider requirements set out in pensions legislation. Designation as a public service pension scheme, as in the amendment, does not have the same effect. In the application of the exemptions I have described earlier, the effect of Clause 16(4) is that, once the new scheme is treated as an occupational pension scheme, it will benefit from the relevant exemptions that apply to similar public service pension schemes. The route to what my noble friend wishes to achieve is therefore through the operation of Clause 16(4). The amendment does not add substantively to the existing provisions in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09051132000029"></a>I should add that, in accordance with the requirements set out under Clause 24, the Government will consult with the trustees of the RMPP on the details of the order made establishing the new public service scheme, which is expected to specify which of the requirements that would normally apply to an occupational pension

The mechanism proposed by the Government explicitly allows for this consultation with the trustees, rather than imposing the specific requirements in the primary legislation.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09051132000030"></a>I hope that there is a broad degree of consensus among Members of this House on the outcomes we seek. I hope that my noble friend is satisfied that I have been able to demonstrate why the Government&#146;s approach already achieves that goal, perhaps in a way that is better suited to the circumstances of the scheme, and accordingly that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09051132000031"></a>It may help if I say to my noble friend in relation to the general requirements under pensions legislation that apply to the new scheme as an occupational scheme, which of those we believe should apply. Obviously, this would have to flow from discussions with the trustees, but it is likely, for example, that it will include the provisions that apply to other public service pension schemes relating to matters such as disclosure of information to scheme members, dispute resolution and assignment of pensions. I hope that has given my noble friend a flavour of what is intended.</p>

I shall look at what has been said. I am sure that the trustees of both the existing scheme and the new scheme will be heartened to know that the occupational pension scheme general terms of consultation will apply.

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09051132000035"></a>Given that the new scheme will hold only past service rights, the protection that members have from adverse changes ought to be protection requiring the active consent of their representatives, as in the Civil Service, rather than an obligation to consult. That is why we have suggested the Civil Service model. There should be an obligation to consult the trades unions before any amendments are made. That is the starting point in all private sector schemes, as well as in the public sector. The obligation is contained in primary legislation for other schemes and ought to be contained in this Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09051132000036"></a>In Committee, I mentioned several times the role of trustees and the tripartite arrangements between the employer, the unions and the trustees.

This amendment should attract the support of the Government. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09051132000037"></a><b><a name="90511-0009.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09051132000201"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, in responding to this amendment, I should like once again to address some of the concerns that have been raised in relation to consultation with members and protection for members&#146; accrued rights. I recognise that these are very important issues.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09051132000038"></a>In terms of protection for members&#146; accrued rights within the new public service scheme, noble Lords may recall the discussion in Committee of the relevant provisions in Clause 19(6). These provide that the new scheme can be amended only in a way that would or might adversely affect accrued rights if prescribed steps are taken to obtain the consent of members or, alternatively, if the scheme is amended &#147;in the prescribed way&#148;.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09051132000039"></a>It is correct to say that the detail of Clause 19(6) does differ from some other public service pension schemes. However, I mentioned previously Section 3(1) of the Armed Forces (Pensions and Compensation) Act 2004 which adopted a similar approach to that proposed in this Bill. Given the requirement in Clause 19(6) for member consent in certain circumstances, it seems to me that the benefit of the amendment proposed is quite difficult to discern. Indeed, in effectively over-ruling the ability under Clause 19(6)(b) to make prescribed amendments without consent, subsection (9) of the amendment could adversely affect the ability to make changes in future that other trustees and employers can make in relation to other occupational pension schemes, such as the RMPP.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09051132000040"></a>In the past, these changes have included expanding the class of person who may receive death benefits to include same-sex partners and changes to ensure compliance with tax legislation. We cannot rule out the possibility that there could be an unforeseen need for comparable amendments to the new scheme in future.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09051132000041"></a>Moreover, there is a general point of principle that underpins the Government&#146;s intended approach. The measures set out in Clause 19(6) are intended to operate in a similar way to the protection that members  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_869"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 869</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the RMPP currently have under Section 67 of the Pensions Act 1995. Consistent with the Government&#146;s overall approach to the establishment of the new scheme, the Government believe that for this Bill it is appropriate for these provisions to reflect as closely as possible the protection for members that currently applies under the RMPP, rather than introduce a slightly different model as would be the case if this amendment were adopted.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09051132000042"></a>In relation to the proposed new subsection (8), I recognise the strength of feeling on the issue of consultation and communication with members that was expressed in this House during our earlier debates. I previously set out the importance that the Government attach to consultation in relation to the key order-making powers under Part 2 of the Bill, including orders made establishing a new scheme under Clause 16. This is reflected in the specific requirement to consult the RMPP trustees set out under Clause 24 and, more broadly, in our practical programme of engagement with trustees, with Royal Mail and with representatives of both current employees and RMPP pensioners that is already well-established. That engagement is now focused on planning the programme of work that will be required to implement the measures set out in Part 2 of the Bill and on ensuring that members of the RMPP are kept informed of key developments as appropriate and that any concerns or questions raised can be addressed.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09051132000043"></a>Turning to subsection (8) of the proposed amendment, I would point out that the trustee body currently includes five member-nominated representatives, including one pensioner nominated trustee. To introduce a separate requirement for formal consultation with representatives of affected members would, in terms of the provisions set out in the Bill, duplicate the role of the trustees in discussing proposals for establishing the new scheme, while adding little in a practical sense to the process of engagement that is already underway.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09051132000044"></a>In relation to consultation on changes to the new public service scheme going forward, I should also explain that once established, unlike many other public service schemes, the new scheme will contain only past accrued rights and that those rights already have a strong degree of legal protection. This means that the scope of any changes will in future be limited, not least because questions regarding future benefit accruals will not arise. Nevertheless, I can confirm that the Government intend to explore appropriate consultative arrangements, analogous to those that already exist in other public service schemes, to provide a forum in which issues in relation to ongoing administration of the new scheme that are raised by members and their representatives can be resolved, and to ensure that communications with members concerning changes are effectively communicated. The scope of these consultative arrangements has yet to be determined but experience with other schemes suggests that they are flexible and effective in addressing a wide range of issues that may be of concern.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09051132000045"></a>I do hope that on the basis of these assurances, which are as strong as I can possibly give, and on the evidence of the consultative activity that is already

The Secretary of State does not have supreme power in relation to the benefits. Order-making powers have to follow consultation with the trustees in relation to splitting the scheme. We will be coming on to a later amendment that deals with this matter. There are provisions regarding the Secretary of State if a section of the RMPP is used for the new public service scheme; otherwise, he does not have any role in the ongoing running of the RMPP. That would be a matter for the company and the trustees. In relation to the new scheme, the Secretary of State&#146;s powers are significantly constrained by the protections in Clause 19(6), and I press my noble friend to bear in mind that very important point. I know that he and his colleagues are concerned about this but I believe that there are substantial protections in this legislation.</p>

<a name="09051132000051"></a><b><a name="90511-0009.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09051132000206"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I shall speak also to the other government amendments in this group.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09051132000052"></a>The Government are proposing these amendments in response to questions raised in Committee regarding the scope of the powers provided at Clause 17. In explaining the purpose and effect of Amendment 36, perhaps I may start by recapping the Government&#146;s policy intention behind the powers in this clause.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09051132000053"></a>Clause 17, particularly subsection (1), allows the Secretary of State, by order, to divide the existing Royal Mail pension plan into different sections. It allows for different participating employers to be in the different sections, and for assets and liabilities in the RMPP to be divided between the different sections. This power is required because the Government intend that the strategic partnership will not include Post Office Ltd, which will remain 100 per cent in public ownership. As a result of the associated restructuring of Royal Mail Group, the Royal Mail pension plan will need to be divided so that there is a section for Post Office employees and another for Royal Mail Group employees. These sections will contain rights built up after the cut-off date for the transfer of liabilities to the Government. Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail Group will each be responsible for its own section.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09051132000054"></a>In addition, however, Clause 17 provides the Government with a power to create further sections separate from the sections containing the ongoing pension liabilities of Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail Group. This power could, in the context of a partnership agreement for Royal Mail, be used to create a section that contained qualifying accrued rights, defined in Clause 15. A section created for this purpose would operate on a similar basis to the public service scheme created under Clause 16 and would not hold any assets. Benefits would be funded directly by the Government as they fell due, as provided for in subsection (2).</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09051132000055"></a>As explained in Committee, the existence of this power is purely a contingency measure should, for whatever reason, the Government&#146;s preferred option&#151;that is, the transfer of the qualifying accrued rights to a new public service scheme under Clause 16&#151;prove impossible. Creating a new section for qualifying accrued rights would be quicker than creating a separate scheme under Clause 16, and there might be circumstances where this additional flexibility was advantageous. In the debate in Committee, I sought to explain that the powers in subsections (2) to (5) of Clause 17 were intended to relate only to the establishment of the new subsection for qualifying accrued rights.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09051132000056"></a>The amendment that the Government now propose concerns the use of the powers contained in Clause 17 in the scenario that I have just described. The proposed new Section (1A) makes it clear that the creation of a section to contain the qualifying accrued rights&#151;a,</p>
<ul><a name="09051132000176"></a>&#147;qualifying section of the RMPP&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09051132000123"></a>is limited to circumstances in which there has been no prior order to create a new scheme under Clause 16.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09051132000057"></a>The amendment also addresses the concern expressed in our earlier debate that, putting aside the Government&#146;s policy intention, the detailed provisions in Clause 17 could in principle provide the Secretary of State with powers to intervene in matters that were legitimately the concern of the trustees, including the new sections of the Royal Mail pension plan relating to Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail Group employees. By making it clear that the relevant powers can be exercised only,</p>
<ul><a name="09051132000177"></a>&#147;in respect of a qualifying section of the RMPP&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09051132000124"></a>the amendment specifically excludes that possibility.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09051132000058"></a>I hope that that explanation is helpful in setting out the purpose of the amendment, and I commend it to the House. I beg to move.</p>

I believe that Amendments 44 to 46 and 48 are also in this group. They all deal with the possibility of using the RMPP as a vehicle for guaranteeing the qualifying accrued rights, which the Secretary of State has said will be guaranteed by the state. They revolve around Clause 17, which will allow the Secretary of State to sectionalise the RMPP, to create a section that will provide for qualifying accrued rights, to amend the RMPP to fit the arrangements that he wants to make after consulting the RMPP trustees but without getting their consent, and to veto any amendment or exercise of discretion in the RMPP.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_873"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 873</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90511-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09051132000061"></a>The Secretary of State has made it plain that the Clause 17 mechanism, if it can be called that, is very much a back-up to be used only if a new public scheme is not set up using the alternative Clause 16 mechanism. However, nowhere is there an explanation of why a back-up power is needed at all. The regulatory impact assessment makes a compelling case for operating the scheme, whatever form it is to take, on an unfunded basis. First and foremost, the reason given is the volatility inherent in a funded model, and the point is made in paragraph 20 of the regulatory impact assessment that a 1 per cent fall in investment returns could double the scale of the deficit.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09051132000062"></a>Models suggested as alternatives in the regulatory impact assessment are as follows. Model A is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a><a name="09051132000164"></a>&#147;One off payment from Government to the scheme to make good any deficit; but no further changes to the distribution of assets and liabilities in the scheme&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051132000125"></a>In model B:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a><a name="09051132000165"></a>&#147;Relevant liabilities and assets are transferred to a separate scheme (or a separate section of the existing scheme), with Government issuing a guarantee in respect of those liabilities, and assuming the role of the sponsoring employer&#151;including making payments to the scheme to make good any deficit.</p>

<p><a name="09051132000126"></a>In model C:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a><a name="09051132000166"></a>&#147;Relevant liabilities are transferred to Government and met through the establishment of a new, pay-as-you-go public sector scheme. Assets transferred to government are in due course sold over a number of years&#148;</p>

<p><a name="09051132000127"></a>That comes from the pensions appendix to paragraph 20 of the RIS.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09051132000063"></a>We are dealing with models B and C; model A has been discounted. Model C supposes an unfunded pay-as-you-go scheme outside the RMPP&#151;that is the Clause 16 mechanism. Model B supposes a funded new scheme or section of the RMPP. There is no model D&#151;an unfunded section of the RMPP. However, that is just what Clause 17 is.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09051132000064"></a>The regulatory impact assessment continues with an interesting explanation of &#147;moral hazard&#148;, which it defines as the risk that occurs where perverse incentives exist so that one party is incentivised to act in a way which other parties would consider to be inappropriate. It explores the moral hazard that would exist if a trustee of the RMPP were to invest in assets supplied by the Secretary of State. Here we have a different sort of moral hazard&#151;the risk that the trustee would be forced to act in a certain manner because the Secretary of State was sponsoring an unfunded section. The point is that the RMPP and the RMPP trustee should be allowed to go forward without any interference from the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="90511-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09051132000065"></a>Clearly, some amendments to the RMPP will be needed if liabilities are transferred to a new public scheme. Members&#146; entitlements to their saved benefits should be removed from the RMPP if they are being assumed by the new public scheme; otherwise, members of the scheme would have a double entitlement. However, that should be the extent of any amendment that the Secretary of State has any interest in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09051132000066"></a>If the Royal Mail is broken up into a number of different companies&#151;which we sincerely hope will not happen&#151;a sectionalised scheme would possibly be necessary. However, the power to amend the RMPP is  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_874"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 874</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>already in the rules of the RMPP. It can be exercised by the trustee and the Royal Mail. There is no need for the Secretary of State to be able to force his way through after &#147;consulting&#148; the trustee under Clause 24, but failing to obtain their consent.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09051132000067"></a>Amendment 43 says simply that the Clause 17 mechanism should not exist. It is not referred to in the regulatory impact assessment, and the need for a back-up mechanism has not been explained at any stage. Unless and until it is, Clause 17 should simply be removed from the Bill.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09051132000068"></a>Amendment 44 deals with the power to amend the RMPP. As I have said, we accept that an amendment power is necessary to remove entitlements from the RMPP that are being transferred to the new public scheme; otherwise there would be double entitlements. However, if Clause 18 is going to enable the cancelling of entitlements under the RMPP, the trustee has a moral&#151;if not legal&#151;obligation to ensure that what is being removed goes no further than what is required. Trustees will also have views about how the scheme should go forward. They will have to manage it in a way that is administratively workable after the qualifying accrued rights have been removed. The amendment would insert a requirement for trustee consent.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09051132000069"></a>Amendment 46 is consequential: it deletes the reference to Clause 17. Amendment 51 is also consequential. Reference to a new public sector scheme is unnecessary. If the representatives of members have to be consulted and agree to any adverse changes, then if any amendment is made to the RMPP that adversely affects rights under the RMPP, the trustees of the scheme will have to obey the law and obtain individual consents. The RMPP is subject to Section 67 of the Pensions Act 1995, even if the new public scheme, like every other public service scheme, is not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09051132000070"></a>Subsection (6) is still required, however, in case, by a side wind, an amendment to the RMPP has a detrimental effect on qualifying accrued rights that are to be provided under the new public scheme and the RMPP. I beg to move.</p>

However, I will attempt to respond. I think that we are dealing with Amendments 43, 44, 45, 46 and 48.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09051132000072"></a>As we have just discussed, Clause 17 has two main functions. One is to allow the Secretary of State, by order, to sectionalise the RMPP so that it has different sections for Royal Mail Group and Post Office employees. This would ensure that pension assets and liabilities relating to Post Office Ltd are completely separate from those relating to Royal Mail Group.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09051132000073"></a>The second function of Clause 17 is to provide for the possibility of a government-sponsored section containing qualifying accrued rights. This, as I have mentioned, is purely a contingency measure should it not be possible to set up and transfer qualifying accrued rights into a new public service scheme.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09051132000074"></a>The amendments that the Government tabled earlier on Clause 17 aim to clarify that we have no intention of playing an ongoing role in the RMPP, except in respect of the fall-back case of a government-sponsored  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_875"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 875</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>section containing qualifying accrued rights. Future matters relating purely to Royal Mail Group and Post Office Ltd sections are a matter solely for the trustees and the company.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09051132000075"></a>Amendment 43 would remove Clause 17. If this is in response to concerns that the intended use of powers in Clause 17 was unclear, I hope that my noble friend has found the earlier government amendments helpful in clarifying our intentions. If Clause 17 were removed altogether, the Government would have no power to sponsor a section containing qualifying accrued rights. They would not be able to make payments to the trustees to pay benefits as they fall due. Nor could they make payments to cover any discretionary payments. Although the option of a government-sponsored section containing qualifying accrued rights is only a contingency measure, it is a necessary precaution should it not be possible to transfer qualifying accrued rights into a new public service scheme. Thus we are unable to accept Amendment 43&#151;or Amendment 48, which appears to be consequential.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09051132000076"></a>The removal of Clause 17 does not necessarily exclude the possibility of sectionalising the RMPP into different Royal Mail Group and Post Office Ltd sections. This might still be achieved through the power to make amendments to the RMPP under Clause 18; but crucially, Amendment 44 would require the agreement of the trustees.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09051132000077"></a>Amendment 44 goes wider than just requiring the trustees&#146; formal agreement to sectionalisation. It would require trustee agreement to any amendments to the RMPP in connection with Clauses 16 or 17. This is not necessary for two reasons. First, scheme members are already protected by the protections set out in Clause 19. These protections are an integral part of the Government&#146;s proposals, and there is no possibility of an order being made under Clause 18 that would have a material adverse effect on relevant pensions provisions contained in the RMPP.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09051132000078"></a>Secondly, Clause 24 already requires the Government to consult the trustees; the Government are working closely with them to ensure that the pension changes are effected as smoothly as possible. It is therefore unclear what extra protection Amendment 44 would provide. Nor do the Government think it appropriate to place a responsibility on the trustees of the RMPP to make a decision in relation to an order proposed by the Secretary of State. As I set out in Committee, we consider that the ultimate decision on the detail of an order laid by the Government must rest with the appropriate Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09051132000079"></a>Finally, Amendments 45 and 46 would broaden the scope of the Secretary of State&#146;s power to amend the RMPP, which currently can be exercised only in connection with an order made under Clauses 16 or 17. We do not think that this is necessary or desirable.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09051132000080"></a>The Bill has strong protections for members, and requirements to consult the trustees. Given the issues that I have mentioned, I ask my noble friend to withdraw his amendment.</p>

As we have said before in these debates, the power to amend the RMPP needs to go no further than dissecting out the rights that will be transferred to the new public scheme. At the end of the exercise members should have the same rights as they had immediately before the order under Section 16 was made.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09051132000083"></a>I have some concerns about the nature of some rights or expectations under the pension scheme. They relate to the entitlement of members in certain events which cannot be anticipated. If a member currently has to retire early because of his or her health or if he or she is made to leave because of redundancy, the RMPP provides a pension. That is very common in pension schemes. Until that person&#146;s health breaks down or until he or she is made redundant it might not be clear that he or she has an entitlement to ill-health or redundancy terms.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09051132000084"></a>The second part of Amendment 47 makes it plain that the division of the RMPP into qualifying accrued rights and other rights would not affect the position. It does not say that a member would have a right to a pension in any particular circumstance; it just says that the division will not change the picture.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09051132000085"></a>Amendment 49 is also consequential. If accepted, subsection (3) would read,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a><a name="09051132000170"></a>&#147;&#145;The relevant pensions provision&#146; means the provision for the payment of pensions or other benefits which is contained in the RMPP and includes the rights of members that are contingent upon the retirement of a member in the event of his retirement on the grounds of redundancy or ill-health&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051132000128"></a>Early retirement and loss of job for all sorts of reasons are pretty basic matters in pension schemes. If the Government do not feel able to accept these words, I would have thought they could come back with some

I hope the Government will look closely at this in order to give workers the assurances they require; so that when they go about their daily business, they are able to say, &#147;At least if I get knocked over or bitten badly by a dog and it stops me working&#148;&#151;it does happen&#151;&#147;there is provision within the RMPP to make sure I do not lose out&#148;. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09051132000086"></a><b><a name="90511-0010.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09051132000215"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My Lords, I can give my noble friend the assurance that he seeks and we do not need to change the wording of the Bill. This group of amendments is focused on the protections that members of the RMPP are afforded in Part 2 of the Bill. Amendment 47, proposed by my noble friend, covers the topic of member protection and how it applies to any changes made by the Secretary of State to the ongoing RMPP under Clause 18. The creation of the new public service scheme and the creation of a new section in the RMPP will both require consequential amendments to the RMPP. The power to make these changes is set out in Clause 18. This power is necessary to ensure that the overarching requirement of protecting scheme members against adverse treatment can be fully met.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09051132000087"></a>However, the power to make amendments to the RMPP is subject to a number of important restrictions. First, the Secretary of State can make an order under Clause 18 to make appropriate amendments to the RMPP only if it is in connection with an order to create a new public service scheme, to transfer rights to the new scheme under Clause 16, or to divide the RMPP into sections under Clause 17. In addition, any such order under Clause 18 to amend the RMPP is also subject to the member-protection test set out in Clause 19(2). This requires that when exercising the power in Clause 18, the Secretary of State must ensure that the &#147;relevant pensions provision&#148; in respect of each person is in all material respects at least as good immediately after the exercise of the power as it was immediately before.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09051132000088"></a>The word &#147;material&#148; is used because the RMPP is set up under trust while the new scheme will be a statutory arrangement and we expect that this may require some differences in the way in which benefits are determined or provided. However, the intention is that the value of members&#146; benefits will be no different.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09051132000089"></a>The definition of &#147;relevant pensions provision&#148; is set out in subsection (3). The definition is deliberately wide to capture the payment of both pensions and other benefits to which members are entitled. This would include a member&#146;s right to continue to accrue future benefits on the current basis and any contingent rights, including any rights to receive benefits in the event of redundancy or ill-health. I agree with my noble friend on the importance of having those facilities. The Secretary of State cannot use the power in Clause 18 to change the way in which future benefits accrue in the RMPP or to remove a member&#146;s right to receive particular benefits in the event of ill-health.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09051132000090"></a>Amendment 49 also deals with the definition in subsection (3) of the &#147;relevant pensions provision&#148;.

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09051132000091"></a>In summary, therefore, I would like to provide assurance that any amendment made by the Secretary of State to the RMPP is subject to robust restrictions designed to protect members. Any amendments need to be appropriate in connection with an order made under Clauses 16 or 17 and also need to comply with the significant member protection set out in the Bill. Therefore, I ask my noble friend to withdraw his amendment.</p>

The first was an issue discussed in Committee in relation to subsection (4). This subsection would allow the Secretary of State to override any commitment if, in his view, another domestic or European legal requirement said it was not necessary. That is the job of the courts. If the Secretary of State has any doubt in his mind whether what he is proposing is lawful, he needs to clarify his thinking before bringing the Bill before Parliament.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09051132000094"></a>The other part would delete subsection (5) because it is not necessary. If the new public scheme guarantees qualifying accrued rights and leaves RMPP rights well alone, there is no need for a provision which says that the form of any scheme should be designed or operated in a particular way.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09051132000095"></a>Amendment 51 also is consequential. The need for a reference to the new public sector scheme is unnecessary if the representatives of members have to be consulted and have to agree to any adverse changes. If any amendment is made to the RMPP which adversely affects the rights under the scheme, then the trustee of the RMPP will have to obey the ordinary law and obtain individual consents. The RMPP is subject to Section 67 of the Pensions Act 1995 even if the new public scheme, like every other public service scheme, is not. Subsection (6) is still required just in case, by a side wind, an amendment to the RMPP has a detrimental effect on the qualifying accrued rights&#151;the words I used a little while ago. It is very straightforward and I hope the Minister will give some comfort on these amendments. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09051132000097"></a>Subsection (4) makes it clear that Clause 19 does not require the Secretary of State to include any provisions in the new government scheme which would be incompatible with any obligations under UK or EU law such as tax requirements or EU anti-discrimination requirements. It is clearly important that the Government act lawfully in setting up the new government scheme. As we work through the detailed drafting of the secondary legislation setting up the new scheme it is possible that some provisions may not be strictly compatible with, for example, the requirements for registration of a new scheme for tax purposes under the Finance Act 2004. We expect any such issues covered by subsection (4) to be of a technical nature rather than to have an impact on members&#146; benefits. Nevertheless, we will need to maintain sufficient flexibility to ensure that the new scheme complies with UK and EU legislation. I should say to my noble friend that it is nothing more sinister than just making sure at a technical level. It would not be until all the fine detail was worked through technically that one would know that there was proper compliance.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09051132000098"></a>The purpose of subsection (5) is to make it clear that although Clause 19 is designed to protect the accrued rights of members, it is not intended to require the new government scheme to be set-up or run in any particular way. For example, the new government scheme will be set up under legislation, not under a trust deed. Nor is it designed to constrain the future operation of the ongoing Royal Mail plan, which is a matter for the company and RMPP trustees going forward and is already governed by existing pensions legislation.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09051132000099"></a>Removing subsection (5) would constrain how the new government scheme could be set up and operated. As a result, this would limit the Government&#146;s ability to balance their objectives of protecting the universal postal service, protecting members of the pension scheme and protecting the interests of taxpayers, for example, from the investment risk in a funded scheme. Accordingly, I ask my noble friend not to press that amendment.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09051132000100"></a>Amendment 51 relates to Clause 19(6), which restricts the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to make changes to the new public service scheme. Under the proposed amendment, this restriction would be amended and this would seriously compromise the member protection measures included in Part 2. The proposed amendment applies the provision to the RMPP rather than to the new scheme. As I covered in the last group of proposed amendments, there are already a number of restrictions on the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to make changes to the RMPP. Amendments made to the RMPP other than under Part 2&#151;that is, amendments made using the scheme amendment power&#151;will continue to be subject to restrictions in the scheme rules and in pensions legislation more generally, in particular in Section 67 of the Pensions Act 1995.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09051132000101"></a>In summary, subsection (6) is a critical element of the member protection set out in Clause 19 and specifically limits the powers of the Secretary of State in relation

Given this and the constraints already in place on any changes to the RMPP, either under Part 2 of the Bill or by the sponsoring employer going forward, I would ask my noble friend to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09051132000102"></a>It might be helpful to put on the record an example of where the tax issues might impact on the considerations that we need to undertake. Under the Finance Act 2004, certain payments provided for under pension schemes became unauthorised payments and subject to tax penalties. These included, for example, the payment of more than 25 per cent of a member&#146;s pension benefit as a cash lump sum and paying a pension to a member before age 55. However, the Finance Act 2004 contained transitional relief provisions giving trustees the discretion to continue to make such payments to or in respect of members to whom those provisions apply as at 6 April 2006. The transitional relief period continues until April 2011, at which point such payments will become unauthorised payments if made to members. Therefore, by virtue of the exercise of the power under Clause 22 of the Bill, the Finance Act 2004 will apply to the new scheme.</p>

<a name="90511-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09051132000103"></a>However, as the new scheme was not in existence on 6 April 2006, the transitional relief provisions will not apply to it. If payments such as those set out above are mirrored under the new scheme, they will be unauthorised payments and disadvantageous tax consequences will apply for members. It may therefore be necessary for the new scheme benefits to differ slightly from those under the RMPP to the extent necessary to avoid being unauthorised payments and subject to a tax penalty. This is one of the specific reasons why Clause 19(4) is considered necessary. I put that on the record as a concrete example of the kind of situation it is intended to cover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09051132000106"></a>When we discussed this in Committee, my noble friend Lord McKenzie said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81"></a><a name="09051132000174"></a>&#147;The Government have stated their intention that when transferring assets and liabilities from the Royal Mail pension plan, sufficient assets will be left to cover its liabilities. In calculating those liabilities, the Government will work with the trustees to find an appropriate valuation basis that delivers value for money without putting members&#146; accrued benefits at risk. The details of the valuation will be set out in secondary legislation&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/4/09; col. 1291.]</p>

<p><a name="09051132000129"></a>The issue here concerns the word &#147;sufficient&#148;. What does it mean? Four matters need to be dealt with. First, what exactly is meant by &#147;sufficient&#148;? In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked whether the deficit would be measured on the basis of FRS 17. I had to go away and find out what on earth he was talking about, but I understand now that FRS 17&#151;which means financial reporting standard 17&#151;is used for accounting for pension scheme deficits in a company&#146;s own accounts. My noble friend Lord McKenzie said in Committee that FRS 17 was,</p>
<ul><a name="09051132000178"></a>&#147;a bit of a separate issue&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 31/3/09; col. 999.]</ul>
<p><a name="09051132000130"></a>I agree. This is an accounting convention that does not measure the cost of the scheme.</p>

<a name="90511-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09051132000107"></a>My noble friend also said that the measurement would be made on the basis of the &#147;technical provisions&#148;, leading the casual observer to think that RMPP and the new companies that will sponsor it will be left with enough money to cover the liabilities of the RMPP on the same sound and &#147;technical&#148; basis. That is what the regulatory impact assessment hints at. The RMPP will have assets of &#163;3 billion and liabilities of &#163;3 billion, and therefore it will have enough to make ends meet. That is taken from table 2 in the pensions appendix to the regulatory impact assessment.</p>

<a name="90511-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09051132000108"></a>The technical provisions basis means something very specific however: it is an assessment made by the scheme&#146;s trustee acting on the advice of its own actuary. He or she can take a more optimistic or more pessimistic view of life depending on the likelihood that the employer will still be around to meet the liabilities if the assumptions on which the evaluations have been made turn out to be wrong. The &#163;3 billion figure comes from the assumptions that were used in the 2006 evaluation, when the sole sponsor was Royal Mail Group. Noble Lords can take their own view on whether the current Royal Mail Group could ever realistically become insolvent in the sense that it goes into administration and abandons its pension scheme. However pessimistic one may be about that, the prospect of the new Royal Mail going into administration when there is no possibility of further support because Europe would forbid it&#151;I ask my noble friend to note that there is a question about what Europe would allow&#151;must be increased. The real point is not about optimism or pessimism but the futility of measuring a deficit on the basis of &#147;technical provisions&#148;, as if that were some magical benchmark. It is not. It depends on the assumptions that the actuary makes. The &#163;3 billion figure is out of date and based on a different world.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_882"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 882</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90511-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09051132000109"></a>The second issue is more technical. In any ongoing assessment of a pension scheme&#151;any assessment where there is a viable employer&#151;liabilities are assessed on the assumption that pensions will be tied to final pensionable pay. As we know, that will not be the case here. The RMPP is not just picking up liabilities for pensions earned after the date of separation; it is picking up the cost of the salary link for the past service liabilities that the Government are assuming. An ordinary technical provision basis omits that link altogether. The &#163;3 billion of liability going forward, as assumed in the regulatory impact assessment, is short of the mark. The RMPP will have a deficit from day one.</p>

<a name="90511-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09051132000110"></a>The third issue follows on from that. One benchmark is largely free from actuarial assumption, which is the measure that a private sector trustee would use in a situation just like this. If a new employer were to branch out into the unknown, taking on past liabilities of any nature on trust, it would want to know that it was being paid enough to meet the liabilities, come what may. There is a pension scheme measurement for this. It is the cost of buying liabilities on the insurance market. Actuaries call it the buyout basis; it is the risk-free option.</p>

<a name="90511-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09051132000111"></a>It is important to recognise the scale of the differences we are talking about. At the 2006 valuation, the RMPP had technical provisions to meet 86.7 per cent of its liabilities. That is a substantial deficit in anyone&#146;s book. On a buyout basis, however, the technical provisions would have met only 64.2 per cent. The deficit is more than twice as big. If anyone thinks that the RMPP will be fully funded post-privatisation because the scheme is sufficient to meet its &#147;technical provisions&#148;, they are wrong. The RMPP will still have a serious deficit and the scale of the theoretical actuarial deficit depends on the optimism or pessimism of the actuary. That is my fourth point. Who makes the assessment? My noble friend Lord McKenzie said in Committee that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051132000179"></a>&#147;the Government intend to hire an appropriately qualified actuary, but we do not believe that it is necessary to put this on the face of the Bill&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/4/09; col. 1287.]</ul>
<p><a name="09051132000131"></a>I think that it is necessary to put it on the face of the Bill. Actuaries disagree with each other if they are paid to do so. It is no good pretending. In many cases they do what they are paid for. The actuary who is paid to look after the interests of the members of the RMPP going forward is the actuary appointed by the trustee. He or she should attempt to reach an agreement with whichever actuary is appointed by the Government. If there is a disagreement involving handing over many billions of pounds of pension savings by members of the RMPP the actuary appointed by the trustee ought to be given the final word.</p>

<a name="90511-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09051132000112"></a>Amendment No. 55 addresses all these issues. It states that the division should be assessed in the same way that it would be in a commercial transaction; the trustee of the scheme that is being divided would insist that the scheme as it goes forward is left with sufficient assets that could buy out all of its liabilities if it had to in the short term; and the trustee is handing over the security of real assets in exchange for the unknown future strength of the new employer to meet its future

Any division of the assets would have to be agreed by the trustee acting on the advice of its own actuary, not an actuary appointed by the Government. Let the actuaries try to agree by all means, but if the trustee is handing over its own money it must be given the right to say how much. I beg to move.</p>

He said that the term &#147;technical provisions&#148; is not a magical benchmark, and I agree with that. I should make it clear in relation to the funding of the salary link that the liability estimate of &#163;3 billion staying with the RMPP includes the estimated value of the salary link, so it is covered in the assets staying with the RMPP.</p>

<a name="90511-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09051132000114"></a>Amendments 55, 56 and 57 relate to Clause 21, as my noble friend has just outlined. The clause is an important feature of the member protection in Part 2 of the Bill. It restricts the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to make an order to transfer assets from the RMPP under Clause 20. The restriction is that the ratio of assets to liabilities in the RMPP is no worse immediately after the transfer of assets and liabilities than it was immediately before the transfer. A specific calculation is being undertaken. The restriction applies to all sections of the RMPP, including new sections for Post Office employees and Royal Mail Group employees.</p>

<a name="90511-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09051132000115"></a>I do not believe that it was intended from what my noble friend said, but Amendment 55 requires that for the purposes of Clause 21 the liabilities are measured on a buyout basis&#151;that is, the most cautious basis for funding pension liabilities, often used to assess the cost of winding up a pension scheme. In addition the amendment requires that the RMPP scheme actuary is responsible for determining the liabilities, and as a result the assets remaining with the ongoing scheme. Amendment 56 has the same purpose but in the scenario where the Government create a section of the RMPP to hold qualifying accrued rights.</p>

<a name="90511-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09051132000116"></a>Measuring the liabilities on a buyout basis rather than using other assumptions, such as the assumptions used by the trustees at the most recent full actuarial valuation in March 2006, would have two effects on Clause 21. First, the measured value of the liabilities of the RMPP immediately before the transfer would be higher, and so the ratio of assets to liabilities would be lower. This would mean that under Clause 21 the Secretary of State could leave the RMPP with a lower ratio of assets to liabilities. Secondly, however, the measured value of the liabilities of the RMPP immediately after the transfer would also be higher on a buyout basis. As a result the assets remaining with the RMPP would need to cover a greater value of liability but, as noted, the Secretary of State could leave the RMPP with a lower ratio of assets to liabilities. Broadly these two effects would cancel each other out, and so in practice the amendment would have little effect on the operation of Clause 21.</p>

<a name="90511-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09051132000117"></a>The Government have stated their intention that when transferring assets and liabilities from the RMPP, sufficient assets will be left to cover its liabilities. The Government will appoint a suitably qualified person  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_884"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 884</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to calculate the liabilities in the scheme. However, they intend to engage with the trustees and their actuarial advisers to find an appropriate valuation basis that delivers value for money without putting members&#146; accrued benefits at risk. I think that that is the core of what my noble friend is seeking and that is what we intend to do. The details of the valuation will be set out in secondary legislation. State aid approval will be required to leave the RMPP with sufficient assets to cover its liabilities. It is not appropriate, therefore, to include a requirement to that effect in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90511-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09051132000118"></a>The thrust of my noble friend&#146;s amendment was to seek to establish that the RMPP should be fully funded at the end of the exercise on the buyout basis. The RMPP and its sponsoring employers will be in a significantly improved position by virtue of the measures in the Bill and it would be perverse to argue in this context that the trustees need full funding on a buyout basis to protect members going forward. Nor is it desirable to specify a particular funding basis for the purposes of Clause 21. In addition to the state aid issues I have just described, leaving the scheme fully funded on a buyout basis could involve a large cost to the Government and the taxpayer but provide members with little extra protection. Indeed, it could also provide an incentive for the company to wind up the scheme. The Government have no intention of doing that.</p>

<a name="90511-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09051132000119"></a>Although the Government are confident that it will be possible for state aid approval to be obtained, they cannot prejudge the Commission&#146;s detailed decision or rule out the possibility of modification to the proposals. That is why the Bill is not written in those terms. But there is protection written on the face of the Bill in the way that I have just outlined. As a result, I ask my noble friend Lord Clarke not to press the amendments.</p>

<a name="90511-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09051132000120"></a>Amendment 57 would remove subsection (3). This subsection deals with the scenario where the Government have created a section of the RMPP to hold qualifying accrued rights under Clause 17. Subsection (3) states that, for the purposes of calculating the ratio of assets to liabilities described earlier, any liabilities in a government section holding qualifying accrued rights should not be taken into account. This is because those liabilities would now be supported directly by Government and not by the remaining assets in the RMPP. Although the option of a government-sponsored section containing qualifying accrued rights is only a contingency measure, it is a necessary precaution, should it not be possible to transfer qualifying accrued rights into a new public service scheme, as we discussed earlier. Accordingly, again, I ask my noble friend to consider not pressing his amendment.</p>

I have, of course, carefully read the Minister&#146;s response to my amendments in Committee and I am grateful to him for the subsequent letter on the matter, which contained a great deal of useful information about the Government&#146;s thinking and expectations of Ofcom.</p>

<a name="90511-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09051133000007"></a>Unfortunately, I am still concerned. The Government&#146;s defence of the current drafting rests on the safeguards in the Bill that Ofcom should be proportionate, non-discriminatory, et cetera, coupled with their other requirements to seek to be deregulatory and so on. That is all well and good and I am sure that Ofcom genuinely intends to apply these conditions only when appropriate. The fact remains, however, that Ofcom and the Government are insisting that power be given now for future regulation of the services I have specified in my amendments. The very insistence that such regulation be possible is precisely what is causing me concern. In Committee, the Minister specifically referenced the possibility that services such as &#147;document exchange&#148; might be regulated in the future. Essentially, my argument boils down to the simple premise that if there is genuinely no intention dramatically to increase the scope of regulation to burden private-sector companies providing services that many question are even covered by the term &#147;post&#148;, why is every indication being given that these amendments are being resisted?</p>

<a name="90511-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09051133000008"></a>If the Government and Ofcom genuinely intend to reduce the amount of regulation out there, not by merely spreading it more widely and thinly, but instead by lighter as well as narrower regulation, I would contend that my amendments would be an easy and harmless way of providing legal certainty and immense reassurance to the many companies concerned by this part. If the Government are, as their responses would unfortunately suggest, not currently intending to regulate these sectors, but are pretty relaxed at the idea that it might happen in the future, we have a serious problem.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09051133000009"></a>Many of these services were set up specifically to provide an unregulated alternative. Their very reason for existing, and the basis of their commercial success, is that they are not the universal postal service. They are as irrelevant to the Royal Mail&#146;s continuing provision of the postal services this country needs as is the question of whether post offices continue to sell

<a name="90511-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09051133000010"></a>There has been considerable debate about how and where exemptions might be inserted and I am very open to persuasion on this matter. My Amendments 58 and 61 are focused on the clauses where the universal service and the services considered within its scope are defined. This is because I am deeply troubled by the idea that Ofcom could eventually decide that users&#146; needs justify, or even require, broad regulation. I remember, when I had responsibility, that regulation always seemed to be a wonderful option. I know that many of us have had experience of the Health and Safety Commission. The idea of being able to step in and sort out all the alleged problems is a very tempting one, but that temptation&#151;and I am talking about areas other than health and safety&#151;is exactly what has led to the most enormous mountain of red tape currently suffocating businesses right across this country. My instinct was, therefore, to cut off that possibility as early as possible and to not even allow Ofcom to entertain the idea of regulating these services. However, I know the Secretary of State and his colleague Ministers feel that the market assessment should be as broad-based as possible in order to result in the most accurate picture of the sector on which to make regulatory decisions. I can see their point, although I do not entirely agree. I would be happy with inserting these exemptions into Clause 27, where it could be made absolutely, unquestionably clear that there is no possibility of the conditions&#151;apart from consumer protection, the essential condition&#151;being imposed on these services. I just hope the Secretary of State and his Ministers have thought a little further on these points and may be announcing to the House tonight that they accept them. I beg to move.</p>

It is quite a challenge, but I am up for it. The amendments seek to limit Ofcom&#146;s powers to regulate in respect of services which do not currently require a licence. The amendments are not necessary and may in future even be damaging to securing the provision of the universal postal service. On that basis, I shall seek to persuade the noble Lord to think again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09051133000012"></a>Protecting the universal service is what this Bill is all about. We need to give Ofcom the best tools available to help it to do that now and in the future. It is vital that we do not tie Ofcom&#146;s hands. I appreciate that there is a concern that some postal operators might be regulated in future where previously they were not. I reassure noble Lords straightaway and in the strongest terms that Ofcom will not regulate everything within the potential scope of regulation&#151;there is a clear distinction there. I make it absolutely clear that Ofcom will regulate only where it is proportionate and justified. In practice, from what is already known about the courier and parcels market in particular, it is highly unlikely that Ofcom will materially increase the burden of regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09051133000013"></a>We do not expect Ofcom to regulate services not currently required to have a licence for the foreseeable future, except to the extent required by the directive. The directive requires us to ensure that operators have complaints systems and other consumer protection measures. However, operators tell us that they have these systems in place in any event because the market requires it. It is likely therefore that they will already be complying with any consumer protection measures and, as such, there will be no added burden for them.</p>

<a name="90511-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09051133000014"></a>The amendments are unnecessary also because exceptions to the regulatory regime are redundant under a system of general authorisations. Moving, as we are proposing, from a system of licensing to one of general authorisations means that it is no longer an offence to convey a letter without a licence. As such, it is not necessary to list services which are exceptions to the regime.</p>

<p><a name="09051133000036"></a>of a letter in consideration of &#163;1 or more, or of a letter weighing 350 grammes and over, the postal services directive requires that the universal postal service covers both national and cross-border services, and that the universal service extends to postal packages of up to at least 10 kilograms, which will almost certainly be priced above &#163;1. To prescribe that the conveyance of such letters is within the scope of the universal service when undertaken by the designated universal service provider but outside the scope when provided by any other operator simply lacks logic, and introduces an undesirable element of regulatory confusion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09051133000016"></a>The proposed restriction on Ofcom&#146;s powers may damage the proportionate regulation of the postal market by hindering the collection of robust evidence about the market on which to build the new regulatory regime. The postal services market is going through a period of significant change, and we cannot predict with any certainty how it will be structured in the future. Ofcom&#146;s strategic market reviews will perform a vital function in ensuring that regulation is appropriate, timely and evidence-based. It is essential that the new regime be evidence-based. As Hooper pointed out, no review of the sectors within the postal market has ever been carried out in the way now proposed. With the changes facing the industry today, it is paramount that there is the best possible evidence on which decisions on the regulatory regime should be based. For certain sectors of the postal market to be outside the remit of that review makes no sense. Ofcom and all those with an interest in the market need the strategic review to be as comprehensive as it can be. Excluding certain services, as proposed by the amendment&#151; namely, those within a document exchange, letters weighing 350 grammes or more or costing &#163;1 or more&#151;could significantly restrict the ability of Ofcom fully to understand the postal market and to regulate accordingly.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09051133000017"></a>It is true that this means that some postal operators currently outside the scope of regulation could conceivably be regulated under the new regime. We understand that for some companies this means that they have less certainty about regulation. We recognise those concerns

<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09051133000018"></a>It is important that the valid concerns of postal operators are balanced against the importance of Ofcom being able to keep the whole market under review. It would not make sense, therefore, to prejudice or anticipate the reviews that are going to be undertaken by excluding certain things from their purview at this stage. Given the changes that the market is experiencing, this is particularly important. We cannot foresee exactly how the markets will change and evolve. It would not make sense to attempt to try to do so for the purposes of this legislation. It would be quite wrong to take a decision that would prejudice Ofcom&#146;s ability to take necessary but targeted steps to secure the universal service. We just do not have that kind of scientific certainty about the market and how it is changing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09051133000019"></a>I repeat my earlier assurance that we do not expect Ofcom to extend the scope of regulation to include the services referred to in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment in the foreseeable future, except so far as required by the directive. Ofcom will regulate only where necessary for specific purposes, the most important of which is to secure the provision of the universal postal service. Ofcom already has a legal duty to reduce unnecessary burdens on the areas that it regulates and a duty to promote self-regulation. We expect and anticipate that Ofcom will fulfil that remit. Reducing unnecessary burdens and promoting self-regulation are as important a part of Ofcom&#146;s remit as any other.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09051133000020"></a>To be clear, we are not expecting the active scope of regulation to increase. We expect the new regime instead to be much better targeted. On the back of this assurance and explanation, I invite the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, to withdraw his amendment. I hope that in the light of what I have said he will be prepared to do so.</p>

He is the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. What we are presented with here is an area which is at the present time unregulated. We are therefore considering whether we should give power to a regulator to regulate this very market in the future. In seeking this extension, the Secretary of State has sought refuge in saying, first, that it is most unlikely to come about and that noble Lords and the other place should not therefore worry about it. Well, we are worried that there will be an extension, and that we will see greater regulation in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09051133000022"></a>I had thought that the Minister stood for deregulation. However, we have not heard very much about the deregulatory environment in which we now are and where we are supposed to be reducing the burden on business of regulation. Here we have some viable businesses which are not regulated which are now, as he has conceded, worried that there is a big question mark over the future. Although I must have time to carefully consider what he has said this evening and I must consult carefully with those who are most affected by this, I think they will be even more worried and that

<p><a name="qnpa_16"></a>To move to resolve that this House regrets that, in drawing up the Housing Benefit (Amendment) Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/614), alternative proposals to deal with the problem of paying Local Housing Allowance for large families put forward by the Social Security Advisory Committee were not properly considered. <I>13th Report from the Merits Committee</I></p>
</ul>

<p><a name="st_154"></a>
<a name="09051133000023"></a><b><a name="90511-0012.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09051133000059"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> My Lords, this Motion is not fatal but it does reflect the frustration that I and others such as Shelter and Citizens Advice feel that the Department for Work and Pensions has not heeded the wise advice of its advisory body, the Social Security Advisory Committee, over the question of how to manage housing benefit for large families. I remind the House that all I am expressing is regret that, in drawing up the Housing Benefit (Amendment) Regulations, alternative proposals to deal with the problem of paying local housing allowance for large families put forward by the SSAC were not properly considered.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09051133000024"></a>The regulations in question introduce a cap on local housing allowance rates at the five-bedroom rate for all new customers and to those moving house, regardless of the size of their families, with effect from last month, and for existing customers who live in properties with more than five bedrooms at the anniversary point of their claim. The one point that the Government have taken on board from the advice is to increase the transitional period from 13 weeks to 26 weeks for existing customers, and for that we are grateful.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09051133000025"></a>Why have the Government decided to take action at all? The SSAC, Shelter and others reckon that it is as a result of sensationalist media coverage of perhaps only two exceptional cases in London where homeless families were re-housed in expensive private accommodation. Citizens Advice thinks that at least part of the problem lay with the way in which local authority staff made decisions regarding the appropriate rent that should be paid for temporary accommodation. However, the Government will certainly not accept that it was only sensational headlines in the tabloid press which has driven this policy, stating in the Explanatory Memorandum that the national rent services in England, Scotland and Wales have reported difficulties in determining LHA rates for larger properties because  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_891"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 891</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there are so few of these properties in any one broad rental market area. But the Explanatory Memorandum&#151;in my perhaps jaundiced view&#151;then gives the game away by explaining that it is deemed to be very unfair for certain customers of housing benefit with large families to be able to live in large properties in the private rented sector at the taxpayer&#146;s expense when these properties would not be able to be afforded by those in even well-paid jobs.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09051133000026"></a>The equality impact assessment takes a different line, stating that one of the benefits of capping will be to help ease the transition into work by keeping rents at a more realistic and affordable level. However, that particular argument is certainly not agreed by Shelter, which says that reducing the choice of properties available to claimants through capping risks endangering the Government&#146;s wider welfare-to-work strategy as claimants are forced to live in lower-cost areas which reduce their access to centres of employment.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09051133000027"></a>While on the subject of the equality impact assessment, I should mention that it has been recognised that these changes will impact disproportionately on some ethnic minority groups and almost certainly on large Catholic families, although it should be pointed out that this particular instrument does not apply to Northern Ireland. However, if the policy were to be implemented in Northern Ireland, it would almost certainly be found to be contrary to equality legislation there. However, coming back to this instrument, does the Minister agree that the new policy does have a disproportionate and adverse affect on BME and certain religious groups, and if so, what is the objective and proportionate justification? Does he further agree that nothing in the parent Act is intended to authorise or require racial or religious discrimination, whether direct or indirect? It seems quite clear to me that the change of policy is arbitrary and discriminatory.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09051133000028"></a>So how many people are likely to be affected by the change? The Government think that less than 1 per cent of householders receiving housing benefit and living in the private rented sector are entitled to benefit for properties with more than five bedrooms. This works out at about 5,000 households or around 50,000 people, the majority of whom will be children. The Government seem to think that because only a very small number of people will be thus affected, this means that the policy is acceptable. However, in those households the impact could be considerable and very undesirable. The impacts that I am talking about concern the possibility of overcrowding, of children living below the poverty line, of disabled people not being able to live with their families, of families being forced into substandard properties or facing large shortfalls in rent. The worst-case scenario is of course that some families could eventually face homelessness, which will mean that the local authority will have to step in to re-house them.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09051133000029"></a>One of the reasons that I felt impelled to raise this whole issue is that there could be many more families who fall foul of these new housing benefit rules with the steep rise in unemployment. The report of the Social Security Advisory Committee was stark. It says   


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_892"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 892</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the regulations will have a direct impact on homelessness. Nor will they do anything to reduce child poverty. Is this really the time to introduce such measures?</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09051133000030"></a>Figures published last week show that the Government&#146;s attempt to reduce child poverty has stalled and they are not likely to meet their objective of halving by 2010 the number of youngsters living in households where the income was less than 60 per cent of the national median. It is not as though there are no alternatives to what the Government are doing. The SSAC has suggested various courses of action, as has Shelter. Shelter says that rent officers should omit exceptionally high rents from the list of six or more bedroom properties used to calculate the midpoint which would determine the LHA rate and would prevent distorted rents being used. This is the method used under the local reference rent system before LHA was rolled out in April last year. This is Shelter&#146;s preferred option and it is also the option favoured by Citizens Advice.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09051133000031"></a>Other sensible suggestions have also been put forward. Rent officers, for example, could assess rents on an individual basis; or an upper limit could be placed on the rates for six bedrooms or more in each BRMA based on regional averages; or apply this last policy in London only. Shelter also urges greater joint working between local authorities, private landlords, the DWP and the rent service so that potential solutions can be found in sustaining appropriate rent levels.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09051133000032"></a>The Social Security Advisory Committee offered two options. If the customer is able to find a property with six or more bedrooms, a reasonable market rent will be determined by an individual referral to a rent officer. This was rejected as lacking transparency, but it is unclear to the committee why that is the case. The second option was for a percentage increase to be added to the rental amount for properties with more than five bedrooms. A proposed derived rate could be used for calculating rents for larger properties, using existing LHA rates from smaller properties. That would provide visible proof of value for money and would use midrange data free from variations introduced by the luxury end of the market. That approach was suggested by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities&#151;CoSLA&#151;and is considered by the SSAC to be transparent and credible. The SSAC&#146;s final suggestion is that housing benefit could be capped at the local housing allowance rate for a five-bedroom property, with the addition of the equivalent of the LHA shared room rate for each additional member of the household, who would be entitled to occupy a room.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09051133000033"></a>The Government are obviously determined to go ahead with these regulations, despite all the warnings that they have been given. If they cannot be persuaded to change their mind, I implore them to monitor and assess the impact of the new rules on homelessness and, if necessary, to introduce changes along the lines suggested. In the mean time, I look forward to the contributions from what I was going to call the faithful few in the Chamber&#151;there seem to be a few more than usual here this evening&#151;and to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09051133000035"></a>I am very conscious of the numbers of ethnic minority communities in east London that are likely to be dramatically affected by this order. I wonder whether the Minister has legal advice about the potential for judicial review on a possible breach of our own equalities legislation. I was impressed by the idea put forward by Shelter and by the noble Baroness that there are alternative ways in which to deal with this. I take on board the Minister&#146;s intention to reduce the barriers to employment by trying to cap in some way the levels of rent, because there is no doubt that parents of large families find it extremely difficult to get back into work and to feel that there is any point in doing so. Nevertheless, it would be reassuring to feel that the Government could find other ways in which to deal with the problem without such a blunt instrument, which I should have thought could be open to challenge.</p>

<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="0905121000001"></a><b><a name="90511-0012.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0905121000234"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, and my noble friend Lady Thomas of Winchester. We owe my noble friend a tribute and acknowledgment for raising this important point on a set of regulations, which herald some significant changes. I also pay tribute to the SSAC, whose work informs our debates time after time in a very positive way.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="0905121000002"></a>I agree with my noble friend that these regulations have not been properly considered by the Government, and I think that it is safe for the House to vote on the Motion. If it occurred to my noble friend to press the Motion to Division, I would be right behind her in the Division Lobbies. Consideration was given to a consultation that was very extensive and very consensual. That is contained in the committee&#146;s report at Chapter 5. There were 25 very detailed responses, and the score was 24 against and one in favour of the Government proceeding as they have. That is an unusual score, even for the SSAC, and that is something that the House should consider very carefully.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="0905121000003"></a>Personally, I am deeply disappointed by these regulations. They are short term and superficial and may be counterproductive. I have not said much as sternly as that since the new Secretary of State, Mr Purnell, took office. This is the first set of regulations under his stewardship of the department which I flatly think are wrong. That is important to recognise.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="0905121000004"></a>The argument in the SSAC report about the motive for the policy changes is well founded. The two cases that caused so much controversy in west London some months ago are the provenance of these policy changes, and nothing else. The pathfinder pilots preceding the introduction of the local housing allowance were planned for years and ran for two years in each of the extensive periods throughout the United Kingdom and, to my knowledge&#151;although I stand to be corrected&#151;not one of those pathfinder projects pointed to this as something that needed attention. I cannot believe, if this was the significant problem that it is now argued to be by the Government, that it would not have been picked up in that rigorous process of pathfinding. The  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_894"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 894</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pathfinder in Edinburgh was the closest one to me and I spent some time monitoring it. The responses were very positive, but they did not at any stage point to capping regulations, the like of which we are seeing now.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="0905121000005"></a>If I were the Minister and was confronted by these difficult headlines&#151;although I believe nothing that I read in the newspapers any more about social security; they never get it right, if they ever get anything right&#151;I would have brought in the local authorities, the Rent Service people, even the health service and the department, and sat down and worked out exactly what long-term alternatives were available to the housing benefit local authority officers who took these decisions. My noble friend may be right; maybe they took the wrong decisions; maybe the expertise available and the level at which these decisions were taken leading to these reports were not right. If that is true, there are some very obvious lessons to learn from this. Even more fundamental than that, however, is that if we are not careful as a House we will end up with unintended consequences, which will result in family breakdown and households being split, two sets of accommodation having to be provided in some cases and overcrowding, with substandard environmental housing conditions.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="0905121000006"></a>As my noble friend Lady Thomas said, these regulations would also result in child poverty. If Lisa Harper has made anything clear in her important contribution to the child poverty debate that has been going on&#151;and positively, it must be said, until the recent past, at the hands of the Government&#151;it is that families predisposed to poverty and hardship contiguously over periods of time are large families with workless households in the ethnic communities. In all three categories, children are subjected to not just low income but hardship and poverty on a longitudinal basis. I do not believe that the department knows how many children will be affected; the figures are 3,000, but they are tentative; this is nothing more firm than survey data. I do not think that that is a safe basis on which this House should allow the department to bring in these regulations if the figures are so flimsy. I do not think that it is safe to make these changes on the basis of survey data.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="0905121000007"></a>I have three questions for the Minister. First, we know that there is to be a review of the local housing allowance regulations after a two-year period from the date of their introduction. Can we have an assurance from the Minister that these regulations will form the basis of a special chapter in that review and that a free-standing integral part of the review in two years&#146; time will be about how this has worked out, how many families it has affected and how many children within those families? After a two-year period, those figures should be nailed down and known. Secondly, we have assurances that the DWP and the Treasury are looking at work incentives as they affect these rents and the local housing allowances in future. I would want to be very careful about work incentives in relation to this client group and these regulations. I would certainly be very nervous about sanctioning people if they were the heads of households of the kinds of family groups that we are talking about here. I would like some assurance that there will be some

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="0905121000008"></a>Thirdly and finally, the SSAC itself asks, at paragraph 6.9 of its report&#151;this is on page 19 of Command Paper 7571&#151;for &#147;further work&#148; to be done on this area. That is the least that we can do and the least that I would accept if I were, like my noble friend, deciding whether to press this. The paucity of evidence and the scarcity of hard facts and stats on which this policy is based need to be further pursued. Further and better particulars need to be obtained before anybody can have confidence that this is no more than a London problem, which the Government have handled badly with a knee-jerk reaction that might, in the long run, be entirely counterproductive. This House should feel able to resist tabloid pressure from time to time. This is no rational response to the problem that the Government have identified, and this policy should be resisted.</p>

<a name="0905121000009"></a><b><a name="90511-0012.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0905121000235"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> My Lords, after the words that we have just heard from all around your Lordships&#146; House, the Minister cannot be particularly grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, for raising this issue today&#151;even though I note that these regulations are up for debate and that, if he plays his cards well, there is no likelihood of a vote. I shall not, however, go through the Social Security Advisory Committee&#146;s report blow by blow. However, like the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, I accept its comment, noted in paragraph 18, that,</p>
<ul><a name="0905121000135"></a>&#147;there is a problem with setting rates for larger properties&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0905121000099"></a>although I cannot see that that necessarily means that these regulations make the system neither transparent nor open.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="0905121000010"></a>Local housing allowance, which replaced traditional housing benefit, featured in the last Welfare Reform Bill and was supported from these Benches. However, as with so much recent government legislation, the devil was and clearly remains in the detail. The Minister will, doubtless, remember that I wrote to him on behalf of one of my correspondents a few weeks ago, although it was not on an aspect covered by these regulations, which respond to a particular problem: namely, state-aiding the residents of large families. I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, that it elicited the fact that area reviews are already taking place.</p>

<a name="90511-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="0905121000011"></a>The subject of the regulations was, as we have heard, highlighted fairly recently in the press when there were reports of an Afghan family claiming a massive &#163;12,455 per month&#151;met by housing benefit&#151;for a seven-bedroom property in Ealing. The value of the property in question was claimed by the <I>Mail on Sunday</I> to be a massive &#163;1.2 million, as we have heard. Three housing benefit officers supervising the case were apparently sacked, for, as one said, &#147;just doing our job&#148;. A spokesman for Ealing Council even said that it was appropriate to put the family in a seven-bedroom property because of the age of the children. If that is correct, why were the officers sacked? How does that make the situation any better?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="0905121000012"></a>Surely to goodness there are two things wrong with the system. Although I do not know the details of the children&#146;s age and sex, I know that in the private sector, where no housing benefit is paid or claimed, it is not uncommon for children of the same sex to share a bedroom until one or more moves out of the family home. The fact that this is not tolerated in the supported housing sector means that those who get state support are sometimes treated more generously than those who are not&#151;and that is not correct.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90511-0013.htm"/>


<a name="90511-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="0905121000013"></a>Secondly, was a &#163;1.2 million house the only one available in the district? I find that difficult to believe; further, there must be a limit that the state should be prepared to subsidise in housing costs. None the less, I agree with the Government that it is a great improvement in the system that claimants should know in advance what the state is prepared to pay in terms of housing benefit. For both those reasons, these Benches support the regulations&#151;even though the local housing allowance and the rules governing it are one of many facets of the DWP that we will be combing through, if and when we get the chance.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="0905121000014"></a>Ministers seem to love two things: targets and pilots. In this case, targets are not in question but pilots most certainly are. Local housing allowance was extensively piloted before it went live across the whole country. I find it hard to stomach that the pilots were properly evaluated before it went live; that is why we will attempt to change the current Welfare Bill where pilots are involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="0905121000015"></a>However, revenons   nos moutons. Was the size of the dwellings ever raised as a problem during the piloting stage, or are the regulations the result of media pressure, as has been suggested from the Liberal Democrat Benches? No doubt the Minister will deny this, as his fellow Ministers have done, but he must answer the question that was put to him by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood. Why do we have the regulations so soon after rollout? It is particularly relevant because, in answer to the SSAC report on the order, I note that the Government have responded, in paragraph 29:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_89"></a><a name="0905121000106"></a>&#147;The Impact Assessment used the best available data to estimate the number of customers that may be affected by the change and what the composition of this group may be. The Government has had to rely on survey data rather than more up-to-date and complete administrative data. The Department for Work and Pensions did not begin to receive administrative data returns on Local Housing Allowance until it became available in September 2008, and then for an incomplete set of local authorities. The Department is still in the process of quality assuring this data particularly the fields that relate to Local Housing Allowance and that are new to the dataset. It is likely that the Department&#146;s administrative data on Housing Benefit will be publishable at a national level later in 2009. However, it cannot be guaranteed that completion of all variables would be sufficient to inform a robust impact assessment of this issue. The only option for now is to use survey data to estimate the possible impacts&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="0905121000016"></a>In another part of the SSAC consultation response of 8 February, the Government claimed that the problem of high subsidy occurs only in inner London.

Does this not now raise broader questions about the viability of the whole scheme, given the concerns about landlords turning away LHA tenants and vulnerable people being unable to cope, which is a subject that I have mentioned more than once in your Lordships&#146; House?</p>

I have listened with great interest to the points that have been made.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="0905121000020"></a>I do not want to dwell on the background to this issue, except to say that the Government have introduced these regulations which cap the local housing allowance at the five-bedroom rate from this April to move towards housing benefit paying housing costs that are on a par with those that the majority of working families can afford. There was some agreement that, clearly, we do not want to burden the taxpayer by meeting excessively high rents through housing benefit; rents that most working families would not even contemplate committing to. I also believe that most people would agree that benefit expenditure at those levels should not go on unchecked, even if the number of households involved is very small. Our estimates suggest that fewer than 1 per cent of cases assessed under the local housing allowance arrangements would be entitled to properties with more than five bedrooms.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="0905121000021"></a>I turn now to the issues raised by the Social Security Advisory Committee in response to the Government&#146;s consultation on the changes and which were reflected in the report of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, raised the criticism that the regulations were over-hasty and disproportionate. The regulations were not over-hasty; it became apparent fairly early after the local housing allowance was rolled out from April 2008 that rent officers were encountering problems in finding sufficient rental evidence to determine an appropriate rent for larger properties. This lack of evidence made it very difficult for them to arrive at a median rate for the local housing allowance. In addition, local housing allowance rates for larger properties had reached unacceptably high levels in some areas. For example, local housing allowance rates for larger properties in some inner London areas exceeded &#163;3,000 per calendar month, and rates in excess of &#163;2,000 per calendar month were not uncommon, particularly in greater London and the south. The need for change was apparent, and we spent some time during the course of last year considering how best to address this concern.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="0905121000022"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Skelmersdale and Lord Kirkwood, asked why these issues were not apparent earlier in the pathfinders pilot. The national scheme was slightly different to the pathfinders scheme. We  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_898"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 898</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>did not measure entitlement on bedroom size in the pathfinders scheme, but on room size. The number of cases affected is very small indeed.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="0905121000023"></a>Our considerations included looking at a number of options, including the cap at the five-bedroom rate, and I will go through these, as the Social Security Committee has identified some of them as being a better way of dealing with excessively high rents for larger properties. The noble Baronesses, Lady Thomas and Lady Meacher, have referred to the options this evening.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="0905121000024"></a>One option was for the local authority to make a referral to the rent officer requesting a property-specific determination of a reasonable market rent if an individual claimed housing benefit for a property with more than five bedrooms. This would replace the arrangement whereby the rent officer calculates generic local housing allowance rates for properties with six or more bedrooms if and when requested to do so by a local authority in any month. We decided against the property-specific determination in these cases for a number of reasons. First, a key principle of the local housing allowance was to move away from burdensome property-specific determinations by rent officers to local rates for the area, so that people would know in advance of taking a tenancy the maximum support they could get through housing benefit. More than that, the property-specific determination route would not have dealt with the more fundamental issue of people on benefit potentially accessing properties that they could not afford, even if employed, without recourse to benefit. This creates a powerful disincentive to work. It is also expensive to administer.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="0905121000025"></a>Another option was to use the five-bedroom rate as a starting point and to add an additional amount for each bedroom entitlement above five bedrooms. We looked at various ways of deriving additional amounts of benefit for each extra bedroom by analysing the local housing allowance rates for smaller properties. Again, we rejected this option. It is complex and lacks transparency for customers. The derived rates, including the single shared room local housing allowance rate suggested by the Social Security Advisory Committee, would not reflect real market rents, so that larger families still might not be able to access suitably large accommodation.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="0905121000026"></a>Conversely, in some cases the derived rate could be higher than the existing local housing allowance rate for properties with six bedrooms or more. The nature of the property market for larger properties is such that rents often do not increase proportionately in line with the number of bedrooms&#151;floor area and location may be more important factors to consider. Again, an overriding concern would be that, by routinely giving people who are dependant on benefit access to larger properties with rental values that they could not possibly meet, even when working, removes any incentive for them to return to work.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="0905121000027"></a>We considered the alternatives suggested by the Social Security Advisory Committee as part of our decision-making process before announcing that we would cap the local housing allowance at the rate for properties with five bedrooms. We believe that the cap is more transparent; it retains the simplicity of the

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="0905121000028"></a>Another comment by the Social Security Advisory Committee was that,</p>
<ul><a name="0905121000136"></a>&#147;the potential impacts of the proposed change did not seem to have been properly thought through&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0905121000100"></a>We have fulfilled our obligation to carry out an equality impact assessment for these regulations. In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, the Government acknowledge that there may be a disproportionate impact on some groups&#151;for example, multi-generational households&#151;but we believe that there are sufficient mitigating factors to justify our course of action.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="0905121000029"></a>First, these changes do not mean that customers with larger families will be unable to rent properties with more than five bedrooms if they rely on housing benefit. The evidence shows that a proportion of properties with six or more bedrooms will still be available at the five-bedroom rate. The customer will know in advance the local housing allowance rate and can shop around for cheaper larger properties or renegotiate the rent.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="0905121000030"></a>Next, there is a scarcity of larger properties and our analysis of the present property size of all households, regardless of benefit entitlement, suggests that, of those who would be entitled to six or more bedroom properties under the existing local housing allowance rules, around 70 per cent may actually be living in properties with fewer than six bedrooms. Again, larger properties tend to have more than one living room so there is scope for these to be used as bedrooms.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="0905121000031"></a>The Government recognise that, as a result of this change, a small number of families will have to seek alternative accommodation because housing benefit will no longer meet their rent. So that these families have plenty of time to find their next property, the regulations give them six months&#146; transitional protection&#151;increased from 13 weeks, as the noble Baroness said. We believe that this is wholly reasonable and that it takes into account that a lot of private tenancy agreements are of at least six months&#146; duration.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="0905121000032"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked about the review. The local housing allowance is subject to a review over the first two years of its operation and we intend to include the impact of this change within the scope of that review. The noble Lord asked whether we could give assurances about a special chapter on this issue. We will be collecting a wide range of data as part of the two-year review and this issue will form part of the evaluation.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="0905121000035"></a>Other specific points were made. On overcrowding, the local housing allowance bedroom allocation criteria are more generous than the &#147;room standard&#148; definition of the statutory overcrowding criteria. Our evidence suggests that the vast majority of six or more bedroom entitlements would have five or fewer rooms allocated under statutory overcrowding criteria. The noble Baronesses, Lady Thomas and Lady Meacher, asked about ethnic minorities. We have recognised that there is a disproportionate impact on some groups. However, we stand by the mitigation presented in the equality impact assessment. For the small numbers of cases involved, there are still properties with six bedrooms or more available at the five-bedroom rate. I mentioned the general scarcity of larger properties which suggests that around 70 per cent of larger families, regardless of benefit entitlement, may live in properties with fewer than six bedrooms. An analysis of the rent service database of market rents shows that nearly 60 per cent of five-bedroom properties have more than one living room, which could be used as a bedroom and still leave adequate living room space.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="0905121000036"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, referred to Ealing Council, which was involved in a case of spectacularly high rents. Obviously, how the council determines employee policy is a matter for the council. He referred to the sacking of officers, and that was also a matter for the local authority involved. There are various options open to a local authority for housing homeless families, but much depends on local policy and the availability of property in the area.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="0905121000037"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked about the fairness of the benefit rate. The housing benefit review is looking at the entire structure of housing benefit, with a focus on fairness, work incentives, and value for money for the taxpayer, and these aims are consistent with the policy change.</p>

<p><a name="st_161"></a>

There is a rolling review of these by the rent service. Some of them are reviewed each year. This is a proper opportunity, particularly for local authorities, to engage in the determination of those reviews and to input into the assessment that is being undertaken, which is a separate review from the two-year review. We are talking about a review of the broad thrust of the policy.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="0905121000040"></a>The noble Lord made an earlier point about overcrowding. Under the local housing allowance, the criteria are one bedroom for every adult couple, any other adult aged 16 or over, any two children of the same sex, and any two children, regardless of sex, under the age of 10. I think those criteria are more generous than those used to determine overcrowding generally.</p>

What I said in my speech was that it would be unfair if those with publicly subsidised housing had a better standard of accommodation than those without such public subsidy. That was what I was trying to draw out of the Minister.</p>

It is a difficult line to tread. Looking at work incentives, if through the benefits system you are able routinely to access better, larger properties than you might be able to afford if you were in employment, then there is an issue that needs to be addressed. Everyone would accept that there has to be some limit on the size of the property. I do not think there would be great disagreement about that. There is clearly some disagreement about how to set the parameters of that, but the review which we will undertake will, I hope, provide broader evidence on how the current policy is working and how we might move forward on housing benefit issues.</p>

<a name="90511-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="0905121000045"></a>To conclude, I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, will not press her Motion to a vote. We considered the alternatives to and the impact of this cap very carefully. We believe that capping the local authority housing allowance at the five-bedroom rate is a fair response to the excessive payments of benefit that larger properties can attract. We must ensure that housing benefit rules do not allow people to take on rents that would leave them without any incentive to work, that the rules are fair to hardworking families who are not claiming benefit, and that housing benefit is affordable and represents value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="0905121000048"></a>On the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, I am sure that the Government already have a detailed policy on the sharing of rooms by siblings. I do not suggest that every child must have its own bedroom. If that were the case, the Social Security Advisory Committee would have had its own comments if it thought that the policy was currently too generous.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90511-0014.htm"/>


<a name="90511-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="0905121000051"></a>To date, much of the debate around this issue has been shaped by the fear that Royal Mail is to be partly privatised, and it has been hard to escape the unhelpful media coverage that has emerged. However, perhaps I may say that I was content with the comments of the Secretary of State, the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, at Second Reading some two months ago, when he said that he could not agree more with the Communications Workers Union&#146;s campaign to &#147;Keep the Post Public&#148;.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="0905121000052"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, while they have so far remained unheard, the voices and interests of stakeholders and, more importantly, service users will not only be raised but become a formal part of the consultation process that Ofcom should go through when carrying out its assessment. That will put in place much-needed protection for consumers right across the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="0905121000053"></a>The Bill&#146;s proposal to transfer the regulatory role for the postal sector from Postcomm to Ofcom will place postal regulation within the wider communications market. Before any changes can be made to the universal postal service, the new regulator will have to carry out an assessment of whether the postal service is meeting the needs of consumers.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="0905121000054"></a>We are all aware that people rely on our postal service to deliver, for example, the deeds of their houses, legal documents, passports and treasured notes from loved ones. Individuals the length and breadth of the country use the postal service, rely on it and, more importantly, have a view on how best it should evolve.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="0905121000055"></a>The amendment allows for broad consultation, but also explicitly requires consultation with Consumer Focus, the consumer watchdog with a legislative mandate to monitor postal issues. This is a common-sense check intended to protect consumers by ensuring that any changes to the service cannot be rushed through under the radar.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="0905121000056"></a>The purpose of Amendment 60 is to ensure that the Royal Mail&#146;s performance&#151;or that of any future provider of the universal service&#151;can be scrutinised effectively by the statutory watchdog for the postal sector, Consumer  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_904"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 904</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Focus. Consumer Focus came into being late last year. It is important that we give it a firm footing in statute, to strengthen its role in the regulation of our postal service.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="0905121000057"></a>We always hope that watchdogs and regulators are freely given the information and access that they need to carry out their role effectively; but sadly, this is often not the case. The amendment would require Royal Mail to provide the postal watchdog with a range of information showing how well it is delivering the universal postal service; for example, details of whether it is meeting targets for collecting and delivering mail. It is drafted to ensure that regional and local information is included, so that performance problems affecting particular areas or regions are detected and addressed.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="0905121000058"></a>Consumer Focus has statutory powers under the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007 to demand information; but it was envisaged that these powers would relate only to specific serious issues and be a tool of last resort. In the hope of facilitating cordial, meaningful exchanges, the amendment should provide a firm basis for Consumer Focus to carry out its function responsibly. I beg to move.</p>

It would be very helpful if the Minister were able to go into a little more depth about how he envisages the relationship between Ofcom and Consumer Focus operating as we go forward. As the Minister's letter makes clear, Ofcom&#146;s internal consumer panel is expecting to play a significant role in the market assessment and in the ongoing maintenance and, we hope, success of the universal postal service. Can we understand what role will be left to Consumer Focus?</p>

<p><a name="st_171"></a>
<a name="0905121000060"></a><b><a name="90511-0014.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0905121000249"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> My Lords, the Government&#146;s first priority is to secure the provision of a strong universal postal service. Clause 28 gives the Bill one of its essential features: the primary duty of Ofcom to secure the provision of the universal service. Amendment 59 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Browne of Belmont, seeks to ensure that the National Consumer Council is explicitly named in the Bill as having to be consulted, along with representatives of small business and other such persons as Ofcom considers appropriate when it carries out its market assessment. Indeed, Ofcom will need to carry out market assessment of the extent to which the market for the provision of postal services in the UK is meeting the reasonable needs of postal services before it proposes any amendment to the universal postal services order.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="0905121000061"></a>An assurance was put on the record in the debate in Committee on 20 April. That is an assurance which I repeat now, that Ofcom will consult fully and in the normal manner on any changes to the universal postal service and that that will, of course, include consultation with the National Consumer Council. In addition, Section 16 of the Communications Act requires Ofcom to establish and maintain effective arrangements for consultation in the carrying out of its functions which will include postal services. That duty includes ensuring  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_905"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 905</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that there is a consumer panel which, among other things, must give advice on the interests of domestic and small business consumers in relation to, among other things, the provision and availability of postal services. Ofcom is a seasoned regulator and, as such, by custom and practice, it regularly consults on major issues of policy across the communications market. That will be no different for the postal service market in the future.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="0905121000062"></a>Amendment 60 seeks to ensure that the National Consumer Council has a direct role in the evaluation of the universal service by requesting that Royal Mail provide the NCC with such information that will enable it to evaluate the performance of the universal service at a national, regional and local level. Clause 33, headed,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_92"></a><a name="0905121000109"></a>&#147;Publication of information about performance&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="0905121000102"></a>already contains some requirements for information on performance of the universal service provider. The clause requires that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_93"></a><a name="0905121000110"></a>&#147;A designated USP condition must include provision requiring the universal service provider&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_94"></a><a name="0905121000111"></a>&#147;(a) to publish information about the extent to which it is providing specified postal services in accordance with specified standards, and</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_95"></a><a name="0905121000112"></a>&#147;(b) to publish annually an independently audited performance report&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0905121000103"></a>As that information will be put into the public domain it will be freely available for the National Consumer Council to see and evaluate on its own accord. In addition, the amendment specifies &#147;national, regional and local&#148;, which goes beyond what is already provided for in the Bill. This would impose a large, imprecise and inflexible burden on the designated universal service provider, Royal Mail.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="0905121000063"></a>In the light of the clarification I have provided, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Browne, will consider withdrawing the amendment.</p>

<a name="0905121000064"></a><b><a name="90511-0014.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0905121000250"></a>Lord Browne of Belmont:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, for his support. The amendment was drafted solely with a view to providing greater clarity and protection for service users. Indeed, Amendment 60 has been laid with the view of ensuring that all service providers offer the same level of independent complaint procedure. I am still firmly of the view that such a provision would give consumers a level of protection and confidence that an independent complaints process would be available to them if required. I am encouraged by the Minister&#146;s response. Although the consultation does not go as far as I would like, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage.</p>

<a name="0905121000065"></a><b><a name="90511-0014.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0905121000252"></a>Lord Hunt of Wirral:</b> My Lords, I make no apology for returning to this issue at this stage. We have strong feelings about the need for regulations under subsection (5) to be made only by affirmative resolution. The Secretary of State will be aware that I raised similar points in Committee and I hope that he and his colleagues will be more sympathetic.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="0905121000066"></a>As I understand the position, we are in complete agreement that there is no intention, no desire, to introduce a levy. The Secretary of State&#146;s colleague, the Minister, made much of the safeguards currently in the Bill to prevent the imposition of this condition and I am glad to see them there. I also understand that there is a precedent of a charge being in the Communications Act and that there is no requirement for parliamentary involvement there. I am aware of that background. However, I do not agree with the Government&#146;s present position that the requirement for an affirmative resolution would be an &#147;unwise and unnecessary check on Ofcom&#148;. The very stringency of the safeguards that are already in place essentially means that the levy would never be imposed at short notice. This rather undermines the Government&#146;s argument that an affirmative resolution would add an unbearable delay on what needs to be a speedy process. I do not accept that argument given that I cannot believe for one moment that it would suddenly happen. I certainly hope it would not.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="0905121000067"></a>I repeat the argument I made in Committee, that if it is discovered that the Royal Mail is unable to provide the UPS at a profit even after the steps we are taking in the Bill, that will indicate a tremendous failure of policy. It will be not only an indication of a declining sector or changing public opinion on what should constitute the UPS but a sign that what we are being asked to approve in the Bill&#151;namely, taking on billions of pounds of pension liability and selling 30 per cent of a public body&#151;is just not enough. There ought to be an opportunity to debate such a situation. We cannot stand idly by and allow such a move to be made without Parliament having an opportunity to discuss and approve it.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="0905121000068"></a>I think that if there were to be a levy Parliament must be involved. I hope that this time the Secretary of State will feel able to accept my amendment. I know from previous debates on such issues that we in this House feel particularly strongly that Parliament should be involved in debating and discussing such a decision by affirmative resolution. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="0905121000074"></a>This group of amendments will require all postal operators to offer an independent process of investigation for complaints from service users. Consumers must have the peace of mind that comes with knowing that they have available redress should the service they receive fall below an adequate standard. Through these amendments we would be offering consumers such protection. In practice, Royal Mail currently passes complaints that cannot be amicably resolved for independent scrutiny through Consumer Direct. No matter who offers a postal service, it is important that consumers know that a fair, open and independent method of adjudication is available to them should something go wrong. Imagine how absurd it would be if service users had to investigate whether such a service exists when they wish to use a particular postal operator or, more probably, once something has gone horribly wrong, when they discover that unlike for other providers, no such complaints procedure exists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="0905121000075"></a>Removing the discretion currently provided will in turn remove the choice for operators.

Amendment 65 would require Ofcom, again if it sets any form of consumer protection conditions, to ensure that the associated postal operator provides information to Ofcom on the levels of compliance with complaints-handling standards and to publish information on the number of complaints made and the way in which the complaints were dealt with. Amendment 66 would require Ofcom to set out the time and manner of publication of such information.</p>

However, these amendments risk placing excessive regulatory burdens on postal operators, especially those operating in the competitive areas of the mail market. Most operators say that they already have appropriate customer-complaints procedures in place and that if they did not, their customers would go elsewhere.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="0905121000078"></a>As currently drafted, before Ofcom can require a postal operator to be a member of an approved redress scheme or to provide and publish information on complaints handling, the Bill states&#151;this is important&#151;that such requirements need to be proportionate and objectively justified. The Bill provides the necessary protection for consumers and allows us properly to implement our obligations under the postal services directive, while at the same time allowing Ofcom the appropriate level of flexibility to ensure that the sector is not overregulated. I would therefore invite the noble Lord, Lord Browne of Belmont, to withdraw his amendments.</p>

As I said, I fully understand that the legislation is drafted in such a way as to provide options, but I still believe that one clear way of demonstrating to service users that they are being fully considered in the passage of this Bill is to accept these three amendments and remove the discretion that is currently attached to consumer protection. However, I go some way towards accepting the Minister&#146;s statement and, at this stage, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

In Committee the Minister persuaded me as to the problems that would result  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_910"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 910</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from lifting the precedent of the Communications Act straight into this Bill. But I remain hopeful that these problems are not insurmountable. It cannot be beyond the wit of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to establish a speedy, cheap and appropriately qualified system of appeal. The amendment is lifted directly from previous legislation and leaves the details of such a scheme almost entirely up to secondary legislation, allowing it to be specifically targeted to the needs of the postal services sector and to be modified easily in the future if problems were to arise.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="0905121000081"></a>The Minister persuaded me in Committee against the CAT model, but he has not persuaded me against the need for a method of appeal that does not rely on judicial review. I continue to be surprised by the way in which some elements in government feel that judicial review is an appropriate remedy. I recall being &#147;judicially reviewed&#148; unsuccessfully on many occasions, but the one thing of which I became aware as a Minister is that judicial review is highly restricted in the area that it can look at. Their Lordships&#151;well, certainly with me, but not with some of my colleagues&#151;were not disposed to try to second-guess Ministers.</p>

<a name="90511-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="0905121000082"></a>So judicial review for someone who feels that they have a right of appeal is not really a useful remedy. It can be useful where a Minister has acted unreasonably or irresponsibly, but in the context of this Bill, there is a need for something a little wider. I remember debates on other Bills where similar amendments have been vociferously resisted by the Government because of the possibility that they would increase the number of cases being sent to an expensive, slow and already overburdened system of review.</p>

<a name="90511-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="0905121000083"></a>I happen to believe that the fewer the cases that end up in judicial review, the better. I also do not feel that the requirements on Ofcom to consult and so on before imposing conditions are a replacement for appeal. The very point of an appeal, in particular the kind of appeal to which I am referring, is the need for an objective opinion. If one is being reasonable, I do not think one could decide that Ofcom could be objective about its own decisions.</p>

<a name="90511-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="0905121000084"></a>I hope that the Secretary of State has had an opportunity to think about this and is minded to try to find some way of meeting this point, which has been echoed on all sides of the House in previous debates and certainly finds a ready echo outside the House and in the other place. I therefore look forward to hearing what I hope will be a more favourable response to the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90511-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="0905121000086"></a>Noble Lords will recall that we have already considered appeals in Committee. Currently under the Bill, any decision by Ofcom other than a price-control decision is subject to judicial review. In our view, this represents an improvement on the current position under the  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_911"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 911</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Postal Services Act, where the grounds of appeal are limited because they are set out in the Act. As a result they do not benefit from recent developments in jurisprudence on judicial review. It is well established that a decision based on a material factual error can be challenged by means of a judicial review; for example, where a public authority has relied on something irrelevant or has disregarded something which was relevant to its own decision. As has also been said before, the High Court has the experience and is well versed in balancing all of the factors that Ofcom must consider before making regulatory decisions. It is the right tribunal to hear appeals on regulatory decisions. There is no need in our strong view to create an entirely new one. Where necessary, the High Court is able to hear cases very quickly on an expedited basis and, given the public importance of issues relating to the universal service, we would hope that such cases would indeed be heard quickly.</p>

<a name="90511-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="0905121000087"></a>Requiring more regulations to determine a new appeal body and new rules of procedure is simply unnecessary and would add to regulatory uncertainty. Furthermore, the significant additional cost and resource requirements associated with the establishment of such a body would be disproportionate when compared with Ofcom&#146;s other sectors of responsibility. The sole exception to this general principle is decisions relating to price controls where the detailed, complex and specialised matters involved in such regulatory decisions make them less appropriate for judicial review. This is why we have provided for a specific appeal of such matters to the Competition Commission which is better placed to undertake the complex economic assessment required in such cases. I would also like to reassure the noble Lord that, before making any regulatory decisions, Ofcom must consult and consider every representation made. They will only impose regulatory conditions where necessary or appropriate to meet specific purposes.</p>

I just thought that would be impossible to refuse. However, in view of what the Secretary of State has said, I shall have to go back to the drawing board and be a little more practical and apply a little more common sense, because I always follow carefully his steer. I do not think that he was saying that he would never agree to a system of appeal. I think that he was saying that he would never agree to a slow, costly and cumbersome system of appeal.

<a name="90511-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="0905121000093"></a>These amendments relate to the operation of a Royal Mail licence condition&#151;namely, the price control condition. The current price control, which was originally intended to be replaced at March 2010, is being allowed to run on but needs an adjustment to continue to operate as intended beyond March 2011. These amendments are therefore necessary to ensure a smooth transition for Royal Mail with the minimum of delay between the current regulatory framework and the new regulatory regime that Ofcom will administer.</p>

<a name="90511-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="0905121000094"></a>The price control includes a volume adjustment mechanism, which allows Royal Mail to recover additional revenue if volumes are lower than those forecast by Postcomm when the current price control was set. This is because Royal Mail&#146;s profits are sensitive to the volume of mail that it delivers, because a large proportion of its costs are fixed. The adjuster compares volumes in the previous year with an index of forecast volumes calculated when the price control was set. Because mail volumes have fallen significantly in the past year or so, the impact of the adjustment on Royal Mail&#146;s finances is significant. The licence currently contains no value for the index to enable the volume adjuster to continue to work beyond the financial year ending 31 March 2011. However, it is not expected that by that date Ofcom will have completed the market assessment, made the universal service order, completed  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_913"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column 913</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>its cost modelling and carried out such consultations as it considers necessary before it imposes a new price control. Assuming no other competing pieces of work need to be undertaken, Ofcom currently estimates that it will be able to put a new price control regime in place in January 2012. Clearly, to ensure stability and certainty for Royal Mail and the postal services market, the existing price control needs to continue until the new one can be put in place, and that assurance needs to be given as speedily as possible.</p>

<a name="90511-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="0905121000095"></a>The Government consider that Ofcom&#146;s principal practical task in this regard should be the work required to build a transparent cost model and compete the market assessment. Revising the existing price control will be a very significant resource drain, and would lead to unacceptable delays in establishing a new regulatory regime. Postcomm is unable to effect the necessary change to the condition under the procedures in the Postal Services Act 2000 before Part 3 is likely to come into force.</p>

<a name="90511-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="0905121000096"></a>The provisions of the current price control will roll forward for the necessary extra year without the need for regulatory action, but there is one vital exception to this. Paragraph 14 of condition 21 of the Royal Mail&#146;s licence currently includes a volumes forecast index, covering formula years one to four. This enables the volume adjuster to function until 31 March 2011, but no further. The volume adjuster is of great importance, as it allows Royal Mail&#146;s revenues to be adjusted to take account of the continuing decline in mail volumes, which has been greater than Postcomm forecast when the current price control was imposed.</p>

<a name="90511-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="0905121000097"></a>Our amendments seek to give the Secretary of State power to make an order extending that adjuster on the same basis to cover a formula year 5, thus allowing the adjuster to continue beyond 31 March 2011. The order made by the Secretary of State may adopt &#147;a forecast figure&#148; that Postcomm has produced using the same methods that it has,</p>
<ul><a name="0905121000138"></a>&#147;used ... to determine the forecast figure for the index years&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="0905121000104"></a>currently set out in the licence. The Government intend to make an order as soon as possible, using Postcomm&#146;s figure&#151;which, for the avoidance of doubt, is 102.46. Before making the order, the Secretary of State will,</p>
<ul><a name="0905121000139"></a>&#147;consult the universal service provider and such other persons as&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0905121000105"></a>he &#147;considers appropriate&#148; for a period of 21 days, and &#147;consider any representations&#148; that might be received. We have already discussed this proposal informally with a number of stakeholders, including Royal Mail, the Mail Competition Forum, the Mail Users&#146; Association and the National Consumer Council. Given their feedback, we believe that this proposal will be entirely uncontroversial.</p>

<a name="90511-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="0905121000098"></a>It is anticipated that the resulting order will be sufficient to enable the current price control to be rolled forward until Ofcom has conducted its full market assessment and is ready to set a new price control reflecting the new regime. It will give Royal Mail and the postal services market stability and certainty through the transition period, without distracting Ofcom from the vital work of putting the new regime in place as quickly as possible.

<p><a name="09051112000003"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051112000157"></a>Lord Bates:</b> It is perhaps appropriate to repeat and to put on the record my interests as a director of three businesses in the north-east of England, all of which pay far too much in business rates, which will be a recurring theme that I shall come on to.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000004"></a>The first amendment, we hope, sets the tone for our argument in relation to the Bill. The amendment allows the levying authority power to impose business rate discount where the levying authority has &#147;sufficient local income&#148;. We have made a flying start, because that is not on the Marshalled List, which actually states &#147;low income&#148;. The intended wording is,</p>
<ul><a name="09051112000141"></a>&#147;local income or avoided costs in order to fund it in full&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051112000005"></a>As well as having the power to increase and to impose a business rate supplement of up to 2 per cent on local businesses, there should in certain circumstances be an opportunity to have a mirroring capability to reduce business rates in a given district. The arguments for this are clear, in that reducing business rates would make that location more attractive to potential investors, retailers and businesses. Bringing those businesses into the area would help.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000006"></a>In her Second Reading speech, the Minister welcomed this Bill, saying that it was another power for the local authority toolkit to build strong foundations for the future&#151; we understand that perspective&#151;and that, even in this time of very difficult economic circumstances, it was right to do so, because the Bill was about releasing investment for mutual benefit across the community. If the intentions behind the Bill are really to help local businesses and to invest in local communities at this time, why not include an enabling power to levy a business rate discount? I am not sure whether &#147;levy a business rate discount&#148; is the right term, but for want of a better one, we shall leave it as it stands.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC286"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC286</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000007"></a>Under the Local Government Act 2003, local authorities already have a discretionary power to levy council tax discounts, which they fund. We advocate the introduction of a similar discretion to offer reduced business rates in whatever form local authorities choose, as long as those reductions can be funded from local income or avoided costs. This would allow councils to apply local solutions to local problems, and would give them greater flexibility. Authorities would be able to work together to fund it, whereby the billing authority would not have to bear all the cost. This is important, because we want to reward businesses and thereby encourage and stimulate business growth and prosperity, particularly as we go through very difficult economic times. This would be part of the new financial framework to give local authorities a share in local growth, as was mentioned in the Green Paper.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000008"></a>There is concern, because economic crises and the lack of incentives to encourage business mean that landlords are being deterred from converting buildings to business use. In rural areas, farmers are not choosing to convert redundant agricultural buildings because they are likely to face significant empty property rates for the period when they take over as tenants. We will come back to the issue of empty property rates later at the appropriate point in our amendments, and to the general revaluations taking place, particularly in ports, but also generally among businesses at a very difficult time.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000009"></a>We ask the Minister to consider this proposal to help local communities and businesses in need, and we do so recognising that we are asking not for exceptional treatment but for something very much in line with other aspects of local government finance.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000010"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09051112000158"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> As this is the first opportunity to speak in Grand Committee, I should declare my interest as joint president of London Councils. This must be the first Bill dealing with local government where one of my fellow joint presidents, the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, is not present.</p>

I was going to say that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, was a third, but I mean the first; he is indeed here, and I would be the third. I am also a former London borough councillor and member of the Greater London Authority, with the consequent loyalties to both those areas that one retains; and am director of a charity, the Rose Theatre in Kingston, which is a business paying business rates.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000013"></a>I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Bates, that I will start by being negative, but I shall end by being positive; that is probably the right way round. I do not see how the amendment would operate. What is sufficient income? That seems quite a subjective phrase. Is it sufficient in an account dealing just with the BRS project, or overall? It could be interpreted in a number of ways. I am not sure what &#147;local income&#148; means in this context. I realised that there was a typo in the amendment; I just assumed that the word should not have been there at all so that we were talking about  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC287"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC287</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;sufficient income&#148;. If it should be &#147;sufficient local income&#148;, I have to say that local authorities do not have that much local income; the amount has varied over the years. We on these Benches say that what is raised locally is not enough, the balance is all wrong, and so on, but I will not embark down the policy road. I am unclear how the two words would affect the noble Lord&#146;s objective.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000014"></a>The noble Lord is right to raise the issue. I had assumed that Clause 10 covered a variation in the amount of business rate supplements, and that it could be varied up or down. There certainly needs to be a mechanism to reduce BRS during a project if it turns out to be less expensive than had been thought or circumstances change. Schedule 2 provides for credits and refunds, but only at the end of the project. I recall seeing somewhere in the debates in the Commons that the Minister, Mr Healey, said that refunds were provided for, but I cannot see where. I look forward to exploring how we can achieve something, even if I do not quite go along with this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000015"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09051112000161"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> I welcome everyone to the Grand Committee on a shorter Bill than the last one, but no less significant. I am sure that we will have the usual vivid debates. I am pleased to have kicked off with a general debate on the disposition of the BRS itself. I am also grateful for the clarification, because we struggled; we thought that a subtlety in the amendment had evaded the combined experience of officials and Ministers, but I now understand more what the noble Lord is getting at. Certainly, the crucial word is &#147;discount&#148;. I will not repeat anything that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said about the issues raised by the amendment, but this is an opportunity for us to debate the general principle. The noble Baroness is right. As regards the BRS, local authorities will be free to levy up to 2 per cent. There is flexibility within that, although it is slightly different from that raised by the noble Lord in his amendment.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000016"></a>The amendment proposes that levying authorities be given a power to reduce business rates. As I understand it, the noble Lord argued that as well as being able to raise BRS for projects that will enhance economic development, they should have the flexibility to use BRS as a trigger to reduce business rates for smaller businesses. That was the background to the general argument about whether that would be a plausible and sensible thing to do. It is an interesting point.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000017"></a>It is worth just giving a brief outline of where the current rating arrangements derive from. As noble Lords will know, they have been in place since 1990. They ensure that business rates are collected by billing authorities and transferred to central government. For many years, we have followed the principle of equalisation according to local need and resource, and redistributed to local authorities for them to provide local services. I believe&#151;as did Sir Michael Lyons, the last person to have a serious look at the systemic nature of this&#151;that it ensures that businesses that benefit from those local services contribute towards them. Although the system has its critics, it is fair.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC288"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC288</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000018"></a>Nevertheless, the noble Lord raised a good question about whether there should be scope for local authorities to be able to use BRS to reduce business rates. It was in that context that this question was raised in the discussions around the 2007 White Paper. Paragraphs 2.43 to 2.50 developed that argument, and I will take the issue on from there. It was acknowledged that, while there had been widespread debate of the issues that surround allowing local authorities to raise a supplement on business rates, there had been less discussion of the arguments for and against permitting authorities to reduce their local rate below the current national level.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000019"></a>The White Paper raised the theoretical possibility of allowing local authorities a broader discretionary power to lower their local rate if this were in the economic interests of the area. As the noble Lord said, an authority might want to do this to attract inward investment or to deal with other local economic challenges. In the White Paper, we said that we would discuss the case for allowing local authorities in the context of BRS to reduce rates with business, local government and other stakeholders, which is what happened.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000020"></a>We held meetings between officials and representatives of business interests, including the CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce, the British Retail Consortium, local government, the LGA and London Councils. We invited views on the proposition and asked stakeholders to consider how such a measure might work in the context of BRS and some of the implications. These included the impact on local services, how local authorities might use the power, what safeguards might be put in place to protect council tax payers and the implications for tax complexity.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000021"></a>This was a thorough discussion but, significantly, the outcome was that there was little appetite to pursue that further. Businesses and local government could not see how this would work without a general negative impact on local services and council tax payers. So they debated it in the round in that context. Given the response, I am very happy we have had this debate on the record. It would be perverse of the Government to bring forward such a measure and, clearly, it would be perverse if we were to support it.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000022"></a>However, let me reassure the noble Lord that local authorities already have the power to provide discretionary hardship relief to businesses which would otherwise suffer hardship, provided it is reasonable to do so having considered the interests of council tax payers. This is because part of the cost of providing hardship relief must be met by local taxpayers. I know that the noble Lord&#146;s argument was in the context of economic incentives and ways of promoting local economic activity, but in order to complete the debate it is worth saying that hardship relief is given in the most extreme circumstances.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000023"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising the issue, and I hope he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000025"></a>I have a question for the Minister that was sparked by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. What would happen if the actual cost was lower than the estimate? Would a refund go back to business? If, for example, the estimate was &#163;1.5 million and the business rate supplement was &#163;300,000, there would be no vote because the figure was less than 30 per cent, but if the actual cost was only &#163;1 million and therefore reduced by one-third, there probably should be a vote in that instance. If the figure were reduced by one-third, would a third of that go back to the businesses that had put in the &#163;300,000 originally?</p>

<p><a name="09051112000026"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09051112000163"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> Local authorities and business together will have to show in their partnership document, the prospectus, what they anticipate the total cost of the project will be. If it becomes clear at some stage that the cost has been underestimated or overestimated, they will have to have a way of dealing with those contingencies that is expressed in the original prospectus. They will have to show that they have anticipated some contingency if things do not work out quite as expected.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000027"></a>The noble Earl asked about refunds. I am afraid that I do not have an answer, and I suspect that we will not find one in the Bill or the guidance, but I will write to noble Lords with a little more detail.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000028"></a>On the ballot, if it turns out that there has been a gross misrepresentation&#151;an underestimate or whatever&#151;the prospectus would have to be re-presented, and there may have to be arrangements for a ballot at some point. I am not entirely certain that I have got that precisely right, but I will write to the noble Earl.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000029"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09051112000164"></a>Lord Bates:</b> I am grateful to noble Lords for their comments, to which I shall refer in turn. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, for her observations on the amendment. Perhaps I should have explained it at the beginning in fairly simple terms. If the project that was the subject of the supplement was aimed at reducing the business rates in a given area, it would work in the same way by paying money into a fund that could then be used to reduce the overall tax rate in that area. Given that business rates, to which we will come later, are often the third greatest cost that many businesses face, that could be attractive. Under previous Governments&#151;I am not sure whether this happened when my distinguished noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding was at the former Department of the Environment&#151;we introduced the concept of areas, such as development areas and enterprise zones, which were free from business rates. They did tremendous good by drawing people in, because business rates were a major barrier to investment. They are again reaching a high level at this difficult time. Offering a discount might be more successful in attracting business to a locality than trying to entice it with a new road or new infrastructure. We would very much like to see such a measure.</p>

I am interested in the extensive discussions that she mentioned had been held with the CBI, the British Retail Consortium and the British Chambers of Commerce. However, she also mentioned that a lack of appetite appeared to be shown. Was that lack of appetite shown by the business organisations&#151;that seems strange given what a burden they consider this issue is and the lobbying that we have received from those organisations on it&#151;or was it on the part of Ministers?</p>

I thought that Amendment 2 would give rise to a spate of lobbying against me on the part of business organisations. I am not sure that it has but I would like to explain why I am seeking to allow the opportunity to extend the scope of the business rate supplement. The Bill is completely focused on economic development but it will, by definition, have to last longer than some other legislation. Life changes and priorities change. Businesses do not necessarily have more of a stake in economic matters than they do in social or environmental matters in their area. Indeed, social and environmental considerations can affect the way in which business operates. Promoting economic development in area A may not greatly affect a business in that area but economic development in areas B and C outside the immediate local authority might well do so. This could be part of a much bigger picture than the Bill seems to allow for. Amendment 2 seeks to allow regulations,</p>
<ul><a name="09051112000142"></a>&#147;to add to or vary the purpose of projects for which money may be raised&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="09051112000120"></a>This is an amendment for the long term. I am not seeking an immediate extension of the purposes. I propose that there should be regulations to implement this, and that they would follow consultation of representatives or organisations of business rate payers, local authorities and others.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000033"></a>It has occurred to me that by tabling this amendment I may be arguing against my own cause, as it is probably possible to argue that almost any activity promotes economic development if you analyse it down to the last detail. But if that was the case, Clause 3(3) would not be required, so it is not the basis on which the Bill has been drafted. I should also say at this point that later amendments have been tabled regarding ballots. They are not unrelated to this if regulations to extend the purpose are introduced. We believe that there should in any case be a ballot on each project so that businesses have the opportunity to express their opinion.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000034"></a>Amendment 7, by taking out the restriction in Clause 3(3)(a), would allow for money to be spent on housing. I am puzzled that this restriction is included because housing so obviously supports economic development. The consultation on the draft guidance published by the Government in January states in the section on the kind of projects it might or might not be appropriate to fund that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051112000134"></a>&#147;It may be considered appropriate to levy a BRS to fund a place-marketing programme to attract investment into a local area&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000121"></a>One cannot attract investment into an area if the environment&#151;I use the word in its widest sense&#151;is not in itself attractive. In order to bring business into an area, those who are going to work in it need to have access to decent housing. If an authority proposed to use a BRS to spend on housing, it would have to pass the additionality test, so I do not seek for this to substitute for other sources of funding. The consultation on the draft guidance rightly states that it will be quite complex to deal with the test, although of course at the moment funding for local authority housing is not in great supply in any sense. Amendment 65 is consequential and would provide for the affirmative resolution procedure to be used or the regulations I have already mentioned.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000035"></a>Amendment 12 would insert a new clause seeking a periodic review and a report to Parliament on the use of money raised by BRS with the opportunity for representations to be made and a report then produced. The clause has been suggested by the Federation of Small Businesses, which rightly says that business is being asked to contribute and therefore should have some reassurance that it will be heard so that the Government can get the benefit of business experience in delivering projects of this kind. There is no doubt that local businesses, given that they are so strongly engaged with economic activity, should be given the opportunities that the amendment would provide. The federation also points out that the amendment should ensure that the business rate supplement is used for the Government&#146;s intended purpose of promoting economic development. I have to say that that is probably a matter for the auditor and does not need the provision I am suggesting here.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000036"></a>However, I have more reasons than the federation in terms of arguing for this amendment. Business rates are national and this local element is only local in some aspects. To my mind, the amendment would not deal with the detailed assessment of individual projects

<p><a name="09051112000037"></a>The review should extend to the interests of all those who are involved, not just those who pay. The billing and levying authorities, having operated the system, are likely to have a view either that it is going well or that alterations in the arrangements are desirable.

We believe that it could be a means to delegate commitments and responsibilities that should be in the preserve of central government to local government as part of the current adverse economic and fiscal position. We are very concerned about that; we will obviously come back to that when we consider additionality. That is why we would not want to follow the amendment that extends the list into housing. Housing is for central government and for private sector commitment for development. That should be allowed and it would not be appropriate to be covered under the Bill.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000040"></a>The amendment helpfully highlights the fact that, curiously, we have a Bill that identifies what the business rate supplement can be used for by listing what it cannot be used for. Clause 3(3) lists housing, social services, education services, services for children, health services or services that the local authority provides in the discharge of functions that Planning Acts provide. Then there is the very broad term of economic development. I share the concern of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee: most things fit into economic development. At Second Reading, the Minister was generous in giving a number of examples of what could be used, but it would be useful for that phrase, &#147;economic development&#148;, to be spelt out. That would give comfort to businesses, which may be fearful&#151;the noble Baroness referred to the briefing from the Federation of Small Businesses, which we have also read and agree with.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000041"></a>Amendment 12 raises a very important issue: how are people who may have contributed to be kept involved in the project all the way through? It proposes a review and a report to Parliament. That is a very good idea. We welcome that. I have only one question for the noble Baroness, which is whether five years is too long and whether annual or triennial reporting would be more appropriate given the major projects that are being considered. That discipline of having to report back to people would be very helpful.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000042"></a>It is also very important to keep businesses involved in the process. We have received briefings from all the business organisations about this. They are very worried,  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC293"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>first, that there will be a whole raft of measures that are carefully crafted not to require a ballot and which the organisations will be levied to fund if their businesses have a rateable value of more than &#163;50,000 per annum. Secondly, they are worried that they will be denied any say in the process of paying that levy and that they will have no involvement in the project itself. We all know what a healthy incentive it is for organisations, particularly businesses, when profit is determined by the ability to keep to the budget and to be on time. In the absence of that profit motive, it would be wise to have businesspeople very closely involved at every stage in the implementation of the project for the perspective that they bring and for the transparency which they can elicit from the people who are project-managing the exercise.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000043"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051112000168"></a>Earl Cathcart:</b> I have one question about Clause 1(2). Can a levying authority exempt certain areas from paying a business rate supplement? In Norfolk, if the project under consideration was the dualling of the A11, it would certainly promote economic activity in the area of Norfolk&#151;certainly from Breckland and Thetford and all the way out to Norwich and beyond: to Yarmouth and so on&#151;but it would be of very little benefit to King&#146;s Lynn and north-west Norfolk. The question is therefore whether levying authorities can exempt certain areas in their area from paying the BRS.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000044"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051112000169"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I shall have to leave that question until the end of the debate. That will give me time to think about it, too. As the noble Lord, Lord Bates, said, very important issues have been raised in our debates on these amendments. I was particularly struck by his saying that we have defined the investment that the BRS will prompt by what it does not cover rather than by what it does. We were very wise to do so, because throughout this whole process we have been trying to avoid any flavour of prescription while at the same time being clear that there are criteria that will be absolutely fundamental to the way in which the BRS can command complete partnership and complete credibility and help to deal with some of the fears among businesses, especially small businesses, which the noble Lord spoke of and which I can understand. That is why I am happy to put as much as possible on the record in Committee. I hope that, by doing so, I can put a lot of those fears to rest.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000045"></a>Amendments 2, 7, 12 and 65 are clearly asking about the use and purpose of the BRS. This is fundamental: what can the BRS be used for and not used for, and why? In essence, Amendments 2 and 65 would give the Secretary of State, and Welsh Ministers in Wales, powers to extend the use of the BRS beyond the promotion of economic development. The amendment to Clause 1 would allow the Secretary of State to make regulations to add to or vary the purpose for which the BRS might be raised. These regulations would be subject to the affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000046"></a>The crucial question that we have been asked is what we mean by economic development. In essence, the best account of why the focus is so firmly on economic development is given in the White Paper in the first part of the chapter that introduces the idea of  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC294"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC294</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the BRS and explains why it is a relevant and important opportunity. I shall give a little history and explain the economic capability of local authorities now.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000047"></a>We are facing situations where we still have gross regional inequalities and local inequalities which need to be confronted. Over recent years, given that we are facing globalisation and the competition that comes through that, which impacts on location of skills, enterprise and investment, that combination has genuinely led to a situation where for a range of reasons with different agencies the Government have tried to give local authorities a much firmer grip on the levers of economic power. We saw that recently, during the passage of the Bill that we have just finished, in terms of economic regeneration, the configuration of regional and local economic capacities, the economic assessment and the sub-national review, which has led to those configurations and so on.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000048"></a>Essentially, the argument is that there are different strengths in different places and that local authorities need, in a way that they have not before, to take a grip on what can be done in terms of their economic prospects and productivity now and in the future; that is, planning locally for greater prosperity. This serious agenda was reinforced by the Lyons inquiry, which obviously considered reforms to business rates. He recommended a new local flexibility to set a supplement on the current national business rate, which we are debating. That was reinforced by the SNR. I take the point that &#147;economic development&#148; is hard to define because of what constitutes direct and indirect economic development. It makes sense if we look at it in that context, bearing in mind the journey that has been made and the focus that we are trying to give.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000049"></a>In responding to the Lyons recommendations, for example, the Government stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051112000143"></a>&#147;a local supplement has the potential to support local economic development, but would need to be subject to credible accountability to rate payers and real protection to any businesses&#151;particularly SMEs&#151;that might be disproportionately affected&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051112000122"></a>That argument was taken up by the SNR, which talked about,</p>
<ul><a name="09051112000144"></a>&#147;a powerful new tool for local authorities to invest in infrastructure to support long-term economic growth in their areas, backed by mechanisms to ensure that there is a strong voice for business and supplements are introduced only where they can command support from all those affected&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051112000123"></a>The lobbies representing business need to know the term &#147;command support&#148; and that people are very serious about that notion. All the subsequent discussions we have had with industry have been on the basis that there is a clear commitment to promoting economic development and economic growth, which is their core business and what they do.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000050"></a>The concept of economic development clearly is commonly understood. There is no single definition of the term. As we set out in the guidance, it may be considered that the projects to promote economic development are likely to focus on supporting the productivity and prosperity of the area. From the first, we been clear that that is what it should be. But we have also said that there must be scope for innovation as to how the local area, the local authority and local business interpret what is best in terms of economic development and how innovative it can be. Basically,  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC295"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC295</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we want to encourage innovation, provided that both partners of the contract are in agreement. It is not just about what the levying authority thinks will best promote economic development, it is about what business thinks too.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000051"></a>I completely understand why the noble Baroness has raised the amendments, because there is a genuine debate around these issues. As she says, these are long-term issues. This journey to give local authorities more grasp of local economic development has been a long journey already. From what the noble Lord, Lord Bates, and I are saying, she will not be surprised when I say that I cannot accept the amendments because they deflect and distort away from the single purpose of the BRS. Essentially, and as the noble Baroness herself admitted, the amendment would mean that the BRS could be used for anything ranging from tackling crime to housing improvement to climate change issues, because all can bring some indirect economic benefit if they are properly managed. However, they are not central to economic development in the normal sense.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000052"></a>The noble Baroness said that the thinking behind the amendment is the need for greater flexibility and to recognise that communities are in themselves successful economic entities. Having dealt with that argument, I shall move on to her second point. We are also looking at a potential compromise in the consideration of additionality. Schemes aimed at housing&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Bates, mentioned housing&#151;the greener, safer agenda or health issues all have statutory funding mechanisms and form part of what the community expects to fund, as well as being the recipients of specific grants. But the same is not true of strategic economic development, and this Bill is intended to boost the ability of local authorities to raise revenue for investment in economic development.</p>
<h5><a name="09051112000150"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000053"></a>That brings me to the third reason for the difficulty here. We need to return to the primary purpose of the Bill. Businesses already contribute to the provision of services such as street cleaning and social services provision through the national business rate, and I do not think that they would take kindly to funding more of the same. The BRS is essentially a new tool aimed at raising revenue to invest in local areas over and above the provision of services and projects already in place, and since it will be a method of securing additional revenue from local businesses, it should be used to fund aspects of the community that are of most interest to those local businesses. We made it clear throughout our preparatory documentation for the Bill that any supplement will have to be subject to strong safeguards. Businesses need to know that they are not going to be asked to fund projects that are not relevant. That is important to the credibility and integrity of the proposals. Indeed, businesses should not see this as something being done to them, but as a shared enterprise at every stage right through from being a gleam in the eye of the partners to its implementation. The Bill ensures that, within the broad remit of economic development, there is scope for innovation depending on the nature of the local economy. Communities are different and there must be flexibility in order to foster creativity through these proposals.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC296"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC296</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000054"></a>My first reaction to Amendment 12 was to say that these are local activities so we should not have a national review mechanism. However, having heard the arguments of the noble Baroness about the criteria and national context, and having taken note of what the noble Lord, Lord Bates, had to say, I am minded to take it away and think about it. I cannot promise anything, but the noble Baroness has made an interesting case for the concept of a review mechanism, and I take the point made by the noble Lord about the involvement of business partners. Indeed, we shall come on to that when we talk about consultation.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000055"></a>I turn now to Amendment 7. Although the noble Baroness knows that I have argued in the context of other legislation that housing is an economic function, in this context it is not of the same order of economic development. I echo again the noble Lord, Lord Bates, that a broad range of funding already goes into housing through the vast sums distributed through, for example, the Homes and Communities Agency, as well as substantial private funding. Therefore, although housing is very much part of what makes a community successful, in the context of BRS it is not different from the other services. I could argue, for example, that the health service services the local community because it keeps people healthy and active in their workplace. I could argue that without education we would have nothing in the way of economic development. Those are both persuasive arguments. To come back to the main point, though, it is important that we keep the focus on economic development and the connection with business, which can be robustly promoted. As I said, businesses already provide and contribute towards core services, and should not be asked again in a different way to contribute. We would have problems with the notion of additionality.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000056"></a>The short answer to the question of the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, is no. This will be worked out not by geographical area but, essentially, on the scope of the distribution of businesses within the area of a levying authority. That is what will define the criteria. One would hope that, within the scope of Norfolk, if something were to be offered through BRS it would be sufficiently strategic that even some of the more outlying areas would get some benefit from it. It would depend on the nature of the local project, the consultation and the scope of the commitment that went into it.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000057"></a>I have spoken at some length on that amendment. I hope that the noble Baroness will feel that she is able to withdraw it.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000058"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09051112000170"></a>Lord Bates:</b> I would like to press the Minister a little further on this because it might be the only chance we get to look at the important term &#147;economic development&#148; and whether it is the right one, or whether &#147;development&#148; is just too broad a term and allows local government officers to dream up lots of pet projects for the private sector to fund. What would be the effect of replacing &#147;economic development&#148; with &#147;increasing economic output&#148;, &#147;maximising economic productivity&#148; or &#147;creating wealth&#148;? These are all the kind of objectives that business is looking for, especially at present; it has the objectives of increasing shareholder value and generating profits. If this is about business and raising funds from business to help business, perhaps we ought to mirror

I appreciate that the Minister might want to reflect on that, but what is her response?</p>

<p><a name="09051112000059"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09051112000171"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> As with most of the language that we have to contend with when we are making policy, sometimes the choice means choosing broader terms that encompass most of those elements. As the noble Lord has picked out, &#147;development&#148; includes output, productivity and wealth, but it also includes the implications of community wealth, growth, progress and so on. The term is fairly commonly understood; it is certainly in common currency. We use it, for example, in the sub-national review of economic development. If we were to take single aspects of development we would be challenged. If we chose &#147;output&#148;, for example, we would have four opinions for every one economist, I would imagine. &#147;Productivity&#148; is certainly a subjective term, depending on which side of the line you are on, and I would hesitate to use the concept of &#147;wealth&#148; in legislation.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000060"></a>I understand what the noble Lord is getting at, though. Something we might think about, in our guidance or advice to local authorities, is that when they came to describe their projects they underpinned the broad notion of &#147;economic development&#148; with a precise statement of what they meant by it, what they expected to get out of it and whether or not, in these terms, there would be specific outputs and benefits. In the prospectus, they will be required to give a detailed account of what costs and benefits their project will deliver. That is the place for some of this language to be employed.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000061"></a>The noble Lord has asked a good question, and I hope that we can find some other ways of digging into it at different stages as we implement the BRS.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000062"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09051112000172"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> It has been an interesting debate. Both noble Lords who spoke raised interesting questions. I wrote down the noble Baroness&#146;s phrase &#147;commanding support&#148;&#151;that the project has to command support. I wrote down &#147;ballot&#148;; we are going to keep coming back to that, are we not? It is certainly necessary for the levying authority to demonstrate how the project will contribute to economic development. It has to win the argument before it wins a vote, of course. The noble Earl&#146;s question was really interesting. In a big area or one that is diverse, that question will cause a lot of heart-searching; it already has in London.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000063"></a>On housing, the Minister referred to the range of bodies that have statutory duties, but I am not sure that that is an answer to the question. We know that those duties are not adequately delivering, and we know about the interchange. I do not disagree with her about health services, education and so on, but the lack of housing is a problem within economic development issues. She distinguishes the power that local authorities have from a duty in the area of economic development; I think that is what it really comes down to. I thought yesterday, but forgot when I came in this morning, that I should have a look at the Regional Development Agencies Act, because my recollection is that RDAs have a limited opportunity to provide housing to support their projects. Has that provoked anybody?

It was probably my enjoyment that she enjoyed least. More relevant to the Bill may be that, for those eight years, I chaired the finance committee of the Metropolitan Police Authority, so was responsible for the huge property estate that the Metropolitan Police has throughout Greater London and beyond, on which it of course pays business rates. Rather more currently relevant, I must again declare that I am a London borough councillor&#151;that is particularly relevant to the amendment&#151;and a member of the executive in the London Borough of Sutton. Indeed, I led that council for 13 years. It is perhaps also relevant to note that, according to the GLA&#146;s guidance, Sutton is the London borough that benefits least from the coming of Crossrail. That coincidence enables me to say, as I did at Second Reading, that it in no way weakens my personal or my party&#146;s commitment to Crossrail. Anything that I say, do or propose should not be taken as any wish to delay or jeopardise that long-needed project, which I have been considering for pretty well all my adult life in London politics&#151;a very long time.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000067"></a>The purpose of this amendment is very simple; it is to add London borough councils to the list of levying authorities. London borough councils are substantial unitary authorities, and have been for a very long time. They have all the duties of local government that pertain to local government in this country. They are now the major drivers of economic development in their area. Their relationship with local businesses has changed enormously in the past 15 or 20 years, probably without exception. All London boroughs work in very close partnership with the business community. That is probably even more the case as regards the relatively small part of the business community that will be affected by the Bill. Those are in the main the other

Of course they are not, but to cite on Second Reading&#151;funnily enough, arguing why other parts of the country should have the same powers as London&#151;the Minister said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051112000136"></a>&#147;If and when the time is ripe and the partnerships agree and want to work on something exceptional that crosses different local authorities, why should they not have this opportunity?&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000124"></a>That was said in the context of authorities outside London, but it applies at least as much to authorities within London&#151;London borough councils. As we know, the Bill when enacted will last for many years. We talk about 2035. At some stage during that time, there will be economic recovery. At some stage, some&#151;probably not all&#151;London boroughs will have a project that they want to go ahead with in partnership with local businesses. We will keep returning to the question of what &#147;in partnership&#148; means and reassurances to local businesses, but all that ought to apply to London borough councils as it does to all other first-tier authorities in the country. The time may be right one day and we need the provisions in the Bill for when that time arrives.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000070"></a>Another point of great concern to London borough councils now is that they will be the billing authorities for the supplementary rate. We know that that will apply in London and why it will apply. They have been anxious for some time to know exactly what that will mean on implementation. Again, I cite the Minister at Second Reading, towards the end of her speech, when she said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051112000137"></a>&#147;We intend to consult shortly on the policy that will underpin the regulations. Even if we do not have the regulations in front of us, we will have the substance of the regulations to enable us to have an intelligent debate, and we can do that as soon as possible. We aim to issue the consultation paper on our proposals for secondary legislation very soon. With that in mind, I hope that we will be able to proceed before, if not during, Committee stage with a map in front of us of what implementation will look like&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/4/09; col. 1534-35.]</p>

<p><a name="09051112000125"></a>I have to ask the Minister: where is the map; why, when it was so confidently expected three weeks ago, is it still not with us; and when will it be?</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000071"></a>As it is not before us, I hope that the Minister will give some commitments: that London authorities, as billing authorities, will be able to recoup all additional

Most particularly, we would like to know the details of implementation and when this map is going to appear before us. I beg to move.</p>

However, I want to put my interests on record, as one has to; like the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, I am a joint president of London Councils, which represents the boroughs and, if one has to declare one&#146;s past interests, a great many years ago&#151;more than I care to contemplate&#151;I was a member of Hornsey Borough Council. Noble Lords may be surprised to learn that there ever was such an animal as that council; the territory it covered is now part of the London Borough of Haringey.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000073"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tope, knows a great deal more than I do about this because he has for such a long time been a member of the executive of the London Borough of Sutton, as he told us, but I wonder whether breaking the pattern of Clause 2 is a wise thing to do. The intention of Ministers in Clause 2 as it stands is to ensure that at any level of local government there is only one tier that can impose a BRS. That is a good principle, otherwise one will land businesses with multi-tier additions to their national domestic rates.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90511-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000074"></a>I ought perhaps to add that I was the inventor of the national non-domestic rate, which was part of the Bill that introduced what was called the community charge but the press always referred to as the &#147;poll tax&#148;. Although the poll tax disappeared, the national non-domestic rate survived, and it is part of the system today. That is a single-tier tax. It may be levied by the boroughs, but only because that is the way the system works. The noble Lord&#146;s argument&#151;that the boroughs should have the right to impose their own BRS because, after all, they are going to raise it for the Greater London Authority for Crossrail or whatever&#151;does not follow at all. It so happens that they are the bodies in London that have the capacity to levy a rate, and therefore that is what they do and what they will do under the Bill. Notwithstanding my support for London Councils&#151;I greatly admire what it has been doing in recent years; it is an admirable body&#151;a two-tier business rate supplement system would be a dangerous step. I say so with some regret because the noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches may feel that they are speaking for the London boroughs, but one has to look at this pattern as a whole, and, as a whole, to have one single tier raising the BRS is right.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000075"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tope, went on to argue that the boroughs were not bursting to do anything now. No, they are not, because they are desperately trying

If they can add as little as possible to the national non-domestic rate, they will justifiably be very proud of that. Therefore, I do not think they will want to add more to the businesses in their areas, which is what the amendment implies. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, says that they may want to in the future. So be it. I hope that at some stage&#151;perhaps when we have considered a number of amendments, including those that will be moved by the noble Lord, Lord Best&#151;we can consider providing a review mechanism not just for limits or amounts but to look at the BRS as a whole so that if changes are necessary they can be introduced through secondary rather than primary legislation. That would be the time to look at this, but in the mean time I believe that the principle in the Bill of having only one tier of local government raising the BRS is absolutely right. Therefore, I am afraid that I do not support the amendment.</p>

He put his finger on the nub of the issue; the amendment, which may be a probing amendment, would introduce the potential for double charging the business rate supplement, levying up to 2p on the London business rates for Crossrail, and would allow local authorities&#151;the boroughs&#151;to initiate projects which could levy another 2p. I understand that if the amendment were accepted, similar dual charging possibilities could apply across the country wherever two-tier authorities exist. In places that may be close to our hearts at the moment, such as Lancashire, the county council could levy a charge and presumably a district council such as South Ribble could also levy a charge. This comes back to the point we have made throughout our discussion on the legislation; namely, that the Bill may have been conceived two years ago when the economic climate was completely different. It might have seemed a good idea then but this is about the worst possible time to introduce it. It has one purpose&#151;to enable the development of Crossrail&#151;and that should be the limit of its scope.</p>

It is not the first time that we have heard about such problems. It would be helpful if we received the draft map, in whatever form it takes, before the second day. However, perhaps it is now appropriate to say that noble Lords will not wish to be committed to anything simply because we receive a draft very close to the second day, not least because the authorities affected will not have had a chance to look at it. I am simply saying at this stage that, although the map will be received with gratitude, it cannot be thought that we will respond to it in any way other than by quoting bits of it back to the Minister, as one does with these pieces of paper.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000084"></a>I turn to the broad arguments. I thought that noble Lords opposite made an extremely good fist of explaining why the GLA will be the levying authority in London, rather than the boroughs. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, pointed out that the important principle throughout the Bill is that one tier is the levying authority. The dog that did not bark in the contribution of the noble  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC303"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC303</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord, Lord Tope, was that if the London boroughs had a power to levy BRS, it would be a power &#147;on top of&#148; and a double opportunity to levy rates on business. The important thing is that while the role of the London boroughs is as important as the noble Lord made out, what we have had to consider is that the BRS should be levied at the right special level. The point about London and its unique characteristics of extraordinary complexity is that there has to be a strategic city-wide approach. Therefore it is only right that the GLA should be the levying authority, not just in terms of London, but because of its role in the economy of the south-east and concentration of jobs there in terms of the country as a whole.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000085"></a>We have tried to ensure that London is treated in the same way as the rest of the country for BRS, but the spatial level at which the supplement is levied needs to be considered in a different light in London. I detect an inevitable tension because the noble Lord is the great champion of the boroughs but, with his experience on and commitment to the GLA, he understands its strategic role in promoting economic development across London. It is clear that the projects that the GLA can undertake with a London-wide BRS will have a much greater strategic impact on London than could be achieved with separate contracts carried out by an individual borough or even a group of boroughs. If noble Lords cast their mind back a short while&#151;although it seems a long while&#151;to when we were debating the GLA Act and the planning powers given to the mayor, they will remember our debates on the strategic imperatives of London and the need to strengthen that capacity.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000086"></a>We have had a very good debate. I hope that on that basis the noble Lord will not feel too injured and will be able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000087"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09051112000187"></a>Lord Tope:</b> All that needs to be said has been said about the very unsatisfactory situation in which we find ourselves, coming towards half way through Committee by the end of today without the promised guidance. I feel pretty confident that no one present today is directly responsible for that delay; it is just unfortunate that the Minister has to bear the brunt of explaining why we are in that unsatisfactory situation. We look forward to receiving the guidance within a day or so and regret that the Government have been so distracted during the past week that they have not managed to produce it by Monday instead of Wednesday.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000088"></a>I was of course interested in what the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, had to say and his declaration of interests. It struck me that the most important of them, although it was not strictly a declaration, was that he was responsible for nationalising the business rate&#151;something that Labour was committed to repealing but for which we are still waiting. I seem to recall that he was a prominent part of an Administration that got rid of one whole tier of government in London at a sweep. Had that prevailed, we would have lost the argument today.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000091"></a>Of course I understand the points being made; I hope that, equally, others understand my points. London borough councils are not to be equated with non-unitary district councils. They are larger; they have hugely bigger budgets; they are very different players in local economies. That is not in any way to belittle the role of non-unitary districts&#151;I would say the same if my noble friend Lord Greaves was sitting next to me. There is no equation there.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000092"></a>I said before that no one is clamouring for the power now&#151;clearly the time is not right&#151;but some time during the next 25 years or so for which the Bill is likely to apply, the time may well be right. Whatever the provisions of the Bill when enacted, it would not be done unless it had the consent of the businesses affected.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000093"></a>I use a local example. If the London Borough of Sutton, which is on the borders of Surrey, wanted to engage in a project with Surrey County Council&#151;as any outer London borough might with its neighbouring county&#151;why should it not be able to levy a supplementary business rate, assuming that the businesses involved are in favour of it? This may well be the worst time to be introducing such a Bill, but I am not responsible for its timing. The Bill is here; all I am saying is that it is regrettable that London borough councils are being treated as if they are non-unitary district councils and being excluded for all time from the Bill.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000094"></a>In the second part of my speech, I asked for a commitment from the Government on various aspects of implementation. I suppose that the Minister's answer is that we will have to wait until the long awaited map is published, in which case it is very likely that we will be returning to similar points for greater clarification on Report, once we have seen the guidance. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

We should not seek to roll out what was an exceptional case of infrastructure development and turn it into normative practice in terms of raising additional local government finance. One of the arguments I pray in favour of this case is that in a briefing from the Local Government Association for our Committee stage, the point was made that local government works  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC305"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC305</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>closely with local businesses. It understands and shares concerns about placing excessive burdens on enterprises. The association goes on to make in bold print the assertion that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051112000139"></a>&#147;Councils are not sitting eagerly waiting to levy new supplements as soon as the legislation is enacted. A recent survey of the Chief Economic Development Officers&#146; Society did not find a single local authority that is planning to use the power to apply an additional supplement during the recession&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000126"></a>I believe that the briefing makes my point for me. It explains that this is a piece of enabling legislation that would allow an additional levy to be placed on business, but goes on to make the clear assertion that chief economic development officers are not sitting back and waiting for that to happen and, by implication, do not feel that it is absolutely necessary. No one is planning to take an initiative like this during a recessionary time, so this is quite a damning indictment of the Bill from the Local Government Association.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000096"></a>Amendment 4 would remove from Clause 2 the designated geographic areas other than the Greater London Authority. This issue was raised in the Commons when the Opposition wanted to decline to give the Bill a Second Reading because it fails to limit the application of supplementary business rates to the Greater London Authority and the Crossrail project. Crossrail is a unique proposal because of its size and extent. It is a one-off project of exceptional economic importance and should not be used as an excuse to roll out a supplementary rate nationally. The funding of Crossrail has been the subject of much negotiation for some time and should be treated in a different way from the funding of infrastructure projects elsewhere in the country. Further, businesses in London have been deeply involved in Crossrail, and groups such as the CBI support the Bill as it relates to Crossrail, but not as a national scheme. The issue also forms part of the debate surrounding the mayoralty of London; in the case of Crossrail, Londoners have already had an opportunity to express a view.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000097"></a>On 27 January during the Bill&#146;s Committee stage in the Commons at col. 127 onwards, a more specific concern was raised that I echoed in the debate on Second Reading in this House: this proposed legislation is somehow being used to cover the Government&#146;s tracks in terms of cutting the amount of funding being made available for local authority business-growth incentive schemes. The money available for those schemes is to be reduced from &#163;1 billion over the past three years to &#163;150 million. That is a significant cut in a proposal aimed at economic development, growth, productivity, wealth creation or whatever we decide to call it. The money was committed and is now being reduced because of the current economic climate. Surprise, surprise; we now have this legislation that is going to be extended elsewhere.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000098"></a>It was also discussed on Report in the other place on 11 March, where it was argued that it was incredibly bad timing for businesses which were already suffering with a range of additional taxes. At the point at which Members in the other place were discussing this, the business rates were going to increase by 5 per cent. Now, of course, there has been a magnanimous climbdown to 2 per cent by the Government, but the 3 per cent will have to be repaid next year. A rating revaluation

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000099"></a>We are at one with the case for the Greater London Authority having the capabilities laid out in the Bill to raise funds, which I think are in the region of &#163;3.5 billion, as its contribution towards Crossrail, to ensure that that major infrastructure project goes ahead, which we support fully. That has had a democratic test at the ballot box, and the people of London have expressed a view that is supportive of Crossrail. We believe that matters ought to be left there, however; if there are issues that demand this kind of measure, it ought to be brought back at a time when the economic climate and the general mood may be more receptive. I beg to move.</p>

Had we been dealing with the Bill 12 months ago, the situation might well have been different. Probably more importantly, in the years to come, when the Bill will apply, we hope the situation will be very different.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000101"></a>Noble Lords on the Conservative Benches who spoke as they did at Second Reading seem to be assuming that, as soon as the Bill is enacted, local authorities across the land will be falling over themselves to impose more taxes on business. As I commented at Second Reading, most of those authorities are actually Conservative controlled, and that scenario will not happen. The powers in the Bill will apply beyond the foreseeable future to when times will improve. Probably the best answer to this was given by the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Leigh, at Second Reading, when he said&#151;I paraphrase slightly&#151;&#147;If it&#146;s good enough for London, why isn&#146;t it good enough for Manchester?&#148;, or, &#147;If London can have it, why can&#146;t Manchester or indeed any other part of the country?&#148;. As I have said before, I speak as a Londoner and, as a London councillor, I wholly endorse that.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000102"></a>As the Bill and the opportunity are before us, these provisions should be available for local authorities throughout the country when the time is ripe. That time is not now, but it will be some time during the life of the Bill when enacted. Those provisions should be there; they will be invaluable not just to local authorities but to the local authorities working in partnership with their business communities. We need to keep stressing this. I do not believe that now, in this day and age, any local authority will simply impose this rate, even if the provisions of the Act enable them to. No local authority in its right mind at this time will simply impose a supplementary business rate without doing a considerable amount of preparation work in partnership with the businesses, whether or not it is required at that time to have a vote, which is a debate we are yet to have.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000103"></a>I do not support the amendment; it is important that the provisions in the Bill should apply throughout the country.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000104"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0003.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="09051112000193"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Tope. I could not improve on what he said. It was an extremely powerful and entirely persuasive case&#151;I shall certainly vote for this Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Bates, and I seem to have a fundamental disagreement about the Bill, and I am sorry about that, because I think we would agree on quite a lot.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000105"></a>The Bill is not simply about raising the necessary revenue for Crossrail, although that is important. It is certainly not an excuse for a national rollout, as the noble Lord suggested. The point is that this&#151;as a device to enable local authorities and business to find another way of working together under exceptional circumstances, and as part of the pattern of those evolving relationships identified by Michael Lyons, the sub-national review and then the White Paper&#151;is all part of this progression towards better partnership, greater economic prosperity, greater local autonomy and proper delivery by local authorities on the basis of what they know their local communities need.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000106"></a>I was about to quote the noble Lord, Lord Smith, in exactly the same context, because he absolutely summed it up. There is no doubt that local authorities across the country can take advantage of the BRS as and when they are able to. I am not a bit surprised that the LGA has said that no one is lining up to do this immediately. Of course we are in exceptionally difficult circumstances and there are other tasks in hand. However, to deny other local authorities the ability to create this sort of partnership would be profoundly undemocratic. Michael Lyons in his final report said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051112000145"></a>&#147;communities need more power to choose to raise new local revenue to invest in themselves ... greater flexibility over raising revenues to invest at the local level should allow communities to strengthen their own economies ... over time&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051112000127"></a>He certainly did not suggest that that should be limited to London. In fact, in evidence to the Public Bill Committee in another place, it was significant that Julie Grail, the chief executive of British BIDs, stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051112000146"></a>&#147;we can see outside of London all sort of scenarios where a BRS could work very well&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000107"></a>The basis of the Bill is to take the long-term view and create opportunities that are not there at the moment. If the amendments were to be accepted, the rest of the country would wonder why they were being debarred from a benign opportunity&#151;a voluntary opportunity, which is a matter of choice to them&#151;to take advantage of this new type of partnership. There is a huge amount to gain from giving local authorities a greater ability to raise revenue for investment, in partnership with business.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000108"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Bates, has been persuaded, if not by me, then at least by the noble Lord, Lord Tope, to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Whichever side of the argument you are on, I have a question for the Minister. Can she guarantee that other government spending or government grants will be in no way reduced because of local authorities&#146; ability to levy a business rate supplement?</p>

<p><a name="09051112000110"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0003.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="09051112000195"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> Certainly&#151;</p>

There is a temptation, which people have foreseen, that the Government may say to local authorities, &#147;We are not going to pay for that project. You pay for it out of the business rate supplement&#148;. I shall give you an example. When the congestion charge was introduced under the Greater London Authority Act 1999, an estimate was made of the likely income that the charge would gather. Then&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;the very next year, the central government grant to Transport for London was reduced by almost exactly that amount. This is one of the worries. I ask the question again: will the Minister guarantee that government spending or government grants will be in no way reduced because of the ability of local authorities to raise business supplement relief?</p>

<p><a name="09051112000112"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0003.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="09051112000197"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> We are straying into the principle of additionality, in some ways. I hope it will satisfy the noble Earl if I quote the White Paper, which is succinct and clear. Paragraph 2.17 says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051112000140"></a>&#147;In principle, additionality can be simply and clearly defined. It means that supplements should only be used for investment that would not otherwise have taken place. Local authorities should not use revenues from supplements to substitute for their own resources and to support projects which they would have undertaken anyway&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000128"></a>There is no question of this funding being used to compensate for cuts in government funding.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90511-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000113"></a>The criteria that will have to be applied will have to meet certain very tough tests of additionality, which is exactly why the principle of these projects is so different and so specific.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000114"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051112000198"></a>Earl Cathcart:</b> I think it is slightly the other way around. It is because local authorities have been able to raise money through this scheme that the Government have said, &#147;You&#146;ve raised a lot of money this year. We are going to cut the grant that we are going to give you&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000115"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051112000199"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> Yes, but the principle applies. It is not a question of substituting funding from one source to another. These are exceptional additional projects, which will be funded through this additional mechanism. It will have no relationship with other resources and funding.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000116"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09051112000200"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> Before the noble Lord, Lord Bates, withdraws his amendment, it is hardly for me to leap to the defence of the Government on transport funding for London, but I must say to the noble Earl&#151;I am sure he has encountered this in his years as a councillor&#151;that disentangling the real rationale behind central government funding to a local authority, which is comparable to the example that he used, is always  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC309"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC309</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>extremely difficult. What one suspects is rarely ever confirmed, however strongly one might suspect it. Central government funding for London&#146;s transport infrastructure was enormous. Those of us who were working in London government might have had many criticisms of what was going on, but we could not have said that London was being deprived of funding for transport infrastructure. We could have said that we did not like the way in which the Underground was dealt with, and all that, but the cash amounts over the past few years have been enormous.</p>

<p><a name="09051112000117"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09051112000201"></a>Lord Bates:</b> I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in this short debate on these amendments. I think I get the flavour of response to them, and I very much understand where it is coming from, but I will say a little more so that noble Lords understand where we are coming from and just in case people misunderstand our position or argue about it. This is particularly relevant to the observation made by the noble Lord, Lord Tope, that if London should have it, why not the rest of the country? It depends on what you think this is. We think that this is a tax. It looks like a tax, it walks like a tax and it acts like a tax, so it is a tax. It raises additional funds and places an additional burden on businesses, so the notion that somehow out there in the provinces businesses are queuing up to ask why they cannot have additional taxation is an interesting interpretation. That difference in perception between how we see this legislation and how the Government see it is at the heart of what we propose in the amendment.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000118"></a>Again, there are some key issues as regards Crossrail. It was unique legislation which required additional funding from businesses. Transport investment in London runs at a dramatically higher rate per head of population than elsewhere in the country. Many schemes are desperately trying to get off the ground: for example, the Leeds Metro system; the Tyne and Wear Metro, which is trying to get additional funding; new routes to Durham Tees Valley Airport, which need to be subsidised in order to keep them going; or Manchester, which is in a very difficult situation after quite decisively rejecting the proposed road charging in the referendum. Therefore, there is a disparity and argument outside London about what London receives, but it is very much about the share of the cake and, particularly, about the share of transport infrastructure spending in the capital relative to other parts of England in particular.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051112000119"></a>These amendments try to make the case. I and the Minister have referred to the Local Government Association briefing, which, in a sense, we are both praying in aid. It seems to be saying, &#147;We are not sitting on the edge of our seat. We do not feel that we need it&#148;. Effectively, if the survey of chief economic development officers around the country is correct, not one authority will use the capability. Therefore, why do we have to open it up to this extent? Clearly, there is a real need for Crossrail and a real problem in plugging the gap in its funding, which is why this innovative scheme was brought up. In our mind, that is where it ought to stay. That said, I very much sense the mood of the Committee and I am grateful for the comments that have been made. I will therefore withdraw the amendment, but reserve the right to return to it on Report.</p>

I have to be very careful about how I say that. It surrounds the whole issue of what is considered to be additional funding. We had a discussion about this because there are many ways in which the types of issues, about which the Minister told us and gave examples, could qualify for a business rate supplements scheme or the types of project that might come forward.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051116000002"></a>The list included, for example, a training initiative or a centre of excellence in a particular area, which again would be very worthy. I do not doubt that centres of excellence would improve innovation, which is one of the five key drivers of productivity. That equals growth, with which we have no problem at all. Growth is a wealth-creating investment. There was also the suggestion that people might use marketing to promote a local area and its businesses. These principle examples were offered as schemes which might qualify under the terms of this report and the Lyons report, to which we have referred.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051116000003"></a>The only difficulty is that a lot of that work has already been undertaken. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has referred to the role of the regional development agencies. In the north-east of England, we have three centres of excellence; that is, one for the process industry, one for new and renewable energies, and another for life sciences. They are all&#151;certainly the first two&#151;doing excellent work and have been funded by the regional development agency. Not wanting to build a conspiracy theory, the regional development agency in the north-east has had its funding cut from &#163;270 million to &#163;207 million. That is a significant cut. The viability and future funding of those centres of excellence is being drawn into question. Clearly, a cut of that magnitude is making the regional development agency look at the funding of all its major projects.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051116000004"></a>We should be grateful for some further statements on the record from the Minister about how the term of additionality is to be applied. If it is suggested that that funding is taken from hard-pressed local business rate taxpayers, simply taking over from the regional development agency because it has had its central government funding cut, that is unacceptable&#151;similarly when it comes to promoting an area. Forgive me for mentioning the north-east of England twice, but there seems to be a rich seam of examples there. We have the major theme of promoting the north-east of England,

That is the slogan: &#147;Passionate People, Passionate Places&#148;. Regeneration under that slogan is being developed by the regional development agency. Are we to say that it will not be involved in promoting the area any longer? The Newcastle-Gateshead initiative, which has a special board chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, is doing some work in that area.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051116000005"></a>My point is that there are myriad different vehicles, whether business improvement districts, local authority business growth initiative schemes, regional development agencies or local authorities&#146; economic development functions, Business Links, or other quangos, that are doing that work up and down the country. Our suspicion, and the reason for moving the amendment, is that the Department for Communities and Local Government is not the focus, but that this is being driven by the Treasury, which sees this as a way to plug the gap in the cuts in public funding by transferring part of the burden to already hard-pressed businesses. That is the basis of our objection, and that is why we are moving the amendment: to seek absolute clarity about what is meant by additionality and the tests that the Government plan to introduce to ensure that money is truly additional. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09051116000006"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0004.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09051116000039"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Faulkner of Worcester):</b> I remind the Committee that if the amendment were to be agreed to, I would be unable to call Amendment 6 for reasons of pre-emption.</p>

It gives me an opportunity to ask the Minister to say a little more about a term used in the consultation on the draft guidance on additionality, which is &#147;existing available funding&#148;&#151;that local authorities should be able to demonstrate that the BRS would add to existing available funding and how it would fit with other available funding packages.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051116000008"></a>It seemed to me, when reading and rereading that paragraph, that to assess what is available is not quite as easy as it might initially appear. Funding may become available when the last bit of the jigsaw, which might be the BRS, is slotted into place; the funding exists somewhere but the BRS makes it available for the project because of the local authority&#146;s own commitment. I hope the Minister can reassure me that if that is the situation, the additionality test would be passed and not failed. To turn it around, it is the BRS that ensures that all the funding comes together. One must expect that there would be situations where the private sector would say, &#147;We will invest in this project if we have a commitment from the local authority for it&#148;. It would be against the spirit of what the Government have been saying if in that situation the whole thing failed because the additionality test was failed.</p>

<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC312"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC312</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an extent we are dealing with hypothetical situations, as the noble Lord, Lord Bates, said. It is about the place of BRS when it is levied for a project with more than one funding stream. The noble Lord has raised a probing amendment that would remove the restrictions on the use of BRS only for expenditure on the project to which the BRS relates, and for expenditure that the local authority would not have incurred had it not imposed the BRS, which is fundamental to the BRS. Noble Lords said that there were myriad funding streams. That is the point: there are many funding streams but this is quite different.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051116000010"></a>I shall set out again why we are so clear that this will not be used to plug gaps or as a substitute for other funding. It would have been verging on the dishonest if we had been less than clear in what we said in paragraph 2.17 of the White Paper, which I shall cite again:</p>
<ul><a name="09051116000031"></a>&#147;supplements should only be used for investment that would not otherwise have taken place. Local authorities should not use revenues from supplements to substitute for their own resources ... This is ... a new tool to stimulate economic growth&#151;not ... a different way of financing existing policies&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051116000021"></a>That is the answer to concerns about the Treasury. This has been crafted with specific challenges in mind&#151;the sort of exceptional project that may be like the projects that the noble Lord mentioned which are funded in other ways but which, without the BRS and the commitment of this partnership between business and local authorities, simply would not have happened.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051116000011"></a>I understand the concern that the noble Lord has raised about RDA funding. It is important to say again that the RDAs&#146; terms of reference are based in law. They are publicly funded and they have to deliver on their aims and objectives and spend their budgets. It may be that an RDA would find a role in a partnership, but crucially, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, was getting at, the BRS is the crucial and unique link that makes it possible to do something with available funding that would not otherwise have happened.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051116000012"></a>I will try to say this again in another way, because I think that I am repeating myself. The fundamental point is straightforward. It is not the Government&#146;s intention that BRS will replace funding streams from central government or anywhere else in the public sector, any more than we intend that BRS should replace funding streams from within the levying authority. BRS is about promoting economic development locally in partnership between the levying authority and business in ways that would not be possible without a contribution from the business sector. This will be a case-by-case opportunity for development which will be unique to each local authority. It is very difficult to hypothesise, because local authorities are innovative and imaginative. All sorts of things may lend themselves to this sort of partnership, which will be extremely successful. Yes, BRS can complement other funding streams, but it is about delivering more.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051116000013"></a>When we consider additionality and why the focus on economic development is fundamental, I should again refer to the White Paper. We went on to say that BRS is,</p>
<ul><a name="09051116000032"></a>&#147;not intended as a new means to fund existing expenditure, or as a resource to support general service expenditure. The Government intends their use to be clearly focused on economic development,  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC313"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC313</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with local flexibility over what specific projects will best promote long-term economic growth in that area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051116000022"></a>It is fundamental, therefore, that BRSs are used on the project to which they relate, because the White Paper essentially was clear that BRS is,</p>
<ul><a name="09051116000033"></a>&#147;intended to support specific investments in economic development in a transparent and targeted way&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051116000023"></a>That is the credibility of the project. That is why business has to be confident that its contribution to a project cannot be used for any other purpose. The Bill provides for that.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051116000014"></a>I turn to the question of determining additionality. In the White Paper, we did not disguise the fact that assessing additionality may well be complex. In fact, paragraph 2.19 makes that clear. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051116000028"></a>&#147;It requires comparison with a hypothetical &#145;no supplement&#146; scenario which can never be fully tested in reality. There will need to be clear accounting of the revenues&#148;;</p>

<p><a name="09051116000024"></a>and identifies four ways in which that might be done to test the claim that it is additional expenditure. There could be benchmarking in the areas affected by spending, so it can be assessed by how far it is additional. The White Paper states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051116000029"></a>&#147;local authorities could be required to set out the funding routes that have been explored, and the reasons that they are not sufficient&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051116000025"></a>A local authority with a three-year budget has a baseline and can easily build in benchmarks across the range of those revenues in transparent ways. It also states:</p>
<ul><a name="09051116000034"></a>&#147;where an authority intends to use a supplement to support borrowing they could be required to set out their full borrowing plans&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051116000015"></a>Therefore, there are ways in which this can be tested, and the sort of examples that have been given in the provisional guidance and the White Paper ranged over a number of different types of projects. For example, the White Paper mentioned projects such as a new bus transit, a light rail scheme or a convention centre that could pull in experience and opportunities; or there could be a retail development. There are all sorts of different ways in which this claim of additionality could settle on a partnership or project and could be tested under the criteria that we have set out.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051116000016"></a>That is not at all woolly. It will be a tough test, but we have sufficient detail in the White Paper and there will be further information in the policy paper that we will issue later this week. I was wrong to call it guidance; it is actually a policy paper that will provide the context to the regulations. That is why it has been a more complex document to write.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051116000017"></a>Although I am conscious that I have been repetitive&#151;which is partly to do with the helicopter circling overhead&#151;I hope that I have answered some of the questions that have been raised by the noble Lord and that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09051116000019"></a>The Minister refers to the fact that councils are innovative and imaginative.

Before I do so and to ensure that no one spends time following up the point I made on the powers of regional development agencies, let me &#147;fess up&#148;. The provision I was thinking of says that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051131000080"></a>&#147;A regional development agency may only provide housing by acquiring existing housing accommodation and making it available on a temporary basis for purposes incidental to its purposes&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051131000069"></a>That is probably a draw, because it makes my point that housing is relative to economic development, but I withdraw the suggestion that this might be different because an RDA has only very limited powers to provide housing and cannot actually build.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000002"></a>Amendment 6 would provide that the sums raised by BRS,</p>
<ul><a name="09051131000084"></a>&#147;may be used for capital and revenue expenditure or either&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051131000070"></a>I have tabled this amendment for clarification and, I hope, to hear from the Minister her confirmation that my understanding of the position as expressed in this amendment is correct.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000003"></a>Amendment 24, to Schedule 1, would include in the prospectus:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051131000081"></a>&#147;The authority&#146;s estimate of the costs of maintaining and operating the project and how they are to be funded&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051131000071"></a>It is not clear that paragraph 4 covering an,</p>
<ul><a name="09051131000085"></a>&#147;authority&#146;s estimate of the total cost&#148;,</ul>



<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC315"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC315</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09051131000072"></a>extends to these matters. I think it probably should, but again I seek to understand the position more fully. Maintenance is often overlooked when a capital project is being constructed or not thought through in sufficient detail. Ratepayers are entitled to know about maintenance and operation in order to judge the project and to assess how realistic is the estimate given by the levying authority.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000004"></a>The other amendments are probing in nature and all express future categories of expenditure. For example, Amendment 31 probes in paragraph 11 the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09051131000086"></a>&#147;expenditure incurred and work undertaken&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09051131000073"></a>which includes what will be undertaken in the future on the project. Perhaps more specifically, Amendment 29 is to paragraph 8(c), which refers to the &#147;principal terms&#148; on which money is loaned&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09051131000087"></a>&#147;in particular, the rates of interest&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051131000074"></a>We all know that rates of interest can go up as well as down. I am putting quite a heavy burden on a local authority to see into the future, but you cannot budget for the sort of projects which might fall within these categories without thinking through the &#147;what ifs&#148;. So I have referred to,</p>
<ul><a name="09051131000088"></a>&#147;the anticipated terms or budgeted interest&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051131000075"></a>Again, the intention is to assist ratepayers in assessing the reality test applied to the prospectus. I believe that the prospectus is an immensely important document, which it will be quite hard to construct. I want to be reassured about its scope. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09051131000005"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09051131000098"></a>Lord Bates:</b> From our perspective, we find much in the later amendments in this group with which we would agree and find very helpful. However, as we are discovering as we go through this afternoon, we are perhaps on the wrong foot&#151;or the right foot, depending on one&#146;s perspective. Under Amendment 6, the business rate supplements can be used for capital and/or revenue expenditure. We would have a problem with that because we do not want the scope of the business rate supplements to be wide and to include revenue spending. It opens up the possibility of local authorities being called to use the business rate supplements for things that should really be paid for from the centre. That is all tied up with the fear that the Government will try to use the business rate supplements to shift the burden of debt on to local authorities.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000006"></a>If the rate is to be used, it should pay for specific and clearly identified projects, which are one-off in nature or have a clear plan as to how they will generate the revenue from their activity to fund their ongoing existence. Taking the conference centre example used by the Minister, in the prospectus there should be a clear statement as to how that will be commercially viable on an ongoing basis.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000007"></a>However, other elements of this group are very helpful. Amendment 24 sets out the requirement in the prospectus to make clear how the projects will be funded on an ongoing basis. It also means that there is something for businesses and interested parties to hold an authority to account for if more expenses are incurred and more funding is needed. It also increases the business involvement in a project by increasing the amount of information open to assessment in the

This is very important, because we would like businesses to be involved throughout the whole process and not just when a decision is imposed and the business rate supplement has been levied.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000008"></a>Amendments 26 to 31 relate to borrowing money. The noble Baroness has done us a great service in raising the issue of borrowed funds, which is outlined in Schedule 1 in the prospectus. If money is going to be borrowed for cash flow, one presumes that there is going to be a lag, albeit a fairly short one, between the funds coming in and their being expended. Some funding is going to be needed in that gap. That is important, because this clause in the schedule raises whole new questions. In this age of difficult dealings with banks, for example, which the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, referred to, what rate of interest is going to be levied? Who undertakes the liability for the loan on its ongoing basis? If a project does not work out, who stands liable? Could it be that the businesses that signed up to the business rate supplement are therefore somehow inculcated as part-funders, and therefore partly responsible for the loan that is taken out on a project that they have supported? There are a number of questions here, and we will listen with care to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="09051131000009"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051131000099"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> This is a useful amendment that will allow us to dig under the surface of the Bill. I shall take Amendment 6 first. It is obviously right that there should be safeguards to ensure that money is spent appropriately, and the Bill provides safeguards on that point. The Bill makes clear, as I have said several times today, that revenue from BRS can be used only on projects that the local authorities are satisfied will promote economic development. Conversely, the Bill sets out a number of areas for which the supplement cannot be used, and we have discussed those today as well.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000010"></a>It is also true that the BRS cannot be used to fund services and projects that the authority is already committed to. We have discussed that too. Clause 3 makes clear that the supplement can be spent only on the project for which the BRS was introduced. Levying authorities will not be able to raise a supplement for one project only to use it to fund another.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000011"></a>That is more or less a summary of what we have debated on previous clauses. With regard to this amendment, I am happy to make it clear that the funding can be used either for capital or for revenue, whichever the local partners determine will be most useful. The crucial point is additionality. We all recognise that there are immensely worthwhile projects where the real added value would come from support for staff, skills or whatever it is. The original guidance gave the example that a levying authority may identify a business support or vocational skills programme in a local area, which clearly brings with it a revenue implication in terms of training. Whether revenue is used to pay the salaries of staff or training&#151;in fact, whatever it chooses to use the revenue for, whether it is about repaying loans or directing it to revenue projects&#151;we have decided that this should properly be left to the authority. We have provided for flexibility there.</p>

<p><a name="09051131000012"></a>I mentioned loans. I may not be able to answer all the questions asked by the noble Lord&#151;I may have to read <I>Hansard</I> carefully tomorrow to make sure that I have picked up all of them&#151;but I will do my best. Clause 3 already makes provision for levying authorities to use BRS revenue to repay loans on sums borrowed. That flexibility is another very important feature of the BRS. It means that authorities are not subject to what would in effect be a limitation on their ability to spend their BRS revenue on capital projects. This will give them the flexibility that they need to identify the project or projects that will best suit their local circumstances and aspirations.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000013"></a>I reiterate that I am happy to put on record the fact that the Bill already gives levying authorities the freedom to use revenue income on capital expenditure, revenue expenditure or a mix of the two. It is unnecessary to put that degree of detail into the Bill. I hope it will help that I have put this on the record.</p>

Is there any stipulation on that? She seemed to suggest that a local authority bond or another bond could be a way of raising capital finance directly on the markets rather than from a commercial lender.</p>

I suspect that I will have to write to the noble Lord. As I said, I might have to read his questions in <I>Hansard</I> in some detail.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000016"></a>Amendment 24 would require levying authorities to include in their prospectus an estimate of the costs of running a project funded by a BRS. This would include the expected cost of maintaining and operating the project, as well as details about where the funding would come from. That is clearly more relevant to capital projects than revenue projects because it specifically highlights maintenance and operating costs.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000017"></a>As I have said, the BRS can fund revenue projects. The current draft of the Bill is deliberately broad in asking the levying authority to set out the potential cost of the project. We must recognise that some of these projects might be quite long term and will be very diverse. That is why we have built in as much flexibility, accountability and transparency as possible.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000018"></a>I reassure the noble Baroness that what she wants to achieve is already allowed for in the Bill. Paragraph 7 of Schedule 1 makes it clear that levying authorities should include a description of how the money that is raised though the supplement will be used. Therefore, if the levying authority plans to use the supplement to cover the maintenance and operating costs of the project, that will need to be set out in the prospectus under the current provisions of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000019"></a>As I have said, the current draft of the Bill is purposely flexible because we wanted to ensure that all the costs associated with a BRS project are captured in the prospectus, irrespective of how the money raised

If the BRS is to be used to fund operational or maintenance costs, the Bill already makes provision for that to be made clear in the prospectus.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000020"></a>Amendments 26 to 29 seek to clarify the information that a levying authority must include in a prospectus when BRS revenue is to be used to borrow money to provide funding for a project. The intention is that levying authorities should be required to give details in their prospectus of money that they intend to borrow to fund their project. It might help if I explain what the Bill currently requires levying authorities to set out in their prospectus when they propose to borrow money for a BRS-related project.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000021"></a>Schedule 1 sets out the information to be included in a prospectus for a BRS. The prospectus is a central plank of BRS and will form the basis of the statutory consultation that must take place with those potentially liable to pay the levy. It is a key document that will set out the arrangements for such matters as billing, exemptions, thresholds, and how the authority proposes to deal with variations, overspends and underspends. As such, it forms a vital part of the necessary reassurances for business and stakeholders. One of the areas that must be covered in the prospectus is the details of any borrowing that the BRS will fund. This must include the amount of money loaned, the period for which the money is loaned and the principal terms on which the money is loaned&#151;in particular, the interest rates.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000022"></a>These amendments, however, propose that levying authorities should be required to set out in the prospectus information about loans that the authority proposes to take out in the future. I reassure the noble Baroness that I agree that this is important. Where money from business is used to borrow money for a project, it is absolutely right that ratepayers should be able to see the details of those loan arrangements and have the chance to comment as part of the consultation process. That should apply whether the levying authority has already borrowed the money or intends to do so. There is no need for the Bill to be amended to accommodate this point. The Bill, as drafted, already requires information to be included in a prospectus on whether the levying authority has already borrowed the money, or intends to do so in the future. I hope that reassures the noble Baroness. I hope that I have also reassured the noble Lord as I think that some of the questions he raised concerned some of those connected issues. However, I may not have gone into sufficient detail to satisfy him on some of the other points he raised, which I shall have to look at.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000023"></a>Amendments 30 and 31 seek to expand the information that a levying authority must include in a prospectus when setting out its plans for levying a BRS. These amendments would require levying authorities to set out in their prospectus how they intend to provide ratepayers with information about their future plans for the BRS. This would give further reassurance to those paying the BRS about how their money is being used. I have talked about the importance of the prospectus. I perfectly understand and agree with the argument that those who contribute to the BRS should be able to see how their money is to be spent. However, the Bill does not need to be amended to address this point. The prospectus already requires levying authorities to  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC319"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC319</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>set out key information about future spending plans and how they intend to spend the BRS money. That requirement goes hand in hand with the requirement for authorities to set out in the prospectus how they intend to inform ratepayers about expenditure incurred and work undertaken on the project. Therefore, we have built in as much transparency and future proofing as possible into these arrangements so that people can see how the money will be raised in the future and how it will be spent. I hope that satisfies the noble Baroness.</p>

This reminds me of my early days in your Lordships' House when I took a guest, who was the chief executive of a record company, into the Chamber and instead of saying, &#147;Ooh, ah, look at the Throne. Where do you sit?&#148;, he said, &#147;It must be very difficult mixing the sound in here&#148;.

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000026"></a>I am not concerned about the flexibility or what is permitted; I was looking to require the prospectus to go wider than we have been discussing, beyond the use of the BRS, but to give information that will help ratepayers to take a view on whether the project is one that they want to support. The issue is not just the use of their own money but&#151;I hate the word &#147;viability&#148;; it is often misused, and I do not think that using it at this point would be absolutely correct&#151;whether the project is realistic and what its future prospects for success are. Maintenance and operation must be a part of that, even if the BRS is being used only to start the project off. If I were a business ratepayer, I would not be enthusiastic about paying for the establishment of a project if I did not have reasonable confidence that it was going to be successful over a fairly long term.</p>

I appreciate that Clause 3(5), which would be amended by the first three amendments in this group, is designed for the particular structure of the Greater London Authority; it refers to the GLA and  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC320"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC320</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to &#147;functional bodies&#148;, the term that is used for the four so-called functional bodies, and it picks up on the mayor&#146;s relationship with London Transport and with London&#146;s regional development agency, the London Development Agency, in particular.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000029"></a>My amendment probes whether it would be appropriate to allow other levying authorities not just to contract with third parties, including their RDAs and private sector commercial organisations, but to make arrangements for, say, the RDA to carry out the work that is in prospect. I have assumed that Clause 3(5) means something more than a fairly normal contract with a third party, because of course third parties are going to be contracted to undertake the work. Does it mean here that the functional body is to be given some discretion by the GLA? If it does not mean that, why is it necessary? To widen the argument to the other authorities, is it not important that they contract with bodies to achieve an outcome, perhaps with discretion as to how to achieve it? I do not see why they cannot be allowed to do that. The implication of Clause 3(5) is that there is some restriction on the other authorities, and, in these days of partnership working, that restriction does not seem appropriate&#151;if my reading of it is right.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000030"></a>I prepared this amendment before I realised that a similar amendment had been moved in the Commons by my honourable friend the Member for North Cornwall, but my reasons are not the ones that he was using; they go rather further.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000031"></a>Amendment 32 would require an explanation in the prospectus of whether there is to be a special purpose vehicle, its governance arrangements and its proposed project management. Again, businesses that think other than fairly superficially about a proposal are going to want to know about governance&#151;a very important point to which the noble Lord, Lord Bates, has tabled an amendment in a later group&#151;because energetic organisations understand the importance of good project management, and this is all about assisting them to assess the project that is put before them. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09051131000032"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09051131000105"></a>Lord Bates:</b> I can be fairly brief as we have established our position on this. We would have great difficulty in supporting an extension beyond the Greater London Authority of levying powers and, therefore, we would not be able to support the first group of amendments. However, if this Bill is to go ahead, Amendment 32 would provide an important safeguard. There ought to be a statement on the governance and management of a project. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, referred to her colleague in another place who moved a similar amendment. He stated that it would be a case of constructing a board comprising people drawn from the local authority, businesses and the community, and particularly those who would be paying the business rate supplement. It seems sensible and appropriate to have them on the board.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000033"></a>I have some experience of this type of arrangement. In the 1990s, my noble friend Lord Heseltine introduced the concept of City Challenge, which was the same idea except that it brought together the public and private sectors willingly to contribute funds towards  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC321"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC321</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the development or regeneration of a given area. As a part of that, City Challenge boards were set up comprising all the various stakeholders. Some of them worked very closely together, which resulted in a load of spin-offs that went way beyond the specific project before them. However, the idea of getting businesses and local authorities around the table talking in the same language and working together is something we would regard as very good practice indeed. We would strongly support any measure that seeks to put that in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09051131000034"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09051131000106"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> Amendments 8 to 10 would allow all levying authorities to pass their BRS revenues on to any other body to spend on the BRS project. Amendment 32 would require a new levying authority to set out in the prospectus the governance structure. Both sets of amendments deal with accountability and openness, as well as with good project management. I know that the noble Baroness understands very well the arrangements that apply in London and underpin Amendments 8 to 10, so I can save at least three pages of speaking notes because I do not need to explain to her how London works. Suffice it to say, in moving swiftly to paragraph 7, that the same arrangements do not apply outside London. The levying authorities are obviously more constrained in how they deliver BRS-funded projects.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000035"></a>The key thing&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Bates, made this point&#151;is that the provisions of the Bill are very much about reflecting local structures. They are not about stifling possibilities for joint working and collaboration. This is, after all, a partnership, and accountability is key. It is obviously essential to have a clear account of how money that is collected from ratepayers for a BRS project is spent, and we have had to make special arrangements in the Bill for the GLA because of the unique way in which the different functions operate in London. Obviously we do not need to make the same provision for local authorities outside the capital.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000036"></a>Joint working in any local authority will depend on what body the levying authority wishes to work with, what the relationship is, whether that body has the capacity to hold funds in its own right and how its existing capabilities can be turned to the advantage of the BRS. We are not inventing anything new; we are simply maximising the possibilities presented by what is already there. Local authorities already have variable powers to enter into partnerships and to spend money on them. That includes providing financial assistance. Nothing is ruled out that I can see, as long as it is set out in the prospectus with a clear account of how the powers, functions and money will be used to secure the objects that everyone has signed up to. That really is a very flexible and pretty robust set of possibilities.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000037"></a>Obviously the key to all this and to credibility will be accountability and people, particularly the business partners, being satisfied that the arrangements are robust. They are going to need to know that, and that will have to be demonstrated to them in a way that is both transparent and credible.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000038"></a>As part of the accounting arrangements, the Bill requires all levying authorities that impose a BRS to keep a specific BRS revenue account for each BRS  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC322"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC322</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that they operate. That will ensure there is a clear means of identifying income and expenditure, and we will certainly make that clear in regulations. We will consult shortly on those regulations, which will set out what we propose for the whole set of accounting arrangements: what must be credited, what must be debited, and so on. Credits will include BRS revenues for the year, and debits will include expenditure on the project.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000039"></a>I hope that that indicates the flexibility we are looking for and that will ensure that the project is constructed with the greatest possible chance of success and will fit in with the local arrangements and partnerships.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000040"></a>Amendment 32 seeks to ensure that levying authorities include in the prospectus information on project management and governance. I entirely agree with what the noble Baroness said about the importance of good project management, because businesses need to have confidence in the way in which the project is managed. They need to be kept informed about the progress that is being made and the costs that are being incurred.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000041"></a>I know that the amendment is probing, but it is overly restrictive and does not reflect the fact that each BRS will be different. Indeed, each BRS might be only a minor part of a much wider funding package. The same aim could be achieved through other more flexible means that would allow levying authorities to tailor the approach to the specific needs of the project and the local community.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09051131000042"></a>Importantly, the BRS prospectus will have to make it clear how those who are paying the supplement can expect to be kept informed about how much revenue has been raised through the BRS and how this money has been spent. Paragraph 11 of the current Schedule 1 requires levying authorities to make it clear in the prospectus how those liable for the supplement will be informed about the expenditure incurred on a BRS project, and about how they will provide updates on the work that has been completed. That will be a very clear indication of progress. Businesses will not be kept in the dark.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000001"></a>The guidance that will accompany the Bill makes clear that it is right&#151;it is fundamental; it is written into the basic assumptions of the White Paper&#151;that businesses must be involved. They will not commit unless they clearly understand the nature and expectations of the project. That must mean that they understand the wider governance of any project.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000002"></a>Local situations are very different, with different funding streams. We must leave it to local discretion how BRS will fit in to and be part of any governance structure. Surely noble Lords will agree that it is better for the accountability and management arrangements to be decided case by case. The levy authorities, in partnership with the key stakeholders, are best placed to decide what approach to governance is appropriate for each project, because they will truly understand their nature and scope. The noble Lord referred to the City Challenge project, which was hugely successful, but there are many different projects with different forms of governance. The New Deal for Communities is a more recent example of such local organisation.  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC323"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC323</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We cannot determine such things centrally; we should not try. I know that noble Lords would not want to be prescriptive.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000003"></a>Transparency is crucial. That is why the Bill requires that the prospectus states how and when money will be spent. Any successful project involving local business will want to consider the skills and talents available, and we would expect all aspects of that to be developed, with local business being the key driver. I am happy to signal that appropriate involvement is vital and that any locally important project must demonstrate the involvement of local stakeholders. I would be very surprised if that was not part of a BRS prospectus. We do not need to lay down a model to be imposed on diverse local circumstances.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000004"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will feel that that answers most of her questions.</p>

<p><a name="09051139000009"></a>This takes us to the issue of ballots and our proposals that there should always be a ballot, not only if the levying authority decides that there should be or if the threshold is reached. I am well aware that the Local Government Association is not seeking an extension of the ballot provisions; indeed, it would prefer there not to be any ballots, as I understood the evidence. It takes the view that whether or not there is a ballot should be up to the local authority. I understand that line of thinking; I thought that the evidence session in the Commons went less into why that was the case than it might have done, which was a pity, but one can understand&#151;and I very much share&#151;the view that local authorities should be autonomous.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000010"></a>The Liberal Democrats have a reputation for defending the local authority position; that is an instinctive reaction, but I hope that it is not a knee-jerk response. It is because we see local authorities as very close to their communities and carrying out an important representative role, but the concern that underlies all that is concern for the people whom they represent. I want to explain why I am taking what may appear to be an anti-local-authority line. It is not&#151;that is not where I am coming from.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000011"></a>I do not suggest that a ballot should replace good, thorough and effective consultation, which is fundamental to the business rate supplement proposal working well. However, because there is no business vote, although I am not arguing for that, we need to be careful to give business the fullest opportunity to make its views known.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000012"></a>I realised, but only this morning, that I had made a bad error in the drafting of these amendments, which I found myself dealing with at some speed just before they were put down, and I hope that both the Minister and the Official Opposition&#146;s officers received a message that no one should spend hours honing their arguments about why there should not be a ballot on Crossrail. I should have accepted Crossrail. The term &#147;unique&#148; really does apply to it&#151;an overworked term, but in this case used correctly. I do not seek to argue for a ballot in this case. Crossrail is different; it has been debated for many years and in great detail.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000013"></a>The Minister, John Healey, has said more than once in the Commons that it would not be right for business to have a veto when the funding for any given project is also coming from other sources. I seek not a veto over a project but a veto over the BRS element of the project&#146;s funding. It is important to have a ballot for any project. The Bill provides a threshold, and if it is considered necessary for business to have&#151;I will use the same terminology&#151;a veto when its contribution is over the one-third threshold, why is it not necessary to have a ballot for any contribution? I do not see that the proportions make for a separate argument.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000014"></a>Most of these amendments were drafted by the Federation of Small Businesses and arrived at a very timely point when I realised that I was in danger of not managing to draft amendments on ballots by the deadline. It says that there is a danger of an authority deliberately or carelessly underestimating the BRS proportion in order to avoid a ballot. I acknowledge its concern but I do not share it. Local authorities may do their best to ensure good relations with businesses  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC325"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC325</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in their area but the national non-domestic rate&#151;I stress &#147;national&#148;&#151;is a national rate. It is harder to consult effectively and there is inevitably a degree of cynicism about consultation when the body collecting is not the body setting. We need good consultation and the ballot.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000015"></a>I return to my point about whether it is necessary to have a ballot if the threshold is reached. The draft guidance, which I looked at this morning, seems to ignore the discretion of local authorities to hold a ballot whatever the proportion. That again makes me wonder about the Government&#146;s mindset in arriving at their decision on this. This is an immensely important point, as I said. It is not anti-local-authority but pro-ratepayers. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09051139000016"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051139000068"></a>Lord Bates:</b> I wish to speak to Amendments 14, 35 and 37 standing in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Cathcart. I do not think that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, is the only person who has struggled to capture the essence of this matter vis- -vis all the amendments in this group. She generously acknowledged that there might not be coherence with regard to all the amendments in the group. I am instructed that we should make a similar apology. I am deeply conscious that often our speeches would not make sense without the aid of the wonderful people who burn the midnight oil, undertake research and draft amendments for us. Having failed to acknowledge their existence when the amendments that they have drafted go swimmingly well, I do not want to draw attention to them only when things go wrong. I thank them for all their work and support.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000017"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said, this matter goes very much to the heart of the issue. A mandatory ballot is one of the two or three central issues that we need to debate. The Minister said earlier that it was important to consult the business community and that she had met the British Retail Consortium, the Federation of Small Businesses, the CBI and the British Chambers of Commerce. I cannot remember exactly what subject was being discussed but she mentioned that there did not appear to be an appetite for the proposed measure.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000018"></a>This is entirely different. One might dare to say that every one of those organisations is militantly in favour of having a vote on this key issue, which is particularly the case at the present time of financial hardship, economic downturn and recession. After all, it would be strange&#151;would it not?&#151;to have a situation where a business rate or a project was proposed with the explicit objective of economic development, regeneration and growth, and not to consult or for it to be done against the wishes of the people who were generating that economic development and growth. It would be an own goal of spectacular proportions, perhaps equalled only by the ports tax, about which we have talked on other occasions. This is a non sequitur.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000019"></a>Clearly, if there is a powerful, strong, persuasive case for how this project will result in economic regeneration in a given area and increased economic output, the businesses whose livelihoods, profits and salaries are dependent on such economic development should be at the front of the queue in endorsing it. If  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC326"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC326</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they are not, that raises serious questions about whether this really is additional and about economic regeneration. Those points need to be on the record.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000020"></a>At the moment, the ballot, as it is configured, is directed to those who may be liable to pay the rates and would have a rateable value in excess of &#163;50,000. Sometimes we let these things trip off the tongue, but a &#163;50,000 rateable value is a decent-sized business. I certainly would be happy to run a business with a &#163;50,000 rateable value. It suggests that you probably have 3,500 square feet to 4,500 square feet of office space, which is probably enough for 35 to 40 members of staff, unless it is the House of Lords where it would be enough room for 300 to 400 Members. But it is a pretty substantial place.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000021"></a>When it is measured against rateable value, those principally affected are not necessarily offices. It will be retail premises because they obviously need to have the store facilities. I believe that relatively small numbers of businesses fall into that category. In the briefing from the Mayor of London&#146;s office, the Greater London Authority produced a helpful map&#151;although I do not want to raise the issue of the map again. There is one here, but I am sure that the GLA had longer to produce it than the worthy people in the Minister&#146;s department. However, it points out how many authorities have 20 or more businesses with a rateable value of more than &#163;50,000. <I>Hansard</I><I></I>is still based in the written age, and we cannot show pictures&#151;although it is worth <I>Hansard </I>considering having pictures every now and again. Dare we say that? Is that utterly radical? That really will get me into trouble. If a map were available, it could be useful in this regard because it would show vast elements of wide spaces all over London which do not have between 0 and 50 businesses with rateable values of more than &#163;50,000. That certainly applies further out of London, where rateable values obviously fall. Because the cost of property falls, as does rent, there will be far less incidence of businesses with rateable values at that level.</p>
<h5><a name="09051139000061"></a>7 pm</h5>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000022"></a>My point with regard to the whole section on rateable values and the size of business that is involved is that it should not be too difficult for the local authority, if it wants to regenerate an area, to talk to businesses of this size on a routine basis. It ought to be engaging with them; clearly it is going to be a major employer. Ninety-six per cent of businesses, or whatever the number is, so the Federation of Small Businesses tells us, have fewer than 10 employees. Clearly, then, a business with 20, 30 or 50 employees is a significant business in the area and should be involved in decision-making.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000023"></a>We talked before about the White Paper having the problem of additionality. If you want the ultimate test of additionality, put it to a ballot. The ballot is the ultimate test. If an initiative ticks all the boxes, is truly additional and is genuinely for economic development, you will have no problem in persuading people to sign up to it. If it is not, however, if it is just a shuffling of the deckchairs, if it is just a pet project of one of the local government officers, you will not get people to do that.</p>

<p><a name="09051139000024"></a>We now have this farcical situation where the Bill says that the levying authority might decide, even if the contribution is not over one-third, to offer a ballot. It is only ever going to offer a ballot on the projects where it thinks it will get strong approval. This amendment would ensure that all projects under the business rate supplement would have that approval. With a stroke of a pen, that would assuage a great deal of concern from many business organisations. It would be good practice and would force local authorities into good discussion and dialogue with businesses. It would follow and mirror a type of arrangement that has worked well in business improvement districts and so on, and it ought to be supported.</p>

<p><a name="09051139000025"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051139000069"></a>Earl Cathcart:</b> The whole ethos of the Bill is to try to take the business community with the schemes and to try to build on the relationships between business and local authorities. It is all about building on what are hopefully the existing good relationships between those two. I am afraid that, like other noble Lords who have spoken to these amendments, I cannot divorce the consultancy process from the voting process; they are tied together.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000026"></a>The Minister in the other place, John Healey, said at Second Reading that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051139000059"></a>&#147;there will be compulsory consultation&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 12/1/09; col. 44.]</ul>
<p><a name="09051139000054"></a>That sounds very punchy but compulsory consultation, although welcome, can be ignored. I can give two examples where that has happened. The first was when Ken Livingstone tried to extend the congestion charge. He jumped through all the right hoops, including consultation, but business and residents did not want the extension imposed on them. That opposition was ignored. The other was another thorny issue: the consultation on the third runway at Heathrow. There was a lot of opposition to that, but it was ignored.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000027"></a>I am not making any particular points about those issues. My point is that consultation alone is a very thorny issue and does not necessarily lead to satisfaction. If, as my noble friend has said, a scheme really is so good for business, they will vote for it. Why would they not if it is going to be so good?</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000028"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, put the position of the Local Government Association, and I am afraid that I do not agree with it. It would say that, wouldn&#146;t it? That was bound to be its position. It does not want any opposition to its schemes, so it does not want anyone to vote on them. We have the bid scheme. Bid scheme approval requires a majority of liable taxpayers so that the aggregate of rateable values voting in favour must exceed those voting against. That scheme seems to work extremely well, so why cannot we have a similar system of mandatory voting for this all the way through? I cannot understand why the Government are so reluctant about this.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000029"></a>Another point is that you get voting only when the contribution from business is 33 per cent of the scheme. There is the possibility that local government will massage the figures. If a local authority wants to raise &#163;300,000 from business through a BRS, provided that its estimates for the total cost are more than &#163;900,000,  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC328"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC328</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it will not have to have a vote. It can then force its project through without one; it can make the estimates greater so that it does not have to reach the threshold of a third. I have talked before about what happens when the actual cost is lower than the local authority&#146;s original estimate and about the ability to massage the figures. The noble Baroness gave me an answer, and I hope that it would not massage the figures, but there is a danger that it might.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000030"></a>I am afraid that I have to go back to the question of consultation, because consultation is vital if these schemes are to be effective. Consultation can work in two ways. The local authority can come up with a scheme and consult on it. I gave the example of Norfolk and the dualling of the A11, which many areas in Norfolk do not think will benefit them at all. I mentioned King&#146;s Lynn. There are lots of down-market King&#146;s Lynns, such as Swaffham, Dereham, Fakenham, Wells-next-the-Sea and Cromer. Lots of places might feel that they just do not benefit from a scheme. It will help the economy in south Norfolk, but not the other areas. Despite opposition from the areas that it does not help, Norfolk might say, &#147;We are going ahead with the scheme anyway&#148;. That is one form of consultation.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000031"></a>The other form of consultation is asking the businesses in Norfolk what scheme they would like and what would help them, rather than imposing a scheme on them. I hope that there would be something in guidance along those lines. They might want an incinerator because all the waste that they produce is put into landfill and the cost is becoming prohibitive, and an incinerator might get rid of a lot of cost and they are willing to help to pay for it. Consultation could work both ways. Why not have a vote because this is a scheme that businesses really want? I cannot understand why the Government are so reluctant to give a vote.</p>

<p><a name="09051139000032"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09051139000070"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> Noble Lords opposite should not apologise for the incoherence of their amendments because the argument just made is very coherent and the debate has been clearly set out. The noble Lord, Lord Bates, was doing very well until he got to the end and said that if we had a ballot to assuage local concerns, it would force local authorities to take note of the views of business. However, it would not assuage concerns for the very reasons described by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. She said that traditionally the Liberals always support local government because there are two partners to the contract, and they need not be as opposite one another as the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, suggests. We are trying to get the balance right between local authorities which, reasonably enough, do not want any form of ballot, and businesses that want to have their say. Those are both perfectly respectable points of view. We have ended up in a position which not only creates trust between the parties&#151;I shall come on to explain why I think that is true&#151;but is also an effective way of tying people into a project in an honourable and sustainable way.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000033"></a>Amendments 13 to 17 would require that a ballot is held before any BRS is levied, and the remaining amendments are essentially consequential. I agree absolutely with the conclusion of the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, that it would be a good idea if local authorities were to ask businesses what is in their interest and  


<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC329"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC329</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what would really help. That is exactly where we hope local authorities will start. This is about economic development, prosperity and greater productivity&#151;all the things we talked about when considering the first amendment. Local authorities will be bound to ask local businesses what is in it for them if they are to come on board as partners, agree to the initial financial commitment and make contributions. Of course the question that must be asked before any other is this: what is going to be the most effective project from your point of view? The notion of consultation is absolutely fundamental to the purpose and the principle of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000034"></a>We have made it absolutely clear that there is no way that a BRS can be foisted on businesses because that simply will not work. There has to be early, proper and thorough consultation, and certainly the statutory guidance will make it clear that levying authorities should consider how they can involve businesses over and above anything described as a formal consultation. However, the issue of a ballot raises significant concerns, and I understand why noble Lords opposite have been lobbied by businesses about it.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000035"></a>Perhaps I may go over the narrative a little. At Second Reading we discussed the fact that it is likely that the BRS would often form part of a wider funding package, marking a crucial link to bring business partnership with it. For example, it could help to pay for a large infrastructure project such as a new or improved transport link. Such a project would bring with it funding streams from bodies such as the Department for Transport, the Highways Agency, and Section 103 agreements as well as BRS funding. Under those circumstances, I would ask noble Lords to think about whether it would be right, democratic or fair that an entire project of some significance that was being marshalled by a balance of partners should be put in jeopardy due to uncertainty over a relatively small but critical element of a funding package. I would argue that it unbalances the partnership and introduces an avoidable degree of uncertainty. It is not worth taking that risk if the BRS is contributing only to a relatively small proportion of the overall funding package, which is one that would genuinely help business because it will be the test to be applied.</p>
<h5><a name="09051139000062"></a>7.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000036"></a>I do not agree that proportion does not count. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked me why the proportion is so important and why we should not do this as a matter of principle and not require a ballot. However, we believe that we have arrived at a fair point. The Bill requires authorities to hold a ballot only if the supplement will fund more than one-third of the total cost of the project. I repeat, one-third&#151;not a half or two-thirds&#151;which is a proper and defensible threshold. The threshold for determining when a ballot must be held represents a judgment between those cases where a BRS can be seen as contributing a relatively large proportion towards the cost of the project and, therefore, have a right to ensure that all members have a say. I will come to the means of voting in a moment. That is as opposed to a situation where the BRS is a smaller player in terms of the overall funding of a project.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC330"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC330</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000037"></a>The policy on ballots was set out in the White Paper, which followed extensive discussions with business and others on how any supplement would best work. Since noble Lords have taken up the case, it is worth putting on the record&#151;the noble Baroness was quite right to say that it is not in the guidance&#151;that the Bill does not prevent levying authorities from holding a ballot if they consider it to be appropriate. The noble Lord, Lord Bates, was uncharacteristically cynical about this in saying that a ballot would be held only if it was going to be approved. I would argue that, if a supplement was opposed by a particularly vocal minority, it might be a very good idea for a local authority to hold a ballot. It would be a mechanism for ensuring that all those who are liable for the supplement are able to have their say. It would tie people into the project. But we would not disagree among ourselves that the key point is that this must be left to local discretion, so that the levying authority can consider if it is appropriate on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000038"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, and the noble Lord, Lord Bates, raised the white spaces problem in London and the arrangements within BIDs for voting. We have tried to address that in exactly the same way as the BIDs arrangement works. It is the same formula because it is fair. Much of the process in this Bill to do with BRS is modelled on how BIDs work successfully. It is worth restating therefore how we intend the ballot to work fairly so that certain businesses in certain parts of the capital or wherever will not be burdened unduly. It is described as a &#147;double lock&#148; ballot, which means that its success is not determined only by winning a majority in terms of the number of votes cast, as there also needs to be a majority in terms of rateable value. For example, let us take a ballot where 100 businesses with a combined rateable value of &#163;10 million are balloted and 80 of the 100 businesses vote in favour, but where those that voted in favour tended to occupy premises with lower rateable values. Therefore, the combined rateable value of those which voted in favour was &#163;4.5 million, which would be less than 50 per cent of the total rateable value of all those which voted. In such cases, the BRS would not go ahead because the 50 per cent had not been achieved on both criteria. That is exactly how BIDs operate.</p>

<p><a name="09051139000039"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09051139000071"></a>Earl Cathcart:</b> Perhaps the noble Baroness could educate me. Does the BIDs scheme involve voting on all BIDs or just on those over a certain threshold?</p>

<p><a name="09051139000040"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09051139000072"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I will have to take advice on that. The answer is yes, it will be all businesses. I hope that the noble Earl is helped by that explanation.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000041"></a>Amendment 46 would require that the ballot is held if any variation is made to a BRS. My case about uncertainty applies to this as well. Projects already under way could be put in jeopardy simply because of a relatively minor change. I understand the noble Lord&#146;s concern that the BRS should not be subject to undue changes without adequate consultation of those liable for the supplement. Clause 10 already makes provision that if the variation in the project would increase the BRS contribution towards a project to more than one-third a ballot would be required, as is the case with new projects. Again, we have covered that point in the interests of fairness.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC331"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column GC331</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000042"></a>There is another possibility. The levying authority might want to vary the supplement, but the change would not result in the BRS contributing more than one-third towards the cost of the project. If that change was not highlighted in the prospectus as a possibility, the authority would be required to consult, which would involve publishing a document that set out the proposed variation, mirroring the prospectus required before a supplement could be levied. If the variation would increase the number of persons liable to the BRS, there must be consultation, whatever the original prospectus says. We have underpinned that arrangement for consultation.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000043"></a>In the Bill, we have tried to set a minimum standard for the consultation and balloting needed before a supplement can be changed. Any decision to carry out a ballot over and above that requirement should be left to the discretion of the levying authority. Amendment 15 potentially goes further than requiring a ballot in all cases. It would also extend who was eligible to vote in a ballot to those whom the authority was required to consult. This would mean that in addition to those who were liable for the supplement, lower/upper authorities and other persons the authority thought appropriate would be eligible to vote.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000044"></a>I agree that the views of the wider community need to be considered, and I think we would see local authorities consulting their communities as a matter of course, in the way that they do already. Given the duty to involve, that is even more likely now. However, giving the same weight to the views of those who would not be liable for the supplement as those who would have to pay could undermine both the fairness principle and the fundamental principle that BRS is a new tool.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000045"></a>I conclude by citing the LGA during the Public Bill Committee. It picked up on the fundamental point that every noble Lord who has spoken has made. It stated in evidence:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051139000057"></a>&#147;The guarantee to local businesses that this power will not be abused is the guarantee that we are accountable to local communities. We have a direct interest in ensuring that local economies are maintained and sustained ... No authority will make a decision that has a detrimental effect on its local business community&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Business Rate Supplements Bill Committee, 20/1/09; cols 65-75.]</p>

<p><a name="09051139000055"></a>That is a straightforward and positive statement from the LGA, and I hope noble Lords will accept that.</p>

<p><a name="09051139000046"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09051139000073"></a>Earl Cathcart:</b> There is one thing. I asked about the idea of manipulating the cost estimate so that a vote would have to be held. I do not want to press the Minister now, but on an earlier amendment she was looking at the whole business of costs being wrong, and I wondered whether at the same time she might want to deal with that.</p>

The prospectus will have to be tested against outcomes, criteria and hard questions of project management. The funding elements of that will have to be specific and evidenced. With the best will in the world, projects change&#151;there might be cost overruns, for example&#151;and the reason why we say that the prospectus has to spell out how underspends or overspends will be dealt with is precisely that that discipline must be there for the partners to be able to deal with such an situation.</p>

<p><a name="09051139000048"></a><b><a name="90511-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051139000075"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I like the idea of <I>Hansard</I> having illustrations, but let us not go as far as cartoons.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000049"></a>On the Minister&#146;s last point, where she quoted the LGA, I still have difficulty in applying the points that it makes to the question of under and over one-third. The arguments are yes or no, rather than centring on that one-third contribution. The proposal to have a ballot is not a matter of not having confidence in a local authority&#146;s judgment about what is good for its area; it is about the businesses that are being asked to pay. The other partners can veto by refusing to contribute because they are not multiple in the same way as businesses are. A local authority can come to a perfectly honest view about what is best, and ratepayers may disagree. That is where we differ.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000050"></a>The consultation allows for nuanced responses. The prospectus should reflect the consultation. The consultation is not an end in itself; it almost certainly ought to lead to variations in the draft prospectus. It is unlikely that the latter will be perfect initially. The consultation has a role to play in developing the prospectus. The consultation is not a referendum. I probably depart from the noble Earl on this because I do not see it as an alternative to a ballot but as complementary to it. One should not consult on something that one is not prepared to do. Consultation has a much wider role. Local authorities should hold a debate with local businesses, but that is not the same as giving them a menu of things to choose from. I do not see that working.</p>

<a name="90511-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051139000051"></a>I hope that I am not being unfair, but I believe that the Minister&#146;s argument can be summarised as the Government&#146;s proposals striking a balance between the two arguments. I fear that the proposals actually satisfy neither of those engaged in this argument. I am certain that we will return to this on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="09051110000003"></a><b><a name="90511-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09051110000040"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09051110000004"></a>Joint Warrior is a biannual tri-service major exercise with invited NATO and allied nations and usually takes place over a two-week period in the spring and autumn.  Its aim is to provide high-quality joint collective training and pre-deployment training in a multithreat environment for participating units and their staffs.  Each unit will operate from various bases in the UK and abroad but specifically there is an increase in air and land activity across Wales, Scotland and the border regions of England, as well as an increase in maritime activity in the north and west of Scotland.</p>

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09051110000005"></a>These exercises have now become routine and I therefore wish to update the House that, with immediate effect, it is my intention to write only to individual Members who have raised specific concerns.  I have also written to the First Ministers for Scotland and Wales to advise them of this decision.</p>

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09051110000006"></a>Joint Warrior is a complex exercise which requires careful planning and co-ordination to minimise the possibility of environmental damage.  I would like to reassure the House that, in order to achieve this, the exercise planning teams will continue to work closely with local authorities, various national rural agencies, landowners and other interested parties.</p>

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09051110000007"></a>Collective training is a key priority for defence.  It is a vital component of the UK Armed Forces&#146; ability to generate forces at the right time, with the right skills and in the right numbers and Joint Warrior has the additional benefit of giving UK forces the ability to train and operate with other coalition countries.  The next exercise, Joint Warrior 091, commences on 11 May 2009 and a press release will be issued for public information.</p>

<a name="09051110000010"></a><b><a name="90511-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="09051110000042"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (Lord Drayson):</b> An informal meeting of EU Research Ministers took place in Prague on 4 May. The two main topics for discussion were links between higher education, research and innovation policies and the mobility and career development of researchers. Professor Adrian Smith, director-general for science and research in DIUS represented the UK.</p>

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09051110000011"></a>The meeting began with a session on the knowledge triangle (a concept referring to the links between higher education, innovation and research policies as being central to the creation of a strong knowledge-based economy). There were presentations from the vice-chair of the Czech Research Council and from three organisations representing major investors in R&amp;D from the three sides of the knowledge triangle: EUROHORCs (the heads of national research councils in Europe), the European University Association (EUA) and BusinessEurope.</p>

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09051110000012"></a>This was followed by a discussion focusing on relevant initiatives being implemented in member states and at European level. The UK stressed the need to address the culture of university-business relations alongside looking at the structures designed to forge links between these two groups and noted action taken in the UK to this effect.</p>

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09051110000013"></a>The second session, on developing human resources for research, examined a paper circulated by the Portuguese and Luxembourg Ministers setting out the conditions required to make Europe a more attractive place for researchers to work. The UK referred to the importance of national action plans on researcher careers and mobility currently being developed in member states and the need to respect national competence which applied in key areas. It was also important to examine the specific needs of mobile researchers in the wider context of mobile workers as a whole and to maximise the use of existing European consultative groups in taking this agenda forward.</p>

<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS75"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column WS75</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09051110000015"></a>The Education, Youth and Culture Council will be held on 11 and 12 May in Brussels. Andy Lebrecht, UK Deputy Permanent Representative, will be representing the UK on 12 May when culture and audiovisual issues will be taken.</p>

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09051110000016"></a>The first item on the agenda concerns the council conclusions on culture as a catalyst for creativity and innovation. The conclusions successfully draw the link between culture and the Lisbon objectives and reflect the role of creativity in responding to the economic crisis. This year also celebrates the European Year of Creativity and innovation. I intend to support the adoption of these conclusions.</p>

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09051110000017"></a>The council will be invited to adopt a decision on the selection of two member states with a view to the nomination by the council of two experts in the selection panel for the European Capital of Culture Community action 2010-12. The presidency will also seek the adoption of decisions on the selection of cities to host the European Capital of Culture events for 2012 and 2013. Portugal and Slovenia are the EU member states nominating cities for 2012 and have put forward Guimares and Maribor respectively. France and Slovakia are nominating cities for 2013 and have put forward Marseille and Koice respectively. I intend to support each of these proposals.</p>

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09051110000018"></a>There will then be a discussion of a presidency paper on creative content online. The paper asks a series of questions around the prevention of intellectual property theft and the need to promote media literacy: what steps have member states taken to help develop legal offers and tackle the problems of piracy? How effective have these steps been and are there any lessons that can be learnt from the experience gained? In particular: (i) how far is it possible to take government action without risking the creation of new obstacles to the development of new innovative services; and (ii) how far is it possible to develop solutions which promote greater variety and better accessibility of legal offer while protecting the interests of rightholders? On media literacy, the presidency asks: how can member states achieve greater awareness on the importance of media literacy, and where do they see added value in possible initiatives at EU level? Our contribution to the exchange of views will outline current UK actions where we think that these are relevant to other member states and the Commission.</p>

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09051110000019"></a>Under any other business, the presidency will provide information on the state of play of the Commission proposal establishing MEDIA Mundus, an audiovisual co-operation programme with professionals from third countries. The programme has a budget of &#8364;15 million and will run for a three-year period from 2011. The aims of the programme include increasing information exchange, competitiveness and transnational distribution worldwide. It also aims to improve circulation and exposure of audiovisual works, increasing public demand for culturally diverse audiovisual content. The presidency will present a paper outlining the current status of this proposal and will invite discussion and comments from member states. The UK is supportive of the principle of this programme and I do not foresee the need to intervene on this item.</p>

There will be an information point on the Work Plan for Culture 2008-10. There will also be an information point from the Greek delegation on the inauguration of the New Acropolis Museum.

<notus-date day="11" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS77"></a><b>11 May 2009 : Column WS77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09051110000026"></a>Since that time the economic downturn has had a significant impact on regeneration activity. This is having an impact not just on physical developments but also on the lives of people living across the country through jobs and homes that have been lost and the strain that that places on communities.</p>

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09051110000027"></a>This document responds to these challenges and sets out a strategic framework for regeneration, supported by measures to target investment; deliver increased flexibility for front-line agencies; and provide clear leadership&#151;setting out a vision of the outcomes we expect regeneration to deliver now and in the future.</p>

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09051110000028"></a>The framework aims to ensure that regeneration investment is:</p>
 more tightly focused on<b></b>economic outcomes and worklessness; driven at the right spatial level&#151;and as close to communities as is practicable, making the most of opportunities that already exist; andtargeted&#151;not trying to transform everywhere&#151;but investing where it will have most impact by supporting those communities where the most severe poverty and worklessness persist and where there is the opportunity to deliver long-term change.
<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="09051110000029"></a>The framework sets out three success measures, against which all regeneration should be judged in future. These are:</p>
 improving economic performance, particularly in the most deprived areas;creating the right conditions for business growth though improved infrastructure, and use of land and a better public realm; andcreating places where people want to live and can work and businesses want to invest.
<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09051110000033"></a>In the <I>Youth Crime Action Plan</I> published in July last year, we said that we wanted to encourage the foundation of more safer school partnerships (SSPs), so that they become the norm rather than the exception.

Taking early action to ensure pupil safety and to prevent young people from being drawn into crime or anti-social behaviour is important for all pupils and for all schools.

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09051110000036"></a>The Government firmly believe that the blacklisting of trade unionists has no place in a modern system of employment relations. Individuals should not be systematically and secretly victimised for their trade union membership and for engaging in the activities of a trade union.</p>

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09051110000037"></a>Section 3 of the Employment Relations Act 1999 contains a power for the Secretary of State to introduce regulations prohibiting the compilation, dissemination and use of lists of trade union members or activists which are drawn up with the purpose of discrimination in relation to their recruitment and treatment by employers or employment agencies.</p>

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09051110000038"></a>We consulted on draft regulations in 2003 but they were not implemented. We took that decision because it was then widely believed that blacklisting of this type had been eradicated in the UK. Following the investigation of the Information Commissioner into the affairs of the Consulting Association (TCA), renewed evidence has come to light. The investigation showed that, within the construction industry, a covert vetting system has operated. My officials have worked closely with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) during its investigation and they have examined the detailed information which the ICO seized from TCA. We have discovered that much of the information held by TCA concerned the trade union activities of individuals and gave a very unfavourable account of their suitability for employment.</p>

<a name="90511-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09051110000039"></a>In the light of these developments, the Government are minded to introduce regulations under Section 3 of the 1999 Act. To ensure we have drafted them correctly and taken account of subsequent developments, BERR will launch a short public consultation early this summer seeking views on revised regulations. We will then seek parliamentary approval of the final draft regulations this autumn, bringing them into effect at the earliest opportunity thereafter. This abuse needs to be addressed as a matter of priority and our aim is to ensure that suitably drafted regulations are implemented with the minimum of delay.</p>

By making this investment, CDC is making a contribution to the achievement of the UK's broader poverty reduction objectives: increased private investment (as through entities such as Travant) is vital to generate the sustainable enterprises, jobs, incomes and taxes that lift people out of poverty and away from aid dependency.</p>
