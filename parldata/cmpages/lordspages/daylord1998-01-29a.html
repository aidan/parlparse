<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80129-01_para0"></a>Whether they will lay before Parliament additional papers on the implications of NATO enlargement for the alliance and for British defence policy to accompany ratification of the enlargement treaty.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80129-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hoyle: </B>   My Lords, I have placed in the Library the communique issued by NATO Defence Ministers on 2nd December. That included the conclusions of NATO's classified assessment of the military and financial implications of enlargement. We have also provided further information to the Defence Select Committee in another place to assist its ongoing inquiry into NATO enlargement. We will make further information available as and when we can.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. However, will he accept that it is not a great encouragement to major public debate? Will he further accept that NATO is central to British defence and that enlargement of NATO--thus the transformation of NATO--means the transformation of the context of British defence? Does he agree that a debate about NATO enlargement appears to be under way almost entirely within the United States, and that we ought to have a parallel debate here?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hoyle: </B>   My Lords, I accept that NATO is central to many matters relating to this country. We are committed to making as much information available as soon as we can. As I think the noble Lord will agree, the amount that we can say is limited by the fact that much information is classified on security grounds. After the Defence Committee has considered the information that was classified, it will be up to the committee to publish the evidence given to it by the Government and others. Over and above that--there will be a full debate both in this House and in another place before UK ratification occurs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Lauderdale: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that we are in danger of becoming entangled in a whole host, a criss-cross, of conflicting claims and counter-claims of a territorial kind in eastern Europe--first against Romania by Hungary, by Bulgaria and so on, over and over again?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hoyle: </B>   My Lords, I realise what the noble Earl is saying. That is one of the reasons why, by unanimous agreement, only three countries were included in the <P>


<a name="column_322"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 322</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>first case. Romania and Slovenia were considered as candidates. The best position was that those countries must be absorbed. I believe that the noble Earl and the whole House will agree that, since NATO is essential to our defence, we must see that it is not made less secure by the absorption of other members. There is a limit to what we can do. That is the position until 1999. In future enlargement no candidate is ruled out at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the case itself for the enlargement of NATO is not widely accepted? Perhaps he can assure the House that we are able to discuss the detail of the subject, about which there is considerable difference of opinion among all parties.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hoyle: </B>   Yes, my Lords, I agree that it is a matter for discussion. At the end of the day there will be a full debate in this House before ratification; indeed, each country will ratify in its own way and debates will take place. There will be an opportunity for all Members to express a view before ratification occurs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that he has answered the Question in the form in which it was put on the Order Paper? What more can be done? Is that not a matter for congratulation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Bridges: </B>   My Lords, has the Minister studied the debate which occurred during the last Session of Parliament on a Motion by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, about the ratification of treaties under the Ponsonby rule? It led to some informed discussions between the noble Lord and the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker of Wallasey. My understanding is that the previous government had it in mind that in future foreign treaties should be submitted to the House with an explanatory memorandum, as happens with European legislation. Would that not be a good precedent to follow on this occasion?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Hoyle: </B>   My Lords, I am indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Bridges. As much information as possible will be given. The House will agree, I am sure, that we cannot give information that is militarily sensitive on troop movements. But this Government are wedded to open government and will make as much information as possible available.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Kennet: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may echo the good wishes expressed from the Benches opposite for the fact that there is now a commitment to have a full debate in this House on the matter while it is still alive. Is my noble friend in a position to tell us when that is likely to be? Must it await the conclusion of the study by the Defence Committee of the House of Commons, or could it be before that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Hoyle: </B>   My Lords, we are not in a position to say when the debate will be. We know that ratification <P>


<a name="column_323"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 323</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will be complete by April 1999. The debate will take place as soon as possible but I am not able to give my noble friend any date at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, in consideration of the problems associated with NATO enlargement, can the Minister state that the Government will give an absolute assurance that the costs will be taken into account in the strategic defence review?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Hoyle: </B>   My Lords, NATO's initial assessment is that the cost of enlargement will amount to 1.5 billion dollars over the next 10 years. That confirms our assessment that the cost of enlargement will be manageable. The MoD's share of costs to date is 110 million dollars over the same 10 years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew15"></A><B> The Earl of Carlisle: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister inform the House which of the former Warsaw Pact nations--and I include the Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania--have opted for the United Kingdom model to train and equip their armed forces? What encouragement will Her Majesty's Government give those nations through the supply of military training teams so that they can meet the criteria which NATO will set before they are allowed to join NATO?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Hoyle: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the noble Lord should put down a Question on the matter. The new members have already put forward significant programmes of modernisation and restructuring. NATO's assessment of those countries' forces has at the moment produced no nasty shocks. Indeed, they are in far better condition than we expected and the whole of NATO, including ourselves, will give every assistance we possibly can.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Dormand of Easington </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80129-01_para1"></a>Whether they accept the findings of the TUC report Wider Still and Wider that average highest paid director salary has increased by 53 per cent. for the period 1994-97 and average employee pay by 13 per cent. and, if so, whether the exhortation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer is sufficient to restrain such increases.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80129-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Clinton-Davis): </B>  My Lords, the TUC report highlights the need for directors to ensure both that their remuneration is justified by performance and that they are setting an example of restraint. The Hampel report on corporate governance, which was published yesterday, supports the view that directors' remuneration is liable to have an impact both on the company's reputation and on morale within the company. My right <P>


<a name="column_324"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 324</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>honourable friend the President of the Board of Trade has said that she will give her considered response to the report in the spring.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Dormand of Easington: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that most interesting answer. Is he aware that obscene increases continue to be given to chairmen of companies, chief executives and directors? Does he agree, therefore, that the pleas and exhortations which have been made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and others are not achieving their purpose? In those circumstances, what thought is being given by the Government to the problem?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend has drawn attention to one aspect of corporate governance which is important. I have already indicated that excessive pay can impact on the company's reputation and on morale within the company. Those are two important components of corporate governance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-01_para2"></a>My right honourable friend will consider the element to which my noble friend drew attention, and all the aspects that have been set out in the Hampel report. Of course, included in her considerations will be the observations made by the TUC.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-01_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, do the Government have any intention of bringing in statutory regulation of wage and salary movements? If not, is it still the case that the responsibility of directors is to act within the law and in the best interests of their shareholders, rather than in response to the exhortations of passing politicians?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980129/text/80129-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, I know that the noble Lord was a politician, but I do not know what exhortations he made, although I heard him from time to time. Of course we have no intention of introducing a statutory regulation on wages. What is important is that we should have an objective and sensible debate on the whole question of corporate governance. It will take place, I am sure, in the foreseeable future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, in order to understand what the Government mean by "being paid excessively", does the noble Lord regard that as applying, for example, to the chairman of a public company who is paid &#163;200,000 when over the trading period the company loses, let us say, &#163;12 million and subsequently goes into receivership? Would that prove to the Government, in their assumption about what is fair or unfair, that the director's salary was at the expense of the shareholders and the workforce?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, what an extraordinary question. It is based on one hypothesis after another--I believe there were four, but I shall check that tomorrow in Hansard. I shall not go into that range of supposition and speculation which engaged the noble Baroness so eloquently.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister prepared to indicate in what way, when we see the Green Paper on Hampel and company law reform, the Government will <P>


<a name="column_325"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 325</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reconcile their overall support for the Hampel report, as indicated yesterday, with their determination to legislate for another method as set out in their manifesto?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, again I indicated that all relevant considerations will be taken into account by my right honourable friend in the assessment of the position. She will make her Statement in the spring. I cannot give a specific date at the present time but I am sure that it will be reconciled with whatever it has to be reconciled with.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that the average increase of 13 per cent. for employees is in itself satisfactory when viewed against the rate of inflation for the period? Without going into too many hypotheses, does he accept that a number of employees might not have achieved that satisfactory rate of increase had not their highest paid director received an increase of something of the order of magnitude set out on the Order Paper?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, it is not easy to follow the correlation in the noble Lord's question. What is important is that there has been a tremendous gulf over the course of many years in the pay of employees and directors. That is a relevant consideration and will be taken into account. I shall not say anything more because I do not want to pre-empt my right honourable friend's assessment of the position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, surely there is ample evidence that there is no correlation between excessively high pay and performance. We can take that from the period of the last 18 years of Conservative government when the rich got richer but the country as a whole sank in the league tables of world wealth.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, there is something in that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Annan: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord rightly said that the Government have no intention of introducing statutory regulations about increases in directors' pay. However, does he not feel that, when something scandalous has taken place, the time has come for the Government to consider how to express some mark of contempt? I say that because, when the noble Lord, Lord Marsh, says that this is a matter about which the shareholders should express their disapprobation, we all know that in the majority of cases the shareholders are the institutions, who are bandits in the same game.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, there is something in that too.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   My Lords, does not the Minister feel that the remuneration of the legal profession and other professions should be taken into account along with that of directors?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, I had a vested interest in that matter. When we are reflecting on pay <P>


<a name="column_326"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 326</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we should reflect generally in relation not only to directors but also to the professions. The professions operate in a different way from public and private limited companies; they are partnerships. However, their remuneration reflects generally upon the situation as perceived by the public. The noble Lord is right that it is a factor to be taken into account.

<A NAME="80129-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80129-02_para0"></a>What progress has been made, since the exchange of letters between the United Kingdom Government and the European Union Commission last June, in removing the anomaly of foreign fishing boats registered at British ports being allowed to catch fish within the quotas allocated to the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80129-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Lord Donoughue): </B>  My Lords, a consultation paper was issued to the industry in July containing proposals for ensuring that all British registered fishing vessels maintain a real economic link with those populations in the United Kingdom dependent upon fisheries and related industries. Those proposals have since been the subject of extensive discussions with all sectors of the fishing industry. Those discussions have been completed and the Commission's views are now being sought on our proposals. Once those views are known, an announcement will be made on the way forward.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. It is now seven months since the Government stated that they would introduce conditions for new fishing licences "with all speed", to use the Prime Minister's words. How fast does the noble Lord consider the process that he described as a disincentive to quota hopping, which was stated to be the objective, is going? Is there any assurance that the European Court will not again rule that that is illegal, as it did in the case of the register in the Merchant Shipping Act?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, it has taken a few months, but we stated at the beginning that we would consult fully with the industry. We were criticised for consulting too quickly on beef bones; on this matter we consulted fully. With his knowledge, the noble Lord is aware that our fishing industry is diverse in its interests and even conflicting. It therefore took time to consult and reconcile the position. The position is now with the Commission. When we reach an agreed view with the Commission, we shall announce our plans and hope that that will be quite soon.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-02_para1"></a>Our action is based upon a suggestion from the European president, who is the guardian of the European treaty. It is being finalised with the European Commission on the basis that it will be compatible with European law. We are therefore reasonably confident <P>


<a name="column_327"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 327</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that we have done everything possible to make sure that it will not be overturned, as the noble Lord fears, by the European Court.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, does not the Minister agree that the trouble was caused by fishermen selling their quotas overseas? That happened because there was no decent decommissioning scheme, and to obtain proper value the fishermen had to do that. Do the Government now intend to introduce a much more generous and widely embracing decommissioning scheme which will solve the problem?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord. Many of our problems derive from what one might call the negligent or careless handling of fishing policy a decade ago. I agree also that decommissioning must be at the heart of any future solution to our problem. We have spent money on that and, in the light of the current spending review, are considering what funds will be available.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister inform the House whether the eventual decision from Brussels as to whether it agrees with the Prime Minister's view of the matter will depend on the dreaded qualified majority vote? If so, can he give the House any indication as to how those votes stack up at the moment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, that is a view that is being considered by the European Commission. When we obtain its response, that will be the policy. I cannot speculate on what will happen with majority votes, but that is not a relevant factor.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, can I press my noble friend on that? Although the Commission may take the view that the British Government have a case, is it not the case also that any such agreement will have to be agreed by all the other member states, including Spain? If that is so, does he believe that Spain will agree to the alteration which suits them so well, in that it gives them virtually a free hand to fish exactly as they wish in British waters?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, when we have an agreement with the Commission, that will be the agreement. I should point out to my noble friend that other member states--for instance, Belgium and France--are already implementing similar regulations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-02_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister accept that the triumphant exchange of letters--"Dear Tony" and "Dear Jacques"--last June was supposed to herald the end of this problem? It is now seven months since that exchange and nothing has happened. The discussions with the Scottish Fishermen's Federation took place last August. It is coming up to five months since those discussions were completed. When are the Government going to do something about this--or am I right in thinking and <P>


<a name="column_328"></a>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that it was the assumption of any of us that any of these solutions are easy. It is quite wrong to suggest that nothing has happened. As I explained to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, very detailed discussions have been held. As I am sure he is aware, the position of Scottish fishermen is not always the same as that of fishermen in the south west. I am firmly confident that something will happen, which will be an improvement. The important thing is to get the matter right and have a proposal which will have an effect and not take the previous government's approach with their protocol, which had no prospect of success whatsoever.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us about some of the provisions that will not be in the agreement as regards the 50 per cent. of the catch which Spanish quota hoppers will still be permitted to land in Spain? I understand that there have been discussions between the UK Government and the Spanish Government about policing landings for under-sized and over-quota fish. Can the Minister say what response the Spanish Government have given regarding UK policing of those landings?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, part of the letter that has been referred to concerned enforcement. We have strengthened that in this country. We have an agreement with the Commission that there will be stronger enforcement on the Continent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it would be much better for British fishing if the European Commission was to get a "Dear John" letter?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, it is a change to get a non-Scottish view. I have no comment on it.

<P>
</UL><A NAME="80129-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, I wish to express at the outset the Government's real sympathy to all those miners who have suffered lung damage in the sad circumstances which led to this legal action, and to their families. The Government are seeking urgent legal and expert advice on the implications of the judgment and how best to take matters forward. In the meantime the Government's claims administrators are due to meet <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para1"></a>The Government understand the vulnerability of retired mineworkers with severe emphysema. We have made it clear to our administrators that this vulnerability should not be exploited by any delaying tactics. Our objective, wherever possible, is to secure a fair and prompt settlement.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Davies of Coity: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely grateful for my noble friend's reply. Before pressing him further, I would like to declare an interest. My father-in-law is 86 years of age. He spent 45 years in the pits of South Wales. He is medically assessed to have a disability with a combination of ailments comprising pneumoconiosis, emphysema and bronchitis. He has 80 per cent. disability, thereby having only 20 per cent. of normal breathing capacity. Therefore, given the age of hundreds, if not thousands, of ex-miners in similar circumstances, does my noble friend agree that this matter has to be dealt with with extreme urgency? If so, are there proposals for making interim payments in the usual way? Furthermore, is it not right that there should be a tribunal set up, chaired by a judge, to deal with the question of compensation outside the normal legal system, bearing in mind that many mineworkers entitled to compensation have died in the past eight years while awaiting this judgment?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, let me express my community of interest with my noble friend in what he has said about the travails of so many miners in the past. Miners have died even during the currency of this litigation. The question of interim payments is a difficult one. Not all the issues have been totally clarified by the judgment. It is a very complex judgment. As the solicitor representing some of the claimants said, it is a kind of test case. We are still reviewing the implications of the judgment. However, my noble friend can accept from me--and I hope that it was clear from my Answer--that we are dealing with the matter with the utmost urgency. We shall consider the question of interim payments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para2"></a>As regards the last point, I do not believe that it would be particularly helpful to set up a tribunal relating to this particular litigation, which may affect many more miners. If my noble friend was asking for a wider tribunal of inquiry, I cannot comment on that today.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Lofthouse of Pontefract: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that many miners will be greatly satisfied with his reply this afternoon that there will be no delay? That is unlike the procedure of the previous administration in 1993 when the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council recommended that bronchitis and emphysema should be prescribed as industrial diseases among mineworkers. There is documentary evidence that government departments, through correspondence, suggested that the matter should be delayed as long as possible as many miners would die before the recommendations were implemented, and that was done <P>


<a name="column_330"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 330</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in order to save money. I am sure that the present Administration would never dream of doing such a thing. Will the Minister consider that there may be an easy way of dealing with these issues rather than dragging men through the courts and legislation? Will he also consider that all the mineworkers who have already been assessed and awarded industrial injuries benefits because their diseases were caused through working in the mines, and who are now receiving those benefits, should be considered for immediate compensation, again, without dragging them through the courts?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, as with all large-scale tragedies of this kind--the "Herald of Free Enterprise" springs to mind and many others--each individual case has to be considered on its own merits. It is regrettable, but it takes time. Each individual may have a claim for special damages besides the general damages being claimed, and that has to be very carefully invigilated. Having said all that, as I have indicated, I am trying, together with my honourable friend Mr. John Battle, to make sure that the oft-adopted tactics of insurance, of taking advantage of the vulnerability of a claimant or plaintiff, will not be pursued here. We give that solemn undertaking. We have given instructions to those advising us that under no circumstances should they have recourse to such dubious tactics.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Richard): </B>  My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister on the events in Northern Ireland on 30th January 1972, which has become known as Bloody Sunday. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80129-03_para3"></a>"The facts that are undisputed are well-known. On 30th January 1972, during a disturbance in Londonderry following a civil rights march, shots were fired by the British Army. Thirteen people were killed, and another 13 were wounded, one of whom subsequently died. The day after the incident the then Prime Minister set up a public inquiry under the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Widgery.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para4"></a>"He produced a report within 11 weeks of the day. His conclusions included these: that shots had been fired at the soldiers before they started the firing which led to the casualties; that for the most part the soldiers acted as they did because they thought their standing orders required it; and that while there was no proof that any of the deceased had been shot while handling a firearm or bomb, there was a strong suspicion that some had been firing weapons or handling bombs in the course of the afternoon.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para5"></a>"The timescale within which Lord Widgery produced his report meant that he was not able to consider all the evidence which might have been available; for example, he did not receive any evidence from the wounded who were still in hospital, <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_331"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 331</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>and he did not consider individually substantial numbers of eye-witness accounts provided to his inquiry in the early part of March 1972.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para6"></a>"Since his report was published, much new material has come to light about the events of that day. This material includes new eye-witness accounts, new ballistic material, and new medical evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para7"></a>"In 1992 the then Prime Minister said in a letter to the honourable Member for Foyle, who has campaigned tirelessly on this issue, that those shot should be regarded as innocent of any allegation that they were shot while handling firearms or explosives. I reaffirm that today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para8"></a>"Last year the families of those killed provided the previous government with a new dossier on the events of Bloody Sunday. The Irish Government also sent the Government a detailed assessment which analysed the new material and Lord Widgery's findings in the light of all material available.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para9"></a>"I want to place on record our strongest admiration for the way in which our security forces have responded over the years to terrorism in Northern Ireland. They set an example to the world of restraint combined with effectiveness given the dangerous circumstances in which they are called upon to operate. Young men and women daily risk their lives protecting the lives of others and upholding the rule of law, carrying out a task which we have laid upon them. Lessons have of course been learned over many years--in some cases painful lessons. But the support of the Government and this House for our Armed Forces has been, and remains, unshakeable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para10"></a>"There have been many victims of violence in Northern Ireland before and since Bloody Sunday. More than 3,000 people--civilians as well as soldiers, policemen and prison officers--have lost their lives in the past 26 years. It may be asked why we should pay such attention to one event.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para11"></a>"We do not forget or ignore all the other attacks, all the innocent deaths, all the victims of bloody terrorism. Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, a former Permanent Secretary in Northern Ireland, is currently looking at a suitable way to commemorate the victims of violence. In particular, the sacrifice of those many members of the security forces, including the RUC, who lost their lives doing their duty will never be forgotten by this Government, just as they were not forgotten by the last government. The pain of those left behind is no less than the pain of the relatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para12"></a>"But Bloody Sunday was different because, where the state's own authorities are concerned, we must be as sure as we can of the truth, precisely because we do pride ourselves on our democracy and our respect for the law, and on the professionalism and dedication of our security forces.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para13"></a>"This is a very difficult issue. I have reread Lord Widgery's report myself and looked at the new material. I have consulted with my colleagues most <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_332"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 332</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>closely concerned. We have considered very carefully whether it is appropriate now to have a fresh inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para14"></a>"I should emphasise that such a new inquiry can be justified only if an objective examination of the material now available gives grounds for believing that the events of that day should be looked at afresh, and the conclusions of Lord Widgery re-examined. I have been strongly advised that there are indeed grounds for such a further inquiry. We believe that the weight of material now available is such that these events require re-examination. We believe that the only course which will lead to there being public confidence in the results of any further investigation is for a full-scale judicial inquiry into Bloody Sunday to be set up.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para15"></a>"We have therefore decided to set up an inquiry under the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921. The inquiry will have the power to call witnesses and obtain production of papers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para16"></a>"As required by the Act a resolution will be required to set up the inquiry. The resolution will be tabled later today in my name, and will be in the following terms:
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para17"></a> That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely the events on Sunday, 30 January 1972 which led to loss of life in connection with the procession in Londonderry on that day, taking account of any new information relevant to events on that day.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para18"></a>"The noble and learned Lord, Lord Saville of Newdigate, a Law Lord, has agreed to chair a tribunal of three. The other two members are likely to be from the Commonwealth.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para19"></a>"It is not possible to say now exactly how long the inquiry will take but it should be allowed the time necessary to cover all the evidence now available thoroughly and completely. It is for the tribunal to decide how far its proceedings will be open, but the Act requires them to be held in public unless there are special countervailing considerations. The hearings are likely to be partly here and partly in Northern Ireland, but again this is largely for the tribunal. Questions of immunity from prosecution for those giving evidence to the inquiry will be for the tribunal to consider in individual cases, and to refer to the Attorney-General as necessary. It will report its conclusions to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Our intention is that they will be made public.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para20"></a>"Let me make it clear that the aim of the inquiry is not to accuse individuals or institutions or invite fresh recriminations, but to establish the truth about what happened on that day, so far as that can be achieved at 26 years' distance. This will not be easy, and we are all well aware that there were particularly difficult circumstances in Northern Ireland at that time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para21"></a>"Bloody Sunday was a tragic day for all concerned. We must all wish it had never happened. Our concern now is simply to establish the truth, and close this painful chapter once and for all.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-03_para22"></a>"Members of the families of the victims, like the honourable Member for Foyle, have conducted a long campaign to this end. I have heard some of their <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_333"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 333</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>remarks over recent years and have been struck by their dignity. Most do not want recrimination. They do not want revenge. But they do want the truth. I believe that it is in the interests of everyone that the truth is established, and told. It is also the way forward to the necessary reconciliation which will be such an important part of building a secure future for the people of Northern Ireland. I ask all sides of the House to support our proposal for this inquiry."
<P>
</UL>
<A NAME = "80129-03_para23"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-04_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Leader of the House for repeating the Statement and for his courtesy in giving me advance notice of it. On behalf of the Opposition, I can say that if genuine and fresh evidence has now been submitted, evidence which the Law Officers advise is significant enough to warrant an inquiry, we shall accept the Prime Minister's judgment that an inquiry should take place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_para0"></a>Inevitably, as was clear from the tone of part of the Statement, there is a danger that a changed conclusion could be seen as an indictment of Lord Widgery. Will the Leader of the House confirm that the inquiry will be conscious of that danger? Can the noble Lord say when he will be in a position to announce the names of the other two members of the inquiry?
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_para1"></a>As far as immunity from prosecution is concerned, the Statement acknowledged that the families of the dead do not necessarily want prosecutions. Can the noble Lord say whether that wish will be taken into account when the report is available to the Government?
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_para2"></a>I welcome the fact that the Government agree with my right honourable friend the Member for Huntingdon, Mr. Major, when he was Prime Minister, when he said that those who died on Bloody Sunday were innocent victims of the Troubles.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_para3"></a>Is the noble Lord aware that we on this side of the House welcome the decision, contrary to much speculation before the delivery of the Statement, not to make an apology before the inquiry reports?
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_para4"></a>Would the noble Lord agree that those of us who have never served in the Armed Forces should be very careful indeed before trying to second-guess, with the benefit of 25 years' hindsight, the actions of a 19 year-old soldier under fire on the streets of Londonderry?
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_para5"></a>Does the noble Lord accept that the Provisional IRA and, indeed, many other terrorist organisations in all parts of the world regularly try to provoke ill-considered reaction from young soldiers, and that those of us who have for many years studied terrorism and have had a very close association on both sides of terrorist wars in the past 30 years are well aware that that is a perfectly usual ploy among terrorist organisations? Can the noble Lord assure the House that the inquiry will take that matter into account as well?
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_para6"></a>I should like to associate this side of the House with the sentiments expressed by the noble Lord about our Armed Forces. Will he go further and agree with me that no other army in the world could have shown such a degree of discipline in Northern Ireland, in all ranks, <P>


<a name="column_334"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 334</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as the British Army has since 1969? After all, myths are potent in all politics. Perhaps in Irish politics myths are more potent than in most places. Does the noble Lord agree that the inquiry should guard against the dangers of its conclusions being used as a weapon by one side against the majority in the Province?
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_para7"></a>As the Statement makes clear, more than 3,000 people have died in the present troubles, most of them at the hands of terrorists. Does the noble Lord agree that in our hope for peace it would be both right and helpful to have an apology, or at the very least some sign of contrition, from those terrorist gangs and their apologists for all the havoc that they have initiated in pursuit of their political aims--political aims that we in this country tend to try to pursue through peaceful means?
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_time1"></A><H5>3.52 p.m.  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-04_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   My Lords, from these Benches I also thank the noble Lord for repeating the Statement made by the Prime Minister in another place. When dealing with Northern Ireland it is an axiom that it is far better to dwell on the future than rake over the problems of the past, but this is a clear exception to that. I welcome the balanced, fair and extremely careful Statement made by the Prime Minister to which it is very difficult to take exception. My hope, which has been confirmed by the noble Viscount, Lord Cranborne, is that it will command the broad support of the House in all quarters.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_para8"></a>The Statement sets out very clearly why there is new evidence to be assessed. I do not take that in any way as a reflection on the report of Lord Widgery so long ago at the end of an inquiry lasting 11 weeks. There is a widespread perception, right or wrong, that events went wrong on 30th January 1972. While that perception persists it is a factor which makes reconciliation in Northern Ireland more difficult.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_para9"></a>I also pay tribute to what our Armed Forces have done in Northern Ireland in very difficult circumstances over so many years. I am sure that whatever the outcome of the inquiry there will be no disposition to start a witch hunt. In particular, the reference to soldiers aged 19 is wholly appropriate. From my experience of visits made many years ago I was very impressed by the extraordinary restraint shown by young men in very difficult circumstances where their lives and the lives of their colleagues were at stake. We must now wait for the outcome of this inquiry. I welcome the form that it will take and hope that it will put this matter finally to rest.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_para10"></a>In those circumstances I should like to ask the Leader of the House only one question. I am sure all noble Lords agree that in accordance with the requirements of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 the report should be freely available and that evidence should be taken in public as far as possible. However we all know that there is an especial problem relating to the <P>


<a name="column_335"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 335</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>protection of witnesses in Northern Ireland, and I shall be grateful if the noble Lord can give the House an assurance on that particular count.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_time2"></A><H5>3.55 p.m.  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the remarks of both the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Liberal Democrats.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_para11"></a>I say at the outset that this is not a criticism of Lord Widgery. He was faced with a request from the Prime Minister of the day to conduct an urgent inquiry into this matter. I believe that the request was made the day after Bloody Sunday. He sat for 11 weeks and on the evidence available to him came up with a report. I re-read it yesterday. It is the kind of report that one would expect from the Lord Chief Justice, as he then was. It is very careful and analytical. The fact may be that he did not have access to all of the evidence, for which no conceivable blame can be laid at Lord Widgery's door. Your Lordships will have noted that the basis for this fresh inquiry is that there is new evidence which was not available to Lord Widgery and that in the view of the Government it is right that it should be considered by a fresh tribunal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_para12"></a>The noble Viscount asked me when the other members of the tribunal would be appointed. We felt that given the importance of this matter we should report to Parliament before confirming the appointment of the other two members, especially as their appointment would involve consultation with other governments. I cannot give a firm date. I can only say to the House that having launched the inquiry we are anxious that it should sail as soon as possible. I echo the remarks of the noble Viscount about the behaviour of the British Army in Northern Ireland. I was very briefly a Minister at the Ministry of Defence in 1969-70 and had an opportunity to visit the British Army. Those who saw the way it did its job could not fail to have been impressed. I echo many of the sentiments expressed by the noble Viscount. He invited me to say that no other country in the world could have done better. My instinct is to agree with that proposition, although perhaps I would not be as comprehensively firm as he has been.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_para13"></a>I was asked about the public nature of the tribunal. The Act requires that the tribunal should as far as possible sit in public. That is our expectation. However, the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, recognises that there are special circumstances in Northern Ireland. We hope that the inquiry will sit in public as much as it possibly can, but that is essentially a matter for the tribunal itself. The Statement makes clear that the report will be made public. The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, invites me to repeat that, and I do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-04_para14"></a>One other point emerges from the remarks of the noble Viscount. This process is totally separate from the peace process. It would be very dangerous to import consideration as to what is happening in the peace process into this tribunal, or vice versa. It seems to me that they are entirely separate. We have taken this step because we believe that there is new evidence that should be considered. In some ways the proposition is fairly basic and I hope that the House will support it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mayhew of Twysden: </B>   My Lords, everyone must agree that the confused events of 30 years ago in Londonderry were horrible and deeply tragic, like so many events in and connected with Northern Ireland both before and since. Can the noble Lord inform the House whether a tribunal of inquiry established under the Act of 1921 has ever been asked to investigate events as long ago as this? What is the longest period of delay, interval or lapse of time with which any such tribunal has been asked to cope? Can the noble Lord foresee that, 26 years on, there is probably a grave risk of injustice to individuals who will be compelled, by the tribunal's remarkable inquisitorial powers under the Act, to attempt to defend themselves as best they may against allegations that they will no longer be able to counter because of the enormous lapse of time, which I believe to be unprecedented?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I have no idea whether this is the longest gap between an event and the setting up of a tribunal to investigate it. I shall endeavour to ascertain the information and make it available to the noble and learned Lord. On the second point, I do not believe that this process carries a grave risk of injustice, to use the words of the noble and learned Lord. There is a feeling that the truth has not come out and there is also a feeling, certainly on this side of the House, that it is time that it did. I do not know of any other sensible and rational way to resolve that problem other than to do what the Government propose.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-05_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Slim: </B>   My Lords, may I ask the Leader of the House whether the appointment of the committee of judges was a purely political decision, taken by politicians, or whether the military advice of the Chief of the Defence Staff was sought in this matter?
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-05_para0"></a>Very often history shows that such inquiries can lead to castigation of the military to appease the political motives of a government or political party of the time. I have some experience in such matters and I think that hindsight 20 or 30 years later is a very dangerous thing with which to judge.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-05_para1"></a>Many noble Lords have great military experience at this level, but in the other place I regret to say that there are those with no experience of military operations like this and therefore a hue and cry would ensue and the military could be most unfairly damaged.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-05_para2"></a>I have no complaint about the setting up of this inquiry, but I ask the noble Leader of the House to ensure that this matter is handled very carefully.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I do not dissent from the noble Lord's remarks: of course the matter has to be sensitively, appropriately and delicately handled, and that is precisely why we have appointed a Law Lord to chair the tribunal. I would have thought that his objectivity and experience are unimpeachable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-05_para3"></a>I was disappointed to hear the noble Lord accuse this Government of setting up the inquiry for political motives. I can only tell the noble Lord that that is not so; it is being set up to look at new evidence. If the <P>


<a name="column_337"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 337</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>matter was looked at in private and a conclusion then announced, I can imagine the reaction from one side or the other whatever conclusion was reached. If it is conducted in public everyone will know that the matter has been properly looked at and examined. I am sure that the noble and learned Lord who will chair the tribunal will be very conscious of the fact that it should not turn into a pillory of one group of people or another.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-05_para4"></a>In regard to the people who gave advice to the Government, I regret that it is one of those realms of government policy which, even after the Freedom of Information Act is passed, will of necessity have to remain hidden.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath: </B>   My Lords, I welcome my noble friend's Statement and the reference he made to the conduct of our services. My worst moment as a Member of the other place was persuading a lady, who is now dead, not to have the coffin of her 19 year-old son, who was in the Parachute Regiment, opened. Will the noble Lord accept that regret could well be expressed from all quarters?

<P>

<A NAME="80129-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his words.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, if the conduct, competence or judgment of a member of the Armed Forces is liable to be impugned--and this does happen in these inquiries--will he be able to be legally represented? I ask the question because some problems arose during the Scott Inquiry which greatly upset my noble and learned friend Lord Howe of Aberavon.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, the answer is yes. It is a matter for the tribunal. During the Widgery Tribunal, certain interested groups, for example, families, had proper legal representation. The power exists for the tribunal to allow that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hurd of Westmore: </B>   My Lords, will the Leader of the House accept that one of the most important parts of his answer today was the assurance that this process, resulting from the Prime Minister's Statement, is quite separate from the peace process? We have all heard and read in recent days that such a statement would be made, perhaps accompanied by an apology--there has not been and I welcome that--and how helpful it would be to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the peace process. Can the noble Lord repeat his assurance? Is it not most important that history should not be used as a tool or pawn in a political or diplomatic process, however important that process may be?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree with the noble Lord. This process is totally separate from the peace process and should remain so. An inquiry which will inevitably take some months to come to a conclusion can only have a peripheral effect upon the discussions that are taking place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-05_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Alderdice: </B>   My Lords, I would like to express my gratitude to the Leader of the House for repeating <P>


<a name="column_338"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 338</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Statement made in another place by his right honourable friend. I have heard the noble Lord say that this matter must be treated separately from the peace process.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-05_para5"></a>There has been a growing view, not just on one side of the community in Northern Ireland but right across the community, that many things happened on that day that were unsatisfactory, not least that young soldiers were put into a policing situation for which they were not trained.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-05_para6"></a>In every conflict there are events that take on a significance beyond their own because they appear to stand for all sorts of things. There have been many incidents over the last years where inquiries might be necessary, particularly in the case of terrorist atrocities where apologies are more than due. We should not delude ourselves at this time, when we are struggling with the difficulty of finding a settlement and reconciling as many of our people as we can, that recognition of this matter should be addressed properly and legally; but it is also a constructive demonstration of the concern in this country to make things right for the future and to do things in a proper way, for we cannot change the past.

<P>

<A NAME="80129-05_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord speaks with deep personal feeling and commitment. His knowledge of events in Northern Ireland is considerable. I am glad that he sees the announcement of this tribunal as something that may bring the parties together, which is clearly one of the hopes of the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-05_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend recollect that last year at the request of the then Lord Chancellor the Council on Tribunals tendered advice as to the future conduct of ministerial inquiries? Can he assure noble Lords that that advice will be very much in the minds of those who have the conduct of this inquiry?
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-05_para7"></a>In regard to what transpired on Bloody Sunday, will the noble Lord agree that the greatest contribution most of us can make is to exercise self-restraint in what we say?

I hope that the memorandum will be very much in the minds of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Saville, and the other members of the inquiry because I have to confess that they are not very much in my mind at this particular moment. I will have to look to see whether there is anything in that memorandum which contradicts or amplifies anything I have said this afternoon and, if there is, I will contact my noble and learned friend.

Are there not going to be two orders of evidence presented to this inquiry: evidence which rests on records made at or near the time, and evidence which rests on recollection at the time of the inquiry?

<A NAME = "80129-05_para8"></a>I have the greatest respect for the legal profession, but I should have no confidence in my recollections of any such event at such a distance in time. It seems to me therefore not at all impossible that there will be no definitive conclusion of the inquiry, and all that it will be able to produce will be a balance of probabilities. In those circumstances, will the noble Lord assure us that thought is already being given to how the Government will react to the findings when they are made known, because that will be nearly as important as the findings themselves?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-05_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that at this stage the Government are giving a great deal of thought--certainly I am not--as to how we shall present the findings of an inquiry that we have just set up. We have not yet passed the necessary resolution in Parliament to do so. The noble Lord is right in the sense that we do not know the precise nature of the evidence that will be put before the tribunal; we do not know how that evidence will stand up to being tested; we do not know how much of it will be recollection which may be flawed; and I do not know how much will be contemporaneous documentary evidence. All sorts of issues have to be considered. The question is not what the inquiry will look like when it finishes, but whether it is worth starting the process. The Government have concluded that they should.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-05_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, I have to ask the noble Lord, with some cynicism, whether he agrees that this may be yet another tactical error in the Government's recent handling of Northern Ireland affairs. The admission that the noble Lord has just made that the Government have not yet thought about how they will handle this sensitive, delicate, and, as the noble Lord has admitted, unknown material that will be put before the inquiry is frightening. Does the noble Lord agree that as this is a public inquiry, Dublin and the IRA will take the evidence piece by piece and use it as presented, against the better results that might be achieved by Her Majesty's Government in their negotiations for peace? Does the noble Lord accept and understand that many people in Northern Ireland, as was stated in the press that I read this morning, will put down the fact that there is to be an inquiry to pressure from Dublin? I consider this to be a serious tactical error. I ask the Government to consider seriously how they will handle the evidence and the conclusions, because I believe that serious problems will arise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, of course we will consider how best to handle the matter. All I was doing a few moments ago was telling the noble Lord, Lord Elton, that it is premature to consider now how we will handle the findings of an inquiry that we have only just set up. Noble Lords opposite shake their heads. I do not know--they may know better than I--what the findings of this inquiry will be. It will no doubt come to a conclusion when it has considered the evidence. When it comes to a conclusion, it will no doubt communicate <P>


<a name="column_340"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 340</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that conclusion to the Government and to the world. It is at that stage that the handling of the findings becomes important.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-06_para0"></a>As to the sensitivity of the process, I emphasise that of course the Government are conscious of the sensitivity of the issue. We are having the inquiry because it is such a sensitive issue. The only sensible and sensitive way to deal with the matter is to set up a tribunal of inquiry in the terms that I have expressed this afternoon. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, thinks that we have made a major error of judgment. I do not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, when does the Leader of the House envisage that the inquiry will make its report, and when will the report be published? Does he think that it will be before or after the planned conclusion of the peace process, which I believe is at the beginning of May, because it could have an effect on the peace process?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I cannot give any date for the conclusion of this inquiry. It is very much a matter for the chairman and the members of the tribunal. I had better leave it there. It is almost impossible to tell until the process is launched.

<A NAME = "80129-06_para2"></a>Clause 1 [Referendum]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-06_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 13, leave out ("question") and insert ("questions").<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-06_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 12. Amendment No. 1 is a paving amendment. The amendments deal with the question or questions to be asked in the referendum. It is a matter which was considered at some length in previous stages. During earlier exchanges the Government asked whether the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives could come up with a set of questions upon which the two groups agreed. She criticised us, perhaps understandably, for proposing different sets of questions, although they were not far apart.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-06_para4"></a>We have responded to that challenge. We have not done so because we agree on the preferred model for London government but because we believe that there should be a debate on the model--the type of debate that a referendum will engender, not the rather peripheral discussion which will occur if there is just one package/question, where the issue for debate will be the generalised issue of the government of London.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-06_para5"></a>It is no secret that all the parties have different views as to the elements there might be in the government for London. The Government propose a package, and they have been clear about that: an authority consisting of a separately directly elected mayor and an assembly. Most of the Liberal Democrats support an assembly with the <P>


<a name="column_341"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 341</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>leader of the assembly taking the mayoral role. Most of the Conservatives support the idea of a directly elected mayor, and an assembly or group comprised of leaders of the London boroughs. There is a range of views in all parties. There was a reference at an earlier stage of the Bill to the leaks about discussions within the Greater London Labour Party and other Labour members in London.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-06_para6"></a>In Committee the Minister talked (col.950) about providing firm leadership, setting strategic direction and getting things done. She ascribed those actions to a mayor, and said that that was what a mayor could do. Those actions could equally well be ascribed to and carried out by an assembly with a leader. As I have said previously, the model for an assembly, a group, a parliament with a strong leader, is that of Mr. Blair. But those activities could also be carried out by a mayor subject to different types of checks than the ones which will be on offer in this package.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-06_para7"></a>The Government believe that the mayor should not have too much power. I agree with that. I believe that no individual in any level of government should have too much power. The recipe of the Liberal Democrats is to write in checks so that an assembly can deal prospectively, not just retrospectively, with proposals and can be effective; in other words, involving a group of elected representatives at the start of every project and every undertaking.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-06_para8"></a>I have referred before to the model of New York, often quoted, where I believe that the mayor has the support of an office of financial officers 350 strong, yet the assembly with the role of scrutinising the mayor's budget has the support of a mere 35 officials, 10 per cent. I give that as just one example of the sort of thing that worries me and noble Lords of my party. That, of course, has been our policy quite consistently.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-06_para9"></a>I am aware that the package on offer from the Government is what was in the manifesto "after a referendum". Those were the words used. So I do not believe that it is of quite the same status as other manifesto items. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, at the last stage said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is right that the Labour manifesto, which I read often, makes the point that there will be an elected assembly and a separately elected mayor. But it does not make the point that people shall not be able to have one without the other ".--[Official Report, 13/1/98; col. 952] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

Nor does it say that there cannot be expressions of opinion about the two elements.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-06_para10"></a>I am sure that the Government do not wish to suggest that the vote in the referendum will be the sort of vote one sees in a totalitarian state, where the people are required to show support for any proposal that comes from the head of state and they have no alternative. So what are we to make of the notion of a referendum, still a very new procedure in the United Kingdom? My noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire at the last stage distinguished between referendums and plebiscites. Plebiscites are what governments do to demonstrate the illusion of consultation but to get their will. Referendums are real consultations with the public. There are different views about what referendums should comprise, what they should be expected to <P>


<a name="column_342"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 342</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>achieve. But there is the common element that they should involve a process of education of the public and encouragement to participate, of consultation and involvement; all values which are certainly values of my party, but I believe that they are expressed to be values of new Labour.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-06_para11"></a>The noble Baroness spoke at an earlier stage of not having imposed upon the Government a constitutional settlement other than the package which is on offer; a settlement, as she described the possible outcome, which the Government believed to be fundamentally wrong. Of course not. I do not believe that a referendum can impose--certainly not the referendum that we are talking about in this context; it can guide.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-06_para12"></a>I agree with my noble friends Lord Wallace and Lord Dahrendorf that public debate about what is the real role of plebiscites and referendums would be useful. But even without that debate I am in absolutely no doubt that what Londoners expect is to be asked their views. The propositions are novel: a mayor, a very strong mayor with powers of which we have no experience. They expect to be able to express their views on the novelty.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-06_para13"></a>The notion that this is presented as a package has been greeted with some amazement by a number of people to whom I have spoken who have not followed the detail of the argument in the way that your Lordships will have done. Their common sense approach is, "This is something on which we should be consulted. We should be able to say what we want. But there are two parts to it. We want to express our views on both parts".
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-06_para14"></a>I have referred to it being a package which is on offer. I hope I do not sound impertinent in saying that it is intellectually a very respectable argument to say that we propose a package, we do not want to disaggregate that package, we will ask views on that package. What I find less easy to understand is how the Government could proceed if there was a no vote because they will not know what the voters regard as being objectionable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-06_para15"></a>Our approach is quite different. It is setting out the context of the package, that the Government propose an authority made up of an assembly and a mayor. Then it asks the two questions because, whatever my preferences and those of my noble friends, and I believe those of the Conservative Party, we do not believe that any of those who support the amendment before your Lordships this afternoon would say that politicians should be pre-empting the views of Londoners. The Government may say that if only the mayor were to be approved from a two question referendum it would not wish to proceed with the mayoralty. It is up to the Government, and indeed, up to my party to argue against an authority which comprises only a mayor with insufficient checks and balances. But if, nevertheless, this is the outcome, that there is not support for both elements, then of course the Government will have to think again. I cannot believe that that is an inappropriate outcome because a constitutional settlement which does not have the resounding support of Londoners must have an element of instability.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-06_para16"></a>The Minister referred at the last stage to the referendum not being an oversized research project. Equally, it is not a directive which the Government are <P>


<a name="column_343"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 343</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bound to follow if their proposals do not receive support. She said it is a package with interdependent parts. Yes, then that is what should be argued during the referendum campaign. It is not a matter of offering two alternative choices to the people of London. If there is a preference for one element--the authority--but not for the other, there will have to be further work on how and if that element might operate. But overwhelmingly, I suggest that it is Londoners not Labour who should decide. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="80129-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bowness: </B>   My Lords, I support this amendment that stands in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and myself. This was a matter discussed in Committee. At that time I withdrew the amendment that was in my name and promised to read carefully the reply that the Minister gave to the debate on both that amendment and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. I must tell the Minister that I have done just that. And just as I did after reading the Minister's response to the issue when it was raised during the Second Reading, I still believe that in resisting two questions the Government are seeing complications where complications do not exist.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para0"></a>The proposal is a very simple one. We would like the people of London to be able to vote separately on the two elements of the Government's proposal. I emphasise that the question does not seek to put before the citizens of London anything different from that which the Government are proposing. Nor, I should say for the avoidance of doubt, does it seek to have a situation where there is either a mayor alone or an assembly alone. Our reason for wanting the question to be posed in two parts is that by then, if we do not have a Bill, we shall at least have a White Paper and some of the details will be very much clearer.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para1"></a>It has to be said, however--and I do not believe that this can seriously be gainsaid--that having seen the details, people may well have a different view about the proposals from those which they currently hold. It is quite conceivable that a voter wishing to see an authority for Greater London might feel that the powers to be given to a directly elected mayor were, for example, too great with insufficient constraints, in which case he might wish to vote in favour of the assembly proposals but not for the mayor. Similarly, voters may dislike the powers and functions to be given to a directly elected assembly. They might consider that those constrain not just the mayor but the boroughs themselves, making it difficult for the mayor and, indeed, the boroughs to do their jobs as envisaged in the proposals or as they would seek to argue they should be done.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para2"></a>The Government appear to have no trust in people's ability to see the difference between the two questions and to answer something more sophisticated than this Government's demand for a simple "yes" or "no". I believe that in what will be a very complicated situation, voters may have a variety of different views and they are entitled to be given as many opportunities as possible to express them
<P>


<a name="column_344"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 344</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para3"></a>The problem with the Government's approach is that it must be accepted or rejected in its entirety. Indeed, the Government seem to make a virtue of that. They acknowledge it and say that it is a package which the voters must take or leave; there can be no picking or choosing. The Government say that there are no choices on offer. One is bound to ask why they bother with a referendum at all. However, I leave that to one side.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para4"></a>Surely it is possible for the referendum to take place against the background of informed debate and to seek a view of the public in the most meaningful way. Your Lordships will know that given that the Government have decided to go down the referendum route, at the very least the draft Bill should be available. But let us suppose for a moment that it is not. Even the Government's second-best plan envisages a White Paper with proposals being available before the vote. Even the Government propose that. Critical to that debate will be the balance of power not only between the mayor and the assembly but between the mayor, the assembly and the boroughs. As a result of that debate, it is perfectly possible for the voters to say, "We like the plans that you have for an executive mayor but not the plans for the assembly", and vice versa.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para5"></a>Contrary to what the Minister said at earlier stages, that does not commit the Government to proceeding with their plans for a mayor and not an assembly or for an assembly and no directly-elected mayor. The Government can make it quite clear, as they have done, that they view this as one proposal and a package and will not proceed with one element only. No doubt the Government will campaign individually for a "yes" vote on both counts but that does not preclude the proposals being divided and put to the people to seek their views on the two essentials.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para6"></a>If the Government fail to achieve two "yes" votes, they will have to think again on whichever element received a negative vote. It will be up to them. No one else is going to decide how to proceed. Nothing is going to be forced on anybody by having two questions and conceivably two different answers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para7"></a>In Committee the Minister asked how a voter should vote who wanted a mayor and assembly but only with the proper checks and balances. I should say to the Minister that I have pondered on that question. I hope that I understood it. In asking the question she is assuming that it is only the relationship between the mayor and the assembly which is the relevant question. As I have suggested, there are the matters of functions and relationships with the boroughs which need to be considered.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para8"></a>I believe that the Minister's voter would vote "yes" twice if satisfied on the question which she posed and "no" to both questions if not satisfied. But the Minister did not pose the problem of a voter who is convinced about the need for a mayor, a voice for London and an advocate for the capital who likes the directly-elected concept but who is concerned about the powers and functions to be given to a new assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para9"></a>The advocate for an assembly but not a directly elected mayor might make a similar case. Why should the voter have to make a stark choice instead of being <P>


<a name="column_345"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 345</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>able to give a considered reply to the two elements of the Government's plans? In my submission the case for two questions is very strong and is not a distinctly Conservative position.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para10"></a>In Committee in another place it was pointed out that not only did The Times and the Telegraph support two questions but so did the Guardian, which supported the Government's proposals in their entirety. I am sure that the Minister will be aware that the editorial in the Guardian said:

<A NAME="80129-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, I have listened very carefully to the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Bowness. I have some concerns about the impact of the amendment, both in terms of the principle of the Bill before us but also in terms of the practical effect that those amendments would have which could lead to both delay and confusion and may thwart the very clearly expressed desire of Londoners to have strategic leadership in the capital as soon as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para12"></a>As both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord pointed out, the Government are proposing a package which embraces both an elected mayor and a separately elected assembly. The proposals were based on the Labour Party's manifesto. They were incorporated within the Green Paper and the consultation that went with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para13"></a>The beauty of what is proposed is that the public in London are being given a clear choice to vote "yes" or "no" with the implications of that choice well understood. They can be very clearly implicated if Londoners vote in favour of the proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para14"></a>Once one moves into a two question situation, that undoubtedly complicates the picture. I should say, in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, that you could end up with several outcomes: either a mayor and an assembly together, a mayor alone, or an assembly alone. The White Paper that preceded the referendum would then need to discuss that range of options. I suggest that it would present a confusing picture to the people whom we are asking to vote instead of presenting a clear-cut choice. Londoners would have anything but that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para15"></a>It becomes even more complicated if a Bill must be published eight weeks before the referendum. The danger is that confusion and delay may occur. I believe that our capital city has suffered so much for too long from a lack of clear strategic leadership. The Bill offers us the clearest, quickest and most straightforward way to proceed. We should resist the amendments.

<P>

<A NAME="80129-07_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of King's Heath, objects to the amendment for exactly the same <P>


<a name="column_346"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 346</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reasons that I objected to the Government's decision to have a two-question referendum in Scotland. I was wrong. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, is wrong for the same reason. Both of us at different times have been too fearful. We have been too reluctant to allow the will of the people to be expressed clearly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para16"></a>We have here two logically distinct questions. They are far more obviously logically distinct than the two questions put forward in the Scottish referendum. Therefore, since we actually have two questions, I believe we need to know what the people think about both questions. I am sure that your Lordships know the story of Hobson's choice: when you came to the stable you were allowed to choose any horse that you liked, as long as it was the one nearest the door. Hobson was actually a real person. I discovered the fate of his estate in the Record Office of your Lordships' House. He was a Cambridge University carrier who made a fortune of &#163;30,000 but, because he died intestate, the lawyers got it all.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-07_para17"></a>In much the same way the Government may possibly risk getting their come-uppance if they will not allow the voters to make a real and genuine choice. On opinion poll evidence at present, it is perfectly clear that it is overwhelmingly likely that a "yes" would be given to both questions. I know that people tend to get anxious, but I really do not think that the Government need to be this anxious. I believe that they can afford to take the risk.

<P>
<A NAME="80129-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Ludford: </B>   My Lords, I just wanted to remind the Minister that, in Committee, she quoted with approval part of the speech that my noble friend Lord Dahrendorf made on Second Reading. She said that he was absolutely right when he said that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"referenda should not be exploratory and open-ended. They should test the views of the people about government proposals. The first duty is therefore that of government to make such proposals and to argue for them. ... If the people of London do not like the Government's proposals--for two separately elected components of the Greater London authority--the Government will have to think again".--".--[Official Report, 15/12/97; col. 430.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

I believe that the Minister quoted those words because she thought that the arguments expressed supported her case. However, I suggest to her that those words could equally support the argument for two questions in the referendum.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-08_para0"></a>The first point made by my noble friend Lord Dahrendorf was to say that the Government must argue for their proposals. What we have heard is the suggestion that, with two questions in the referendum, the Government will have the proper democratic duty of arguing and explaining their proposals very strongly and that the quality of debate will be all the higher for it. In other words, the interests of Londoners in the debate is likely to be greater and there will be the prospect that some of the issues facing a London authority will be discussed, rather than what is happening at present with the debate being distorted by speculation on the personality who is likely to run for the position of mayor. That is most unhealthy.
<P>


<a name="column_347"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 347</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-08_para1"></a>The second point made by my noble friend was that if the people do not like the Government's proposals the Government will have to think again. The point has been well made in this debate that the referendum is a consultative process. In that respect, perhaps I may answer a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, who said that the referendum would be based on the proposals in the manifesto. If the manifesto and the General Election result were all that was necessary, one could say that there was no point in having a referendum. If we are to have a referendum, it is because we want the specific approval of Londoners for the scheme put forward by the Government. If the Government have to argue strongly for their proposals for an assembly and a directly-elected mayor--which, as my noble friend Lady Hamwee pointed out, is a constitutional innovation in that it is rather novel-- I believe that the debate will be all the stronger.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-08_para2"></a>Another important point which has arisen from the debate is that the Minister has said at various stages that the Government are wary of the situation where voters could reject the assembly and opt only for a mayor and that, as they do not support having a mayor only, they would be unable to implement that result. I believe that would be dealt with by the fact that, clearly, they would have to think again. However, I hope that the quality of the arguments will ensure that it will not come to that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-08_para3"></a>Can the Minister also address the following point? If voters are faced with the package only and do not like one element of it, they will have to vote "no" to the whole package. If they are not happy with the suggestion of a directly elected mayor, they will have no option but to vote against the assembly. That seems to me to be a very sorry situation and is one of the reasons why we on these Benches have consistently supported the restoration of a strategic authority for London. We would prefer a first-best solution, but a second-best solution is better than no London authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-08_para4"></a>We are worried that the atmosphere in which this proposal will be debated will rather sour the debate. Frankly, it looks as if the Government are open to the charge of being rather arrogant in imposing only a single package and, indeed, that they may be getting rather defensive about the whole idea of a London authority. The spirit in which this should be presented and debated is that of an exciting step forward in that London will be better governed when it has a London authority. If the Government are coming over as rather stubborn about this--indeed, perhaps rather defensive--and unwilling to argue strongly for the different elements in the package, there is a risk that the nature of the reception that Londoners will give the proposal will be slightly discouraging and we shall end up with less support and enthusiasm for what should be a bold and exciting step forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-08_para5"></a>Before the Minister replies, I should add that it is important for us to remember that the amendment is supported by those who actually want a directly elected mayor. Supporting this amendment does not depend on whether you want the outcome of only an assembly or only a mayor; indeed, it is supported by those who simply want the quality of democracy and of debate to <P>


<a name="column_348"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 348</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be enhanced by giving Londoners the choice. The Government would go up in the estimation of all those who support democracy and who vote for choice if they were to concede that the best way in which the referendum can be conducted is to allow Londoners not to have their vote distorted by the package approach.

<A NAME="80129-08_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  My Lords, we have been through this territory both in another place and in your Lordships' House on several occasions. I shall try to restate the Government's position on the issue of two questions as clearly as I can. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, was very clear in her exposition and very frank as regards the history of the two Front Benches opposite finally finding a form of words upon which they could agree in terms of the proposed amendment. The noble Baroness accepted that, in a sense, that masked a very real disagreement between those two Front Benches and certainly in regard to this Front Bench about the best constitutional settlement for London.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-08_para6"></a>There is disagreement on the issue. The Government's position is absolutely clear-cut. It was clearly stated in our manifesto and, indeed, it has been there all along. We believe that there should be a Greater London authority comprising a directly-elected mayor and a separately directly-elected assembly. We have stated that we need the leadership and the legitimacy of a directly-elected mayor and the accountability and the monitoring of a separate, directly-elected assembly. Moreover--and I say this to the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, because it represents the difference between us--we believe that those people should be separately elected to that job. In other words, they should not be doing it as a second job to their leadership of the London boroughs. I know that the noble Lord's party believes that there should be an indirectly-elected assembly, in the same way as the noble Baroness's party believes that there should be an indirectly-elected mayor. These are absolutely legitimate political differences for parties to hold.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-08_para7"></a>I have no problem with these arguments being propounded by parties. Indeed that was done during the general election campaign to some extent. The Government's position was clear and has been consistent. I believe that the position of the Liberal Democrats was clear; namely, they have never been in favour of a directly elected mayor. The noble Lord, Lord Bowness, has accepted that the Opposition--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ogmore: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for giving way. I am sure that most noble Lords know exactly what the noble Baroness means. However, I should be grateful for some clarification. When she uses the words "directly elected", does she mean that both the assembly and the mayor are directly elected by <P>


<a name="column_349"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 349</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the electorate of London? Or, is the assembly elected directly by the electorate and the mayor elected by the assembly? There may be slight confusion here.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-08_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has illustrated the kind of confusions and difficulties we get into when we start opening up different options. The Government's proposition is quite clear; namely, that there should be elections for a mayor. There will be a slate of candidates for the mayoralty. There should be elections for the assembly. There will be names of people and the constituencies they would represent. The voting systems will be set out in the White Paper. As I say, there will be separate elections for the assembly. There will be a disposition of powers between the mayor and the assembly; the inter-relationships will be set out clearly. Those two together will form the Greater London Authority to which we committed ourselves in our manifesto.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-08_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. Before she concludes I hope that she can answer the question of my noble friend Lady Hamwee. If the manifesto concludes the matter and the package cannot be divided, why do we want a referendum?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-08_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I can assure the noble Earl, Lord Russell, that I have not finished yet. However, he has thrown me slightly. I was trying to express the matter clearly. There are different views as to the most appropriate way forward. Those views can be propounded by different political parties and put to the electorate at a general election. To an extent that was done. The general election of last year gave a clear endorsement to the Government. Perhaps my next point will answer the questions of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. The Government also committed themselves to testing the assent of the people of London to a Greater London Authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-08_para8"></a>I rather resent the accusations of totalitarianism and not giving the people any choice. We are imposing another layer of assent and public consultation. We saw what happened when the GLC was abolished. One does not need a referendum to change government in London; one can do that by Act of Parliament. However, we stated in the manifesto that we believed it was important to create strategic, city-wide London government and to test whether the people of London agreed with the Government's proposition. We never said that we would also offer them propositions that appealed more to the Liberal Democrats or to the Conservatives.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-08_para9"></a>I wrote down what the noble Earl, Lord Russell, said. He said that in the past we had been reluctant for the will of the people to be clearly expressed. We are trying to allow the will of the people to be clearly expressed. I stress the importance of the word "clearly". I suggest to the House that there would be no clarity in the kind of propositions that have been put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, or the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. If we detect different degrees of support for different parts of the package, the Government will have to think again. How will the electorate know what <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>their clear choice is when a variety of results could emerge on the issues of whether the mayor or the assembly should be directly elected? The noble Lord, Lord Bowness, said people were considering many other issues, for example the relationship with the boroughs.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bowness: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. I hope she will concede that I did not say there were an even greater number of outcomes; I said there were a number of issues that the people would wish to consider when casting their vote. I did not argue for more than two questions. That strictly limits the possible outcomes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, it strictly limits the possible outcomes but people would not know with any clarity what the outcome of their vote would be as they would not know how other Londoners would vote and they would not know what the Government's response would be. I return to the accusation of totalitarianism and imposing a referendum to which people can vote only yes. That is not correct; people can vote yes or no.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Ludford: </B>   My Lords, I hope the Minister will address that point. People may have to vote no when they are voting no to only one element of the package. However, they will be forced to vote no to the whole thing precisely because the Government are not giving them the option to vote no to only one element. Would it not be better to have some government for London rather than none if people's votes are being distorted by the Government's refusal to give choice?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-09_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I cannot agree with the noble Baroness that it is definitely better to have some government rather than none. Neither I nor the Government want to have an unaccountable mayor. We do not think that is the right way forward. I do not wish to see--I do not think those on the Bench opposite wish to see this--a recreated GLC without the leadership and the counterbalance of a mayor. We need some clarity here. We were accused of not being able to risk the judgment of the people. However, we are willing to risk the judgment of the people on the package that we are putting forward. I do not think it is appropriate to analyse the speeches of a noble Lord in his absence in terms of the thinking behind them. I believe that the words of the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, that I mentioned were absolutely clear. People can read them in the Official Report and draw their own conclusions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare: </B>   My Lords, I have listened to the argument with great interest that was academically given to the House with all the forensic skill of the noble Baroness. Will she be kind enough to explain to me why in Scotland there could not have been one question: "Do you want an assembly with tax raising authority"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-09_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, in Scotland there were two separate issues which were not interdependent. They were separable constitutional areas. The reason we <P>


<a name="column_351"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 351</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>had one question in Wales was because the issue of tax raising powers was never proposed as something that would be implemented. In the case of Scotland there was a package of constitutional measures, without a pick-and-mix; for example, "Do you want a first Minister or not a first Minister?", or, "Do you want to change it around, or anything else?" There were two separate issues comprising the constitutional set-up of the Parliament and the tax varying powers. There was a clear yes or no answer to either question. I have said time and again that the Government's case is quite clear; namely, this issue concerns responsibility of government. I have forgotten the point that was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-09_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Ludford: </B>   My Lords, I referred to the danger that people would have to vote no to the whole package.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-09_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to the noble Baroness. The noble Baroness said that people would have to vote no when they were only 90, 80, or 70 per cent. against a measure and that they would not be able to express the nuances of their views. I am afraid that life is sometimes like that. At general elections we have to take the totality of a party's policies and come to a view on them. It would be irresponsible of the Government to offer the people of London the possibility of splitting up a constitutional settlement when the Government do not believe that would be in the interest of Londoners. We are willing to risk the judgment of the people of London on the proposition for which we shall definitely argue. We have no temerity about that. We are not uncertain about the robust nature of the proposals, but we wish to see some clarity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-09_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bowness: </B>   My Lords, the Minister speaks about the robustness of the proposals. Does the noble Baroness agree that there are no proposals? The Government have produced no White Paper or Bill. The Government intend to put forward an unknown proposal to the people of London. They are not even prepared to divide the proposal so that the people of London can make a considered judgment when they have a few details, which will presumably come from the White Paper rather than the Bill as we would prefer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-09_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I can assure the noble Lord that there will not be "a few details" in the White Paper. The White Paper will be comprehensive. It will deal with all the issues with which this House is rightly concerned across the range of complex issues involved in the government of London. The White Paper will be published in the week of 23rd March. We shall make sure that a summary of that White Paper goes through the door of every household in London.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-09_para0"></a>We have talked seriously in this House about how we can make people aware clearly of the details of the proposal. To do so clearly, and to give proper information, in such a complex area will not be aided if many variable answers may result--the mayor without the assembly; the assembly without the mayor. If we are to have clarity, we cannot also have a variety of outcomes other than "yes" or "no".
<P>


<a name="column_352"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 352</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-09_para1"></a>That leads me to another issue that I hope your Lordships will consider carefully if the amendment is pressed to a Division. I refer to the behaviour of the Chamber, and the amendment which was passed in Committee. The noble Lord, Lord Bowness, discounted his victory in Committee; but victory it was. The Committee amended the Bill so that a Bill has to be published eight weeks before a referendum is held. The Government advised your Lordships' House that that was not appropriate. We thought that it was wrong. We did not think that it would aid clarity and understanding; and we knew that it would delay fatally the referendum. It would mean that we could not hold the referendum on 7th May of this year, the same day as the local elections. Nevertheless, the Committee took a different view. It took the view that there should be a Bill and those who propounded the amendment were clear that it should contain the detail of the Government's proposals. The Bill should not contain clauses which provided for the relationship were there to be an assembly but an indirectly elected mayor, or, alternatively, the relationship were there to be a directly elected mayor with an indirectly elected assembly. The noble Lord, Lord Bowness, was clear that the Bill should contain the specifics of the Government's proposals so that people knew exactly what they were voting for or against.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-09_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Bowness: </B>   My Lords, I hope that the noble Baroness will forgive my intervention. I do not wish to delay the House longer than necessary. Does the noble Baroness agree that we proposed that there should be a Bill? That is the decision of the House as it stands. The Government's proposal--it is second best in our view--is that there should be a White Paper with proposals. Does that not support--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-09_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may remind the noble Lord that we are on Report. This is the third intervention and interruption of the Minister's winding up speech. Normally one is considered sufficient.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-09_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bowness: </B>   My Lords, clearly I am in the hands of the House. But the Minister referred specifically to what I said. It seems to me that she was misinterpreting the position we put to the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-09_para2"></a>We want as many details as possible put forward. Does the Minister agree that in the light of those details it would be quite possible for the people to express one view about one aspect and a different view about another?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-09_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, that is the point on which I differ with the noble Lord. While I do not think that it is justified, there is an intellectual coherence in being more specific, getting more detail, and having the legislation in front of people before they vote in the referendum so that they know the government's proposals and exactly what would be entailed in voting "yes" or "no" for the package of the greater London authority, which is the assembly and a mayor.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-09_para3"></a>The House should consider carefully whether we should ask another place to amend the Bill in two diametrically opposite directions. The amendment <P>


<a name="column_353"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 353</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>already passed asks for more clarity and more detail on the exact government proposals. This amendment increases uncertainty. It has been said by Members of both parties opposite that the Government would have to think again as a result of the different votes and degrees of support there might be for one proposal or another on the mayor or the assembly. This House rightly prides itself on being scrupulous about the internal consistency of its decisions. I do not think that it would be sensible, the House having amended the Bill in one direction, then to amend the Bill in a completely different direction.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-09_para4"></a>Each amendment has a logic of its own. It makes the outcome either more black and white, more certain, with a more specific background against which people vote "yes" or "no"; or it opens up the situation and makes the referendum less a test of assent to a given proposition and more a consultative exercise on different options. But together the amendments pull in completely different directions. Together they destroy what was a clearly set out commitment by this Government in their election manifesto to implement proposals for a directly elected authority for London; that it should comprise two separately directly elected elements, and that we would test that proposition with the people of London. We were willing to risk the people of London rejecting what we put forward. As a responsible Government we were not willing to put before people a false menu of a constitutional settlement for London which we do not believe to be workable or in the interests of the capital. On that basis I urge the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-10_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, the Minister suggested that disagreement between the two Front Benches was masked by the amendments. That is not so. I and the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, have been perfectly clear about our decisions. It is not a question of masking disagreement but of reaching agreement as regards part of the process.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-10_para0"></a>I shall not take up too much of your Lordships' time in responding. I sense that noble Lords would not be entirely tolerant of the arguments being rehearsed fully again. However, perhaps I may respond to points made by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and the Minister. It was suggested that there could be several outcomes to a referendum containing more than one question. I hope that I have made the position clear, but I shall do so again. I am not suggesting that if the votes do not produce the package that the Government are promoting they would then be bound to proceed immediately with one element.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-10_para1"></a>It has also been suggested that this amendment is inconsistent with the one agreed by your Lordships at the previous stage--the question of publication of a Bill before the referendum. The Government immediately went on record as saying that they would reverse that amendment in another place. I recognise that that will not be the end of the process. However, I propose this amendment in the light of that history.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-10_para2"></a>It has also been said that the will of the people can be clearly expressed by means of one question, but that more than one question would lead to a variety of results. I dealt with that point by explaining that I do not propose that the results would mean an immediate move to some other form of constitutional settlement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee </B>   moved Amendment No. 2:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 2, line 30, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) Where the polls referred to in subsection (1) are taken on the same day--
<BR>
(a) polling for the referendum shall be between the hours of 7 in the morning and 10 at night on the day of the referendum; and
<BR>
(b) polling for the election shall be between the same hours and regulations shall be laid pursuant to section 36(2) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 accordingly.").<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-10_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this is an amendment to Clause 4, and I hope it is a less contentious issue. It returns to the question of polling <P>


<a name="column_356"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 356</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hours and proposes that polling in both the referendum and in local council elections shall be from the hours of seven in the morning to 10 at night.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-10_para9"></a>We previously focused on the hours of the referendum. I take the point that has been made that if the hours of the referendum and the borough elections held on the same day are different, there could be confusion. Noble Lords will be familiar with the argument over the need not to disenfranchise those who travel long distances and work long hours in London. At a previous stage, the noble Lord, Lord Tugendhat, commented on our becoming more of a 24-hour society. I accept what was said about encouraging turnout through other means and not only relying on the polling hours, although I suggest that that is not an adequate answer to the point which I and other noble Lords made.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-10_para10"></a>I also understand the point about the costs, but there are costs to democracy. It was said that there could be administrative disruption, but that would not be the case if the hours of the two polls were the same. It was also said that the local election results would be delayed. Yes, but only by one hour.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-10_para11"></a>Returning to the question of extended hours leading to higher turnouts, it was accepted that there was no evidence either way. The Minister said that if there was any evidence as to the effect of hours on turnout, then she would bring the matter back to the House. I know that very often in local elections there is a rush to vote between the hours of 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. when the polls close at 9 p.m. I also know that sometimes there is great difficulty in persuading people to turn out and vote straight away when they come home at 8.30 p.m. Because I live opposite a polling station, I have seen people turn up before 8 o'clock in the morning thinking that they can vote on the way to work but they find that the polls have not opened.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-10_para12"></a>I believe it is likely that the referendum will be regarded as more like a general election than a local election and therefore the hours should be those of a general election. I realise that the hours are a matter for statutory instruments. So too are the hours of the local elections, but under other legislation. Hence my reference to the Representation of the People Act 1983. I hope that the amendment will give the Government the opportunity to convince us, with evidence, if there is any, that we will not disenfranchise--I use the word deliberately, knowing the argument on absent voting--those who wish to exercise their vote but who, for good reasons, find themselves unable to do so because of the pressures of work and other pressures in their lives. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness said, it is a slightly less contentious issue than the amendment we have just debated. As someone who always draws the short straw at general elections and seems to be responsible for taking numbers outside polling stations between the hours of 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., I have waited in vain for many people to come through the doors when it is cold and dark. I have taken a particular interest in the issue. My experience has been reflected by many other people, not just in London but <P>


<a name="column_357"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 357</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in other parts of the country. One needs a good deal of convincing before extending the hours suggested in this way in relation to the London referendum.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para0"></a>As the noble Baroness said, it will cost extra money. I have seen one estimate which puts it at around &#163;0.5 million. I suspect that it would also disrupt the preparations which returning officers have to make for the election and to meet the challenge of running two elections on one day.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para1"></a>We should not consider the matter in isolation. We have in place a government review of electoral procedures which may well consider the issue of hours of voting, alongside a number of other issues. Surely it would be better to consider the whole issue of procedures and hours of voting in relation to voting generally rather than specifically in the case of just one election. We could spend &#163;0.5 million more effectively in terms of public information about the nature of the referendum and the issues to be decided.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para2"></a>At heart, the issue that will most get people to the ballot box is the degree to which people in London feel it is important. That does not rest on whether there is an extra hour in the morning or evening, it rests on the importance of having a mayor and elected assembly in the city. That is what will get people to the ballot box, not this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ludford: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, opened his remarks by referring to the inconvenience for tellers of having to stay at polling stations until 10 p.m. I venture to suggest that the convenience of tellers is not the issue. It is the convenience of voters that is the point. In a world, particularly London, where supermarkets are open all night, or certainly till late in the evening, it is strange that our democracy should lag behind in terms of convenience for citizens.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, made the point, if I did not misunderstand him, that if people think it important enough, they will make sure that they get to vote. I should have thought the more interested they are, the more they wish to vote and the more they wish to express opinions, the more frustrated they might be if they turn up, as my noble friend Lady Hamwee suggested, on their way to work and find polling stations do not open until 8 a.m.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para4"></a>The noble Lord may be right, there may be implications for future elections if voting hours are looked at. But this time we want the maximum turnout, as the Minister rightly stressed at numerous points, we want the maximum support and consent of Londoners and it is important that Londoners are able to vote in the greatest possible numbers. They may find it strange that they were not given the best opportunity to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare: </B>   My Lords, I read carefully the Minister's speech on Second Reading. I wonder whether she will be able to tell us, when she comes to the Dispatch Box, how many people or what percentage of people voted between the hours of 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. in the general election. She kindly said she would look into that. During that speech she <P>


<a name="column_358"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 358</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>also said that she would tell us of other ideas that she had to ensure that people realised that this was happening and in particular the way in which proxies would be held. I only remind her of those matters because, rather than making a long speech saying that that is what I want, I shall assume that the answers will be in her speech.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_time0"></A><H5>5.30 p.m.  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-11_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, that is my cue. As has been said, I do not think there is any debate within the House about the ends with which we are concerned. We all wish to maximise participation in the referendum and in elections generally. We are talking about the means and the priority for resources as well as the most appropriate way forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para5"></a>We are committed to a major publicity campaign advertising the referendum and the ways in which people can vote. It will make clear the possibilities for proxy and postal voting. At an earlier stage of the debate the noble Lord, Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare, asked about the circumstances in which people will be eligible for a proxy or postal vote. I explained that those eligibilities had recently been made more extensive and easier and that we would be publicising the ability to claim a postal or proxy vote.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para6"></a>We shall incorporate that information in the leaflet that will go to every London household. It might amuse the noble Lord to know that my 18 year-old son received a birthday card this week from the local borough. On the back it said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If you are going to be away on 7th May"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para7"></a>I can assure the House that this relates to local elections; it is not anticipating anything--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"then you can apply for a postal vote or have someone vote for you. Simply call the above number and we will help you make the necessary arrangements". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

Earlier it said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"You don't need proof of identity. It is hassle free". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

The publicity is therefore already starting in that regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para8"></a>I return to the undertaking that I gave at Committee stage that I would look carefully at the question of disruption, the difficulties and the voting patterns. Extending polling hours would disrupt local authority preparations and add significantly to the costs of the referendum, with no guarantee of higher turnout as a result. Furthermore, the amendment would not allow us to make best use of the resources we have available to maximise the opportunity for Londoners to vote.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para9"></a>Before I address the amendment in more detail, perhaps I can respond to the points raised in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, on a similar amendment concerning the arrangements for a debate on the draft secondary legislation arising under this Bill. I am sure that noble Lords will understand that the use of secondary legislation to make detailed provision in respect of electoral matters is well precedented. The secondary legislation to which the noble Lord referred in Committee will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. The House will therefore have an opportunity to debate and approve the secondary legislation concerning arrangements for the referendum.
<P>


<a name="column_359"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 359</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para10"></a>I realise that that does not provide scope for amending the Order in Council, which was the main anxiety raised. However, I emphasise again that we have placed the draft secondary legislation in the Library for consultation and are happy to receive comments on that draft.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para11"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare, reminded the House, I said that I would look to see whether there was any available evidence of voting patterns and flows to see exactly when people cast their votes in elections. I have to report back that the data in London is limited. However, the figures we found indicated that in the last general election turnout in the three London parliamentary constituencies for which figures were available--the three Ealing constituencies--between the hours of seven and eight in the morning and nine and 10 in the evening numbers were below the average for the rest of the day. Taken together, something over 6 per cent. of those voting throughout the day did so between seven and eight in the morning and something over 5 per cent. between nine and 10 at night.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para12"></a>Noble Lords who have canvassed in elections will know--my noble friend Lord Hunt mentioned this--that the figures for the last hour of polling tend to reflect the efforts of canvassers to get people out to vote in the last hour, whatever hour that may be. That can happen whether the last hour is between eight and nine or nine and 10. It does not strike me therefore that that makes an overwhelming case for special arrangements to be put in place to extend polling hours in this instance, particularly when we consider the administrative costs of such a measure, its potential impact on other aspects of the referendum and local elections and the ready availability of absent votes for those who cannot vote at any other time. I must stress again that not all of those voting between seven and eight and nine and 10 do so because they cannot vote at any other time
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para13"></a>We are seeking to hold an efficient combined poll. In drawing up our proposals we have greatly appreciated the hard work and co-operation of London local authorities and returning officers in preparing for the poll. Their views deserve our attention. Mr. David Wechsler, the chief executive of Croydon, in his capacity as chair of the Working Party of London Chief Executives on Electoral Matters--a group which represents all London returning officers--wrote to my honourable friend the Minister for London expressing his concern about discussion in Committee in relation to extending polling hours. In his letter he sets out a number of objections. In particular, he highlights the delay and higher costs that would arise. Subject to his agreement, I shall be happy to put a copy of that letter in the Library of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para14"></a>Those are the considered views of the working group representing all returning officers in London. They are concerned, as are we, about extending polling hours. Amendment No. 2 would disrupt meticulous preparations and add significantly to costs for what we believe would be a limited return in terms of increased turnout. The chair of the Association of London Government, Mr. Toby Harris, also wrote to the <P>


<a name="column_360"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 360</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Minister for London to express his concerns, again in relation to the increased costs and delay in getting out the results.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para15"></a>Local authorities calculated that increasing polling hours would lead to additional costs--hiring staff for additional hours and extending the rent of polling stations and count venues comes to about 8p per elector--of some &#163;400,000 or &#163;500,000. That represents an increase of almost 50 per cent. on the total budget that we have available for referendum administration. That money will have to come from somewhere. Local authorities and returning officers would rightly resist such a burden falling upon them. The only alternative would be to use the limited resources set aside for other aspects of the referendum, particularly the publicity. I do not believe that that would be desirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para16"></a>It is crucial--we debated this at great length at an earlier stage--that people are informed about the referendum, about the detail of the proposals and that they can come to informed conclusions on the issues on which they will be voting. I would be reluctant to cut back on that exercise of informing the population. As I said earlier, we intend our campaign to focus on reaching those who may need an absent vote; those who may not be able to get to a polling station whatever hour it is open; and those who may not be able to get there before seven in the morning because they would need to be there at six in the morning.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-11_para17"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, said that we have a 24-hour society. No extension will cover everybody's convenience in terms of personal attendance. That is why it is important to make the option of absent voting well known, so that there is a high turnout in that regard.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the Minister will allow me to intervene. I apologise for not warning her that I would bring up this matter. She used the words "our campaign". I hope that it will be a campaign in which all sides of the House can join on equal terms, that it will not look as though it is a campaign being promoted by 10 Downing Street or by certain Ministers in the Labour Party in the Lower House and that those of us who are just as interested as they are will be allowed to express our views. We will not have the &#163;500,000 to spend that the Minister mentioned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-12_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare, tempts me to talk about campaigns and the effectiveness of the campaigning by individuals and parties as well as the Government. I should make it clear that the campaign about which I am talking involves informing people about the election taking place. It is factual, non-partisan campaigning. It is not campaigning for a yes or no vote or for a particular candidate. It is a campaign to inform people about the election which, I believe, is correctly government responsibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para0"></a>In that very limited, specific and non-partisan campaigning--I hope that a variety of individuals and groups will be involved in the referendum campaign as in the local government election campaign--I believe that we have made a correct assessment of where limited <P>


<a name="column_361"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 361</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>funds should best be applied. We have a fixed budget for the referendum drawn up, bearing in mind constraints on public expenditure. We have taken the view that the best use of available funds is to have a substantial absent-vote campaign. Such a campaign may also have valuable spin-offs for other elections, for example, for people who experience difficulty in attending polling stations. They may realise for the first time just how easy it is to obtain an absent vote and to apply for it in subsequent elections. That would do much more for extending democracy than simply a one-off extension of hours in this particular referendum.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para1"></a>On the broader issue, the Government are committed to improving access to democracy. Last week the Government launched a review of electoral procedures. The working party charged with carrying out the review includes representatives of central and local government and of the main political parties. In that context, clear recommendations will emerge on improving people's experience of participating in the democratic process. Some of the wider issues that have been brought to bear in this debate will be properly covered there. That is the proper avenue for those kinds of areas to be addressed. In view of what I have said, I urge the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-12_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I take the point that work is being carried out on electoral procedures. With some reluctance, I shall not push for an alteration as there might be further alterations very close at hand in the pipeline.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said that he had drawn the short straw in having to be outside a polling station between 9 and 10.00 p.m. It is an even shorter straw to have to run a committee room, trying to get people to continue working between those hours. That is my experience. But I shall volunteer for that. I do not discount the point about cost and hours. That could lead one to ask why in general elections and European elections polling hours are two hours longer. I note that the Minister understands the thrust of that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para3"></a>She said that the application is not hassle-free. It is not very difficult, but it has to be made early. I believe it has to be 13 working days before the election. I have checked rather quickly so I might be wrong, although I do not think so. On this occasion it will mean an application by 20th April. That is the Monday following the week in which Easter Monday falls. In other words, that will be the week after the Easter holidays. I also guess that it will fall within some school holidays. Those who are able to be away for Easter are likely to be absent until that weekend.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para4"></a>There is the hard work that the political parties will do besides the information published in the press. People are unlikely to catch up with the need to make an application until it is too late to do so. I was fascinated by the figures available from Ealing. They were 6 per cent. and 5 per cent.--11 per cent. overall. Some of those people may have voted at other times, but that appears to me to be far too large a percentage to discount. I hope that the expressions of concern raised at various stages of this Bill on this matter, even if they are not to have any effect on the conduct of the polls <P>


<a name="column_362"></a>

<A NAME="80129-12_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee </B>   moved Amendment No. 3:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 2, line 30, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) Where the polls referred to in subsection (1) are taken on the same day registered electors may apply to vote by post or proxy at the referendum and the election on a single form.").<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment refers to a related matter. It is a probing amendment regarding the application form to be completed by electors who apply for absent votes. The Minister has advocated the use of the absent voting procedure. The published forms ask if the applicant requires an absent vote either in general or for particular elections.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para7"></a>I raise the point because I understand that when the county and general elections coincided, there was some confusion. Two forms were required from voters, one for each election. It may be that the point was not considered early enough in the arrangements for the elections. I am sure the Minister will agree that it is important to make the application as easy and as straightforward as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para8"></a>I can well imagine voters saying, "I have filled in that form". The proxy will go to the polling station or open the envelope for the postal ballot, and find only one ballot paper. I do not believe any noble Lords would want to see that situation. I hope that the Minister can give some assurances about necessary steps being taken, which I would not wish to see on the face of the Bill. Alternatively, perhaps she can give an assurance that if the box for the local government election is ticked, that refers to the referendum for London, if that takes place on the same day. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-12_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I hope that I can reassure the noble Baroness on this point. I understand her concerns. We would certainly not wish the circumstances she described to occur.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para9"></a>This amendment seeks to ensure that people can apply for a postal or proxy vote for the referendum and the local election on a single form. I hope to explain to the House why this amendment is unnecessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para10"></a>We have made quite clear in the secondary legislation in Part I, Schedule 2, paragraph 7(1) that anyone who applies for a postal or proxy vote for either the referendum or the local election will automatically be sent an equivalent postal or proxy vote to participate in the other poll, unless they specify that they do not want one. Therefore, there is no need for this amendment. If people apply for one or the other, they will get both. They need not of course exercise their vote if they do not wish to do so. But we are determined that no one should miss out on their chance to vote in both polls. That will be made clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para11"></a>As I said earlier on in talking about opening hours--I note the point that the noble Baroness made earlier about the timeframe for applying for postal and proxy votes--we hope that because people will be getting <P>


<a name="column_363"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 363</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information about that well in advance of the poll at the same time as information about the referendum, it will encourage them to apply early on and in good time. With those assurances in mind, I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to withdraw her amendment.

<A NAME="80129-12_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, that reply is extremely helpful. I am sorry that I did not spot that detail in the draft of the secondary legislation, which I have read. It is the sort of document which causes one's eyes to glaze over a little. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para12"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish </B>   moved Amendment No. 4:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 4, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>Independent Statutory Commission </B></center><BR>
(" .--(1) The Secretary of State shall appoint an independent Statutory Commission, which shall monitor the conduct of the referendum provided for under this Act, and shall, in the light of the referendum and of the referendums carried out under the Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Act 1997, draw up recommendations for the conduct of future referendums, having regard to the 1996 Report of the Commission on the Conduct of Referendums.
<BR>
(2) Any report containing recommendations under this section shall be laid before each House of Parliament.").<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10. Some noble Lords may recognise these amendments. I see the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate in his place. He will certainly recognise them. They are exactly the same amendments that I proposed to the Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Bill. I shall try to shorten my arguments although I notice a number of noble Lords in the House who were not present when I advanced them as regards the earlier Bill, including the Minister. As a new Minister is to answer me this time, I live in the hope that I may get a slightly more positive answer than I received from the Lord Advocate. However, the very fact that the noble and learned Lord is here suggests that he will ensure that the noble Baroness does not stray from the text.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para14"></a>We are moving towards the third referendum in less than a year, with the probability of more to come. I shall not go into the detail of whether referendums sit comfortably in our Westminster model. It is a model that has served us well over time and I am pretty sceptical about the use of referendums inside our model of parliamentary democracy. However, we know that the Government intend to have a number of referendums in the future. As their so-called "reform"--I prefer to say "change"--to the constitution is of a very piecemeal fashion, who knows what other piece they may decide to try to change? If they have a grand plan, they are certainly not telling us.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para15"></a>If we are to continue to have referendums, it really is time that we had a proper generic referendums Act. We should not conduct each referendum piecemeal. The noble Baroness would not get into problems such as <P>


<a name="column_364"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 364</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those she encountered earlier this afternoon on the question in the referendum if she took my advice on board.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para16"></a>The Constitution Unit and the Electoral Reform Society established a Commission on the Conduct of Referendums in April 1996. Those two bodies are not naturally in my part of the political spectrum but, as I said in August, if we are to have referendums, I very much agree with the commission's conclusions. The commission's briefing paper states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The conduct of referendums should be entrusted to a statutory independent body, accountable to Parliament, in order to ensure maximum confidence in the legitimacy of the results. This could be a free-standing commission--a 'Referendum Commission'; or an Electoral Commission, if one were established. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The responsibilities of an Independent Commission could include: advising on the wording of the referendum question; liaising with and funding campaigning organisations; the fair presentation of public information and equitable access to the broadcast media; and the organisation of the poll ... </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> A generic Referendum Act could establish an Independent Commission and a statutory framework for the efficient, fair and consistent conduct of referendums. Those matters which will be different in each referendum and are likely to be of Parliamentary concern could be the subject of primary legislation on each occasion".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

 I shall probably quote from that document once or twice again.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para17"></a>I stress that the commission's membership was by no means narrowly drawn. Perhaps I may mention a few of those who served on it. It was chaired by Sir Patrick Nairne; its vice-chairman was Dr. David Butler and, to take just three names at something like random, the membership also comprised the noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton; the noble Lord, Lord Holme of Cheltenham, and Mr. John Whittingdale, MP, from my party. The commission was broadly based and its conclusions were very clear. I do not think that those conclusions represented a minority view. I hope that the Government will give me some reassurance that they will address this issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para18"></a>When I raised such issues in August, I was told that I could not expect the Government to establish a commission in the time available between August and the holding of the Scottish and Welsh referendums. I was told that that was impossible; and that was more or less that. I have no doubt that the noble Baroness will say the same thing now, but I must advise her that I do not accept that argument now because the Government have had since last August to deal with the issue and to come forward with a more substantial and more positive reply than that which they gave then. I am afraid that the same argument simply will not do today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para19"></a>It is interesting to note that if a proper Bill were introduced we could discuss then some of the issues that I raised in August. I am raising one or two of them again today, but I could certainly have kept the House going all evening (if I had chosen to do so) by tabling a series of amendments covering a variety of issues that should be properly addressed. As happened last time, the noble Baroness will have to bring forward orders to change the Representation of the People Act. As I said previously, you will only be able to understand those orders if you sit in the Library with a copy of the <P>


<a name="column_365"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 365</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Representation of the People Act beside you and work your way through it. The orders will change legislation which Parliament passed and which was designed specifically for general elections with parties and candidates. That legislation is to be changed in a piecemeal way to meet the circumstances of referendums. That is not satisfactory.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para20"></a>An independent commission could address a number of issues. Indeed, paragraph 47 of the report outlines them. It refers to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"advising on the wording of the question; allocating funding to campaign groups; liaising with and acting as moderator between any campaign groups; acting in an ombudsman role to deal with any complaints; monitoring balanced access to the broadcast media; providing public information, including a balance statement of the opposing arguments; supervising the organisation for each polling station; counting and declaration arrangements". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

All of those matters could be dealt with by the commission. That is the first part of my argument.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para21"></a>The second part of my argument is that a generic Act would mean that guidance could be drawn up. Guideline No. 1 states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Guidance should be drawn up dealing with organisational, administrative and procedural matters associated with holding a referendum. Established guidelines should include fixed rules for some matters (for example, the organisation of the poll, the election machinery and the count). For other matters, on which it is impossible to determine rules in advance (for example, wording the question), the guidance should state how a decision should be reached". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para22"></a>It is not an elegant way to conduct a referendum if part of the argument here and in another place relates to what the question should be. Having sat through the arguments on why there should be two questions in the referendum Bill relating to Scotland which the Government advanced against amendments which some of us tabled to provide that there should be only one question, it was most interesting to listen to the Government turning that argument on its head in relation to London. A commission could sort out just such issues. They would therefore no longer be matters of party argument on the Floor of the House with decisions having to be made in the Division Lobbies and, dare I say it, the Government being defeated. My suggestion would hugely help in any future referendums which the Government intend to hold.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para23"></a>I am not asking for such an electoral commission to be set up; I am using this amendment, as I used the same amendment in the summer, as a trigger to start the process. I am saying, "Let us have a commission that can inspect how the London referendum works. Let us have a commission that can look back at how the Scottish and Welsh referendums worked and then propose to government--and government can come to Parliament with--a generic Bill before we have the next referendum". I believe that that will be on the day that Tony and Gordon agree that we ought to join the single currency. I hope that we shall have a generic Act before then and that we shall not have to go through the same procedures then as today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para24"></a>I turn now to my three other amendments. They would not need to be discussed if we had an Act such as I have suggested. Amendment No. 8 is straightforward. I raised the same argument last time and I received <P>


<a name="column_366"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 366</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>assurances, but I am afraid that I shall have to raise the same points again and get assurances again that no public money will be paid to any organisation established to campaign for either side on the question and that no civil servants shall engage on the side of--I presume--the Government's case in any referendum. I received perfectly satisfactory reassurances from the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, last time and I hope that I shall receive such assurances this time, but if we had a generic Act, I would be saved asking the same questions every time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para25"></a>The same point is made on broadcasting. Guideline No. 17 states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A balance should be maintained between the 'Yes' and 'No' viewpoints rather than between the different political parties. Broadcasters should be encouraged to provide a limited amount of airtime for setting out the arguments for each option in the referendum. The content of such broadcasts would be the responsibility of any formally recognised campaign organisations. In the absence of such organisations the Independent Commission should appoint production companies to produce such broadcasts. Party political broadcasts should not normally be transmitted during the referendum campaign". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

I would be grateful if the noble Baroness could provide me with assurances in that regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-12_para26"></a>In a contribution from the noble Baroness a few moments ago I noted that the Government had set in train a review of electoral procedures. I would be perfectly willing to withdraw my new clauses if I received an assurance from the Minister--normally, the Government are teased about reviews--that the whole subject would be seriously considered and that the Government intended to act upon it; otherwise, I have to say that the procrastinating reply that I received in August will not do this evening. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-13_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, these amendments address important issues about the conduct of the referendum. I hope to be able to reassure the House as to how we intend to proceed and make clear to the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, that these amendments are unnecessary. Amendment No. 4 seeks to establish an independent statutory commission which would monitor the conduct of the referendum and make recommendations as to the conduct of future referendums. I was not present for all of the prolonged discussions on the referendum Bills for Scotland and Wales, but I am well aware of the keen interest that the noble Lord has taken in these matters. I hope that he will not be too disappointed when he discovers that I shall not respond any more favourably to his amendment than did my noble friends at that time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-13_para0"></a>The noble Lord is right to anticipate that the Government cannot accept Amendment No. 4 because of some practical problems concerning the London referendum. An independent commission would need careful preparation: a clearly defined remit and so on. No doubt there would be pressure for inter-party consultation on its role. It would not be possible to have such arrangements in place in time for a referendum on 7th May. Any delay in the date of the referendum would lose the advantages of a combined poll, add about <P>


<a name="column_367"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 367</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>&#163;3 million to the costs and diminish the advantage in terms of turn-out both for the local elections and the referendum.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-13_para1"></a>I should like to make clear that the Government's position does not depend simply on the issue of timing. My noble and learned friend the Lord Advocate does not need to be here to keep me in line on this matter. I totally agree with the stance that he took during Committee stage on the Scotland and Wales Acts that the Government see no need to set up such a commission. Each referendum is different. There are bound to be different arrangements appropriate to referendums of different scale. Current arrangements whereby Parliament makes specific provision for each referendum have served us well in Scotland and Wales and I believe will do so in London.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-13_para2"></a>I do not agree with the noble Lord that his amendment would obviate the need for debate on specific issues. The prolonged debate on the wording of the question in this Bill shows that Parliament takes a keen interest in matters such as the wording of a proposition in a referendum. The answers to issues such as how many questions should be on a ballot paper or their wording will depend not on generalities but the issues in the particular referendum in question. It is quite right that Parliament should have the opportunity to consider the legislation which provides for each referendum, to debate the detail and press the Government to explain their proposals. I do not believe that this amendment should be accepted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-13_para3"></a>I turn to the amendments relating to broadcasting. We believe that these are unnecessary given that all broadcasters are obliged by law to maintain due accuracy and impartiality in reporting any matters of political controversy or current public policy. I do not believe that it is appropriate to legislate in this Bill on this matter. To add further provision on top of the long standing general obligation or to give a new role to an independent commission would serve merely to muddy the waters. The broadcasters are answerable to their independent regulators and the courts for satisfactory compliance with their duty to maintain due accuracy and impartiality. I am confident that the existing framework of regulation will be quite adequate to ensure that impartiality is respected during this referendum campaign.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-13_para4"></a>Amendment No. 10 would require the independent commission to monitor the publication and distribution of campaign material. Amendment No. 8 would prohibit the use of public funds to fund campaign organisations. We have made it absolutely clear that we do not intend to provide any state aid to campaign either for or against the proposal. I am happy to repeat that undertaking to the House today. We do not believe that it is feasible to try to identify umbrella campaign organisations as potential candidates for financial support. If people wish to oppose or campaign in favour of our proposals they are free to do so. But the Government will spend their money on ensuring that people are fully informed about the referendum so that they are able to exercise their right to vote. Government-funded publicity will be factual and neutral. A summary version of the White Paper will be distributed to every household and there will be other <P>


<a name="column_368"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 368</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>initiatives to ensure that everyone in London is aware of the issues. Information about absent voting in particular will be integral to the campaign.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-13_para5"></a>The creation of an independent commission is not necessary to ensure that the proposed referendum on the GLA is both fairly conducted and effective. Obviously, campaign material produced by organisations either pro or anti the proposition put by the Government will not be impartial. Provided that it is within the law--for example, that it is not obscene or libellous--its content is and should remain a matter for those who produce it. Moreover, I see no reason significantly to delay the holding of this referendum for which the people of London indicated their support at the general election when two important fair and successful referendums have already been conducted during the course of this Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-13_para6"></a>We do not believe therefore that these amendments are necessary. We have made our position quite clear on questions of campaign funding and will follow the precedent set in Scotland and Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-13_para7"></a>As far as concerns the specific issue of Civil Service conduct, the Cabinet Office will publish clear guidelines well in advance of the referendum. They will be based on the normal rules which apply to civil servants as respects political impartiality. Similar guidelines were in place in Scotland and Wales and I believe that they proved to be wholly sufficient for the task.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-13_para8"></a>I hope that I have reassured the House that the provisions in place will ensure that the referendum is conducted in a fair and proper manner. I urge the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for the assurances that she gave about the Civil Service, funding and broadcasting. I expected the assurances as I received them when we discussed the Scotland and Wales Bills. I am grateful to her for giving them to me on this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-13_para9"></a>However, I am not nearly so happy with the answer provided by the noble Baroness to Amendment No. 4. In my original contribution I said that the Government had had since last August to prepare for an independent statutory commission if that was what they agreed to. It seems perfectly clear--perhaps a little clearer from the reply of the noble Baroness than in August--that the Government have no sympathy with the idea of either an independent statutory commission for referendums or a generic referendums Act. I believe that an Act would be helpful. Of course, for each referendum a piece of primary legislation would be needed, but it would be a small piece of primary legislation that simply slotted into the generic Act. That Act would govern all other issues that the orders govern under the Representation of the People Act. The argument of the noble Baroness could be applied to the Representation of the People Act. Each time there was a general election another series of rules could be brought forward. We have not gone down that road, but have used a more sensible method.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-13_para10"></a>I am not always, although frequently, persuaded by my own arguments, but on this occasion I am persuaded by the arguments in the report of the commission. The more <P>


<a name="column_369"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>I read them the more persuasive I believe they are. I shall not be put off quite as readily as I was in August. I shall demonstrate my seriousness about this matter by asking for the opinion of the House. Whatever the outcome, next time the Government propose a referendum I sincerely hope that they will between now and then take the kind of steps that the commission has proposed. I wish to test the opinion of the House.

<P>
<A NAME="80129-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, the change is that with the Welsh referendum some serious problems arose. They did not arise on the "No" side; they arose on the "Yes" side. The matter was drawn to our attention by no less an organisation than the Caerphilly Constituency Labour Party, which expressed some concern--I have to say in total privacy--and sent letters which, unfortunately, winged their way outside the sacred walls of the Caerphilly Constituency Labour Party to people such as me.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para1"></a>The letter from the secretary, Mr. Lamb, indicates a number of concerns that the constituency Labour Party had about the conduct of the count. The clause relates to the conduct of the count. There were a number of problems. It was concerned, for example, about the information it was given; about where the ballot boxes <P>


<a name="column_371"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 371</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>came from; about the list; and about the way the count was conducted. Although the letter does not say it, I understand from other papers it was concerned that it could not see the official mark.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para2"></a>I suggested in August, in order to be helpful to the Government, that I thought the day of official marks was over and done with. The Government told me that it was not and that they were important. So, they were important. The scrutineer should have been able to see them. The whole question of who were the scrutineers and whether there were enough of them was part and parcel of the same problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para3"></a>The Caerphilly Constituency Labour Party was in the difficult position of having that concern in the constituency of the Secretary of State for Wales. It recognised that and its letter stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Of paramount importance was the fact that the implication of what in our view contravened the Representation of the People Act 1949, 1969 and 1983, and the Referendum Act should not become a formal issue because of our MP's position as Secretary of State for Wales. Ultimately the buck stops at the Welsh Office, and we realise that politically we have to be extremely careful because of Ron's position there". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

I appreciate its concern for "Ron's position", but the issues it raised were important: the number of polling agents; the boxes and verification not being announced; the counting officer would not allow polling agents to know which were "Yes" and which were "No" allocations; the design of the ballot paper made it almost impossible for polling agents to see official frank marks, to the extent that even the top paper was invariably covered by a counting officer's hand; some supervisors allowed their counting assistants to count haphazardly, with ballot papers being turned face down, upside down--particularly regarding potential spoils--no announcement of the count proper being started in part was made; polling agents were not allowed to check the final bundles; and there was inordinate delay in announcing the result. Out of 145 boxes, after the first 50 boxes or so had been counted, five out of a total of 10 teams were taken off verification, thus prolonging the count.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para4"></a>I do not want to prolong my remarks, but those matters are all of concern. The biggest concern was that doubts arose that evening about how to count papers which were not marked with a cross. It was easy enough when in answer to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Do you agree that there should be a Welsh Assembly?" </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

people put "Yes" or "No"instead of a cross. That was clear. The problem arose with "I do not agree" with the answer "Yes" or "No", because there was a double negative. There was some doubt about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para5"></a>During the course of the count the officers in that counting station asked for and received advice about what to do. It was advice which was not transmitted to everyone judging at all the counts throughout Wales. That is a serious point, which is why I tabled Amendment No. 5 which provides that one should not be able to go to court unless:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"different guidance has been received by the counting officers in one or more areas on the conduct of the count". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_372"></a>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para6"></a>Amendment No. 6 relates to observers admitted to the count not receiving full access. If the Caerphilly Labour Party had not been in the embarrassing position of having the Secretary of State for Wales as its MP--it is doubly embarrassing because that portion of the Welsh Labour Party seems to have been in favour of the "Yes" vote--I suspect that the matter might have been taken further. It could not have been taken any further because of the clause in the Scotland and Wales legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para7"></a>I am concerned that if something like that arose with the London referendum, no one aggrieved who believed that there was a legitimate point to be made would have recourse to the courts if your Lordships pass the clause unamended. With that explanation of why I tabled the amendments--as a fall-back--I suggest leaving out the clause altogether so that people could challenge in the courts on any grounds, not just the two I exempt. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-14_spmin0"></A><B>The Solicitor-General  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </B>  My Lords, I hope that I shall be able to establish that the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, are misplaced. As he pointed out, the purpose of Clause 6 is the same as that of an identical clause in the Referendum Act 1975, the Scotland and Wales Act 1978 and the Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Act 1997. The aim of the provision is to ensure that the Government can respond without delay to referendum results.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para8"></a>As my noble friend Lady Hayman explained in Committee, the clause is designed to prevent any, save serious, challenges to the certification of votes or ballot papers under the Bill. Any challenge which was to be made in court would be time-consuming. So long as there was an application before the court, there would be considerable doubt about the fate of the legislation establishing the GLA. In effect, the position would be politically frozen until such a court challenge were brought to an end. The provision is designed to exclude all, save serious, challenges to the certification of votes or ballot papers under the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para9"></a>We recognise that the clause does not prevent all possibility of legal challenge in connection with the certification of referendum votes. The courts are rightly jealous of their jurisdiction, and look carefully at provisions which seek to oust their jurisdiction. There is a substantial body of case law, including an important decision of this House in its judicial capacity, concerning the proper interpretation of such statutory provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para10"></a>Should any legal proceedings be brought challenging the certificates of the chief counting officer, or a counting officer, it would be for the courts to decide, having regard to the case law and the particular circumstances of the case, whether a challenge could be entertained in the light of Clause 6. A balance is being struck between the clause stopping challenges which are not serious, but with the court having power to investigate those challenges which might be serious.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para11"></a>I have taken some trouble to explain what the clause means, because I can see that, on the face of it, its terms are all-embracing. It may be helpful if I remind your <P>


<a name="column_373"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 373</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lordships that there is a presumption that Parliament legislates in the full knowledge of the existing state of the law. Clear and express provision would be needed in an enactment to over-rule the effect of the case law to which I have just referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para12"></a>It is therefore within the conventions for a well-precedented clause such as this one to be enacted in the knowledge that it is not the end of the matter. Like all other similar provisions, it is subject to the construction of the courts and the intervention of the courts in those cases that the courts think are serious enough.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, appeared to suggest that he was satisfied with the answers that my noble and learned friend the Lord Advocate had given to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, because he introduced the amendments on the basis that things have changed because of the position in Wales. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, identified a number of matters which he said gave cause for concern. The most important one that he identified being advice given on how to deal with something other than a cross in relation to those who wanted to vote "No".
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para14"></a>The position, as the Secretary of State said, is that there were 22 counting areas in Wales. In relation to the problem of a cross rather than a "No" or a "No" rather than a cross--I cannot remember which--the chief counting officer gave advice which was disseminated to 20 out of 22 areas on the night. In respect of those two areas where it was not disseminated there may have been a few hundred "no" votes which were not recorded in accordance with the advice given by the chief counting officer. It would not therefore have affected the result. Moreover, it would have been most unsettling for there to be a court challenge that would have not made any difference.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para15"></a>In my respectful submission that is a very good example of why one needs a clause like this. If there are more serious complaints about the conduct of the Welsh referendum, the Scottish referendum or any other referendum, including this one, to which this clause applies then, as I have made clear, this clause would not prevent the courts considering whether or not such a challenge should be considered by those courts. I believe it is a sensible balance, I believe it permits the matter to be dealt with quickly and efficiently but gives the court a residual jurisdiction in relation to serious cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para16"></a>Perhaps I may turn to the particular amendments proposed and deal with them very briefly. First, with Amendment No. 5 the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, seeks to insert the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"except in circumstances where different guidance has been received by the counting officers in one or more areas on the conduct of the count". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

That, in my respectful submission, is an ill-conceived suggestion for an amendment. The effect of it will be to make the courts consider that the only circumstances in which they can intervene is where different guidance has been received by the counting <P>


<a name="column_374"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 374</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>officers in one or more areas. On the basis of the speech the noble Lord made that is the last thing that he would want. Moreover there may well be good reasons in relation to the London count as to why different guidance should be given in one area as opposed to another.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para17"></a>I take just one example. The City of London, which is one of the areas for the poll in Greater London, will not be having local elections. It would therefore be sensible that different instructions or guidance be given there as to how the poll should be conducted in other areas where there will be local elections.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para18"></a>Having said that, I would say that it is my hope that the chief counting officer in the London referendum will issue guidance to counting officers well in advance of the count and that he will consult with experienced returning officers before doing so. Moreover, if we are talking about guidance aimed at ensuring consistency in the way in which doubtful ballot papers are to be judged, clearly I would hope that the guidance given will be the same for all boroughs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para19"></a>More than that I cannot say without entering into matters which will, under this Bill, be the responsibility of the chief counting officer. But noble Lords can be reassured that we have the problems well in mind. It is on that basis that I urge the noble Lord to withdraw this first amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para20"></a>As to the second amendment, the particular circumstance which he suggests should be an exception to Clause 6 is where observers admitted to the count have not received full access to scrutinise all aspects of the count as they are entitled to do under the Representation of the People Act. The aim expressed in this is an aim with which I am fully in agreement. We have provided in the draft secondary legislation currently available in the Library of the House for the appointment of observers to scrutinise both the poll and the count. We have already included in it a provision which is absent from previous referendum legislation enabling counting observers to be present at the dispatch and receipt of postal ballot papers. They will, of course, also be present at the count itself and, in general, all those things which are normally required to be done in the presence of counting agents at an election are, at the referendum, to be done in the presence of these specially appointed counting observers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para21"></a>Again, however, inserting the exception, will have the effect of limiting the effects of the circumstances in which the court would intervene to those referred to in the exception rather than to those cases which the court itself determines are sufficiently serious to justify intervention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para22"></a>There are three short points in relation to the appointment of observers. First, if organisations campaigning for a particular referendum outcome want to have counting observers they must invite the counting officer to appoint their representatives. I understand that in some cases organisations in Wales failed to respond to counting officers' requests for nominations with the result that they were not <P>


<a name="column_375"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 375</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>represented. Therefore, it is for each campaign side to ensure that they have made the request to the counting officer to have representatives present.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para23"></a>Secondly, in view of the terms of the proposed amendment, it seems to me worth reminding your Lordships that there is nothing even in ordinary election law which says that every counting agent has the right to observe everything. Electoral legislation says that counting agents are entitled to attend the count which should be arranged so that they have all reasonable facilities to observe the proceedings and that certain things must be done in their presence if they have attended for that purpose.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para24"></a>The present clause is only apparently an all-embracing exclusion of legal proceedings. For the reasons I have indicated Amendments 5 and 6, far from having the effect of extending the circumstances in which the court can intervene, will, I believe, limit them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-14_para25"></a>Finally, if what the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, described as his fall-back position were adopted--namely, to leave out Clause 6 altogether--there would not be the balance between preventing non-serious applications, but on the other hand leaving the court with a residual discretion. I therefore ask whether, upon reflection, the noble Lord will consider withdrawing all three amendments.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80129-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for his detailed reply. I have listened to it with great care and I can divide it into two parts: one part is the same reply we received from the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate in August, which satisfied us at the time, that the courts would still have a role in certain circumstances. I am pleased to have a repeat of that assurance. On the second part, which really arose from the problems in Caerphilly, it has been useful to have on record what really ought to have been done. I hope that similar problems will not happen for any local Labour parties in London at the referendum on London.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para0"></a>In trying to keep my remarks short I omitted to say that another of the complaints was that the observers were not allowed into the postal vote part. I was therefore delighted with the assurance from the noble and learned Lord that it would be clear that observers will be able to attend the postal vote, sending out and opening, as they do at General Elections. I thank the noble and learned Lord for that assurance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para1"></a>It is an interesting point. The noble and learned Lord suggested to me that in Wales it would not have made any difference. I do not think that is the point. These things cannot be done by looking backwards. Nobody knew that it would make no difference. Indeed, a lot of the problems in Caerphilly arose <P>


<a name="column_376"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 376</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because the local Member of Parliament, the Secretaryof State, declared that it was the 6,000 majority in Caerphilly that actually delivered the "yes" vote for his party in Wales by a margin of 6,700. How he actually knew that that was the case is quite hard to decide, given the fact that it was a bigger area. But never mind; he said that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para2"></a>I know that I will be accused of being theoretical but let us assume for a moment that it had been even closer in Wales. Then I think the importance of the points made by the local Labour party there are underlined. There should not be any doubt about the result. It is interesting that the story started in a Scottish newspaper. I suspect that the Welsh newspapers did not want to touch it for a variety of reasons. However, when the Scotsman started the story, it raised very serious issues which deserved to be aired both in the press and in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para3"></a>The noble and learned Lord will be pleased to hear that I accept his assurances. I hope that the words which he spoke on the two specific issues will be heeded. I am grateful to him for his remarks about postal votes. I am persuaded by the noble and learned Lord's argument about the general principle and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>

<BR>
( ) specifying the electoral systems for the purposes of the election of members of any assembly and of any separately elected mayor established following the referendum held by virtue of Part I").<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: I return to the issue of the electoral systems to be used in the elections, if there are to be elections, following the referendum.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para8"></a>At the last stage, we approached this matter in the context of the powers of the Local Government Commission and my noble friend and I realised that we had concentrated particularly on the systems to be used for the election of members of the assembly. I shall use this occasion to put on record our concerns about ensuring the fairest systems, both for the election of the assembly members and also for the directly-elected mayor, if there is to be one.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para9"></a>It may be that the Minister will tell me that since the direction to be given under Clause 7 will specify the number of electoral areas and the number of members, that direction cannot be given unless full consideration has been given to the electoral system to be applied. The need to reflect the size, cultural diversity and general differences across London needs to be recognised and I believe that a proportional system argues for quite large constituencies in order that that proportionality can be reflected.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para10"></a>For example, if the constituencies for the London authority are based on two or three boroughs, there would be problems of fairness because of the different sizes of the London boroughs. I do not choose the <P>


<a name="column_377"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 377</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>example of a constituency coterminous with any London borough because I believe that the Government have ruled that out.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para11"></a>As regards the mayor, it is important that voters are able to express their full preferences; in other words, to go on voting until they have exhausted their preferences. That may mean voting all the way down a list of eight or 10 candidates. As I have observed before, among other things, it gives one the opportunity to register who is one's least favourite candidate by putting him at the bottom of the list.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para12"></a>More important, a fully preferential system allows everyone to have the opportunity to vote for the winner and to generate something of a feeling of ownership of the result. Even if one's preference for the eventual winner is half way down the list, one has, at least to some extent, signed up to that candidate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para13"></a>In addition, it does not require the voter to make any tactical decisions. Genuine preferences can be expressed all the way down the list.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para14"></a>If the voting system is first-past-the-post, to which we are all so accustomed, it will be entirely possible, given the large number of candidates, for the winner to have the support of a very low proportion of electors. That would be an undesirable outcome. The system to which some people have pointed which is in between, known as the supplementary vote, allows, as I understand it, only two choices. Of course that is a little fairer. It allows a little more expression of preference. But it is more complicated than simply voting one's way down a list. It means that one cannot put one's least favourite candidate at the bottom. It means that one must exclude all but two of the candidates in voting. If the position is that there are two clear favourites in the campaign, voters will have to guess which of those two is most likely to do well; in other words, such a system would not achieve the involvement of electors in the way that other systems may do. I beg to move.

<A NAME="80129-15_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, has returned to the discussion which we had in Committee on the basis that the Local Government Commission should be able to make recommendations on the electoral systems to be used both for the mayor and for the assembly. I accept her point that we dealt mainly with electoral systems for the assembly at an earlier stage and that the argument applies to both.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para15"></a>Perhaps I may take the opportunity to restate why the Government find unacceptable the argument that the commission should have that responsibility. I understand very clearly that the noble Baroness and her party feel strongly about electoral systems. She made those views clear in proposing the amendment today. The Government do not dispute that that is a crucial issue for the assembly and the mayor. In fact, in the Green Paper New Leadership for London, we asked seven separate questions about electoral systems and we are now spending considerable time and effort analysing consultation responses to that Green Paper. <P>


<a name="column_378"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 378</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>We shall set out in the White Paper proposals, after looking at the results of the consultation, as to how the mayor and assembly should be elected. I suggest to the House that the results of that consultation, the details of the electoral system, will be a vital piece of the jigsaw which adds up to people's understanding of the proposition put forward in the referendum.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para16"></a>But this amendment would devolve important questions of policy to the Local Government Commission, asking it to consider issues which are far beyond its remit. The commission is an independent body which advises on boundary issues. There is no case for asking that commission to make recommendations on how the mayor or members of the assembly should be elected. We have said that we shall set out clear proposals on how the election should be conducted, and that quite rightly, the commission will then be asked to provide expert and independent advice on the technical framework necessary to put that policy into practice. That is the right way round. The commission should not be asked to make recommendations beyond its remit on policy issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para17"></a>As I said to the House at an earlier stage, such amendments would make it nearly impossible to write the White Paper. If the commission were to be asked to make recommendations, presumably it would not be acceptable for the Government to pre-empt those recommendations by publishing their own proposals on electoral systems in the White Paper. In turn, that would reduce clarity and certainty as to the basis for the new assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para18"></a>In that case, the people of London would be forced to vote in the referendum without having a clear idea about how the mayor and assembly would be elected. That is not good for democratic choice and I do not believe that it is good for informing clearly and specifically on the Government's proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-15_para19"></a>How the mayor and assembly will be elected are very important issues. I do not dispute that for a moment. However, we believe that they are integral to people having a clear understanding of the proposals which we are putting before them. Therefore, I do not believe that there is a case for asking the Local Government Commission to make recommendations on electoral systems. Such central policy should and will be addressed in the White Paper. On that basis, I urge the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.

We had a full day of deliberations on the first day of the Report stage and the proceedings went on until midnight. At that time we covered 31 amendments. Even allowing for those amendments which are marked on the groupings list as having been previously debated, which is not entirely accurate, there are certainly 33 more amendments to consider this evening.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-16_para5"></a>It is quite inappropriate for us to start on such deliberations at this hour. No more important measure is likely to be before your Lordships' House this Session. At the beginning of the last Parliament we repeatedly sat very late hours. However, after repeated protests, the Rippon Committee, which studied the sitting hours of the House, reported on the matter. After that, the then government loyally abided by those recommendations. But we are now right back to pre-Rippon days in the conduct of this Bill; indeed, that committee might just as well not have reported. I endeavour to protest at our being asked to consider the Bill in this way.

<a name="column_380"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 380</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bill on Report. It was anticipated that that would be quite sufficient. As it happens, a number of us present in the Chamber today remember that our discussions and deliberations on Report took rather a long time and, therefore, a second day was provided by agreement between the usual channels. We do not believe it to be unreasonable to get on with the Bill. Indeed, many of the issues, if not flogged to death, have at least been carefully examined on a number of previous occasions. As I said, we do not believe it to be unreasonable to get on with the proceedings at ten minutes to seven on a bright evening.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   My Lords, I support the sentiments behind the noble and learned Lord's submission. Undoubtedly constitutional Bills of this nature bring forward unexpected problems of considerable difficulty; indeed, we encountered that situation on the first day of the Report stage. Therefore, while I truly appreciate the Minister's wish to get on with the Bill, I hope that he will take to heart the observations that have been made.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-16_para6"></a>I anticipate that many unexpected problems may arise, which will take much longer to debate than originally envisaged, during the course of our consideration of other Bills which come before your Lordships' House this Session. I am sure we all agree that it is thoroughly undesirable to be discussing at midnight constitutional reform of such importance, as was the case on the previous day of the Report stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the Third Reading of the Bill is scheduled for 5th February. Moreover, on the same day, the Third Reading of the Greater London Authority (Referendum) Bill will also take place. On that occasion, could we not come before the latter Bill on the Order Paper so that we can get a clear start?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may also intervene from these Benches. In response to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, my understanding--and this is subject to discussions between the usual channels--is that it is the intention next week that this Bill will be dealt with before the Greater London Authority (Referendum) Bill, which preceded us today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, obviously we could spend a great deal of time discussing how much time we should spend on the legislation and complaining about the lateness of the hour. However, that would not be profitable. I understand the Government's problems in handling their business and, indeed, I have sympathy with them in that respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-16_para7"></a>It is because the Report stage took so long last time that we are here again this evening. It was because the House was so thinly attended on the last occasion--as, indeed, is the case this evening--that I did not move an important amendment on proceedings, but indicated that I would do so on Third Reading. It is for the same reason that I have given advance notice that I shall not <P>


<a name="column_381"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 381</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be moving an important amendment tonight about the human rights commissioner but, again, will do so on Third Reading.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-16_para8"></a>I realise that Third Reading is not normally the occasion to do so, but it seemed to me to be the best way of reconciling the need to get business through with the need for a full debate on important issues. I believe that to be a satisfactory outcome, even though I realise that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, will continue to be unhappy about the situation for quite understandable reasons.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-16_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I shall respond as briefly as I can. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lester; namely, that the longer we spend discussing the timetable the longer the time taken will in fact be. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Henley, and also that made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner. Such matters will be discussed by the usual channels. If we were by some happy chance to go before the London matter next Thursday 5th February--my birthday--then I would be able to bear it with some fortitude.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-16_para13"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, in the immortal words of my old friend the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, who I am sorry to see is not in his place in the Chamber, I can deal with my amendment very shortly. I do not do so because of the way that it has been referred to in the groupings list today, because it is quite wrongly described as already having been debated. I had a discussion with the usual channels about the matter well before lunch and persuaded them that it was wrong. I have confirmed with the noble Lord, Lord Williams, that my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor has been informed that this amendment will be moved; indeed, it had not been moved previously.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-16_para14"></a>Your Lordships will recall earlier attempts to amend Clause 1 so as to make specific reference to Article 13 of the convention which reads:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

Your Lordships will also recall that, when the matter was raised originally in Committee on 18th November, my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor said that the provision gives effect,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to Article 13 by establishing a scheme under which convention rights can be raised before our domestic courts. To that end, remedies are provided in Clause 8. If the concern is to ensure that the Bill provides an exhaustive code of remedies for those whose convention rights have been violated, we believe that Clause 8 already achieves that and that nothing further is needed".--[Official Report, 18/11/97; col. 475.] <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_382"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 382</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor then added, also at col. 475, that if Article 13 were mentioned,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The courts would be bound to ask themselves what was intended beyond the existing scheme of remedies set out in the Bill". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

When the matter came before your Lordships on 19th January at Report stage my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Our objection is that the amendments add nothing to the scheme in the Bill. On the contrary, the only effect they could have is to disturb the carefully crafted structure of the Bill in some unforeseen way. I do not know what the courts would make of amendments which, on the face of it, contain nothing new. I therefore suggest that the amendments would either cause confusion or uncertainty".--[Official Report, 19/1/98; col. 1266.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

One thing which my amendment will not do is to cause confusion or uncertainty because in order to make assurance doubly sure it adds the words of the amendment to Clause 8 of the Bill. It therefore does no violence of any kind to the Bill as it stands. It makes it perfectly clear that all one is seeking to do is to ensure that the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to give full and effective protection to Convention rights" </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

get rid of any doubt as to the overall cover of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-16_para15"></a>I appreciate that my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor takes the view that this is unnecessary and that it is surplusage. I refer him to what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon, said when the matter was before your Lordships on Report on 19th January, in particular at cols. 1267 and 1268 of the Official Report; namely, that there are occasions when additions put in for the abundance of caution pay off. He referred to the Judicature Act of 1875 which was concerned with divergences between rules of equity and rules of common law, and how a clause in that measure managed to cope with an unexpected problem which arose. The noble and learned Lord on that occasion also quoted Cromwell:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, [to consider that] you may be mistaken". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That is all this comes to. I seek my noble and learned friend's generosity in making sure, out of the abundance of caution, that the anxieties which have been expressed at the omission of any reference to Article 13 can be put happily to rest. That cannot cause any ambiguity or give rise to any difficulty or confusion. It is as short and as simple as that. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80129-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, it may be for your Lordships' convenience if I try to summarise the story so far, supplementing the account explained so clearly by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner. The starting point is that the White Paper indicated, in the Prime Minister's preface and in the body of the White Paper, that the purpose of the Bill was to incorporate the convention into domestic law and to create effective remedies for breaches of convention rights. The problem was that when the Bill was drafted neither the Long Title nor any provision of the Bill stated that purpose, so there was a mismatch from the start between the White Paper and the text of the Bill.
<P>


<a name="column_383"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 383</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-17_para0"></a>A further problem was, and is, that, on the face of it, Clause 1(1)(a) gives the impression that Parliament is innumerate and illiterate in terms of the law of the convention by inviting us to count from two to 12 and 12 to 14, omitting Article 13 altogether, even though we know that Article 13 creates a substantive right which has to be complied with by all the public authorities of the United Kingdom, including the courts. The problem is then aggravated by the fact that although Clause 8--with which this amendment is concerned--gives ample powers to the court to grant just and appropriate remedies there is still no link with Article 13 of the convention. Various attempts have been made to create that link. Notwithstanding the assurances that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has given in previous debates which are, as it were, Pepper v. Hart assurances, it is essential that our courts should be able to continue to do what they have already been doing in developing the common law and in interpreting statutory discretion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-17_para1"></a>As I explained earlier, in libel cases the Court of Appeal has at least twice referred to Article 13, and the Appellate Committee of your Lordships' House has done the same in ex parte Khan. It would be most unfortunate if the deliberate exclusion of Article 13 in Clause 1(1)(a) were to be construed as intended to cut down the power of our courts to have regard to Article 13 as well as to the other substantive provisions of the convention. That is why it seems to me that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, with his skill and elegance has, as always, produced a formula which, without mentioning Article 13, creates a necessary link between the domestic obligation to give a remedy and the convention obligation that there should be an effective remedy. I cannot see that that can do any harm at all, and nor did the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor indicate that it would on the previous occasion that this was discussed. It would clear up once and for all the problem I have attempted to summarise. For that reason I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   My Lords, I, too, support the amendment. I still hanker after the inclusion of Article 13 because I think its omission might well have a disproportionate effect on a court of interpretation. They might well say, "Why is Article 13 exceptionally not specified in the schedule?" It is rather like when a child loses its milk teeth. Until the tooth is replaced, every eye is drawn to the gap. That might well be the effect of the lacuna.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-17_para2"></a>However, my noble and learned friend Lord Ackner has skilfully gone a long way to mitigating any adverse effect by his amendment. I wish to add only this. Between the two days of Report, there has been an important occurrence. A leading constitutional lawyer--none is more eminent than Mr. Geoffrey Marshall--has written to The Times and drawn attention to two matters in which the Bill is defective. One is the absence of Article 13; and the other is the refusal to reinforce and to nominate in the Bill the doctrine of implied repeal, both of which matters were canvassed on the last occasion. Mr. Marshall seemed to think that those <P>


<a name="column_384"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 384</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>matters can now be put right only when the Bill goes to another place. He may be right on that. He is probably right as regards implied repeal because I do not think that I shall be entitled to put that down for discussion again at Third Reading.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-17_para3"></a>However, if my noble and learned friend's amendment is accepted, the matter may be reconsidered at Third Reading. What he proposes can only do good; it cannot possibly do any harm. But it may be thought preferable to go back expressly to Article 13 in view of what I have just said.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-17_para4"></a>In view of what Mr. Marshall wrote and what has been said by the two noble Lords who preceded me, I hope that the amendment may be accepted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-17_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, we have already had a full argument on this proposed amendment. Clause 8(1) provides that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In relation to any act (or proposed act) of a public authority which the court finds is (or would be) unlawful, it may grant such relief or remedy, or make such order, within its jurisdiction as it considers just and appropriate". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

In my respectful view, that gives the courts the amplest discretion. I am not persuaded by an argument which proposes an amendment on the basis that it may well be unnecessary but where no specific argument is advanced as to how it may do some positive good. In my view that is likely to be productive only of uncertainty. I therefore oppose the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, I do not know from where my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor gets the proposition that we have already had full argument on this issue. We have had no such thing. At Committee stage, when the Lord Chancellor criticised the suggestion that Article 13 should be referred to, I intervened before he sat down and said that perhaps the whole problem may be solved by adding at the end of Clause 8(1) the very words that are the subject matter of the amendment. Your Lordships said that if one wishes to do that one raises it on Report. That is exactly what I have done. I have raised it on Report. The matter was not referred to by way of any argument when we were on Report a few days ago. I reserved the matter specifically saying that it was a matter which I would move at a later stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-17_para5"></a>It rather looks as though my submissions have fallen on totally deaf ears because your Lordships thought that it had already been dealt with. It had not. If I am wrong, I shall be happily interrupted to be corrected. The matter has not been argued before.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-17_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I entirely accept what the noble and learned Lord says. The amendment was originally grouped with Amendments Nos. 3, 5 and 70, the purpose of which was to include Article 13 in the convention rights. Your Lordships debated that set of amendments on 19th January when I explained the Government's position: that the Bill provides a coherent and effective scheme for providing remedies and that nothing was to be gained by adding Article 13 to the list of convention rights.
<P>


<a name="column_385"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 385</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-17_para6"></a>All I was saying was that in principle we have effectively debated these points. But there is nothing inappropriate, and the noble and learned Lord is well within his entitlement, in putting down the amendment for consideration now. I entirely appreciate that the amendment is to insert into Clause 8(1) a statement that the remedies granted by the courts are to be such as to give full and effective protection to convention rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-17_para7"></a>The key point is this. Given the wealth of remedies available to a court under Clause 8(1), nothing further is needed, in the Government's judgment. We are confident that Clause 8 will allow the courts to do full justice in the cases that come before them. I repeat that it is noteworthy that on the several occasions that we have now debated this general issue, no one has been able to point to any particular deficiency within Clause 8(1).

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. Will he deal with the point I raised: that our courts have already expressly had regard to Article 13 of the convention?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may remind noble Lords of the convention that once the mover of the Motion has spoken at Report any further interruptions are purely on matters of detail.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, I am just finishing my reply because I had invited the noble and learned Lord to interrupt me if I had got the position wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-17_para8"></a>I clearly have not. I said in terms on the last occasion that I should be moving the matter at a later stage notwithstanding the groupings. The groupings were not accepted by me. In fact I had asked, but it was overlooked, that the amendment be grouped separately. The matter has not been argued.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-17_para9"></a>The Lord Chancellor has not answered the point I seek to make. It is that whereas the amendments to Clause 1 were, so he said, amendments which could cause confusion or uncertainty, what I propose now would do no such thing. It would make clarity doubly clear. Therefore the objection to the amendments to Clause 1 has absolutely no relevance to the amendments I put forward. That is why I had hoped that that particular point would be addressed; it cannot be in the same category as the amendments to Clause 1. That is why I did not move this amendment with those amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-17_para10"></a>I do not know whether my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor would like to deal with that point. But if he does not, then it merely means that my argument has not been properly addressed. I cannot accuse the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor of a lack of generosity of spirit. When it comes to later amendments concerning judicial pensions, he has been very generous. All I can say is that I am sorry that that admirable feature of his character has not shone forth at an early stage in this particular debate. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-17_para11"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 5, line 26, after ("account") insert (", but need not be limited by,").<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para0"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, this amendment raises an issue in relation to Clause 8(4) of the Bill. It arises out of a matter suggested to me by the Law Society of Scotland. The Society also gave notice of the matter to the Government. The amendment seeks to probe the issue as to whether or not, in exercising the power to award damages under Clause 8(4), a court in the United Kingdom would in any sense be limited to the principles applied by the European Court of Human Rights in relation to the award of compensation under Article 41 of the Convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para1"></a>Those of us who have from time to time considered and been involved in cases involving the European Court of Human Rights sometimes take the view that, in instances where compensation is awarded, the awards are of a fairly modest nature, and had the applicant been able to prosecute a right in the British courts under the common law for some breach of statute for a similar wrong or injury, the damages that he or she would have received, if successful, would in all probability have been somewhat larger--in some instances significantly larger--than the levels of compensation assessed by the European Court of Human Rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para2"></a>I fully accept that the words in subsection (4), "must take into account", could be construed as being such that the courts need not be limited by the principles applied. It is to probe and seek the Government's assurance that no such limitation is intended that I move this amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, if I thought that the Government's intention was that the words, "must take into account", in Clause 8(4) were to be given a different meaning from the words, "must take into account", in Clause 2(1) in relation to the Strasbourg jurisprudence, I would certainly support this amendment. It would be quite wrong to fetter or clog the discretion of the English, Scottish and Northern Ireland courts in deciding upon the appropriate principles for the award of compensation for what is really to be a new form of public law tort; that is to say, a breach by a public authority of a convention right. It would be absurd, if, for example, domestic law concepts such as that of exemplary damages in an appropriate case, which is not a concept that has been developed by the European court, were to be excluded. It would be absurd if our courts were not able, in developing the common law, to stick to our own principles.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para3"></a>On the other hand, I support the way in which the clause as it stands is put. I look forward eagerly to the Minister's explanations. As I understand it, what is envisaged is that guidance should be given as to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights in relation to what is now called Article 41 of the convention, previously Article 50, in giving just satisfaction.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para4"></a>What I like about that case law is that it is fairly mean. In a routine case, the Strasbourg court does not award massive damages. It is quite right that the courts <P>


<a name="column_387"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 387</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be guided by that mean spirit. This Bill could be destroyed in practice if there were excessive damages awards. Therefore, it seems to me to be well calibrated. The courts "must take into account" that austere case law, but they are not restricted in a gross case where, for example, a person under colour of law deliberately and wickedly tortures somebody or inflicts upon him or her some other barbaric practice in breach of Convention rights and in a context where the Strasbourg court may not even have dealt with such a case. In that case, it is quite right that our courts should be free to use their well-known principles for the award of damages in common law cases. If my understanding is correct, then I should be opposed to this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, it is very important to note in discussing this amendment, and indeed any matter to do with Clause 8, that we are not dealing with any conflict of law between European Convention law and our own substantive law, whether primary or secondary. That matter was dealt with under Clause 4, under the rubric, "Declaration of incompatibility". Here, we are dealing simply with the power of the court to award damages. In that connection we should bear in mind not only the remarks of my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, but also the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, in amplifying the argument.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para5"></a>A factor which neither of them mentioned, although they may have had it in mind, is this. There is such a thing as inflation, or at least changes in the value of money. In awarding damages, our courts would be neglecting their duty if they failed to bear that point in mind when fixing an amount of damages. I therefore see this amendment as doing no harm; indeed, it is essential.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-18_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I find this amendment somewhat surprising. In connection with Clause 2, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, put down an amendment which stated that in determining a question which has arisen under this Bill, a court,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall be bound by any judgment, decision, declaration or advisory opinion of the European Court of Human Rights." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

The words he sought to replace--"must take into account"--were apparently not strong enough for the noble Lord's liking.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para6"></a>But in Clause 8, the wording of subsection (4) is consistent with that used in Clause 2; namely, that in determining whether to award damages, or the amount of an award, a court "must take into account" the principles applied by the European Court of Human Rights in relation to the award of compensation. On this occasion, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, would appear to find that phrase too restrictive, and that the courts are to be enjoined not to be limited by the principles of the European Court.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para7"></a>I have no hesitation in advising your Lordships that the similar expressions in two parts of the Bill will bear the same meaning. The intention of Clause 8 is that people should, so far as is possible, receive the same remedies from our domestic courts--albeit with much less delay--as they would receive if the case went to <P>


<a name="column_388"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 388</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Strasbourg. For that to happen, it is necessary that our courts should take into account the principles adopted by the European Court of Human Rights. I see no need for the added gloss that they "need not be limited by" such principles. As I explained when talking to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland's proposed amendment to Clause 2, the phrase, "take into account", allows the courts to use their discretion where appropriate in applying Strasbourg jurisprudence generally to cases before them. It would be unnecessary and confusing to have a different phrase in Clause 8 from that in Clause 2. It would suggest that the courts were to apply a different test in questions of damages, which is contrary to our intentions. In view of what I have said, I ask the noble and learned Lord to consider withdrawing the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for his explanation. In tabling as in moving my amendment, I was indeed conscious of the terms of Clause 2 and the extensive debate we had about that matter at an earlier stage of the Bill. Nevertheless, it had struck others, as well as myself, that the matter was worth clarifying. The answer given certainly does that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para8"></a>Quite how that squares with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, about exemplary damages I am less certain, particularly in view of the absence of such damages within the powers of the Scottish courts. They will be required to apply the provisions of Clause 8(4). So yet again we have an instance of how the Bill, which seeks to bring rights home to the United Kingdom, will end up having different results in different jurisdictions within the United Kingdom. However, I am grateful for the answer I have received and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(c) in such other forum as may be prescribed by rules.").<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para11"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, in speaking to government Amendments Nos. 35 and 36, it may be helpful if I also speak to Amendment No. 37 by the noble Lord, Lord Meston.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para12"></a>I am sorry that the noble Lord has been put to the trouble of tabling again on Report the amendment that he moved in Committee. We reached his amendment rather late on the second day of Committee and therefore had less time for discussion than I had hoped.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para13"></a>The noble Lord will now be aware that the Government have themselves tabled an amendment to this clause to provide an enforceable right to compensation for breaches of Article 5 by judicial acts. The noble Lord will see that this is a rather more <P>


<a name="column_389"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 389</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>detailed amendment than his own, but I hope that he will accept that it makes the same provision as that which he is concerned to ensure.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para14"></a>May I explain the overall purpose and the detailed provisions of this amendment, because they are of some importance. It has two purposes. The first is to provide an enforceable right to compensation for breaches of Article 5 by judicial acts. The second is to preserve judicial immunity generally for judicial acts undertaken by judges, magistrates, tribunal members and court staff performing judicial functions or acting on behalf of the judge or on the instructions of the judge.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para15"></a>Noble Lords will remember that at Committee stage the noble Lord, Lord Meston, moved an amendment, identical to that which he has now put down on Report, to make explicit provision for the requirement of Article 5(5) that everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of Article 5 shall have an enforceable right to compensation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para16"></a>I indicated at Committee stage that the Government were alive to the need to make appropriate provision for the Article 5(5) requirement and that we were considering how best to give effect to this obligation in relation to judicial acts of courts and tribunals. The effect of Clauses 6, 7 and 8 of the Bill is that there is an enforceable right to compensation in relation to public authorities generally. But special provisions are needed in relation to judicial acts of courts and tribunals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para17"></a>Where a complaint is made that Article 5 has been breached as a result of a judicial act or omission it will be necessary first to establish whether the judicial act complained of was unlawful, then to rule on whether the aggrieved person is entitled to compensation under Article 5(5) and then to determine the amount of compensation. In determining those questions the court will take into account the Strasbourg jurisprudence on unlawful detention and on the award of damages, as required by Clauses 2 and 8 of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para18"></a>Subsections (1) and (2) of the clause require that proceedings under Section 7(1)(a) in respect of a judicial act may be brought in three ways: by exercising a right of appeal; on an application for judicial review (or in Scotland a petition for judicial review) or in such other forum as may be prescribed by rules.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para19"></a>A finding that an inferior court has acted unlawfully will most commonly be reached in England and Wales by way of appeal to the Court of Appeal or the Divisional Court, or by an application by way of judicial review to the High Court. The higher court will then be able to reach a decision of unlawfulness and make an award of damages. Clause 8(2) will enable the courts, which already have power to award damages, to do so in proceedings under this Bill. However, in criminal proceedings in Scotland, if the High Court on appeal finds that some act of an inferior court has contravened the complainant's rights under Article 5(5) it would have no power to award damages. It would therefore be necessary for the amount of damages to be determined by the civil courts. The clause therefore enables proceedings to be brought in such other forum as may be prescribed by rules. The Court of Appeal in England, as a single entity, has the power to award damages. <P>


<a name="column_390"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 390</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Rules will provide as to whether the Criminal or Civil Division should hear compensation claims. Again, Clauses 9(1) and 7(2) provide the necessary powers to make rules.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para20"></a>Subsection (2) underlines that no new right to judicial review is being created. For example, a challenge to a decision of the Crown Court in a matter relating to a trial on indictment will be made on appeal since there cannot be judicial review in respect of trials on indictment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para21"></a>Subsection (3) has two purposes. It restates the current position under common law and statutory rules that the Crown is not liable in respect of judicial acts and that judges and magistrates acting within their jurisdiction, or outside their jurisdiction if doing so in good faith, are immune from proceedings for damages. But it also makes provision that damages may be awarded to compensate a person to the extent required by Article 5(5) of the Convention in respect of a judicial act of a court.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para22"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Meston, has written me a most helpful letter in which he has indicated that he himself had thought of making clear in Clause 9 that existing personal immunity of judges and magistrates was preserved, but he had decided that it was probably unnecessary to do so. It is helpful to know that he had in mind the second purpose of the government amendment--that is, preserving judicial immunity--as well as the first of providing an enforceable right to compensation under Article 5(5).
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para23"></a>I believe that now he has seen the draft of the Government's amendment to this clause, he will agree that it is helpful to spell out that judicial immunity is preserved, given the way the clause is now drafted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para24"></a>Subsection (4) provides that an award of damages permitted by subsection (3) should be made against the Crown rather than against the judge personally. It also ensures that whichever Minister is responsible for the court or tribunal concerned is joined to the proceedings if not already a party. This is similar in effect to the provision of Clause 5 which provides that where a court is considering whether to make a declaration of incompatibility, the Crown is entitled to notice and, on an application to the court, to be joined as the party to the proceedings. In practice, the Lord Chancellor will be the appropriate person in many cases concerning judges and magistrates, in England and Wales. In Scotland, the relevant Minister will usually be the Secretary of State. But there may be cases where the breach of the Article 5 provisions arises from a wholly proper judicial decision required by inconsistent legislation, primary or secondary legislation. In this case it would be helpful for the Minister responsible for the legislation to be joined. "Appropriate person" therefore allows me, or the Secretary of State for Scotland to nominate a person or government department.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para25"></a>The definitions in subsection (6) make it clear that judicial acts include acts undertaken by court officers performing judicial functions or acting on behalf of the judge or on the instructions of the judge.
<P>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 391</B></P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para26"></a>At present, this clause refers both to a "judicial act", in subsection (1) and to a "judicial act of a court" in subsection (3). This may give rise to confusion and the Government will therefore be moving a minor amendment at Third Reading to clarify this small point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-18_para27"></a>I said in Committee that the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Meston, might be the best way of providing compensation for breaches of Article 5 by judicial acts. I warned the Committee then that the complex and delicate issues of judicial immunity and Crown liability for judicial decisions required consideration before an amendment was made to this clause. The government amendments before the House seek to deal with that situation. They go rather further than the noble Lord's amendment. I hope that he will therefore consider withdrawing his amendment and that the House will agree that the government amendments achieve what is required. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="80129-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   My Lords, from these Benches I offer no objection to Amendments Nos. 35 and 36, which address fully the point raised previously by the noble Lord, Lord Meston. With an element of diffidence perhaps I can ask one question. Is it proposed that these amendments will apply to the courts of the Church, about which we have had certain discussions during the passage of the Bill? If so, looking at the terms of subsection (5), set out in Amendment No. 36, I doubt that one could say,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Minister responsible for the court concerned". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, first, I congratulate my noble friend Lord Meston on introducing this matter at Committee stage and the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor and his colleagues on what I regard as an appropriate and necessary amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-19_para0"></a>The amendments represent a significant change in existing law. As I understand it, until the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 came into force it was possible for someone who had been unlawfully detained by order of a magistrates' court to take civil proceedings against the relevant Bench of magistrates. In cases in which imprisonment was unlawful, compensation could be paid.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-19_para1"></a>Sections 44 and 45 of the 1990 Act introduced a requirement for the plaintiff to allege and prove malice before compensation could be ordered. That in effect rendered such litigation impossible and ended the right to compensation for unlawful detention by a magistrates' court. The Strasbourg case law is that <P>


<a name="column_392"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 392</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a requirement to prove malice as a precondition to compensation does not conform to Article 5(5) of the Convention. The amendment deals with that problem extremely well. It extends to a judicial act of a court done in good faith so that damages can be awarded to compensate a person to the extent required by Article 5(5). It impliedly repeals Sections 44 and 45 of the Courts and Legal Services Act. Perhaps the noble and learned Lord could think a little further about whether one needs to have something dealing expressly with that. It deals skilfully with the problems of judicial immunity and Crown liability, as the Lord Chancellor indicated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I can raise a small drafting point on subsection (4) of the amendment. It says,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An award of damages permitted by subsection (3) is to be made against the Crown", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

and so forth. Does not that mean "may" be made against the Crown? Is not that the normal manner of drafting? Matters of drafting are not positively debated across the Floor of your Lordships' Chamber, but perhaps my noble and learned friend will consider that point with the draftsmen, if he thinks it worth considering.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-19_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Colville of Culross: </B>   My Lords, I am relieved to have it put clearly in the Bill that the judiciary is immune. In relation to what the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said, one can make a mistake in the Crown Court as well as in the magistrates' court and this is an admirable arrangement for some of us.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-19_para2"></a>The only question I would ask the noble and learned Lord is this. Now that the explanatory memorandum has disappeared, I cannot check whether there is to be a financial provision introduced by another place in order to pay for all this. It will come out of the public pocket, out of the Treasury, and I imagine that it will be necessary to bring forward an amendment which we cannot introduce in this House, but which may be introduced in another place.

<P>
<A NAME="80129-19_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I am disinclined to be drawn into argument about the Church courts. The short answer is that if the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, had in mind the Church of Scotland or indeed the Church of England, I am not aware that they make any decisions that could breach Article 5. I have difficulty therefore in understanding how the question of compensation in relation to Article 5(5) could arise.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-19_para3"></a>I note what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, in relation to the interaction of these provisions by way of an amendment with pre-existing civil and statute law. However, having regard to the position of the hands of the clock, it would not be wise for me to embark extempore upon that. However, I undertake to write to the noble Lord.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-19_para4"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, invites us to consider subsection (4) from a specific standpoint. I am happy to do so. I understand the <P>


<a name="column_393"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 393</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>significance of the provision to be no more than to emphasise that the liability is in the Crown and not the judge as an individual. I shall look at that. I do not believe that any specific financial provision needs to be made for liabilities that may arise at law against government departments.

<A NAME = "80129-19_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 40, it may be convenient for me to speak also to Amendments Nos. 41 to 43.

<P>

<A NAME = "80129-19_para12"></a>Amendment No. 40 prevents a remedial order being made following a declaration of incompatibility if there is any prospect of an appeal against the relevant court decision.

<FONT SIZE=3>Lord asked what would happen if the remedial order procedure were initiated before all avenues of appeal had been exhausted.

That is the purpose of Amendment No. 40.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-19_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Coleraine, helpfully raised the question in Committee as to whether or not the power conferred by Clause 10 may be used retrospectively in respect of findings in proceedings against other states or parties to the Convention.

<A NAME="80129-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Coleraine: </B>   My Lords, I too would like to thank the noble Lord for accepting the arguments which I put forward in Committee about this small matter. I am very happy that his amendment should pre-empt mine.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I, too, support this amendment and those associated with it, to which I shall speak briefly. I wish to draw attention to one matter. I realise that it is right in principle that remedial action should be confined to proceedings against the United Kingdom, made after the coming into force of the relevant section. However, there is the problem of what happens in relation to proceedings before that occurs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-20_para0"></a>That is best illustrated by the position in the case of Goodwin v. the United Kingdom. In that case there was a finding by the European Court of a breach as a result of an interpretation given by the Appellate Committee of this House. Then the problem was translating that into our own legal system without legislation, given the doctrine of binding precedent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-20_para1"></a>The problem has been exemplified more recently by a decision of the Court of Appeal in a case called Camelot. There is now an awkwardness in that there is no equivalent of the remedial procedure by subordinate legislation to give effect to a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights where it is necessary to over-rule domestic law. This problem is going to continue as regards pre-Human Rights Act cases.

<A NAME = "80129-20_para2"></a>I realise that it would be wrong to seek to widen this power, but I draw the attention of the House to the problem. I am not quite sure how we resolve it if, for example, a journalist in the same position as Mr. Goodwin found that the judgment is given binding effect against him in breach of his rights under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. I draw attention to that not in order to speak against the amendment or to suggest that it should be widened. It is quite a serious practical problem that will continue to exist and will not be solved by this Bill.

<A NAME="80129-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, that may be so, but the structure that we have carefully crafted is to tie in, with the assistance, which I re-acknowledge, of the propositions put forward by the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Coleraine. We have constructed the system of remedial action specifically in the context of this Bill. We believe that we have achieved the right solution. There may be anomalies which will have to be addressed in a different way, but not--and I respectfully agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill--through remedial action.

I am grateful for the personal discussions I had with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon when we were able to discuss other matters of general concern to the Church of England.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-20_para13"></a>As it was indicated in Committee, Clause 10 would enable a Minister of the Crown to make a remedial order amending a measure of the General Synod or of its predecessor, the Church Assembly, following a declaration of incompatibility. The Minister of the Crown could do that without any reference to the General Synod.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-20_para14"></a>The Church of England, perfectly properly, pointed out that that would sit uneasily with our present arrangements whereby a Church measure can only be approved or disapproved by Parliament in its entirety--in other words, with no opportunity for amendment. To provide for amendment of a Church measure by a Minister, even in response to the serious situation of a declaration of incompatibility, would obviously have significant implications for the Church. Neither do we feel that it would be appropriate for a Minister of the Crown to be in that situation. It would not tie appropriately with our present relations between Church and state.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-20_para15"></a>Therefore, we thought about it carefully, particularly benefiting by the conversations to which I have referred. We came to the conclusion that if an amendment to Church measures were required to remove a convention incompatibility, it is better done by the Church itself rather than by the exercise of the order-making power by a Minister of the Crown. I express the Government's confident hope that if there were a court declaration of convention incompatibility, then the General Synod would speedily consider whether the measure should be amended. We do not believe that the Church of England would be found inactive if its legislation were found to be in breach of human rights. We are content to leave it at that. I beg to move the amendment on that basis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-20_spnew7"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Ripon: </B>   My Lords, from these Benches I would like to express my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, for tabling this amendment. For over 70 years the Church Assembly--and more recently, the General Synod--have had delegated powers from Parliament to pass measures, subject to final parliamentary approval, relating to matters concerning the Church of England. These measures are part of the primary legislation to the law of the land. As the noble Lord, Lord Williams, has said, by removing measures from Clause 10, the understanding between Church and state is preserved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-20_para16"></a>The position of the Church of England as an Established Church puts it into a unique relationship with Parliament. As the noble Lord has said, Clause 10, as it stood before this amendment, would have given Ministers the power to amend Church of England legislation without consulting the Church.

<P>

<A NAME = "80129-20_para17"></a>The amendment removes those measures from Clause 10. It does not affect the status of such measures as primary legislation and the courts therefore cannot strike them down. However, as the noble Lord said, the courts have the power to declare an incompatibility between the convention and measures, and the power under this amendment to remedy that incompatibility lies not with the Government but with the Church of England.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-20_para18"></a>The Church of England--I am confident that I speak for other Churches also--does not wish to escape its proper obligations under the convention. We have been seeking an assurance that the Bill cannot be used to require the Church to act in ways contrary to its religious principles and beliefs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-20_para19"></a>This generous and welcome amendment gives a substantial assurance to the Church of England in this regard. I should like to express once again my thanks not only to the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, but also to his officials for their careful consideration of this issue and my pleasure at the outcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-20_para20"></a>In response to the noble Lord's final hope, I wish on behalf of the Church of England to give an assurance that if ever the courts made a declaration that a Church measure was incompatible with convention rights, the Church would of course give consideration of the utmost seriousness to the introduction of an amending measure into the General Synod for the purpose of rectifying the situation.

<A NAME="80129-20_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   My Lords, I do not want to become involved in a contentious debate about Church versus state. That issue was probably debated at length earlier. However, I am unconvinced that there is any need to exclude the Church from any of the Bill's provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-20_para21"></a>I should like clarification on one or two points. As I understand the amendment from the way in which it was moved, and from the response from the right reverend Prelate, it basically restores the position to what it was before this Human Rights Bill was introduced. There is no real attempt to put the Church of England in an especially privileged position other than the especially privileged position that it was in before.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-20_para22"></a>The whole purpose and thrust of the Bill is to repatriate the human rights Convention. No human rights have been taken away from anyone. We all understand the certain derogations in the Bill, but they in no way affect Article 9 of the Convention, which deals with religious freedoms.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-20_para23"></a>Perhaps I may ask a question. Is it possible for someone who feels aggrieved by the procedures of the Church still to go to Strasbourg if he or she wishes? In other words, I seek confirmation that there is no cut-off point and that nothing in the amendment prevents that happening. If that is so, there would be no problem, but if it were the case that the purpose of the amendment inadvertently-- if perhaps not advertently--was to reduce the possibilities of anyone going to Strasbourg to exercise their rights, in my view that would represent unfair discrimination in favour of the Church. I hope that an explanation of that point can be given.

<A NAME="80129-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, on the first day of Report stage, I spoke against the much wider amendment (which was defeated on a Division) to exempt the Church of England and, indeed, other religious bodies from much of the effect of this Human Rights Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-21_para0"></a>On this occasion, I speak in support of the amendment which has been moved by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, because it seems to me to do no more than what is perfectly proper, which is to secure that the existing arrangements for the constitutional settlement between Parliament and the Church of England are maintained as now. We on these Benches are entirely happy with that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   We are grateful for the generous response of the Church of England as articulated by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and for his positive assertion, which we welcome and accept, that the Church of England would not be found wanting or dilatory were a declaration of Convention incompatibility to be made in respect of any court order.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-21_para1"></a>To answer the specific question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Hughes of Woodside, nothing in this Bill takes away from any citizen of this country the opportunity of the journey to Strasbourg if that were eventually required. The whole point of the Bill is, to coin a phrase, to bring rights home. The Church of England is not being exempted from the provisions of this Bill. We are dealing with the relationship between Church measures and legislation. It is because Church measures can be only approved or disapproved--not amended--following parliamentary discussion and scrutiny that we think that the remedial fast-track procedure is not appropriate for the reasons outlined briefly by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, upon which exposition I cannot improve.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-21_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a drafting amendment. In Committee the noble Lord, Lord Meston, commented that the phrase "a remedial order" seemed to make its first entry into our world in Clause 11 although the power to make it was conferred by Clause 10. Scrutiny of the Bill will show that the phrase does not appear first in Clause 11, but in Clause 6(6)(b) which is concerned with acts of public authorities. It is not defined in that clause but in Clause 21, which defines a number of expressions used in the Bill. Clause 21 states that "remedial order" means,

<A NAME = "80129-21_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment draws on the report of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation, paragraph 23 of which states:

Without strict limitations, a secondary power of such potential width would be unacceptable". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-21_para8"></a>On 27th November, at col. 1143 of Hansard the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, said in reply:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is clear from Clause 10(2) that a Minister will be empowered to make only such changes (apart from any consequential changes) as are appropriate to remove the incompatibility". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

The Minister was referring to appropriateness as being the test.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-21_para9"></a>The purpose of this amendment is to require the fast-track procedure to be invoked where it is not merely appropriate but necessary in order to give effect to the court's declaration of incompatibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-21_para10"></a>When the Lord Chancellor replied, he indicated that the Government had considered with great care the report of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation and had concluded that Clause 12 was adequate. The noble and learned Lord then said these important words:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the present Bill remedial orders are limited specifically to amendments to legislation which are necessary to remove an incompatibility with the convention".--[Official Report, 27/11/97; col. 1145.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

That is not what the Bill says; it is what the amendment says.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-21_para11"></a>I regard it as of great importance that the words of the Lord Chancellor should be reflected on the face of the Bill because of the unease on all sides of the House, shared with different levels of disquiet, about Henry VIII clauses. I note that when we come later to Amendment No. 49 we shall look at attempts to impose further safeguards on the fast-track procedure. My attitude to those amendments will be greatly affected by the reply from the Government Benches to this amendment, and whether the Government are willing to create the necessary safeguard. I know it will be said that it goes without saying and that the courts are likely to read into the Bill a test of necessity and not just appropriateness, but the words "appropriate" and "necessary" are not the same. Therefore, it is very important that before delegated powers to amend primary legislation are invoked--powers with which I entirely sympathise for the reasons given by the noble <P>

<A NAME="80129-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill. He referred to my amendments which are in the next group. Those amendments take the idea somewhat further and I believe are more in line with the suggestions made in paragraph 24 of the sixth report of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee. Obviously, I would prefer to go down the line of Amendment No. 49 and the associated amendments, but if the House is unwilling to go that far at this stage I should like to support Amendment No. 48. If the House is prepared to accept both I shall be even happier because the two groups of amendments are not incompatible. I believe that my amendments, to which I shall speak at slightly greater length, do more to achieve that which was suggested or recommended by the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-21_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, this particular amendment attracted a good deal of support in Committee. We were then told to go away and ponder the matter further. The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, said that he would also ponder further upon it. He said at the time that I was pressing for both belt and braces. That is correct. I see no objection to the combination of belt and braces. Indeed, that may be a very useful motto for everyone to bear in mind on some occasions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-21_para12"></a>I cannot see any objection to this amendment. Either it is the Government's intention to draw as narrowly as possible the powers that Ministers will have under these clauses or it is their intention to try to satisfy Parliament that the powers used are absolutely essential. I believe that on both tests this amendment is not objectionable. I hope that in responding the Government will make it plain either that they accept it or that there are very good reasons why they cannot do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-21_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   My Lords, I too support the amendment. Your Lordships are now sensitive to the allegation of Henry VIII powers, particularly since the setting up of the committee which investigates them. These provisions allow the Henry VIII provision to go to quite unnecessary lengths. I ask your Lordships to look at Clause 11(1) which provides that a remedial order may make consequential provision. In subsection (2) it is provided that subsection (1) powers include powers to amend or repeal primary legislation--that is the Henry VIII proposal--including primary legislation other than that which contains the incompatible provision; in other words, it goes beyond what is required to remove an incompatibility and what is consequential to that. Put another way, the provision in this amendment is necessary. It picks up the word used by my noble and learned friend in justifying it. It is necessary in order to limit the quite undesirable ambit <P>


<a name="column_401"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 401</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the Henry VIII provision; in other words, it includes other primary provisions beyond what is incompatible and consequential on the incompatibility.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-21_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Coleraine: </B>   My Lords, I should also like to express my support for the amendment moved by the noble Lord, which I believe the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, moved in Committee. I have one query on the drafting which centres on the word "it". I believe that the word should be "power". Obviously, the remedial order will not be made except where it is deemed necessary to correct the incompatibility with Convention rights. The Government will not amend the legislation except where necessary to correct an incompatibility, but it is important to make clear that it is the power which is deemed necessary.

<P>
<A NAME="80129-22_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I confess that I am a little puzzled. Your Lordships will appreciate that the amendment under consideration is an amendment to Clause 11, not Clause 10. Therefore, the subject matter under consideration is correctly addressed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale. Clause 10 allows a remedial order to be made to amend a piece of primary legislation so as to remove an incompatibility that has been found to exist in one of its provisions. Clause 11(1)(a) provides that a remedial order under Clause 10 may contain such incidental, supplemental, consequential and transitional provisions as the person making it considers appropriate. Clause 11(2)(a) provides that the power to make incidental changes includes power to amend or repeal primary legislation, including primary legislation other than that which contains the incompatible provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para0"></a>Thus, Amendment No. 48 bites on the power to make incidental changes to legislation in addition to the main changes necessary to remove the incompatibility. I gained the impression from the language used by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, that he believed his amendment would alter the whole basis for remedial orders. But they are made under Clause 10 and this amendment relates only to the ancillary powers in Clause 11.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para1"></a>I hope that I can reassure your Lordships, as I and my noble friend Lord Williams of Mostyn sought to do both at Second Reading and in Committee, that the Bill contains sufficient safeguards to meet concerns about the powers conferred under Clauses 10 and 11. These powers have been carefully tailored to ensure that a remedial order can perform the job that it is designed to do; namely, to remove incompatible provisions of legislation in an effective and tidy way. A remedial order would not be used, and in our view could not be used, for any other purpose.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   My Lords, would not the word "consequential" be sufficient to tidy up the amendment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-22_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I will explain in a moment the effect of Clause 11(1)(a). It provides that a remedial order under Clause 10 may contain such incidental, supplemental, consequential and transitional provisions as the person making it considers appropriate. <P>


<a name="column_402"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 402</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Clause 11(2)(a) adds that this provision includes a power to amend or repeal primary legislation including primary legislation other than that which contains the incompatible provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para2"></a>It is in relation to that power only that the amendment would bite. It would limit the power to make incidental, supplemental and consequential changes to primary legislation which were themselves deemed necessary to correct an incompatibility with the Convention. In doing so it would prevent the amendment or repeal of provisions of other primary legislation that are not in themselves incompatible but whose amendment or repeal would be a natural or sensible corollary to the successful curing of the incompatibility of the legislation found to have been wanting. In other words, the effect of the amendment would negate the purpose of the provision which is made in Clause 11 for changes incidental to this which are needed to correct the incompatibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para3"></a>For example, there may be cases where changes to other legislation which is not itself incompatible, are necessary not to remove an incompatibility but for consequential or supplemental purposes. For example, if a section of an Act has been deleted, any references to that section in other Acts would be otiose and should also be removed. Changes under this category would be ruled out by the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para4"></a>The Government understand the desire to ring-fence the powers in Clauses 10 and 11 so far as possible, consistent with the purposes of the remedial order; but we believe that the existing provisions provide appropriate safeguards. I will list the elements. The order-making procedure is only available where a declaration of incompatibility under Clause 4 or a Strasbourg court judgment has been given or there is an urgent need to replace subordinate legislation quashed on convention grounds. Crucially, for present purposes, the power is to be used to remove incompatibility found by the UK or the Strasbourg court, and plainly it cannot be used in any connection for any other purpose.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para5"></a>The power to make incidental, supplemental, consequential and transitional provision is not novel; it is a well precedented supplementary vires provision. I emphasise "supplementary". It is not a basis on which a Minister could properly tackle some unrelated issues. Supplementary provision can only be added to a Clause 10 order, and the object of the Clause 10 order must be to remove the incompatibility found by the United Kingdom or Strasbourg court. In other words, while the power extends to amending other legislative provisions, it is heavily circumscribed because of the plain purpose of Clause 10.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para6"></a>Our view is that it is necessary to have the extra powers in Clause 11 in addition to the main powers in Clause 10 if the job is to be done properly and remedial orders are to make proper sense. We think that the amendment would make this impossible.
<P>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 403</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para7"></a>The purpose of Clause 10(2) and Clause 11(1)(a) is to ensure that the removal of an incompatibility is complete so far as the statute book goes. As we see it, that is all that there is to it, and on that basis I hope the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, that was a most powerful and impressive reply, which I should like to read in Hansard and think about tomorrow. If I have been guilty of a certain confusion of thought, then I plead guilty as between Clause 10 and Clause 11. I understand why the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor had gained that impression of what I said.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para8"></a>I do not share the view of noble Lords who have criticised Clauses 10 and 11 as creating a vast Henry VIII clause with jackboots added on, doing violation either to parliamentary accountability or rule of law. I made clear at an early stage that I approve of this fast track procedure for the reasons given by the Lord Chancellor--that is to say, it is to uphold the rule of law to ensure that a declaration of incompatibility in judgments of the European Court are speedily and effectively translated by Parliament into effective remedies required, among other things, by Article 13 of the convention. Therefore I have no disagreement with the purpose of Clauses 10 and 11.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para9"></a>Much of what the noble and learned Lord said sounded like a judgment of the Appellate Committee in the House of Lords in an argument of vires about whether a particular form of delegated legislation came within or outside Clauses 10 and 11. I believe that the law Lords would be most likely, if not certain, to give a judgment in that way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para10"></a>We have been given assurances, which I should like to consider further, about the need to ring-fence the safeguards the Lord Chancellor has indicated and the difficulty of seeking to limit the remedial orders in Clause 11 by a test of necessity when one does not, for obvious reasons, seek to limit the power to take the legal action by a similar test of necessity in Clause 10.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para11"></a>I hope I will not be considered by noble Lords who have been generous enough to support this amendment to have sold the pass; but I seek leave to withdraw the amendment.

The other amendments in this group, Amendments Nos. 50 and 55 and 51, 56, 57 and 58, are all different approaches to the same issue and I trust that on this occasion we have all found the right clause to put them in.

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 404</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hope that the Government will not address the issue tonight because that matter could be resolved on another occasion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para15"></a>I suspect that the group of amendments in my name and in the name of my noble friend are nearest to the approach put forward by the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para16"></a>I moved similar amendments at Committee stage and therefore I do not intend to speak at great length on these amendments. I received a degree of support from the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and then I offered her a degree of support on her amendments, just as I do on these amendments. Having debated the amendments, I have made some modifications to appease the Government by reducing the period of delay from 60 days to 40 days; but I suspect that that was unnecessary because the Government's amendments now seem to accept a 60 day delay period. I made the concession but it was not necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para17"></a>At Committee stage I made reference to the report of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee. I will not repeat paragraph 24 of that report except to remind noble Lords of the sentence which stated that the House may wish to consider whether there is a case for developing a new procedure to scrutinise such orders modelled on that for the second stage parliamentary scrutiny of deregulation orders.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para18"></a>It is important that Parliament has a means of amending these orders. That is what my amendments do, and what, I regret to say, the other amendments do not do. It would obviously be possible, if one followed the lines pursued by the Minister's amendments, for the Executive to produce amendments following the consultation period. That is not sufficient. This is one of those occasions where it is important that Parliament itself can make amendment to the orders before they go through.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para19"></a>Committee stage was some time ago, and since then we have had the final stages, which the Minister will remember, of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Bill. That Bill came to this House for the last time on 2nd December last year, and, as I understand it, it was designed to rectify a problem following a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para20"></a>As the Minister will remember, my noble friend Lady Blatch, who was at the time dealing with Home Office matters, on a number of occasions pressed amendments to that Bill, but they were resisted in this House by the Minister. Following my noble friend failing to move, as it were, the Minister, but no doubt on his advice, his colleagues in another place agreed largely to accept the points put forward by my noble friend. Again, I hope on his advice, his honourable and right honourable friends in another place accepted the spirit of her amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-22_para21"></a>Without my amendment, it would not be possible for Parliament to make those amendments. No doubt the Minister will respond that it would be possible for the Government, should they wish, to use primary legislation to rectify those problems.

<P>
<A NAME="80129-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I have been asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, whose name stands first in the list of those tabling Amendments Nos. 50 and 55, but who is unable to be here tonight, to speak to those amendments on her behalf.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-23_para0"></a>On the issues raised by the amendments, the parties seem to have been moving, to some extent, towards a consensus, but unfortunately they have not quite reached it. We who have tabled the amendments, welcome the amendments to be moved by the Minister. We also have a good deal of sympathy with the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Henley.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-23_para1"></a>Two principles are involved. One is that there should be an opportunity to scrutinise a draft remedial order before it takes effect; the second is that there should be power to revise or amend a draft order in the light of defects shown up by that scrutiny.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-23_para2"></a>I shall look first at the question of scrutiny. It will of course be for the Government to decide whether to invoke, in any particular instance, the fast-track procedure. If they do so, the purpose of the scrutiny will not be to review that decision, and decide whether or not it was correct, but to look at the draft of the proposed order to see whether it is an appropriate and effective way of correcting the incompatibility which has been discovered by the court, and to ensure that the order does nothing more than correct that incompatibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-23_para3"></a>Wide public consultation will not be needed. What will be needed is expert scrutiny by a body familiar with parliamentary draftsmanship. That body should be a human rights committee, either of each of the two Houses or a joint committee of both. I recognise that it is of course for Parliament to decide whether to set up such a committee, and not for legislation. Our amendments are intended to emphasise the importance of ensuring that there is scrutiny by an appropriate committee, without being prescriptive as to the nature of that committee. So far as Amendments Nos. 52 and 53 seek to achieve the same purpose, we of course agree with them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-23_para4"></a>The Government's White Paper on the Bill made it clear that they would welcome the creation of a parliamentary human rights committee or committees. I assume that that remains their view. I should welcome confirmation of that and also that the Government see scrutiny of draft remedial orders as one of the functions of a parliamentary human rights committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-23_para5"></a>I turn now to the question of amendment. It is surely pointless to have scrutiny if the result of the scrutiny cannot be taken into account in deciding the final form of the order. It is not generally open to either House to amend the text of a draft Order in Council. The amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Henley, is an ingenious solution to that problem, though in our view it involves some element of overkill and may lead to unnecessary delay, because it will require, before the order can come <P>


<a name="column_406"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 406</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>into effect, two successive 40-day periods--one involving the looking at what may be called a pre-draft and then the actual draft.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-23_para6"></a>I hope that the fast-track procedure will be rarely needed, and that when it is needed it will often be easy to see what amendment is needed to ensure the compatibility of the existing legislation. For that purpose, an 80-day stand delay will not be needed. But it may not always be as simple as that. It is important that the Government should have power to amend an Order in Council by means short of the withdrawal of the existing order and the laying of a new order.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-23_para7"></a>In Committee, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor took the view that Clause 12 was adequate as it stood. He also at that stage took the view that a 60-day period of consideration was unnecessary. On the latter point, the Government's view has now changed. Amendment No. 58 will extend the period for consideration to 60 days. Presumably the point of the Government's amendments, extending the period of consideration to 60 days, is to enable more detailed consideration of the draft Order in Council to take place. But what is the point of having a period for scrutiny and consultation if the draft has already been laid before the House in a form which can be amended only by withdrawal and relaying?
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-23_para8"></a>The consultation process may well make it clear that the order is capable of improvement. I would ask the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor to reconsider whether it would be possible to introduce a procedure to enable that order to be revised after it has been laid before the House in draft.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, this is an important group of amendments. One of the reasons why the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, and I moved the original Amendments Nos. 50 and 55 was to give a substantial parliamentary element to the consideration of remedial orders. I greatly welcome the new amendment tabled by the Minister. I have just one reservation. It is the one made by my noble friend Lord Goodhart; that is, it makes no reference to the scrutiny by Parliament as distinct from consideration by the Executive.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-23_para9"></a>I recognise that the Minster has gone some way towards meeting the point raised in Committee by extending the period of consideration to 60 days, but I should be most grateful if he, or his noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor, would say a little more. I recognise the difficulties because the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has said more than once that this must be a matter for Parliament; but if it is a matter for Parliament it is one where the Government's assurances and statements will be taken into account. Perhaps a little more could be said about how the Government consider the possible responsibilities and developments of the committee were it to be set up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-23_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I certainly agree with the noble Baroness that this is an important group of amendments. In Committee your Lordships discussed in some detail the procedure for making a Clause 12 remedial order. There was undoubtedly feeling that the procedure should be amended to make it easier for <P>


<a name="column_407"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 407</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Parliament to exercise its scrutinising role. Amendments were tabled on that occasion to lengthen the period for consideration of remedial orders to provide for the scrutiny by a parliamentary committee and to enable them to be amended by Parliament. Similar amendments have been tabled for Report. They are before your Lordships again. In Committee, we undertook to reflect on the concerns that had been expressed. As your Lordships will see, we have responded and we have concluded that some changes to the procedure should be made, although we have not adopted all the suggestions made in Committee. Nonetheless, we hope that the government amendments will give a measure of satisfaction.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-23_para10"></a>The first change we propose relates to the period for consideration of draft remedial orders. Under Clause 12(1)(a), no remedial order may be made unless a draft has been approved by Parliament. No period of time is prescribed for this procedure, so it would be possible for a draft to be approved, and an order made, very soon after the draft was laid before Parliament. The effect of government Amendments Nos. 51, 57 and 58 is to provide a minimum period of 60 days' consideration before a draft of the order may be approved by Parliament. The noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, was good enough to call attention to that. This is designed to allow interested parties an adequate period of time in which to comment upon a draft remedial order. It responds to amendments tabled in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Meston, and to one aspect of the amendments tabled by the Opposition.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-23_para11"></a>I ought to point out that the government amendments depart from those tabled in Committee in not providing a 60-day period for the consideration of urgent remedial orders made under clause 12(1)(b). In these cases the order will expire after 40 days unless approved by Parliament. These orders are to be made without prior parliamentary approval, and we do not want to extend the time in which they may have effect without such approval. A 60-day period for consideration of these orders would simply delay the point at which Parliament could, if it chose, express its disapproval of the order.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-23_para12"></a>The other change that we propose is in the government Amendment No. 56. It would require a remedial order, or draft, to be accompanied by an explanatory statement. This would contain particulars of the court case in which the declaration of incompatibility had been made, and would seek to explain what the incompatibility was. It is designed, therefore, to facilitate the consideration of remedial orders by Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-23_para13"></a>We think this would be helpful because we still believe, as we said in Committee, that it would not be appropriate to create a statutory, and I emphasise statutory, requirement for the scrutiny of remedial orders by a parliamentary committee, as the amendments in the name of the noble Baroness and others would do. We assume that this will be the parliamentary committee on human rights, and we have said before, and I say again, that we would welcome the establishment of such a committee, but it is a matter for Parliament. We do not want to anticipate what the functions of that Committee might be. As we said in Committee, it is not normal practice for provisions of this kind to be set out in statute, and I have to say that I do not think there is a case for departing from <P>


<a name="column_408"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 408</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the normal practice on this occasion. But I made perfectly plain what the position of the Government is in relation to the establishment of a parliamentary committee on human rights. Nor do we think it necessary to provide for the amendment of remedial orders once made or laid in draft, as proposed in the Opposition amendments. Statutory instruments cannot be amended. An instrument has to be revoked, remade or another amending instrument made, and remedial orders are no different. The advantage of the draft affirmative resolution procedure in Clause 12 is that Parliament can decline to approve so the order cannot be made and a further order would then have to be prepared to meet Parliament's concerns; otherwise the incompatibility desired to be removed would simply continue. The explanatory document that we propose will make it possible for Parliament to have an informed debate about the incompatibility which has been exactly identified by a court and what the Government's proposals are for removing it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-23_para14"></a>In proposing these changes I can say that I am conscious of looking ahead to the possible establishment of a parliamentary committee on human rights. Such a committee, I can readily say, would be able to look afresh at the issue of procedure in the light of the experience gained in operating these provisions. If it recommended that a closer Parliamentary scrutiny of remedial orders was needed, I am sure that the Government would be very much influenced by that. But for the present, although we cannot accept the Opposition amendments or those in the name of the noble Baroness, and others, I hope the House will accept, particularly in the light of the explanations that I have given, that we do offer the government amendments for approval by your Lordships' House in a spirit of conciliation and as improvements which go some considerable way towards meeting the concerns expressed in committee. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80129-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor for having gone just a little way towards meeting some of the demands and requests made both by myself and by noble Lords from the Liberal Democrat Benches.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-24_para0"></a>However, I have to say that I do not think that the noble and learned Lord went far enough on this occasion. I referred earlier, as did other noble Lords, to the report from the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee. I can assure the noble and learned Lord that whenever that Committee made recommendations when we were in government we were always most scrupulous in taking up those recommendations and in acting upon them. It would be right if we allowed the House at least to have the opportunity on this occasion to consider the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-24_para1"></a>I appreciate that the noble and learned Lord has made a number of concessions. He has lengthened the period of delay from 40 days to 60 days at a time when I was suggesting bringing it down from 60 days to 40 days. I do not think that the actual period of time available for scrutiny of these orders is a matter of great importance. What I do believe is important is that Parliament itself, and not just the Executive, has some power, some ability, for developing a procedure whereby it can amend these orders. That is what was recommended by the Delegated <P>

<A NAME = "80129-24_para14"></a>There are, of course, two kinds of relationship created in the Bill between convention and domestic law: the interpretive principle in Clauses 3 to 5, and the right to rely on convention rights against a public authority in Clauses 6 to 9.

We hope that your Lordships will find the amendment to be a useful clarification. I beg to move.

<A NAME="80129-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I greatly welcome the amendment. I do so because it makes clear that which is already implicit in the Bill--namely, that the European convention contains a floor of minimum rights guaranteed under international law, but does not create a ceiling. Therefore, if Parliament chooses to go further or if the common law goes further in protecting our basic rights and freedoms, which are inherent in us as citizens and human beings, the convention and the Bill are not to restrict that. The fact that that is a minimum and not a maximum is made clear in the convention itself. It does not mean that there will never be conflict and difficult questions to be resolved as a result of people arguing that, say, the Race Relations Act is an infringement of some basic right in the convention, or other such points. It is important that one does not concentrate only upon the convention as a guarantee of rights. As the amendment makes clear, the common law will continue to develop in a creative way and no doubt the convention will be used, as the Bill makes clear, in the course of developing the common law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-24_para15"></a>I, for one, believe that one should approach convention rights through out common law and through the statute book, not round the common law or the statute book. That is to say, one intertwines convention rights into our domestic legal system. One of the many virtues of the Bill is the fact that those who have thought it through and drafted it have found ways to create very subtle connections between convention rights and our own statute law and common law. This modest looking amendment is designed to make all of that clear. It is to be welcomed.

I hope that the noble and learned Lord will regard the amendments that I now move as a completely satisfactory response by the Government to the issues which he then explored.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-25_para1"></a>The Bill makes provision for the appointment of a UK judge to the European Court of Human Rights. It is possible, although not necessary, that the appointment will be made from among the ranks of serving judges. If that happens, the judge will be in a unique situation; and, in announcing the pension arrangements that will apply to him, I emphasise that no precedent is being set that could apply to any other position. The Government are concerned to ensure that, should a judge already serving in the United Kingdom be the preferred choice for appointment to the ECHR, he or she should not be adversely affected in pension provision when compared to every other judge serving in the UK. The amendments taken together ensure that a UK judge who is for a time serving in the ECHR will be treated for pension purposes as if he had not left his UK office.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-25_para2"></a>Amendment No. 62 paves the way for that process by restoring the provision about pensions in the Supreme Court Act. It is, as I have explained, no longer appropriate to apply the rest of Section 12 to an ECHR judge, as it would mean paying his United Kingdom salary in addition to his European salary, even though he was not actively performing any judicial duties in the <P>


<a name="column_413"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 413</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>UK. Therefore, he will not have two salaries, but only his European salary. However, it is obviously right that his pension rights should not be prejudiced.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-25_para3"></a>As it is our intention that his eventual pension should be paid as if he had not had a period of service at the ECHR, it is right that the provision in Section 12(7) should remain applicable. Amendment No. 64 removes the general power to make pension provision for the ECHR judge; this is because it is replaced with a much more specific duty to make such provision. In changing the power to make arrangements to a duty to make specific types of arrangements, I am confident that the concerns expressed in Committee by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, will be met.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-25_para4"></a>Amendment No. 74 introduces a new schedule to the Bill, Schedule 3. This schedule contains the detail of how that pension provision will be made. It is intended that orders made under Schedule 3 will be subject to the negative resolution procedure, and Amendment No. 67 gives effect to this. Schedule 3 imposes a duty on the relevant Minister, who will usually be the Lord Chancellor, to make an order making pension provision for any serving UK judge appointed as a judge of the ECHR. It further provides that any such order must allow a judge who is a member of a judicial pension scheme to remain in that scheme, that the terms of membership must be as if he had not been appointed to the ECHR and that entitlement to benefits will be calculated in accordance with the salary as increased from time to time of the UK office which that judge holds. The order may also contain provisions as to how contributions will be collected from the UK judge. This is needed because contributions towards dependants' benefits are normally deducted from the judicial salary received by a judge, but the judge serving in the ECHR will not be receiving a salary in this country so that alternative arrangements will be needed for the collection of these contributions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-25_para5"></a>There is also power to amend relevant judicial pension legislation in order to facilitate the proper administration of a scheme. This will enable the modification or disapplication of pre-existing legislative provisions, should this prove necessary, to enable suitable administrative arrangements to be made to give effect to the policy. It is not envisaged that this power will be needed to any extent, if at all, but the pensions legislation is inherently complex and such a power--limited for this purpose--seems prudent. These amendments together will ensure that a UK judge appointed to the ECHR will in due course receive the same pension as if the ECHR appointment had not taken place. I believe that this will remove what might have been a powerful disincentive for some of our most able and highly qualified candidates from the judiciary to seek appointment to the ECHR. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, in Committee, in my capacity as judicial shop steward emeritus, I raised the amendments which have resulted in my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor tabling on Report the amendments which he has just described. They were <P>


<a name="column_414"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 414</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>important amendments because they dealt with a constitutional matter of some importance. Section 12(3) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Any salary payable under this section may be increased, but not reduced, by a determination or further determination under this section". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

Pension is but deferred salary. I was concerned that the judicial pension, whose value has been much reduced by the judicial retirement and pensions Bill by requiring a judge to work 20 years instead of 15 years to achieve his 50 per cent. pension--totally out of line with pension provisions in Commonwealth jurisdictions--should not be further prejudiced if a judge were to accept an appointment at the Strasbourg Court. I therefore raised the objection that if the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor were to remove the protection of Section 12(3), something must be put in its place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-25_para6"></a>I am deeply grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor for having fought my battle with those who normally would defeat the claim for the judicial pension to be safeguarded, and to have fought it so well, so ably and so effectively. It is an indication of the generosity of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, although there are occasions when it is hidden so deeply that one does not immediately bear it in mind. I am most grateful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, during the period since the creation of the European Court and Commission of Human Rights we have been fortunate in the quality of members of both institutions coming from this country. One recalls, for example, the very first British judge to that institution, the great international lawyer, Lord McNair, who was, I believe, the grandfather of my noble friend Lord McNair. One also recalls Sir Humphrey Waldock and Sir James Fawcett, who was, I believe, for 20 years a member of the European Commission of Human Rights. One comes to the present incumbents. I mention judges such as Sir Vincent Evans, and now Sir John Freeland, and Nicolas Bratza QC as the commissioner. They have all performed a vital public service, not always as well recognised in this country as it might have been. Most of them have been former senior legal advisers to the Foreign Office. None of them has ever been a serving British judge, or former British judge. In some ways that has been a pity because a more significant judicial contribution might have been made if we had had some of our great British judges serving in the European Court. There would have been a contrast with membership of the Court of Justice of the European communities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-25_para7"></a>I very much welcome these provisions which will enable effect to be given to some important principles. First, it is essential that members of this new European Court of Human Rights, who will become full time from November when the Eleventh Protocol comes into force, should be of the highest calibre, of outstanding quality. Some of us are concerned that with such a large court of perhaps 40 judges drawn from across Europe--east, west and central--it would be difficult to obtain judges of the highest quality.
<P>


<a name="column_415"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 415</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-25_para8"></a>Secondly, as the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has indicated, it is important that we ensure that there are no disincentives so that distinguished British jurists, whether drawn from the Bench or otherwise, are not deterred from forming that critical mass of intellectual and moral leaders who are needed if the new court is to succeed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-25_para9"></a>I therefore think that these are important provisions. They will facilitate those objectives. I ask this question only out of curiosity. Do we have similar provisions, or are they needed in respect of members of the European Court of Justice to ensure similar treatment? In my ignorance, I do not know whether similar provisions are in place. In practice, there seems to be no such problem for the European Court of Justice. It has always had judges of outstanding quality who have often sat as judges in this country before going to Luxembourg. These provisions apply only to the Strasbourg court for the good reason that the Bill is concerned only with the European Convention.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-26_para4"></a>He will see that in the Bill the words "public general Act" are used. Our concern is whether the phrase "public general Act" covers Acts of Parliament from the English Parliament or the Scottish Parliament passed before the Act of Union in 1707. I am advised that there are still some Acts on the statute book and could therefore be relevant. We were unsure whether "public general Act" covered those cases. An assurance from the noble and learned Lord that the words cover Acts of Parliament passed by both those Parliaments before 1707 would satisfy us. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-26_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Advocate   (Lord Hardie): </B>  My Lords, I think it is fair to say that we are dealing here with what is a purely drafting point. This amendment would insert into the definition of primary legislation in Clause 21 of the Bill an express reference to Acts of the Parliaments of England and Scotland passed before the union of England and Scotland in 1707. As the noble Lord opposite explained, the concern is to ensure that such Acts are treated as primary rather than subordinate legislation under the Bill. At present the Bill defines primary legislation as including a "public general Act" but it does not further define what is meant by a public general Act. In fact the term is nowhere defined in legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-26_para5"></a>The question whether the definition of primary legislation should expressly include references to the various pre-union Parliaments was one which the Government considered before the Bill was introduced.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-26_para6"></a>The issue arises not only in connection with the former Parliaments of England and Scotland, to which this amendment refers, but also in connection with the Parliament of Great Britain which existed in the period from 1707 to 1801; that is, after the Union of England and Scotland and before the union with Ireland, and in connection with the Parliament of Ireland in the period before 1801.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-26_para7"></a>As noble Lords may be aware, the treaties of union themselves affirm the continuing validity of former legislation so far as not altered or repealed by the successor Parliaments. Article XVIII of the Preamble to the Union with Scotland Act 1706, for example, preserves (with certain exceptions) the validity of all,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"laws in use within the kingdom of Scotland". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-26_para8"></a>Similarly there is no doubt that pre-1801 Acts of the Parliament of Ireland form part of the body of legislation in Northern Ireland. That follows from Section 1, Eighth Article of the Union with Ireland Act 1800 and the express savings provided by Section 61 of the Government of Ireland Act 1920.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-26_para9"></a>We concluded that there was no need to make express provision on the point raised. The Bill invites a judge presented with a piece of legislation to conduct a very simple exercise to decide whether the legislation is primary or secondary. There can be no serious risk that the enactments of old Parliaments which preceded the United Kingdom Parliament in its present form could ever be regarded as subordinate legislation. In our view the enactments of those Parliaments must be primary <P>


<a name="column_417"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>legislation for the purposes of this Bill. In the light of that explanation I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="80129-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I have every intention of withdrawing the amendment, and I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate for staying here all evening purely to deal with this one amendment. I can only offer an apology to the House that, as a Peer of Ireland as well as a Peer of the United Kingdom, I failed to include Acts of the Irish Parliament and Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain that existed between 1707 and 1801. I shall not return to this matter at Third Reading. I believe that the assurances given to me by the noble and learned Lord are perfectly correct. However, should the issue arise again, I shall remember, when putting forward such amendments, to include other Parliaments as well as those that I did include. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-26_para18"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, this is an amendment to the Title of the Bill. I moved it in the same form in Committee very late at night. I had hoped to move it before a full House this evening. There is nobody on the Government Back-Benches, so far as I can see. I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, has been faithful on the Liberal Democrat Benches, and there may be somebody else. I did the noble Lord, Lord Monkswell, a disservice; I did not see him enter the Chamber. As usual, the noble Lord, Lord Renton, has rightly come to invigilate on questions of statutory construction.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-26_para19"></a>Tribute has rightly been paid to the draftsmanship and construction of the Bill. However, even with the best drafted measure the courts can be assisted by indications as to how it should be interpreted. There need not necessarily be an ambiguity. There is quite often matter for argument.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-26_para20"></a>There are two, or possibly three, ways of indicating how a measure should be interpreted. The first is by examining the whole of the enacting provisions; but in addition (and secondly) in appropriate cases a purpose clause can be introduced. In my respectful submission, this was a very suitable measure for the inclusion of a purpose clause, and the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, proposed one which met with general affirmation. He withdrew it in order to consider the matter further before Third Reading. It is erroneously reported in Hansard that the amendment was negatived. It was not, it was withdrawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-26_para21"></a>The third method, by no means mutually exclusive with the other two, is an indication in the Long Title of a Bill. There is this to be said in favour of such an indication of construction, that unless the Long Title <P>


<a name="column_419"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 419</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>does that, it serves no useful purpose at all. A few sessions ago we had a Long Title that ran to three-quarters of a page or even longer. We moved an amendment reducing it to four lines and finally compromised on seven lines. But even then it served absolutely no purpose. It merely reiterated what the table of contents said more conspicuously.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-26_para22"></a>In the absence at the moment of a purpose clause, this is very much a case where the Long Title can be slightly amended in order to give an indication. At present, it reads:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An Act to give further effect to rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

My noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor said quite correctly that that was perfectly true. So it is; it is a truism. There are two directions in which the Bill gives further force to the Convention. One is that it amplifies rights already given by our common law and contributes to the European Convention. The other is that it makes the Convention rights enforceable against public authorities in our own courts. But that is clear from the contents of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-26_para23"></a>What a court of construction wants to know is whether it is intended that the Convention rights should apply in domestic law. That is precisely what the White Paper said and what my noble and learned friend has said on many occasions. So all I suggest is that in place of "further effect", the Long Title should read "domestic effect". That will mean something to a court of construction, whereas the Long Title at the moment means nothing at all. I beg to move.

We are in effect giving our domestic courts the jurisdiction relating to the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights.

<P>


<a name="column_420"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 420</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-27_para1"></a>First, Sir Geoffrey Palmer, a former Prime Minister of New Zealand, when explaining the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, said something rather wise. He said, "Bills are made to pass". I use that phrase when I hear critics of this Bill saying that it has diluted the milk of pure principle in some way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-27_para2"></a>I am sure that the Government chose the words of the Bill carefully to enable the Bill to pass. That may explain some curious and ingenious formulae that have been used in the Bill. I suspect that the Long Title is defined as
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An Act to give further effect to rights and freedoms", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

rather than,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to give domestic effect to rights and freedoms", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

not because of some doctrinal or theological objection to the notion of giving domestic effect. That is already made clear in the White Paper, as I hope the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor will agree when he comes to reply. It is clear from the White Paper that this measure is designed to give domestic effect to convention rights and freedoms; it is designed to incorporate the convention into domestic law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-27_para3"></a>I cannot read the substance of the Bill in any other way. The only matter which gives me cause for concern and made me decide to put my name down in support of the amendment is that earlier in the debate the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor said something which I found extremely curious. He said something along the lines, "This Bill will not incorporate convention rights into the substance of domestic law". That seemed to me to be an almost mystical concept which I could not understand. It seems to me that if the Bill does anything clearly, it incorporates convention rights into the substance of our domestic law and it does so in a number of ways.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-27_para4"></a>One way is by commanding judges to read statutes, where possible, to comply with convention law. That is where it embodies convention rights into our statute law. Another way is that it requires judges to be a public authority bound by the convention and therefore interpreting and applying the common law and statute law to give effect to convention rights. Therefore in those ways it surely does incorporate convention rights into the substance of our domestic law. If we can agree about that, it will go a long way towards assuring me that, whatever the reasons for those curious words in the Long Title, at least it is quite plain that the central object and purpose of this Bill is to give domestic effect to convention rights and freedoms. If that is clear it may well be that this amendment is otiose.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-27_para5"></a>If there were any ambiguity about it then I believe that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, has the better of the argument. There is a powerful case. I wish that the matter had been dealt with by a purpose clause and at an earlier stage. This is the last amendment that we shall consider today. Before we say farewell to this Bill it is important that this matter is put beyond any doubt. I therefore support the amendment.

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 421</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>last that we have to consider at Report stage, took the opportunity to remark that the House was not as fully attended as it might be at this hour. In the dying moments of Report stage on this Bill, I shall give the noble and learned Lord an additional opportunity to have the last word by rebuking me yet again on my unyielding disposition in relation to this jewel of a Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-27_para6"></a>I do not believe that there is much that I can add to what I said when Amendment No. 75 was debated at Committee stage. The word "further" is included in the Long Title because, in our national arrangements, the convention can, and is, already applied in a variety of different circumstances and is relied on in a range of ways by our own courts.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-27_para7"></a>The Bill will greatly increase the ability of our courts to enforce convention rights, but it is not introducing a wholly new concept. As I have said before, the Bill as such does not incorporate convention rights into domestic law but, in accordance with the language of the Long Title, it gives further effect in the United Kingdom to convention rights by requiring the courts in Clause 3(1),
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"So far as it is possible to do so" </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

to construe--in the language of the statute, to read and give effect to--primary legislation and subordinate legislation in a way which is compatible with the convention rights. That is an interpretative principle.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, I am very reluctant to interrupt the noble and learned Lord. I believe that he said just now that it was an Act to give further effect in the United Kingdom,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

The words "United Kingdom" do not appear in the Long Title. It merely says, "further effect". If we say, "domestic effect" we make it clear that it is in the United Kingdom. The phrase that the noble and learned Lord has used would then be implemented.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-27_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, when I used the words "in the United Kingdom" I was not reading from the words of the Long Title. The words in the Bill are,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An Act to give further effect to rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

But I have not conceded that this Bill claims any extra territorial effect. I do not believe that it is a great flight of the imagination to read it as meaning in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-27_para8"></a>I have to make this point absolutely plain. The European Convention on Human Rights under this Bill is not made part of our law. The Bill gives the European Convention on Human Rights a special relationship which will mean that the courts will give effect to the interpretative provisions to which I have already referred, but it does not make the convention directly justiciable as it would be if it were expressly made part of our law. I want there to be no ambiguity about that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the Lord Chancellor; but I wonder whether he would mind explaining the difference <P>


<a name="column_422"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column 422</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>between requiring our courts (as a public authority) to give effect to the convention; requiring our courts where possible to interpret Acts of Parliament to comply with the convention; requiring our courts in developing the common law to have regard to the convention rights, and requiring our courts to give effective remedies where there is a breach of those rights. What is the difference between all of that and incorporating the convention? What else would be needed over and above all that in order to incorporate the convention?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-27_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, this is fast becoming something of a theological dispute and I should like to bring it to a conclusion as quickly as I may. The short point is that if the convention rights were incorporated into our law, they would be directly justiciable and would be enforced by our courts. That is not the scheme of this Bill. If the courts find it impossible to construe primary legislation in a way which is compatible with the convention rights, the primary legislation remains in full force and effect. All that the courts may do is to make a declaration of incompatibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-27_para9"></a>I have a feeling that in these dying moments of Report stage we are behaving in a way in which judges sometimes behave at the end of a very long case. It is almost as if they cannot bring themselves to depart from the case and to be left to consider it themselves, and question after question continues. I have given the best argument that I may.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   My Lords, I am quite satisfied that my noble and learned friend has given the best answer that can be given. We can therefore leave this to a later stage or to the other place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-27_para10"></a>I am most grateful for the cogent support that I have received on this amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, was altogether too modest. His intervention was extremely powerful. I am particularly grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Renton, who is such an authority on statutory interpretation--not only in himself but because he comes trailing the clouds of glory of the Committee on Preparation of Legislation. The final word was said by him: further effect? What further effect? That is left entirely at large. There is no guidance to the courts at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-27_para11"></a>My noble and learned friend said that this Bill is not intended to incorporate the convention into our domestic law. That is at variance with various points that have been made, but so be it for the moment. The amendment to the Long Title does not suggest that it should be. All that it seeks to do is to give "domestic" effect to the convention rights and that is incontrovertibly what it does. However, it is now nearly a quarter to ten, and I am 87 years of age, so I claim leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-27_para12"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Skidelsky </B>   moved Amendment No. 37A:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 18, leave out lines 5 and 6 and insert--
<BR>
("(a) helping to develop talent and achievements in the fields of science, technology and arts;").<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I slip out slightly before we finish this evening. Also, as this is the last day of the Grand Committee on the National Lottery Bill, I take this opportunity to thank the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, for his courtesy and consideration in the last two sessions of the Committee. I look forward to renewing our engagement today and on Report.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para4"></a>In moving Amendment No. 37A I start by stating briefly our general concern about the way NESTA is being set up. First, we welcome it; it is a good and imaginative idea. We also like the fact that it has been endowed. This links it to an old British tradition in setting up public institutions going back to the Middle Ages. Had the method of endowment been used for our new universities or, to give another example, for the Royal Opera House these institutions probably would not have experienced their recurrent financial crises--or at least not so acutely--and would have been independent bodies in fact and not just in name.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para5"></a>Here our first worry creeps in. I quote what the noble Lord said at Second Reading:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"NESTA is the ne plus ultra of the arm's length principle".--[Official Report, 18/12/97; col.790.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para6"></a>However, we see some rather large fingerprints of the Secretary of State on it, especially in Clause 19. Our amendments are designed to give it more genuine independence. Unless some of the Secretary of State's powers are limited, the danger is that it will become his toy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para7"></a>A second worry is duplication. The objects for which NESTA is being set up are already being partly fulfilled by other grant-giving bodies--for example, the research councils--but also by charities. We do not want either taxpayers' money or private donations to be diverted to NESTA. Again, the question of additionality, which has dogged our footsteps right through the Bill, rears its head. Will NESTA, for example, be able to consider an application from a university group which would otherwise have been directed to a research council or to the British Academy? We want NESTA to be additional <P>


<a name="column_CWH108"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column CWH108</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to other initiatives including voluntary ones, not a substitute for them. Finally, we do not want NESTA, any more than we want the new opportunities fund in general, to suck money away from the other good causes. We shall therefore be seeking to limit the Secretary of State's powers to enlarge its endowment at the expense of the original good causes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para8"></a>I turn to my amendment. Amendment No. 37A is simply a drafting amendment. The word "individual" in the Bill suggests that only individuals will be eligible for grants; it carries that suggestion. We do not want to exclude team and group projects: for example, fringe film companies is one object that has been discussed. We believe that our draft accomplishes this aim.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para9"></a>As for Amendment No. 37B, which relates to subsection(2)(b), I should like to ask how exactly NESTA is supposed to help people turn inventions and ideas into products and services. The Government's note on Clause 15 gives no examples. Is NESTA supposed to finance companies or groups to market their products? Is it supposed to enter into competition with banks? If so, is that not back to the bad old days of picking winners?
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para10"></a>The contention seems to be that we are very good at inventions but banks or others are reluctant to back them, so they end up being exploited overseas. The argument that our innovators have suffered from lack of venture capital is an old one, but it is very hard to prove. Surely, whatever the case, NESTA should not seek to become a venture capitalist or business angel in its own right. We should have learned by now that government agencies should not try to second guess the private sector. In the end it is the taxpayer, or in this case other National Lottery initiatives, who suffers the losses of bad decisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para11"></a>Also, what does it mean "to help protect property rights"? Are these not already protected by copyright and patent laws? It seems to us that the Government are trying to edge NESTA into commercial activities in which it should not be involved. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   This amendment gives me the opportunity to probe the real intentions of setting up NESTA and to seek an explanation from the Minister as to why the Government's intentions in this field appear to be relatively limited. In reading the White Paper, and indeed the debate held at Second Reading, I am left with a considerable series of questions in my mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para12"></a>As I understand it, NESTA has an important, though limited, role. Like my noble friend, I am not quite certain how far it goes, particularly with this reference to individuals, and indeed what its limitations are. It is certainly perfectly possible to think of the development of scientific or intellectual ideas, but when we come to the arts, are we only dealing with the encouragement of the writer or the artist in creating a particular individual work? Are we, as has been indicated, going further and talking possibly about the ability to create scripts and productions in the world of film? If we are going that far, then what about artistic productions in the theatre or in opera?
<P>


<a name="column_CWH109"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column CWH109</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para13"></a>That takes me to the central question that I have about this Bill, and it is something which genuinely puzzles me. My noble friend Lord Gowrie, in an eloquent speech at Second Reading, drew attention to the huge problems facing the arts at the present time, particularly with regard to the shortage of revenue funding. In column 773 of Hansard on 18th December, he spoke of the huge capital inflows, which he suggested had led the Treasury to cut our small revenue. He spoke of our suffering the worst arts revenue crisis in his adult lifetime, and he referred to specific examples.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para14"></a>A good many of the supporters of the Government have in recent weeks expressed their dismay, concern and surprise about the situation they now face. They criticise the present Government because they believe they are merely continuing policies which they strongly criticised when they were pursued by the previous administration. In making those criticisms, some of those most outspoken tend to paint a picture of the arts having been in a catastrophic period over the past 20 years. I shall go on to comment about the shortcomings which I believe have existed in government policy under both the previous administration and the present Administration, but I happen to believe that the past 20 years have in many respects been one of the most productive periods we have seen in modern times as far as large sections of the arts are concerned. Despite the recurrent problems that have arisen, I do not believe that we have ever in this country had such a wealth of talent in the opera companies, or have seen such a series of outstanding productions from a number of opera companies. The strength of some of our orchestras has been remarkable, and theatre too.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para15"></a>However, it is true that in the early 1980s the arts were greatly helped at a time when there were government constraints by the strength of funding from the private sector. That funding tended to fall away as we moved into a period of recession and the problems grew.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para16"></a>In criticising what is happening now, let me assure the Minister that I am not doing something that I did not do even when I was in government. I did something in this field--I sent a minute to the Prime Minister which I certainly did not make a practice of as Secretary of State for Wales--at some point in the early part of the 1980s expressing my acute concern about policies for funding the arts and expressing the view that even quite modest increases in funding could make a dramatic difference. I supported the then Minister for the Arts--now Governor of Gibraltar, having moved on to a different role in life--in the battle he was having in the PES exchanges in government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para17"></a>I would add that as Secretary of State for Wales I made a practice of finding financial support out of my block grant in Wales for heritage bodies. I found the money to build the art galleries at the national museum. Indeed those policies were followed by some of my successors; at least one of them supported the Welsh National Opera, for example, in a moment of crisis. This is an ongoing saga, but the fact of the matter is we have a lottery which has been injecting vast capital sums, and we can be thankful for that, but we face the real risk that as <P>


<a name="column_CWH110"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column CWH110</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we move into the next millennium there will be no one to use the buildings. The companies that should be occupying them will be in a state of crisis.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para18"></a>This applies not only to the performing arts. Some of our national museums are still in a pretty bleak condition. I paid a visit to the Victoria and Albert Museum a little over a year ago. (I was practically brought up in the Victoria and Albert Museum. My father was keeper of the department of woodwork for many years.) I went upstairs to look at the British collections. I have to say I was almost in tears, tears of frustration and anger, as I left. I had earlier been admiring the superb exhibits of the Indian and the Far Eastern collections, to take two examples, funded on a magnificent scale by those from overseas. The display of our own collections at the present time in the Victoria and Albert Museum are a national humiliation and a disgrace. I think those involved would admit it. They keep talking about the difficulty of finding adequate funding to do anything about it. The collections are nothing like as good as they were in the period after the war, when those exhibits were first restored by the then director, Leigh Ashton, and others.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para19"></a>We have a pretty desperate situation right across the field of the arts. Here, as I understand it, with NESTA we are taking a modest but important step into a very limited area. I am not at all sure how limited that area is, and nothing I have read provides clarity. We keep hearing statements from those who now have the job of defending arts policy on behalf of the Government that steps are being taken to move away from the previous constraints that limited lottery funding entirely to capital projects. Indeed, the Secretary of State--facing a blitzkrieg from critics on television the other night--used words which indeed suggested that there was going to be a new ability to provide revenue funding for people and for activities taking place in the buildings, not just capital funding.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para20"></a>I am sorry I was not able to be present at Second Reading just before Christmas to make this point, but I do not understand why the opportunity was not taken in this Bill to go much further than appears to be the case with NESTA. Why was the opportunity not taken to give the ability--as we come to the end of the need to go on funding great capital schemes--to help the performing companies, individuals and galleries carry out to the maximum possible extent their own objectives within those buildings? It will be an absurd situation if, when the Bill is passed, we continue to face a series of crises right across the field about which I have been speaking with no real ability to do anything substantially about it out of lottery funding without further legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para21"></a>It seems to me that we may be in the situation where we will be helping talented individuals in the fields of science, technology and the arts to develop their creative ideas, and then at the very moment when we might see them translated into vivid performances, into successful productions to strengthen the companies that invite the public in to see them, somehow the whole thing will fail and there will be no performing companies to take up the ideas. The productions that have been thought of, the ideas that will have been invented, will never be developed simply because we will be going on using money for a further range of capital buildings while the companies face an ongoing series of crises.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para22"></a>I simply take this opportunity to try to extract from Government a clearer idea of what their policy is, how far we can now go with the Bill as it now is, and to seek information as to whether there is any prospect as a consequence of this legislation of finding a way out of the mess which we are now in, a mess which I fully accept--and noble Lords are not going to have to use that defence--arose as much from policies of the previous administration as it does from those followed now by the present Government.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-28_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, began his treatment of the two amendments with some general remarks, and we are in complete agreement with the two main points that he made. There is no intention that NESTA will, as he put it, become the toy of the Secretary of State, and we certainly agree with him about the point which in brief was additionality, that NESTA should not be concerned with substituting for what is already available. We have tried to make this clear again and again in the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, said that NESTA should be more at arm's length, and I believe he mentioned Clause 19 as giving the Secretary of State too much control. However, Clause 19 is all about powers to allow the Secretary of State to provide safeguards for the lottery endowment, and the powers in Clause 19 are concerned only with financial control and accountability matters; he will have no powers to influence NESTA's policies and programmes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para23"></a>The noble Lord asked specifically whether NESTA will fund matters that other bodies fund, for example universities. We recognise that NESTA's interests overlap inevitably with some other bodies. We want NESTA to work with or through those bodies. In our opinion NESTA's first task should be to assess current provision, look for partners and ensure that its contributions are truly additional. That is a very important principle that we have tried to embody throughout the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para24"></a>The noble Lord also asked how NESTA would protect property rights. Intellectual property rights are protected by copyright, patents, design rights and so on, but protecting those rights and seeking registration in the case of some rights is a complex matter, particularly where rights need to be protected not only in this country but also in many other countries. Our idea is that NESTA will be able to work with inventors and artists to ensure that these rights are properly protected and we will be able to help them achieve that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para25"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, also raised this question of individuals. I now turn specifically to the two amendments that we are dealing with. NESTA is primarily about the talents and creativity of individuals and helping them to reach their full potential, but individuals can also be part of a wider group. It does not have to be one single individual. It can be one individual or a group of individuals. It is difficult to see how NESTA could address its support for talent to whole groups and teams without actually specifying individuals.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-28_para26"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, raised very important and serious points, which we would all echo, about the state of the arts in this country. Many of them will be dealt with under Amendment No. 39, with which my noble friend Lord McIntosh will be dealing later. We are concerned that lottery-funded buildings should have something to go in them. Other parts of the Bill and other actions we are taking will mean that lottery funding can address the needs of both capital and revenue of the good cause sectors. That is how the distributor strategies will address the framework which governs distribution.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   I should be grateful if the noble Baroness could help me on one specific point. I am not very good at interpreting the legal jargon of Bills, and I have cast my way around this Bill. I keep hearing the statement that there are other parts of the Bill. I simply have not been able to identify them. If there is going to be this change of policy, I want to know where it appears and to what extent action is possible under it to deal with the problem to which I am referring. I simply have not been able to identify it so far, and reading everything that has been said about the Bill, I am as confused about it as I was when I began.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-29_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   But what will not be dealt with under parts of the Bill are the objectives of NESTA. That is a negative answer, but I can certainly tell the noble Lord what is not there. When we come to Amendment No. 39 and that part of the Bill I hope that this discussion can continue there.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para0"></a>It is fair to say that the proposals for NESTA have been among the most widely welcomed of all the proposals of our White Paper. Nine out of 10 of the people who responded commenting on NESTA supported its establishment. The proposals which are now embodied in the Bill have been the subject of lengthy discussion and consultation outside and inside the Government, both before and since the general election. The response to NESTA has been overwhelmingly enthusiastic. I was pleased to hear that the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, also gives his support to the concept of NESTA.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para1"></a>The reason why NESTA has so captured people's enthusiasm is that it is perceived that there is a major and damaging gap in our national life which NESTA will fill. Britain is a country full of talent, ideas, innovation and creativity. As well as a source of national pride, this surely represents a real economic as well as a cultural value. Many of the jobs of the future will depend upon creativity. If we are to make the most of the advantages of the creativity of the British people, we must ensure that we support and nurture that creativity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para2"></a>Britain has too often failed to provide this support in the past. Too many of our talented young artists and musicians have found the way barred to them. Too many of our inventions have been exploited overseas because financial support could not be found to develop them here. Too many of our scientists have left to pursue their pioneering work in foreign laboratories. NESTA's primary object is,
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to support ... talent, innovation and creativity in the fields of science, technology and the arts". <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para3"></a>It will do so by helping talented individuals reach their full potential, and by helping turn good ideas and innovations into marketable products and services at the cutting edge of technology where financial support is often hard to come by. In these ways, NESTA will help the most talented people in our country to give of their best.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para4"></a>The first of the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, would remove NESTA's focus on,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"helping talented individuals reach their full potential". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para5"></a>Instead, it suggests that NESTA should help,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"develop talent and achievements". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para6"></a>On the face of it I would agree that this does not perhaps seem a significant difference but in practice we believe that the amendment is drawn far too wide. Developing talent and achievement is not the same as talented people reaching their full potential. The amendment seems to be aimed at a wider group of people, including those whose talents are not yet apparent or even noticeable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para7"></a>It is not a primary objective of NESTA to improve general access and involvement in science, technology and the arts, however laudable these aims are. The Government support many other programmes and projects designed to promote exactly such access, but NESTA's concern is with the brightest talents whose gifts might otherwise be diluted, squandered or just not developed. The wider NESTA's focus, the less support it would in practice be able to deliver to those with the greatest potential. The Government, therefore, support the original wording, rather than the noble Lord's amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para8"></a>The means by which NESTA is to achieve its objects, which are set out in Clause 15(2), include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(c) contributing to public knowledge and appreciation of science, technology and the arts". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para9"></a>We see this particular means as supporting NESTA's primary objectives--promoting talent and helping develop ideas. Ensuring public appreciation of the role of creativity will help to secure public support for NESTA's activities, but we do not expect NESTA to spend as much time and money on general public awareness activities as on its primary objectives. We are therefore considering whether we need to make it clear in Clause 15(1) that the public appreciation object in paragraph (b) is subservient to the main object at paragraph (a). If we consider that this needs to be made much more explicit, we will seek to return to this issue on Report.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para10"></a>The noble Lord's second amendment would remove altogether NESTA's capacity to support the development of new goods and services. At the cutting edge of innovation, it is often difficult to bring ideas to the marketplace. The noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, said he had often heard this, but he was not convinced. However, venture capital often fights shy of creative genius and all its attendant risks. The clear market failure places the UK at an economic disadvantage, and has done so until now, and it leaves others--notably the United States and Japan--to exploit and capitalise upon what was, very often, British creativity. The Japanese Government have estimated that 57 per cent. of major technological innovations which have benefited the Japanese economy <P>


<a name="column_CWH114"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>stemmed from ideas or inventions from the United Kingdom. I know those figures are often quoted--at least, I have read them a great deal recently--but they are nonetheless telling for the fact that they have been reiterated. If one reflects on what that means, it surely makes an unanswerable case about the fact that something needs to be done to help British creativity be exploited in its own country.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para11"></a>We need to do something to address this failure and to ensure that most of the benefit of British innovation, talent and ideas is reaped here and not overseas. The noble Lord's amendment would, we believe, move this major plank of NESTA's activities. That is one of its activities that has been warmly commended by so many people who have been working in exactly those fields.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para12"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will, on reflection, agree with the central purpose and means we have set out for NESTA. I appreciate that at the beginning of his remarks he joined in welcoming the creation of NESTA and the fact that it was endowed by the National Lottery, but I hope that in the light of all this he will withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="80129-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Chorley: </B>   Before the noble Lord withdraws his amendment or otherwise, I wonder whether I could ask a question in order to try to understand a little better how this will work. I am not sure whether I am addressing myself to the amendment to subsection (2)(a) or the amendment to subsection (2)(b). But what happens in the case of an individual who works for a company--he may even own the company--which is trying to establish a new technology that it eventually wants to market? Will NESTA be able to give help to that individual? If the property rights--that is, the benefit of the invention--accrue to the company, does that preclude the individual from getting help from NESTA? Can the noble Baroness give me some guidance?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-29_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I am not sure whether I can be of complete guidance to the noble Lord, but it seems to me that it would depend very much on what agreement the individual had with his company. I do not know whether it helps to say that "persons", as used here, also includes companies. However, on the specific point of a person working for a company and applying for something that is his idea, it would depend on the relationship and the agreement between him and the company as to whether it could be treated as his personal idea or the company's. I may have misunderstood the question.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Chorley: </B>   I do not want to prolong the discussion but subsection (2)(a) refers to "individuals"; I do not think that an individual can be a company. I can see that "persons" in subsection (2)(b) can be a company. Perhaps the noble Baroness will write to me in due course, but it will help tease out the scope.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-29_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   Yes, of course, I shall be happy to write to the noble Lord. However, the point is that "individuals" in subsection (2)(a) does mean one or a few individuals, but "persons" in subsection (2)(b) also includes companies.

<P>
<A NAME="80129-29_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Skidelsky: </B>   The Minister's reply has given us some indication of the difficulties of this subsection. That is why we are seeking to tighten it. For example, the provision in subsection (2)(a), which states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"helping talented individuals in the fields of science, technology and the arts to achieve their potential", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para13"></a>seems to me to reflect a rather romantic view of the artist--the talented individual starving in the garret, and NESTA comes to his rescue. The trouble is that NESTA is the national endowment of science, technology and the arts. Unless it was purely for the convenience of the acronym that led to science and technology being put first, that has no relation to innovation in sciences and technology. These are team efforts, and creativity is a collective thing. They are laboratories, they are experiments, they are groups of people.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para14"></a>The word "individuals" just gives the wrong emphasis to the whole thing. It suggests that the Government have the idea of the starving artist as their paradigm. That is surely not the message that NESTA wants to be sent out, especially when coupled with the Minister's sad reflections on how inventions keep going abroad, are exploited by others and so forth, and that NESTA is designed to stop this happening. I suggest that wording does not relate to the objectives of NESTA centrally, as either stated by the Minister or in any of the notes we have had. That is why we want to change it. We may not have come across quite the right wording, but surely we have to find some way of getting "individuals" out of the central position, and making the provision more relevant to the needs of British science and technology, if indeed they are of the types that have been described.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para15"></a>The idea that our economy has lost a war over the past century because the British genius has not found expression in British industry and because owners are too stupid and banks too shortsighted--"Will Huttonism" one might call this--the Government have bought hook, line and sinker. It is totally unprovable. There may be something in it, there may not, but I am interested in the mechanics of the process.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para16"></a>I asked a number of questions. Is NESTA supposed to enter into competition with banks in lending innovators money? Is its judgment supposed to supersede commercial judgment about the value of the products? If so, at the end of that do the losses fall to the taxpayer or to other National Lottery causes? We do not believe that NESTA should be set up to be a commercial organisation. I know the noble Baroness said this was a subsidiary aim and not the main aim, but there it is, and we believe that it should not be. That should not be the aim because only trouble will lie along that route.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-29_para17"></a>I would beg the Government to take what we are saying seriously, not respond automatically, and do something to tidy up this subsection. It is going to land NESTA in trouble, and we are seeking to avoid that trouble.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-30_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I hoped that what I said would have persuaded the noble Lord that we were taking what he said extremely seriously and considering it very properly. I do not want to prolong this discussion too much at this stage, but I shall just deal with the two main points he made.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH116"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column CWH116</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-30_para0"></a>The word "individuals", the noble Lord pointed out, carried us away on a romantic idea about starving artists in garrets. Performing and creative artists usually have a pretty bad time financially, even if one hopes they do not starve in garrets. It is also true that talented scientists and inventors have similar problems. It is not true that one cannot have the same idea about helping people who are talented in the fields of science and technology just as in the arts--whether the performing arts or the creative arts--and giving them the help that they would not be able to get in any other way. That would be a very worthwhile thing to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-30_para1"></a>On the issue of trying to help market British inventions, I do not quite know why the noble Lord keeps repeating that this is not provable. When the Japanese Government say that 50 per cent. of the inventions it processes come from Britain, that is part of the proof of something going wrong. I do not think it is arguable that Britain has been as successful as the United States and Japan, and even as some other European countries, in making full use of and fully exploiting economically and technically the inventions of its own scientists and technologists. The noble Lord spoke about whether NESTA is going to be in competition with banks.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   I apologise for intervening at this point. One of the problems that many of the people who develop ideas have at the moment--and my own brother-in-law is a designer--is that when taking your product to market it is often easier to get it developed and produced overseas, because the processing is so much cheaper over there. Would NESTA also look along those lines of the secondary manufacture of designed goods?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-30_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   Why not? This would be up to NESTA. NESTA will have as its object what we have put down. The way it could try to achieve its end of helping British inventors to market their inventions properly would be up to NESTA, and I would see no problem in it looking at all these potential ways of doing it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-30_para2"></a>With regard to the question of being in competition with banks, NESTA is not meant to be in competition with anybody and certainly not banks. What NESTA is about is reaching the parts that other methods do not reach in this sense of giving help and support. Yes, the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, is right in that there may be losses here, and the reason why venture capital is sometimes reluctant to help create a genius, as we have said earlier, is because there are big risks involved. We therefore must accept that NESTA will have to take risks, and NESTA will undoubtedly back some things which will lose money. That is why NESTA will have to take risks which venture capital will not be prepared to take, but that is one of the reasons why I believe we need NESTA.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Skidelsky: </B>   We will not prolong this. One day I hope to persuade the noble Baroness that the Japanese examples she cited are part of what is called the diffusion of technology. There is nothing sinister whatever; it is a <P>

<A NAME = "80129-30_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: We would see no need for these subsections if subsection (2) had been amended as we proposed. NESTA's remit in that case would cover everything which we believe it should do. If I am wrong about this, will the Minister give examples of the kind of changes in remit which might be required? We probably should not have a long discussion on this, because it may fall within the reconsideration of the previous amendment, but I should like to say that this was the reason behind it. If the Government accept the intention of our previous amendments, it seems to me that the Secretary of State's duties become largely redundant. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-30_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I should make it clear that we do not accept the intentions behind the previous two amendments. I was trying to be very reasonable and appreciative about the points that the noble Lord was making, but we do not accept the intention behind the previous two amendments. On this amendment--and it hangs together with the next one, Amendment No. 37D--it has been a principle from the beginning, as I tried to say when I was speaking to the first two amendments, that NESTA's policies and procedures should be at arm's length from the Government. Ministers should have no power of policy direction over NESTA; that is exactly right and as it should be. NESTA's objects are described in Clause 15(1), and there is no reason why these objects should change as time goes by.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-30_para6"></a>Clause 15(2) describes the means by which NESTA is to achieve its objects. It is conceivable that those means might need to change, or other means might need to be added, if NESTA is to be able to meet its objectives. After all, NESTA is meant as a project for the 21st century. Science, new technology and the arts are developing at a fantastic pace, and we cannot predict what the circumstances will be in 10 years' time, let alone 20 or 30 years' time. We believe that it would be unwise to tie NESTA indefinitely to the means we have identified today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-30_para7"></a>NESTA's chair and trustees will need to be in command of the latest developments in their fields. They will be chosen to be able to do that. They will be charged with keeping NESTA at the forefront of encouraging new opportunities as they arise. As the arts, sciences and new technology develop, they may find in the future that they could achieve their objects more effectively by different means. Clause 15(3) and (4) give the Secretary of State power to amend the means by which NESTA is to achieve its objects, subject to an affirmative resolution procedure in both Houses of Parliament.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-30_para8"></a>I should emphasise that this power is exercisable only at the request of the chair and trustees of NESTA itself. There is no question of the Secretary of State being able to change the nature of NESTA's activity of his own volition. I should also say that the Government have no particular circumstances in mind in including this provision. It was felt that it would be too restrictive not to give the chair and trustees of NESTA the opportunity to put the case for different or additional means. With this in mind, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, will agree that, far from allowing ministerial influence on NESTA's policy, Clause 15(3) and (4) are important provisions to ensure that NESTA remains at the cutting edge of innovation. I therefore invite him to withdraw his amendments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-30_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Skidelsky: </B>   I note that the Minister said at the beginning of her remarks that the Government are not really disposed to accept the intention behind the previous amendment on which this hangs.

Many of us believe that NESTA will be a very exciting and innovative project and we wish it the best of luck in all it does. However, one aspect about which we are concerned is that under the provisions set out at present funds for NESTA are already accumulating in the shadow funds for the new opportunities fund. With the inclusion of the amendment, we want to probe the Government's intentions over where future finance will come from. We believe that further endowments from the Secretary of State should come from the new opportunities fund rather than from the other good causes, which would give considerable alarm to them. This issue was flagged up by the noble Lord, Lord Rothschild, at Second Reading. The purpose of the amendment is to get an assurance from the Government that it is their intention <P>


<a name="column_CWH119"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>that any further endowment to NESTA should come from the new opportunities fund in the future and not from the other good causes. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-31_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   Coupled with Amendment No. 39 is Amendment No. 39A. This is a probing amendment which is intended to seek clarification about the destiny of the old good causes' share in the lottery proceeds. At Second Reading the noble Lord, Lord Rothschild, raised serious concerns about the provisions of Clause 17(2). The Minister had little reassurance for him at the time. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government have assured [the National Heritage Lottery Fund, the Arts Council, the English Sports Council or any of the other distributors] that they will receive the money that they expected, and will continue to receive that money until the end of the present licence. No further assurance has ever been possible".--[Official Report, 18/12/97; col.788.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-31_para0"></a>This provision seems to give the Secretary of State licence to raise a distribution fund at the expense of the old good causes on which so many people depend. We believe that such action is wrong in both principle and practice. In principle, it represents a further departure from the equality between the good causes enshrined in the 1993 Act; in practice, it would cause the problems of planning difficulties, over-commitment and uncertainty for recipients that the noble Lord, Lord Rothschild, highlighted. We want to protect the old good causes. We want to see only the Millennium Commission's share of funds go to NESTA when it completes its task.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-31_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   This group of amendments takes us to Section 22(3) of the 1993 Act and the distribution to the good causes. It therefore enables me to press again the point that I raised earlier, particularly to pursue the point that, having got the money from the distribution fund, in whatever proportion, into the good causes, how much discretion then exists for moving from the previous policy of confining expenditure largely to capital projects to a wider interpretation and to a greater use for revenue funding, and what are the Government's intentions in this respect. I look forward the hearing the Minister's reply.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-31_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rowallan: </B>   The initial endowment for NESTA is to come from money set aside for the new good causes. However, after one year the Bill enables one to increase the NESTA endowment directly from the National Lottery Distribution Fund. This could reduce the amount to existing good causes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-31_para1"></a>The home countries' sports councils, as noble Lords are probably aware, have a very good programme at the moment of supporting up-and-coming elite sports performers through their world-class performance programme. Nearly &#163;300 million will go towards that, which is extremely worthy. Can the noble Lord confirm that sports funding will not be reduced? If NESTA is to receive further endowments from the National Lottery Distribution Fund, can the Minister also confirm that this funding will not reduce the amount of funding for sport?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My noble friend Lady Ramsay said in response to the earlier amendment that <P>


<a name="column_CWH120"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column CWH120</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we would address these issues of funding when we came to this group of amendments, and I am happy to confirm that I plan to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-31_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, has said that the percentages are set out in Section 22(3) of the 1993 Act, and he is quite correct. If he turns to Section 28 of the 1993 Act, he will see that amendments are possible by order to those percentages, with only the condition that none of the existing good causes can come below 5 per cent. of the money available for good causes. The point I tried to make at Second Reading is still valid--it was the intention of the previous government that there should be this degree of flexibility in the funding of the existing good causes--that any of them could go down to not less than 5 per cent. at any stage by order without primary legislation. In this Bill, we are simply extending the same flexibility as was intended by the previous government to, first, our new opportunities fund, and secondly, to NESTA. I am sorry to deal with these issues before I come to the specific amendments, but this is the right way round because we are talking about the continuing financing of NESTA.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-31_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, asked me in what sense we would tackle the problem which he rightly identified of risking having lottery funding for buildings rather than for people and having a large number of very fine buildings with nothing to put into them. There are two answers to that. On the face of the Bill, from Clause 8 onwards, there is a whole series of measures to increase the flexibility available to the existing distributors in the way in which they handle funding applications. They are enabled to solicit applications if they think that is appropriate, if they think there are significant gaps in applications for funding in different places or for different purposes. They are enabled to delegate their powers of approving applications to smaller groups of people who might be officials or regional committees or whatever. They are enabled to undertake joint schemes so that good causes which fall at the boundaries between arts, sports, charities and heritage, or indeed the millennium, can be undertaken and approved in a more rational way. This comes back to the case which the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, himself raised in Cardiff, and on which I still have to write to him. They are required to produce strategic plans which will enable applicants to understand the thrust of their funding policies and make it easier for applicants to respond appropriately.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-31_para4"></a>The specific point the noble Lord makes, which is in addition to these provisions, concerns the change of emphasis from capital projects to revenue projects. That will be given effect by policy directions made under Section 26 of the 1993 Act. We do not need to have it on the face of this Bill, although the provisions to which I have referred in Clauses 8 to 10 will help in the working of distribution.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-31_para5"></a>I should repeat the warning I gave at Second Reading. You cannot simply fund a building and then indefinitely fund what goes into it. That would mean that every time you funded a building, the cost to the good cause would be cumulative. Gradually, over time, the amount of funding available for new projects will diminish as the continuing revenue funding obligations increase. So we <P>


<a name="column_CWH121"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column CWH121</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cannot go that far but we can do what we have done, which is simplify and make more flexible the funding procedures of the good causes, and we can, as we plan to do, change the policy directions to make revenue grants more appropriate. With that necessary digression, I return to the amendments in this group.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-31_para6"></a>If I may respond first of all to the noble Lord, Redesdale, I am afraid we cannot accept his amendment. The 1993 Act provided Ministers with wide order-making powers, subject to the affirmative procedure, to re-allocate lottery funding between the good causes. That is what I referred to in Clause 28. Parliament recognised that there were all sorts of circumstances, not foreseeable at the time of the legislation, which might mean that there was a strong case for increasing or decreasing particular good causes' shares without the inflexibility and delay which would be caused if primary legislation were necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-31_para7"></a>All we are seeking to do by means of Clause 17(2) is to provide an equivalent degree of flexibility for NESTA. NESTA is not, of course, a lottery distributor. It will not receive a percentage stream of lottery funds, nor should it. We see it as a body apart from the lottery, and to tie it to a stream of lottery funds, which would be the effect of the noble Lord's amendment, would undermine this. It might also make other potential contributors more reluctant to contribute. However, we need to give ourselves the opportunity in future to respond to any need to increase its funding with the widest degree of flexibility about how we do so. It might not merely work, but work wonderfully well, and need more money for very good causes indeed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-31_para8"></a>Therefore, limiting the source of funding to the new good cause share--to the new opportunities fund--as the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, suggests, would deprive us of that flexibility. We would not be able to take a view, across the good causes as a whole, of the competing demands. NESTA would only be able to receive a further endowment if the new good cause share happened to be able to fund the whole of it. That would not be right since, as I hope is clear already, NESTA will not be a new good cause initiative, nor does NESTA have any more of a relationship with the new opportunities fund than it will with any other distributor.

Is it the Government's intention to replenish on a regular basis NESTA's endowment, and to what extent, if it was a significant amount of money, would that affect the percentages of the other good causes? I realise that it is not within the stream but it would affect the money they expected to receive.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-31_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   That is quite right, of course, and I have some specific assurances that I wish to give to the Committee about that. However, let me deal with Amendments Nos. 39A and 39B, which concern the millennium, before I come to the assurances, because they apply to both.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80129-31_para9"></a>The amendment of the noble Baroness, with the accompanying consequential Amendment No. 39B of the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, would in effect rule out NESTA ever receiving a further endowment. As I explained when we were discussing Clause 5, the Millennium Commission's entire projected funding of &#163;2 billion is already committed or definitely allocated to programmes. There will be no scope for funding additional resources for NESTA from that money, and when the millennium stream has delivered the projected &#163;2 billion the millennium good cause will cease to receive funding.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-31_para10"></a>As I made clear in discussions on Clause 5, the Government do not believe, any more than the last government did, that it is sensible to limit flexibility to respond to circumstances which cannot be predicted. That is why I hope the Committee will reject these amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-31_para11"></a>However, I can give certain assurances about funding. First, the Government have no current plans to use the power. We consider that an endowment of &#163;200 million provides NESTA with a fair and affordable endowment from the lottery. Circumstances would have to change significantly before we could consider making a further endowment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-31_para12"></a>Secondly, there would certainly be no question of using the power in a way which went against the expectation of the existing good causes that they will between them receive &#163;9 billion over the lifetime of the current licence. Thirdly, if we were to use it, we would do so only after considering most carefully the outcome of the consultation which we are required to undertake by subsection (3), and in particular the impact any proposal would have on the distributors' ability to meet their commitments or to carry out their strategy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-31_para13"></a>I hope, with those assurances, noble Lords will feel that their amendments are not appropriate.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80129-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Monro of Langholm: </B>   I am grateful for the point that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, made about the capital and current expenditure by the distributors, for instance the Sports Council on capital projects and on running expenses. We have been talking about this for approximately two years, and informally one understood the Sports Council was moving towards this. When will the Government be making the policy directions so that it can get on with this, and will it be in this financial year, so that sports councils can begin to work firmly towards supporting non-capital expenditure, which we both agree is so important?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-32_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   I should like to follow up that point, because I was about to make a very similar point, but to carry it beyond the field of the sports councils. I am most grateful to the Minister for his clarification of the position, and for confirming that the constraints placed upon the distributing bodies--confining their grants largely to capital--was a matter of direction rather than legislative limitation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-32_para0"></a>Of course, I am well aware that it was originally introduced very largely at the wishes of the bodies to be funded, who feared that if money was initially available on a wide scale for revenue funding any government <P>


<a name="column_CWH123"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column CWH123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would see this as a wonderful opportunity to cut revenue funding from the Treasury. It was therefore thought to be a safeguard. I think people no longer see it in quite that light, partly because of the problem, which has manifested itself with increasing strength as the years have passed, that there are magnificent improvements to the facilities but not enough money for what goes on inside them. In any case, people have discovered that revenue funding from the Treasury can, whatever happens, be cut, and indeed funding from the lottery may be cut. It is no longer seen as an effective safeguard, and therefore people--not just the Sports Council--are anxious to have a clarification of government policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-32_para1"></a>I know that my noble friend Lord Gowrie, who is chairman of the Arts Council of England, has been discussing these issues with Ministers over a considerable period, but there has not yet been any real clarification of policy. There is considerable anxiety, not only in relation to sports but certainly the arts, that there should be greater flexibility, and that there should be an indication of the way things are going. In any case, the definition of what constitutes capital and revenue is always an interesting semantic exercise, and those of us engaged in business as well as in government affairs sometimes find the distinctions are not easy to make. Certainly in the field of theatrical, operatic or musical productions, for example, it is perfectly easy to argue that one is justified in funding an initial production, because it may last a decade or more, and continue to produce a source of revenue to the company. It is absurd to have a constraint on the ability to provide funding of that kind.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-32_para2"></a>Grateful as I am to the Minister for clarifying that there is the capacity to change the present rules, and for some indication that it is indeed the Government's intention to do so and all the rather vague words uttered by the Secretary of State on television programmes and elsewhere that we are moving in this direction--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-32_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Strabolgi): </B>  I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord, but there is a Division in the Chamber. The Committee will adjourn and resume in 10 minutes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-32_para3"></a>[The Sitting was suspended for a Division in the House from 5.10 to 5.20 p.m.]
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   I was speaking of the importance of having clarification of the Government's intentions in this regard within the discretion available to them. I am grateful to the Minister for going the limited way he has today, which is helpful. The issue is of such great importance for sports bodies, bodies funded by the Arts Council and indeed the heritage bodies that I propose tabling an amendment at a later stage so that we can have further clarification and a clear statement of the Government's intentions in another place. I intend to pursue the matter further.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-32_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rowallan: </B>   I am afraid I feel the Minister did not come back to me either, and I would be grateful if he could expand slightly on his programme. The world-class performance programme and the United Kingdom Institute of Sport which was set up precluded <P>


<a name="column_CWH124"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column CWH124</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>any sports money having anything to do with NESTA. I am extremely concerned that money could disappear from this extremely good cause if we are not very careful. Could the Minister confirm or deny the situation?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-32_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Chorley: </B>   I do not want to take up more than a moment of time. I am glad the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, mentioned the Heritage Lottery Fund because it seems to me that exactly the same points about revenue funding apply there. Perhaps also in addition--although I do not want to go into detail if there is to be some sort of clarification--there is the whole question of endowment funding, which is also wrapped up with this sort of issue.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-32_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Noble Lords opposite are entirely right that the question of capital versus revenue funding is one of very long standing, not just in relation to the lottery but in relation to public expenditure generally and indeed in all walks of life. It has been going on for a long time, it covers all of the good causes and more, and it will not go away. I rather thought that if I left noble Lords opposite to it, they would continue to debate the issue among themselves and I would not need to intervene at all, because they have put both sides of the argument among themselves perfectly satisfactorily. I recognise the validity of the different points which they all make.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-32_para4"></a>All that remains is for me to make clear again that the Government recognise that it is not possible to go over to complete revenue funding, because of the wishes of the distributors and the good causes to preserve additionality and because of the fact that it would gradually clog up the flow of funds for new projects; nor is it possible to stick to the original position of funding buildings and not people. I have already given an undertaking that policy directives are in preparation. I can confirm that we are already in discussion with the distributors about those policy directives. We hope soon to be able to enter formal consultation with the distributors, and we hope to issue the new directions in March or April this year.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-32_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Chorley: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, can he say whether these policy directives will also cover the question of endowment funding?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-32_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Yes, I think they should do, because endowment funding is in competition. Although NESTA is not part of lottery funding as such, it is clearly in a sense in competition with streams of funding for new money coming in from the lottery.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-32_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Skidelsky: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, has the last word on this group of amendments, may I make one interjection? The Minister was quite right to remind us that Section 28 of the 1993 Act allowed the percentage for each good cause to sink to 5 per cent. If I may repeat the point I made before, in the situation facing us today there is an urgent need to protect the old good causes against the politically insatiable demands of the new good causes. That is quite <P>


<a name="column_CWH125"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column CWH125</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a new situation because this new good causes did not exist in 1993. That is just an observation which does not call for a reply.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-32_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I need to reply because, first, I have given firm and literal assurances about our intentions, and, secondly, the Bill itself contains percentages which reflect our intentions which do not include going down to 5 per cent.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-32_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   The purpose of the amendment was to achieve assurances, which the Minister has given to an extent, although it has been the basis of an extremely wide-ranging debate. I hope the Minister will accept my scepticism, not because I do not believe he has every intention of honouring the commitments he has made but because I do not believe that many governments will pass up the opportunity in the future of making additional alterations to the National Lottery Bill. I believe that is an argument we will have in further legislation, if that ever happens. I take the Minister's assurance that he does not see it happening at the moment, but I look forward to having those arguments during debates on that legislation. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="80129-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   I would also like an assurance from the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, because I believe that the case is that the chairman and trustees are to be <P>


<a name="column_CWH126"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column CWH126</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appointed by the Secretary of State. Can she give some indication of how the independence of that body should be guaranteed or promoted in its inception?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-33_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I hope I can reassure both the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, and the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, on the points they have raised. As the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, indicated, the amendment would prevent NESTA under any circumstances from spending any part of the capital of its endowment from the National Lottery. Currently, the Bill provides that NESTA may do so with the Secretary of State's approval.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-33_para0"></a>The principle on which NESTA is established with an endowment from the National Lottery is that it should safeguard the endowment itself and fund its programmes and running costs from the investment income it receives from the endowment as well as from revenues it attracts from other sources. The endowment is an investment for the next century and it needs to be secured. That is the principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-33_para1"></a>But the Government recognise that some flexibility is necessary at the edges. When NESTA is first established with the staff and accommodation it needs to start its work and with all the attention it will have upon it, it will need--if I may speak bluntly--ready cash. It will not have started attracting a flow of investment income. Nor can it be guaranteed that donations from third parties will have started flowing in at the beginning when it needs to start its activities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-33_para2"></a>In those early days, NESTA will need to be able to spend a small portion of the capital sum of the endowment. That is the key reason we have provided a power in Clause 17(5) for the Secretary of State to approve such spending. It is a purely practical response to an inevitable practical issue. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, would remove that power.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-33_para3"></a>There may be other circumstances in which NESTA may wish to spend part of its capital. It may have the opportunity to support a one-off programme which it cannot afford alongside other priorities in a single year. It may therefore wish to adjust its spending profile to spread the investment over more than one year. To do so, it may need to spend a little capital, to be paid back into the endowment in the following year. In those circumstances it would appear to us to be reasonable for NESTA to come to the Secretary of State to seek approval for what might be a perfectly sensible course of action.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-33_para4"></a>Whatever the circumstances, any approval that the Secretary of State were to give under this clause could be subject to financial directions which he issues under Clause 19. The Secretary of State could, for example, specify over what period NESTA should budget to pay back into the endowment any part it has spent with permission.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-33_para5"></a>The Government fully intend to do all they can to preserve NESTA's endowment for future generations. This power and the counterbalance provided by the financial direction powers provide necessary flexibility at the margin.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-33_para6"></a>In answer to a direct point from the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, the Secretary of State appoints the trustees but he has no power to direct them on their policies or programmes. It is the trustees themselves alone who will have the responsibility for deciding what NESTA should do in seeking to meet the objects that Parliament sets for it. I hope that that answers that specific point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-33_para7"></a>We feel that the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, would prevent the Secretary of State from responding flexibly and practically to the issues that NESTA will face in aiming to meet its objectives. I hope that, on reflection, he will agree that the power we propose is necessary and sensible. I assure the noble Lord that our main aim is to ensure probity and accountability. This is a practical proposal for what we see as very occasional practical problems that might arise.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Skidelsky: </B>   What the noble Baroness has said is very clear. Flexibility is written all over the place; it is a departmental obsession, not just in the noble Baroness's department but in every department. The Secretary of State has to have flexibility. The intentions of the present Secretary of State are incredibly honourable, and this provision will be used only very sparingly in the occasional practical difficulty that arises in starting something up. Indeed. Then we come to a new Secretary of State and there are all these powers. We remind the new Secretary of State of what the noble Baroness has just said and he says, "New Government, new circumstances".
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-33_para8"></a>Discretionary powers of this kind are always rather worrying because, whatever the intentions of the present incumbent, they offer no indication of what a future Secretary of State will do. That is why we are worried about them. Of course, we cannot do anything about it at this stage, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>

<A NAME = "80129-33_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: With the leave of the Committee, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 42 and 43. Before I do so, may I comment on the last words of the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky. He may come back as often as he likes!
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-33_para11"></a>May I remind him that we have just had a change of government, and what the present Government are doing is retaining the flexibility that was provided for by the previous government. And it is now being attacked by the supporters of the previous government, who put in the flexibility in the first place. I wonder whether flexibility is more in Opposition than in Government.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-33_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Skidelsky: </B>   The noble Lord will have noticed that I was not a member of the previous government and therefore do not feel bound by everything they did.

<P>
<A NAME="80129-33_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   At the Dispatch Box there is collective responsibility and that applies to the <P>


<a name="column_CWH128"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column CWH128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Opposition Dispatch Box as well. Amendments Nos. 41, 42 and 43 are, I hope, welcome in the sense that they simplify the language of the Bill. Clause 17(6) currently defines what is meant by NESTA's endowment as the total of any contribution to NESTA from the lottery. The wording used is less than elegant and the amendments put it more succinctly in the same words. Amendment No. 41 saves seven words, Amendment No. 42 saves 14 words and Amendment No. 43 also saves 14 words. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-33_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   I would also entirely agree that the wording is an improvement. I just seek clarification or confirmation on one point. When we talk about the aggregate of the amounts paid, can the noble Lord tell me exactly what that means when we come to the growth of the fund and the investment record of the fund? Is it a fixed amount, or is it an amount that the aggregate then becomes when perhaps the capital has grown? May I just have clarification of what the aggregate means in this sense as the years pass? The fund may grow or it may reduce according to the investment result. We want to know what the answer to that question is.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-33_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   It is the aggregate of any amounts available from the lottery. So of course as lottery funds grow, the amounts will grow.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-33_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   I am not sure that the noble Lord entirely understood my question. I take the point that, as each grant is made, they are taken together and you will have a total. However, I am simply seeking confirmation that that aggregate total, which may rise and fall according to the way the investments perform, the whole amount of it--whatever the sum is--remains the aggregate and it takes account of the future changes in value. That is all I am seeking by way of confirmation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-33_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   If the noble Lord is asking me whether it includes the interest, no, it does not include the interest; it includes the original sums. However, the original sums are the endowment provided in Clause 17(1) and additional payments made under order by the Secretary of State under Clause 17(4). It is therefore the original sums and not the interest payable on them.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-33_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Chorley: </B>   It seems to me that what is being proposed in the new amendment is what is known as historic cost accounting: that is to say it takes no cognisance of the effect of inflation. Perhaps that is the rule that might be looked at--it should be a more current cost accounting. It is the historic amounts which went into the fund at the particular dates that the noble Lord mentioned and, if 15 years down the line there has been a lot of inflation, you could pay out the difference between the historic cost and the new value if it has been invested sensibly in equities or other things.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-33_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I do not have the noble Lord's accountancy qualifications to which he referred in an earlier session. This is an endowment and the income from the endowment is being spent to meet the objectives set out in Clause 15 of the <P>


<a name="column_CWH129"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column CWH129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Bill. Therefore, there is no addition to the endowment from the accrual of interest, because all of that is going to expenditure from the endowment. It is in cash and it is invested by the Treasury under normal arrangements.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 19, line 32, leave out ("shall be under a duty to") and insert ("may").<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: I beg to move Amendment No. 41A. As my noble friend Lord Skidelsky has argued, we are concerned about the nature of NESTA. We accept that it cannot be a charity because it would be unable, for instance, to grant loans or enter into joint ventures, as proposed by Clause 16(2). As set up, it is more akin to a non-departmental public body on a long lease from the Treasury, as the endowment sets it free from the PESC treadmill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para4"></a>If it is not to be a charity, it appears inconsistent to make NESTA similar to one by placing it under the obligation to fund-raise. It is extraordinary for a government to set up a body to raise public donations to deliver government policy. We feel strongly that a body with clear government backing, which will fund-raise in direct competition with other charities, is bound to affect the flows of charitable giving.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para5"></a>I accept it is a point of debate whether the lottery is the sole cause--or indeed a cause--of the decline of charitable giving in recent years, but it seems rash, however, to rule out that the lottery has damaged charities, and the impact of NESTA on the charitable sector should be carefully assessed. I would therefore argue that it would be prudent to limit the fund-raising powers of NESTA.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-34_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   As the noble Baroness has made clear, this amendment would remove the duty on NESTA to seek sources of income other than the lottery endowment. It would, however, give NESTA a permissive power to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para6"></a>Clause 18 places a specific duty on the trustees of NESTA to raise money, as well as other forms of assistance, from a variety of sources, to supplement its endowment from the lottery. We do not agree with the noble Baroness's amendment to make such fund-raising optional.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para7"></a>I hope the Government have demonstrated their determination to establish a body with considerable freedom of action, clearly at arm's length from the Government. Our consultation process told us that people wanted NESTA to be set up, and set on its way, without any ongoing involvement from government in its policies and priorities. We share that vision of NESTA.

<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para8"></a>Clearly, in establishing such an independent public body, and in granting it a large endowment from the National Lottery--&#163;200 million--Parliament and the Government need to be clear what they expect from NESTA. That is why in Clause 15 we have set out NESTA's objects and the means by which it should seek to achieve those objects.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para9"></a>If NESTA is to succeed in its mission, it must secure the support of the general public, of talented individuals, and of the creative and business communities. In many ways, NESTA is akin to a charity. Its aims are intended to benefit the nation as a whole as well as the individuals it supports. Like a charity, one of its primary activities must be to seek support from wherever it can.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para10"></a>Whether NESTA is or is not a charity is, of course, a matter for the Charity Commission. The Charity Commission has indicated informally that it is unlikely that NESTA's objects are exclusively charitable, and I think even to a non-expert eye that would seem to be rather a reasonable conclusion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para11"></a>To the question of whether NESTA is fund-raising for government policy--which I think the noble Baroness indicated in her introduction of the amendment--the answer is certainly not. NESTA will raise funds for NESTA's policies. The Government will have no influence once Parliament has passed and set up the objectives for NESTA. It will be NESTA which pursues whatever policies it thinks fit for achieving its objectives.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para12"></a>The endowment from the lottery will allow NESTA to make a significant contribution from the very outset. It will place NESTA in the list of the top 10 grant-making trusts in the UK. But, if its mission is to continue, to develop and to expand, it must widen its resource base and use its income to invest in what--as we have said so often before--we intend it to invest in; British creativity, talent and ideas. I do not believe that this activity can be an optional extra. The Government and Parliament will commit themselves to NESTA through the endowment from the lottery. It is only right in return to expect NESTA to do all it can to build on that public investment by seeking further contributions to its resources.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para13"></a>I hope that that has helped to convince the noble Baroness and to understand why the Government see this duty as wholly appropriate as a duty and not a permissive possibility. I hope she will consider withdrawing her amendment.

<A NAME="80129-34_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   I thank the noble Baroness for that explanation. I still find phrases like "akin to a charity" rather enigmatic. This duplicates the roles of many charities, which is a great shame. When the noble Baroness also mentions that NESTA will be totally independent, we must not forget that its chairman and the board will be appointed by the Secretary of State, so it is not an elected body like the National Trust. The National Trust chairman is elected from within the body.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para20"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of this amendment is to white out one of the Secretary of State's fingerprints. Schedule 4 gives the Secretary of State power to appoint all NESTA's trustees and remove any or all of them if they are unable or unfit to discharge their duties. These are very ample powers, as my noble friend has just pointed out. We feel that they should not be supplemented by the further power to fine NESTA for not carrying out the Secretary of State's directions. The principle we propose is very simple--appoint people to do a job and sack them if they do not do it, but do not whittle down their financial resources while they are trying to do it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para21"></a>We also see practical difficulties about fining. Suppose the Secretary of State were to remove the whole or part of NESTA's endowment, as he is entitled to do.

Both on grounds of principle and on practical grounds, there is a good case for our amendment. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-34_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I hope that in a reasonably simple and straightforward way I can clear up what is perhaps a misunderstanding about the situation. The powers which the Bill would enable the Secretary of State to exercise over NESTA are actually very limited. They are chiefly concerned with safeguarding the public investment in NESTA through the endowment from the National Lottery. Clause 19(1) allows the Secretary of State to issue NESTA with directions concerning its financial arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para22"></a>It is clearly important that the public's investment in NESTA is secure at all times. The financial directions will provide the proper level of accountability and control to allow the Secretary of State to ensure that this achieved. There clearly also needs to be some backstop provision to allow for the unlikely event of NESTA failing to comply with any such direction. The Bill as drafted provides the sensible and responsible solution that in those very unlikely circumstances the Secretary <P>


<a name="column_CWH132"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column CWH132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of State will be able to require NESTA to pay back to him all or any part of the endowment. This will enable him to continue to safeguard the lottery endowment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para23"></a>The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, as I understand it, suggests an alternative approach. He suggests that the Secretary of State should be given the power in these circumstances to remove the chairman or trustees of NESTA. We can certainly see the point of the amendment. It is both to act as a deterrent to activity outside the terms of the financial directions, and to enable the Secretary of State to change the board so as to address the perceived shortcoming.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para24"></a>However, this amendment does not provide a quick and direct means by which the Secretary of State can assure himself that the lottery endowment is safeguarded. That, I believe, is the main drawback of the amendment. It is high on deterrent value, but low on practical financial protection.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para25"></a>In practice, none of us expects either of these provisions ever to come into play. We do not need a deterrent to reckless behaviour by the trustees. After all, we are placing them in a position of trust, which is why we are calling them "trustees" in the first place, and we are sure they will do their utmost to live up to that trust. All we need is a longstop provision to safeguard the public's money. That is provided by the Bill as drafted, and I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, will accept the point. The point is to secure the endowment, not to sack the trustees.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-34_para26"></a>We are very serious about trusting the trustees, but we are equally serious about securing the endowment, and that is why we have drafted this provision as we have. I hope that puts the noble Lord's mind at rest as to the motivation behind it, and that he will withdraw his amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-35_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Skidelsky: </B>   I am full of anxiety. I would just ask the noble Baroness whether she could answer my second point concerning the practical problem of projects in the pipeline, which would presumably have to be cancelled if the Secretary of State withdrew parts of the endowment and, therefore, the income stream which went with that endowment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-35_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   It seems to me that in the extreme, almost unimaginable, circumstances of something so untoward happening that the Secretary of State had to ask the trustees to reimburse part of the endowment which had been grossly misspent, there would still be money in place for the projects which were considered perfectly legitimate. It would only be in order to retrieve what had been misspent that the money would be demanded back. We are dealing in very hypothetical situations here of course, but we are, after all, legislating for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-35_para0"></a>If a "melt-down" situation applied--which is why we have included the provision--then the trustees would be changed and Clause 17(2) would be used to re-endow whatever new trustees would be in place. The whole point is to try to get back the money that was misspent. Presumably the trustees would also be replaced by new trustees. We are dealing with a situation in which there would be a considerable crisis. I do not believe that a <P>


<a name="column_CWH133"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column CWH133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>project which was up and running would present a big problem. Indeed, the whole point of trying to get the money back is so that there would be money for legitimate projects to go forward.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-35_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Skidelsky: </B>   I am impressed by the ability of the noble Baroness to think out these matters on the hoof. Unimaginable though any of this may seem, the Bill is always ensuring against unimaginable contingencies and this is one against which it has not insured because it is not convenient for the Government to do so. I was raising the case, which does not seem to me at all unimaginable, that a percentage of the endowment is cancelled, and therefore the projects that depend on that stream of money cannot go ahead. The noble Baroness says, "Ah!", but in that case we can re-endow NESTA and Clause 17(2) gives us the machinery to do it. However, it does not mandate that at all, it does not say that it has to be done. It may possibly be done not at that moment, at some other point, and therefore there is still the practical problem I raise. I wish that the noble Baroness would give it some consideration because it is there--unless she can allay my deep anxieties even further.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-35_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I shall write to the noble Lord at greater length, but the basic point is this. What must be done in a situation of crisis where money has been clearly misspent is to get the money back and to secure the endowment. I accept there might be a hiatus in which legitimate projects would have a cash-flow problem from NESTA, and that would be put right by restoring the endowment, both by getting the money back and by making good the shortfall. It might make the matter clearer if I write to the noble Lord at greater length.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-35_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Chorley: </B>   I do not quite see how one can get the money back if it is gone, but perhaps that can be covered in the letter that the noble Baroness is to write to the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-35_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: I am rather nervous in moving this amendment because it is clear that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, would have been much better at it. No doubt he is a corporation tax expert, and I do not claim that talent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-35_para11"></a>However, what the amendment seeks to explore is Clause 22. As currently drafted, it exempts NESTA from corporation tax. The Arts Council of England and the Heritage Lottery Fund are both exempt from paying corporation tax on the interest accrued and they draw down funds from the National Lottery Distribution Fund, as they both have charitable status. The English Sports Council has, however, to pay corporation tax on the interest it receives on lottery funds it holds between the period of drawing down from the National Lottery Distribution Fund and passing to lottery recipients.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-35_para12"></a>The amendment has three objectives: to seek an exemption from corporation tax, perhaps to right an anomaly and also to encourage flexibility. The amendment would give the English Sports Council and those for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland exemption for distribution purposes. The English Sports Council and the others are not seeking charitable status, merely a relief from the corporation tax on moneys transferred to award recipients. Their view is that this is an anomaly in the operation of the distribution fund.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-35_para13"></a>I wonder whether it could have been Parliament's intention in the 1993 Act in effect to subject parts of money going to good causes to a form of double taxation. The amendment seeks to address what was an unintended anomaly. It has always been my understanding of corporation tax and other taxation that there should not be a situation where double taxation comes into play.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-35_para14"></a>The other point of the amendment is this. It seeks to encourage flexibility in the drawing-down arrangements, and there are many who would argue that encouraging flexibility will make more effective and efficient use of the funds so distributed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-35_para15"></a>There are six or seven points to be considered here. In distributing the proceeds from the National Lottery to good causes, the money is not really a form of income. <P>


<a name="column_CWH135"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column CWH135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Therefore I would argue, and others might argue, that perhaps it should not be taxed as such. Corporation tax is charged in addition to the 12p paid to the Treasury on the National Lottery ticket sales, so that is a double taxation on the moneys raised by Camelot.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-35_para16"></a>The third point is a matter of illustration. Between March 1995 and March 1997 the English Sports Council advises me that it paid out approximately &#163;80 million, and paid on that &#163;122,240 in corporation tax on the interest accrued. On current estimates, it calculates that over the life of the current lottery franchise it will pay &#163;1.5 million corporation tax up to September 2001. That seems to me not to be a very efficient way to work with money which is primarily intended at this stage to go to beneficiary bodies.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-35_para17"></a>The National Lottery Charities Board has confirmed that in the financial year 1996-97 it paid &#163;42,000 in corporation tax on &#163;130 million drawn down. That is, after all, a board which operates with much more draw-down flexibility. This compares with the &#163;122,000-plus paid out by the English Sports Council. I remind noble Lords again that this is with the National Lottery Charities Board drawing down weekly rather than on a monthly basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-35_para18"></a>I have no doubt that the Minister will argue that alternative draw-down arrangements should ameliorate the situation, but they will not resolve it. That is what the amendment seeks to encourage. Corporation tax paid by the English Sports Council, the National Lottery Charities Board and the Millennium Commission reduces the overall funding available to all of the good causes by increasing the amount that these organisations have to draw down from the National Lottery Distribution Fund. I do not believe that that acts within the spirit of the National Lottery, nor could it have been the original intention of those who legislated.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-35_para19"></a>Perhaps the Minister will consider those points and give us some assurance that they will be taken into consideration. We could then make progress on what is clearly a rather thorny issue. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="80129-35_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   The amendment draws attention to the fact that the Treasury is having a second bite at the cherry. It already receives money when people buy their lottery tickets, and the funds being accrued are supposed to go towards good causes. The amendment just says that those sporting bodies should get the same treatment as other bodies. That is all.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-35_para20"></a>The sums may be comparatively small in relation to the total figure that has been distributed--it may be &#163;1.5 million--but if it is going to small causes like coaching courses or new kit for clubs and so on, that is a lot of courses; it is a lot of kit. I suggest that this amendment, or something similar to it, should be addressed because it is merely stopping the Treasury taking a second bite.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<FONT SIZE=3>money going in and out, and for it to be lost at all through taxation is ridiculous when taxation has already been paid on it.

<P>
<A NAME="80129-36_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monro of Langholm: </B>   I strongly support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Bassam. As an old sparring partner of the noble Lord, Lord Howell, I know he would not have introduced this amendment without most careful thought and consultation with the Sports Council and the CCPR. I am quite sure at heart he is right that this was an anomaly which probably crept in with much enthusiasm from the Treasury in the 1993 Act. But now is the moment to redress that and give the sports enthusiasts throughout this country all the money they are entitled to.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-36_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I have one last addition to that. I declare an interest: I am a Millennium Commissioner. It would be wrong to say that this would be irresponsible, but it would perhaps not be the ideal way of using funds. People will wish to expend the funds rather sooner than they might, whereas if they were left earning and accruing interest until a more appropriate time, when certain situations in a grant were more appropriate to fund, it would be better.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-36_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   As my noble friend Lord Bassam said, this is a complex issue. I hope your Lordships will forgive me if I try to explain the financial arrangements for the sports councils' share of the good causes money. The share of the National Lottery proceeds allocated to each of the four national sports councils is paid into the National Lottery Distribution Fund, along with the shares of the other distributors. The money earns interest, and each of the sports councils receives a share of that interest in proportion to their balance in the fund. This interest is not subject to tax.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-36_para0"></a>The sports councils then request money to be paid from the National Lottery Distribution Fund into their bank accounts as they need it to meet grant commitments. They normally make a request once a month to meet grants that will be paid in the coming month. During the time between the money being paid from the National Lottery Distribution Fund to the sports councils and its being paid to the grant recipients, it earns interest in the sports councils' own bank accounts. This interest is subject to tax because the sports councils do not enjoy tax exemption as charities do, for example. I note from what my noble friend Lord Bassam says, that it is not the intention of the sports councils to seek charitable status. It is pretty clear that they would not be able to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-36_para1"></a>I should stress that it is only the interest that is subject to tax and not the principle. Indeed, it is my understanding that the tax liability on the interest amounted to only &#163;30,000 in 1995-96 and only &#163;74,000 in 1996-97. My noble friend said he would no doubt be told that there are ways of minimising the tax without obtaining tax exemptions, and of course we do want the sports councils to maximise the amount of lottery money they are able to distribute to sports projects. However, I have to say to him, even though he anticipated it, that the best way of achieving this is not to exempt them from taxation but to ensure that the money is not paid <P>


<a name="column_CWH137"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column CWH137</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to them before it is needed. This means that it is exempt from tax and indeed earns interest for them. This could be achieved through improved cash-flow management by the sports councils and by more frequent payments from the National Lottery Distribution Fund. My department is examining both of those options.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-36_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I want to make only two more points. The first concerns why NESTA has tax exemption when the Sports Council does not. Secondly, I want to refer to the claim which noble Lords made of double taxation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-36_para3"></a>All public bodies, no matter how worthy, are subject to tax unless, like charities, they have been exempted, and sport is not a charitable purpose. The tax concessions for NESTA in Clause 22 do not set a new precedent for lottery-funded bodies. NESTA is unique for a number of reasons. First, it is a public body with activities similar to those of a charity. Secondly, unlike all other lottery-funded bodies, it will rely for its income on interest earned on an endowment, which would normally be taxable. Thirdly, again like other lottery-funded bodies, it will be under a duty to seek contributions to its own funds from other sources. Taken together, these three characteristics make a unique case for exempting NESTA from tax on its investment income and bequests and for allowing NESTA to qualify for Gift Aid and covenanted giving. The sports councils are not in a similar position.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-36_para4"></a>A number of noble Lords have said that this is double taxation and it is an anomaly. Lottery duty on ticket sales is designed to be revenue neutral and compensate the Exchequer for taxes lost elsewhere (for example VAT, from substitution of expenditure by the lottery). Lottery money held in the National Lottery Distribution Fund is not taxable, as I have explained. Lottery funds drawn down by the sports councils and held in interest-bearing accounts are not taxable, only the interest that they earn. This is consistent with the principles of taxation for bodies that are not exempt from tax.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-36_para5"></a>In summary, the amounts of money are very small, taxation is only on the interest, and only on the interest on that part of the money which is between drawing-down from the National Lottery Distribution Fund and being paid out to the organisations who are receiving the grants. It is better to improve cash management rather than to create what would be an additional anomaly, which would be to exempt a non-charitable body from tax. I am therefore bound to resist the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129-36_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, responds to the Minister, I do not remember hearing the argument when the 1993 legislation went through that the tax on the ticket was to compensate for tax not taken elsewhere. Was that put forward in 1993?

<P>
<A NAME="80129-36_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   In the face of such powerful arguments, it becomes me to withdraw the amendment. While I am encouraged by the Minister's comments that the recipient body should be encouraged to better cashflow management, it would be nice to think that further discussions could be held on these points. I feel they should be. Perhaps some assistance to better cash-flow management could be engendered by having more flexibility about the way in which the draw-down operates. There is merit in having some further discussions around that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129-36_para6"></a>On the NESTA issue and the question of the lack of similarity between the sports councils and NESTA, I can accept two, but not all three, of the arguments that the Minister makes. Perhaps this requires some further consideration as there are points of similarity. On the double tax question, I am obviously a great fan of the Treasury and good taxation, and I can see the benefits of having a robust taxation system. Perhaps double taxation is robust taxation; I do not know. I would not wish to comment much further on that point. It is something which merits some consideration in the future. Perhaps it is an anomaly which also requires to be interrogated further. With those comments, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

I advised them that the review of benefits for sick and disabled people would thoroughly examine the current system and consider the full range of options for future change. They sought an assurance that there would be formal consultation once the Government announced their proposals. We have subsequently made it clear that we will consult on any proposals for change flowing from the review. Taxation will be a matter for my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his annual Budget.

<P>
<A NAME="80129w01_spmin3"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  Over &#163;123 million was allocated between 1993 and 1997 to successful bids under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for projects in South Yorkshire. These were made under a variety of different programmes, and include a number of sub-regional projects covering more than one local authority area within South Yorkshire.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129w01_para9"></a>The South Yorkshire areas have also benefited from a share of over &#163;42 million made available over the same period for projects which operated across all parts of Yorkshire and the Humber which were eligible for ERDF support.

The Commissioner also reported in depth his recent exchanges with the United States Agriculture Secretary about issues in discussion between the EU and the US concerning the adoption of a veterinary equivalence agreement. Commissioner Fischler emphasised the constructive and positive nature of recent exchanges, and expressed the hope that an agreement could be concluded in the near future. My right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food emphasised my wish to see this achieved as soon as possible during the UK Presidency.

Under such circumstances, forces may perform a PNC check and mark the subject record accordingly.

<P>
<A NAME="80129w03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The latter. Before setting the tariff of a mandatory life sentenced prisoner, the Secretary of State will have taken careful account of the views of the judiciary (including any minimum recommendation made in court by the trial judge under the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965) on the minimum period which must be served to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. Thereafter, the tariff is used to set the date of the first review of the case by the Parole Board, which is generally two years before the tariff expires.

<P>
<A NAME="80129w04_wqn3"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What are the latest reports and recommendations of the pay review bodies.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80129w04_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Richard): </B>  The 1998 reports of the five pay review bodies have been published today. Copies are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. I am grateful to the chairmen and members of the pay review bodies for the work they have put into them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129w04_para1"></a>The Government have twin objectives: to run a stable economy in which inflation is low and there is a long-term prosperity; and to reward the effort and dedication of those working in many of our most important public services, including schools, hospitals and the Armed Forces, while leaving as much money as possible for front line services.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129w04_para2"></a>In the evidence the Government submitted to the pay review bodies, we stressed the need for their recommendations to be affordable to ensure that departments can maintain the delivery of services within their agreed spending plans. We also made it clear that pay increases throughout the economy should be compatible with the Government's overriding economic objective of stable growth and long-term prosperity. Responsible decisions now on pay, in both the private and the public sectors, will help to secure jobs and prosperity in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129w04_para3"></a>Against this background, in considering the recommendations of the independent pay review bodies, the Government have sought to strike a balance between ensuring that the pay settlements for these important public sector groups are fair; that they are affordable <P>


<a name="column_WA74"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column WA74</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>within departments' existing spending plans; that they are consistent with the Government's inflation target of 2.5 per cent.; and that they are responsible in terms of the long-term stability of our economy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129w04_para4"></a>The main pay recommendations average some 3.9 per cent. The Government believe that this is high in relation to inflation, both the headline rate (3.6 per cent.) and the underlying rate (2.7 per cent.). It is also significantly higher than the average of 3.3 per cent. for last year's recommendations, which were introduced in stages by the previous administration to accommodate the public expenditure costs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129w04_para5"></a>After careful consideration the Government have decided to accept this year's main pay recommendations in full. However, to ensure that departments can accommodate the costs without damaging front line services and to ensure that these awards do not lead to unwelcome increases in pay pressures throughout the economy more generally, we have decided that it is essential to stage their introduction. Full implementation will therefore be achieved by December this year following a first-stage increase of 2 per cent. for each group from April.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129w04_para6"></a>The main pay recommendations are as follows:
<P>

<A NAME = "80129w04_para7"></a><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) has recommended increases of 3.75 per cent. in the basic military salary for all ranks and classes except Privates Classes I, II and III and Lance Corporals Class III, for whom they recommend increases of 4.2 per cent.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "80129w04_para8"></a><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The Review Body on Doctors and Dentists Remuneration (DDRB) has recommended general increases of 4.2 per cent. except for General Medical Practitioners, for whom they recommend increases of 5.2 per cent.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "80129w04_para9"></a><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The Review Body for Nursing Staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine (NPRB) has recommended increases of 3.8 per cent. in national pay scales.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "80129w04_para10"></a><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The School Teachers Review Body (STRB) has recommended increases of 3.8 per cent. in teachers' pay.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "80129w04_para11"></a><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The Review Body on Senior Salaries (SSRB) has recommended:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "80129w04_para12"></a><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) increases of 3.5 per cent. in the minimum and maximum values of each of the pay ranges for the senior civil service. Within the ranges, departments will determine individual salaries on the basis of performance.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(c) increases of 3.5 per cent. in judicial salaries.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "80129w04_para15"></a>The effect of staging is that, on average, the rates to be paid from April 1998 are 3.3 per cent. higher than those paid from April last year, and the rates to be paid from December 1998 will be 3.9 per cent. higher than those paid from last December. The average first-year increase will be 2.7 per cent. in 1998-99, compared with the rates of pay in force at the end of 1997-98. But since those rates did not apply throughout the year, the more appropriate comparison is between the pay received in the corresponding months of each year. The Government believe this represents a fair deal for these hard working and dedicated public sector staff on whom the whole country depends.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129w04_para16"></a>In addition, the Government are separately taking action to improve training and development, and address concerns about recruitment and retention, in nursing and other professions allied to medicine. We are providing for an extra 1,300 training places for nurses this year, launching a national recruitment campaign and implementing more family-friendly employment policies.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129w04_para17"></a>The staging arrangements will apply to all groups. They will extend to the recommended increases in the minima and maxima of the senior civil service pay ranges and the awards departments will determine for the senior civil service and senior military officers <P>


<a name="column_WA76"></a>

<B>29 Jan 1998 : Column WA76</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>within the framework set by the SSRB recommendations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129w04_para18"></a>Pay increases for MPs and Ministers are linked to the pay ranges for the senior civil service, which means their awards will be treated in the same way as other groups. They will, therefore, receive an increase of 2 per cent. on 1 April. The balance of the 1998 recommendation will be paid on 1 April 1999; in the same way, 0.75 per cent. is due on 1 April 1998, resulting from the staging of last year's awards, which other groups received in December 1997.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129w04_para19"></a>As agreed last year, Cabinet Ministers will in 1998-99 forgo, for a second year, the substantial increases recommended by the SSRB in 1996 to which they would be entitled.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129w04_para20"></a>The reports are substantial wide-ranging documents. This response addresses the main pay recommendations. Many other detailed recommendations will also be accepted, although some will require further consideration and discussion as necessary. In particular the NPRB recommendation for additional discretionary increments will need to be addressed as part of wider NHS pay discussions; and the DDRB recommendation for the enhancement of GMPs' net remuneration will need to be considered and discussed as proposed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129w04_para21"></a>The Government have asked the SSRB to resume work, which had been temporarily deferred, on the pay of Lords Ministers outside the Cabinet.
<P>

<A NAME = "80129w04_para22"></a>The following table summarises the main pay recommendations of the Review Bodies.
