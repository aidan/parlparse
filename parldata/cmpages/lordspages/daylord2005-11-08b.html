<a name="51108-01_star0"></a><h3 align=center>Monetary Policy Committee</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Barnett </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What criteria are used for the appointment of external members of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, Section 13(4) of the Bank of England Act 1998 states that the four external members of the Monetary Policy Committee shall be appointed by the Chancellor only if he is satisfied that the person has knowledge or experience which is likely to be relevant to the committee&#039;s functions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, I assume that that means that the Chancellor must like him or her. In making the decision, does the Chancellor have discussions with the Governor of the Bank of England? If so, what do they talk about? Does he try to influence whether the person is one who might increase or decrease interest rates? If he does not discuss that, can we take it that they discuss something at their regular monthly meetings? If they do not discuss that, is it because the Chancellor never seeks in any way to influence the changes in interest rates decided by the Monetary Policy Committee?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I am not privy to what happens at monthly meetings between the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor. I am a little surprised that my noble friend should be perhaps a little disgruntled at the arrangements surrounding the Monetary Policy Committee, because independence of the Bank of England and the institutional arrangements have been spectacularly successful in helping to guide the UK economy. As for the Chancellor influencing the committee&#039;s composition and the outcome of its decisions, I firmly reject that. It is hugely important to the process that the credibility and integrity of the MPC is maintained. That has been recognised internationally by the OECD and others.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Newby: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the openness of the system would be improved if the Chancellor fulfilled the Nolan principles when making appointments to the MPC&#151;in particular, if the appointments were advertised? The problem at the moment is that the Chancellor often gives the impression, even if it is not the reality, that he just rings up a chum.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_500"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 500</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, if that impression is given, it does not accord with reality. The difficulty in making these appointments is that they are highly market-sensitive and the procedures adopted for other public appointments are therefore not appropriate in this case. Imagine what might happen if a timetable were issued with a process of advertisement. There would be endless speculation about who is in, who is out; who has applied and who has not; is it the doves or the hawks? There is no doubt that that would feed into the market. It is vital that market interest rates should reflect economic fundamentals, not rumour, speculation and perception.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, we on these Benches understand why the appointment of the Governor of the Bank of England might be market sensitive, but we do not understand why the appointment of any of the other eight members of the MPC might be market sensitive. What evidence does the Treasury have to suggest that these appointments have the power to move markets?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I do not have the cuttings with me, but recent press reports relating only to a change itself gave rise to speculation about what had been happening between the so-called doves and hawks on the Monetary Policy Committee. These things do influence markets. It may be inevitable that one can never extinguish that entirely, but taking steps to ensure that it is not exacerbated by the appointments process is absolutely vital.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Peston: </b>   My Lords, I chaired the Economic Affairs Committee, which vigorously opposed the Treasury&#039;s approach to this matter and argued forcefully that we ought to follow the Nolan rules. Indeed, we believed that the Treasury, as the most important department of state, ought to have given a lead on this. What is it about the availability of economists in this country that the Treasury is under the impression that only those from the Oxford, Cambridge and London nexus are worthy to be members of the Monetary Policy Committee? Does my noble friend not know that there are vast numbers of first-class universities in this country containing outstandingly good economists? I live for the day when someone from north of the south-east triangle might be appointed to that committee.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that the Government recognise, as do I, that there are many distinguished economists in the UK, including my noble friend. What is important is that those who are appointed have the relevant expertise. This matter is tested because the Treasury Select Committee in another place has held some 22 appointment hearings since 1998. On each occasion it has endorsed the appointments that have been made, with only one exception back in 2000 where a query arose. Indeed, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_501"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 501</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the decisions of the Treasury Select Committee in another place have been unanimous. They have had all-party support.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, in view of what the Minister said about the qualifications needed, including the suggestion that someone from north of Watford be appointed, does not the name Lord Barnett cry out? I suggest this particularly if we couple with his qualifications the noble Lord&#039;s record of tabling unswervingly helpful Questions to the Government Front Bench.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the experience and expertise of my noble friend Lord Barnett are well recognised beyond the bounds of the Treasury and the Bank of England. However, like the noble Lord, Lord McNally, I would be distraught if my noble friend took up a post which precluded him being able to be regularly in his place in order to ask such interesting questions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </b>   My Lords, are any reports on these appointees given to the Chancellor after their appointment, and if so, by whom?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the Chancellor is directly involved in making the appointments of external members, but the names of the people who are considered for appointment remain confidential for reasons which noble Lords will understand. However, I repeat that those who are appointed are routinely questioned by the Treasury Select Committee in another place.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Sheldon: </b>   My Lords, should not the Governor be congratulated on his ability to be in the minority during the monthly meeting when interest rates are assessed, and to be able to take that position when it might be thought of as a disadvantage? It demonstrates clearly the level of independence that the Governor has brought to his office.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, that is absolutely right, although I think it has happened on only one occasion, certainly on checking the voting records over the past 12 months. Indeed, when we look at both the external and internal appointments, it is clear that the members do not vote in blocks in the same way. They vote differentially and have done so over the period.
</p>

<a name="51108-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>In relation to the whole question here, I would ultimately pray in aid the report of the OECD Economic Survey. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;The framework governing monetary policy and fiscal policy has played a key role in improving macroeconomic stability relative both to the past and to other OECD countries. The United Kingdom is a leader in the quality of its monetary and fiscal policy frameworks among OECD countries and the principles and features of its framework have been scrutinised by other countries with a view to implementation in a different institutional context&quot;.</p>
</ul>

<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="51108-01_time0"></a><h5>2.45 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Jenkin of Roding </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>When they now expect to publish the report of the joint industry/government electricity system issues steering group on grid operation with increasing wind generation.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="51108-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My Lords, the Electrical Systems Technical Issues Steering Group is looking at the performance of the GB electrical network post-2010. Its interim report will be published by the end of November. A copy of the report will be placed in the Library of the House.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51108-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </b>   My Lords, why is this taking so long? It was in July 2004 that the Select Committee of this House drew the Government&#039;s attention to the fact that the intermittency of wind power makes it subject to the law of diminishing returns: the more wind power you install above a low limit, the less conventional power is displaced and the more unstable the Grid becomes. Given that the problems faced in Denmark and Germany arise from precisely the phenomenon of the law of diminishing returns, is it not time for the Government to give the Select Committee a response to its warning?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, we had hoped to produce the report earlier, but it has been necessary to provide additional resources to the National Grid electricity transmission company. The interim report has now been produced and it will be sent to the Minister next week. The House will therefore be able to see the group&#039;s recommendations soon.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Redesdale: </b>   My Lords, following on from the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, does the Minister agree that the National Grid standby is calculated on the largest provider of electricity, which is Sellafield, and that until wind power matches about 20 per cent of the National Grid, it is irrelevant whether it is subject to diminishing returns? Does he further agree that, given the large amount of energy that is being taken up to match Sellafield&#039;s output, the Government should consider dismantling the National Grid and turning to localised networks?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, the report does not look at diminishing returns. It looks at the stability of the system. Until one approaches the 20 per cent level, this is probably not an issue, as has been shown in other countries. That is what the report is looking at. Interestingly, it has already been shown that if we get the turbine designs right, the performance of the system could be increased rather than diminished by having more wind.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lewis of Newnham: </b>   My Lords, what effect will the delays have on the investigated changes in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_503"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 503</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

charging and contractual regime, proposed by Ofgem, to cope with the growing number of renewable generation projects? I believe that the report will be published in 2006 but there seems to be some disparity of date.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, as I pointed out, the report looks at the dynamic performance of the system after 2010. It does not look at current charging issues.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   My Lords, without anticipating the report, which is taking an inordinately long time to come to fruition, is the Minister able to say how close it is coming to previous predictions about the contribution that intermittent wind will make to our power needs by 2010?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, again, I point out that while scenarios are being produced so that we can look at the performance under different circumstances, the report specifically looks at the dynamic performance and whether unstable situations are produced if wind and gas are increased as a proportion of the system. The report suggests that if the turbine designs are right, there can be a dampening-down of systems oscillations and a riding through of transmission faults, which would improve the system.

<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spopq0"></a><b> The Earl of Dundee </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>What plans they have to fulfil their commitment to double investment in palliative care services.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My Lords, the details of delivering our manifesto commitment are being discussed with a range of key stakeholders. Alongside this, the views of the public, service users and staff on end-of-life care is one of the issues covered in the <i>Your health, your care, your say</i> consultation process at present in progress. We will be taking account of what people have to say in this consultation in the way we discharge our manifesto commitment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew8"></a><b> The Earl of Dundee: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he accept that government funding of adult hospices, at 34 per cent, and of those for children, at only 4 per cent, makes hospices the largest fund-raising cause in the United Kingdom? Which improved percentages of public funding for adult and children hospices will therefore be achieved when the Government fulfil their commitment to double investment in palliative care services?
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I fully accept the tremendous contribution made to health and social care services by the voluntary sector in the hospice <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 504</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

movement, both in adult and children services. That is strongly supported by the Government, who, as the noble Earl knows, continue to put extra money into palliative care. About half of the extra &#163;50 million we have put in recently went to the voluntary sector in this area. It was made very clear that our manifesto commitment was about increasing opportunities for people to be treated at home, not in other services. Clearly the hospice movement will have some contribution to make in that area.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </b>   My Lords, the Government&#039;s commitment to doubling investment in palliative care is, of course, welcome. But, given the fact that only some 1 per cent of people who die from causes other than cancer receive palliative care&#151;in other words, 99 per cent do not receive such care&#151;the doubling of the investment is inadequate. Does my noble friend agree that what we really need is a very significant increase in funding and other resources?
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, we discussed this issue very fully in our debate on 7 July. There was a general acknowledgement that the Government had done a reasonable job in taking forward support of palliative care, although we all recognise that more needs to be done. As to implementing the manifesto pledge, the services will be extended to include children as well as adults and patients with conditions other than cancer. So we will be extending choice in this area when we do what needs to be done to implement our manifesto commitment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </b>   My Lords, do the Government recognise that there are already half-a-million patients per annum in this country who would benefit from specialist palliative care skills to maximise their quality of life and allow them to be at home as much as they would wish, but that some PCTs currently seem unable to meet their commitments to hospice providers providing care in the community?
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I pay tribute to the noble Baroness for the work that she has done in this area, which is of international renown. We have shifted the balance of power to primary care trusts, which are best placed to make judgments about the support to be given to their local services. We have not only shifted the balance of power but we have given them a five-year period of roughly a 9.5 per cent cash increase year on year to expand the services in their areas.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew14"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Newcastle: </b>   My Lords, bearing in mind the report of the Select Committee of this House which stated that Britain is a world leader in palliative care but that this branch of medicine is underfunded, when will the Minister be able to give an assurance that more funds will be forthcoming? Will he assure the House that what is euphemistically known as &quot;assisted dying&quot; will not be seen as an alternative to allocating <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_505"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 505</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the resources needed so that every terminally ill person receives the palliative care that he or she needs right across the country?
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I made clear in our debate on the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill that the Government have a position of neutrality in this area. I have nothing to add to what I said then. We were the only party to put in its election manifesto a commitment to improve funding for palliative care. We will honour that promise. We are consulting the public. We want to listen to what they have to say and to stakeholders, including organisations such as Marie Curie Cancer Care. We will come forward with proposals as soon as those consultations have been completed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew16"></a><b> Baroness Neuberger: </b>   My Lords, given that the Government have made a commitment to increase funding, as well as listening to the consultation, will they look at the lack of funding, particularly for older people who are dying of conditions other than cancer? Whatever comes out in the consultation, that is a serious inequality in care provision.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="51108-02_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, people will have to be patient until we complete the consultation. There is no point in our making policy until we have heard what the public and stakeholders have to say. We shall bring forward proposals at the end of that process.
</p>

<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="51108-03_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </b>   My Lords, did the Minister mean to imply that there will be no action until the public&#039;s voice has been heard? He has mentioned consultation twice. How is it being carried out and when should we expect to know the result?
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="51108-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, we have been through a process of extensive consultation, which has still not been completed. There are questionnaires on websites; 1,000 people met in Birmingham from all over England 10 days ago, when their views were taken on a wide range of issues, including end-of life issues; and there have been regional consultations. There are many opportunities to find out what we have been doing on the Department of Health website, which the noble Baroness can read if she wishes to do so. Those consultations will lead to a White Paper at the turn of the year, when all will be made clear.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="51108-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Laming: </b>   My Lords, it is encouraging to hear the Minister paying tribute to the remarkable contribution that volunteers make to the hospice movement both in bedded units and in people&#039;s homes. Does he agree that there is a danger of volunteers being exploited, and that far too much of their time is diverted into fundraising when they would be much better employed supporting people with special needs?
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="51108-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, there is always a balance to be struck. As a former chairman of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, I know that the <br>&nbsp;<br>

voluntary sector often strikes the balance between fundraising and service provision very well. It is in the nature of the voluntary sector that a degree of fundraising goes on&#151;that is what makes it the voluntary sector. I pay tremendous tribute to its work on palliative care; long may it continue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="51108-03_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lyell of Markyate: </b>   My Lords, would it be wholly unjust of noble Lords listening to the Minster&#039;s answers if we had the impression that this widespread consultation and the wait for a White Paper might involve a small element of treading water? Will the Minister take care to listen to those professionals in the day-to-day care of the elderly in hospital, who know how badly the opportunity for further palliative care at home is needed? Can he find a quicker way of providing money for that?
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="51108-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, one of the features of this Government&#151;and the reason they have been re-elected three times&#151;is that they listen. I note that the two candidates for the leadership of the noble Lord&#039;s party seem to be learning some of those lessons.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="51108-03_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Patel: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the Government and Marie Cure Cancer Care are discussing extending the Delivering Choice Programme to a further 11 sites, to improve end-of-life care for patients, irrespective of their diagnosis?

</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="51108-03_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the initiative referred to by the noble Lord has been discussed, and will continue to be discussed between departmental officials and Marie Curie Cancer Care. The initiative has been taken by Marie Cure itself, which is in the driving seat in terms of how rapidly it wishes to roll it out. We shall have to wait until the consultation process is completed before deciding how we spend the money promised in our election manifesto.

For the purposes of clarity, I should say that Rebound did not refuse outright to admit the two people; it asked for a postponement of the visit until the Crown Prosecution Service had reached a decision in the Gareth Myatt case. Those two people had produced the original report and, on the advice of lawyers, that was the position taken. I reassure the House that there is an ongoing, wider review on the use of pain techniques.

<a name="51108-03_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Renton: </b>   My Lords, should not the Home Office team investigating the use of restraint on teenage prisoners be able to apply a universal system without any variation of the contracts with which various prisons or training centres are required to comply? Should there not be a systematic universal system for dealing with this matter?
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="51108-03_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, we have clear guidelines on the matter. I reassure noble Lords that the panel of experts was appointed by the Youth Justice Board, and it commissioned the consultants to review the operation in each of the centres. This they did, and they have reported.

<a name="51108-03_spnew13"></a><b> The Earl of Listowel: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the better trained and supervised the prison officers working directly with children in young offender institutions and secure training centres are, the better equipped they are to intervene early and de-escalate situations before they get out of hand and force needs to be used? I welcome the introduction last year of a seven-day training course for prison officers to train other prison offices in the needs of children, but is the Minister aware of the view of the chair of the Youth Justice Board that that is only the most elementary introductory training for prison officers to learn about children&#039;s needs? What steps is she taking to improve that training?

<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="51108-03_spnew16"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, that basic training is very much part of the training that takes place. I certainly undertake to check its precise nature and to write to noble Lords if there is greater information about it. However, I reassure noble Lords that the care that needs to be taken with young people in such situations is absolutely understood. One of the reasons for driving forward the review is that we want to make sure that we have the best possible means of keeping young people safe and restraining them in a way that is appropriate.

<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="51108-03_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Dholakia: </b>   My Lords, the Minister may not deem it necessary to review the contractual arrangements in light of the use of restraint, but will she ask Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Prisons to examine the excessive use of restraint, particularly in secure training centres, and will she ensure that the Home Office has on no account abrogated its responsibility for the welfare of that individual?
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="51108-03_spnew18"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I assure the noble Lord that excessive use of restraint has not taken place.

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Noble Lords will recall that the House agreed a number of amendments in Committee on 25 October which fundamentally changed the structure and the content of the Bill, including the introduction of a new freedom of expression exemption. In response to those amendments, the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, generously and helpfully said that she would consider the issue further. The purpose of these amendments, therefore, is to find out the current status of the Government&#039;s consideration of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51108-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>First, will the Minister explain to the House at what specific areas of the Bill the Government are looking? Secondly, with whom are the Government discussing these issues? Finally, when does she expect the Government to be able to return to the House with concrete proposals on the way forward? I hope the Minister might feel able to give the House a response to these questions early in the debate. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="51108-04_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, with the House&#039;s agreement, it may be convenient if at this stage I respond to my noble friend to apprise the House of where we are collectively on these issues. Indeed, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, for tabling these amendments.
</p>

<a name="51108-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>The noble Lord has, I know, been a keen supporter of the Government&#039;s intentions in introducing the Bill to Parliament. He has spoken eloquently about legislation in this area both at Second Reading and in Committee. Noble Lords will know that there are strong feelings on all sides in relation to how we should move forward. The noble Lord has been kind enough to indicate that these are probing amendments, and they provide me with a valuable opportunity to update your Lordships on the progress we have made so far.
</p>

<a name="51108-04_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>In Committee strong concern was expressed about freedom of expression. Those concerns led noble Lords to vote substantially in favour of the amendments tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Hunt and Lord Lester, the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Carey, and the noble Lord, Lord Plant. As I indicated then, I wanted to take stock of our position and look for ways in which that deep concern could be addressed without substantially undermining the Government&#039;s stated policy aim of legislating to outlaw incitement to religious hatred, which I continue to believe is fundamentally correct.
</p>

<a name="51108-04_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>We have considered the issues further, and I have had a number of discussions both with those who support the Government&#039;s intentions in this area and those who have deep reservations about how the legislation might operate in practice. Those discussions have been ongoing on all sides of the House. I am sure that noble Lords will appreciate that squaring this particular circle is in no way easy. If it were, I am sure that others far wiser than I would have done it a long time ago.
</p>

<a name="51108-04_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>The time between Committee and today has not been sufficient for the Government to come to a definite resolution of the matters in dispute. There are further discussions to be had, both with the Opposition and with noble Lords on these Benches. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_511"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 511</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Therefore we are unfortunately not in a position to table government amendments for the House to consider on Report. I am, however, continuing to look at how we might make headway and perhaps achieve a level of consensus. I can give your Lordships a personal assurance that we will do all we can to achieve such a consensus, as I am sure your Lordships would wish.
</p>

<a name="51108-04_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Four main areas of the Bill have changed as a result of the amendment that was made in Committee. I shall briefly set out our view in relation to each of these. I want to make clear that nothing is set in stone at this stage. In considering how to take the Bill forward, we will look at how our proposals can be adjusted to provide the reassurance that so many of your Lordships have indicated is required. If we are able to achieve that, we will look to table government amendments at a later stage. I hope that that will be at Third Reading.
</p>

<a name="51108-04_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>The amendment that was made in Committee restructured the Bill so that the religious offence is entirely separate from the racial offence. There are difficulties with providing consistency between that and the existing racial offence, since it suggests&#151;more than we accept&#151;that religion and race are completely separate issues. I accept, however, that the House has clearly signalled its preference for the new framework. We are prepared to consider whether the new structure should remain.
</p>

<a name="51108-04_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>The amendment also removed the words &quot;abusive&quot; and &quot;insulting&quot; from the offence, leaving only &quot;threatening words or behaviour&quot; capable of prosecution. As I indicated in Committee, we have real difficulties with that change. If we confine the offence relating to religion to cases in which threatening language has been used, we would limit it to a very narrow range of behaviour. In the sort of cases that have been dealt with under the racial offence, it is clear that campaigns used to stir up hatred use a range of words, some of which may be threatening but are not necessarily so. Abusive and insulting words can also be used, and they can have just as devastating an effect on the communities concerned. Therefore, limiting the offence only to threatening words and behaviour would make it far too difficult to get to the sort of material that is used to incite hatred and would severely curtail the ability of the Crown Prosecution Service to bring to justice those responsible. We have to bear in mind that those who seek to take advantage of the provisions will want to craft what they say very keenly to avoid being subject to any restraint provided by us through the law.

<a name="51108-04_time1"></a><h5>3.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="51108-04_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>The most important amendment to the Bill is, I respectfully suggest, to the freedom of expression protection included at paragraph 29J to the schedule. My noble friend&#039;s amendment would remove that provision and replace it with something far more tightly drawn. That issue is at the heart of concerns raised by most of those who spoke in Committee. The wording currently contained in the Bill would cause us <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_512"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 512</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

some difficulties in terms of providing a workable offence for prosecutors. However, I believe that it should be possible to include something that goes some way towards that type of wording, which would be sufficiently sound and robust in defending the freedom of speech concerns raised both inside and outside Parliament. That is something that we shall continue to consider and discuss with noble Lords, with a view to coming up with a form of words that I hope will be acceptable to all.
</p>

<a name="51108-04_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Lastly, there is the issue of whether intent should be the only threshold for bringing forward prosecution of these offences. Your Lordships will know that that is something that is also being looked at in the context of the Terrorism Bill currently being considered in the other place. While the wording that was used in what is known as the &quot;likely limb&quot; is obviously considered to be too loose by a number of noble Lords in respect of the Bill&#039;s offence, we shall want to see whether there is a form of words that will enable prosecutions to be brought without having the unintended consequences feared by many. We understand that that is a difficult road to walk, but we intend to see how best it can be done. If we are successful in doing that, we would hope to be in a position to table amendments at Third Reading, subject to the House&#039;s agreement.

We are in the hands of the business managers, but I am sure that there are those who will be sensitive to the position in which we find ourselves.

<a name="51108-05_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, I have a question that is not in any way meant to be hostile. In the days when I was in government, the business managers did not allow Bills to come before the House at any stage until policy had been sorted out. Why was it not possible to sort out the policy before deciding the date on which these matters were to be considered?
</p>




<p><a name="st_72"></a>
<a name="51108-05_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, we are sorting out the policy now. Let us look at where we are. The Government have put forward a number of propositions with which this House has comprehensively disagreed. There are two ways in which we can deal with that. We could say, &quot;Very well. This House has spoken. We will do no more. The matter will go back to the Commons. The Commons&#151;which, after all, has a mandate as the elected House and the voice of the people&#151;will decide&quot;.
</p>

<a name="51108-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>This is an issue of such sensitivity that there is a desire to accommodate and seek to compromise, to find a middle way. I had understood that those in this House, discharging their duty with such propriety and care as always, would, if possible, prefer to find a way through this rather difficult situation. There may be others who would rather enter into the usual fray.

It does not seem quite certain to me.

in his ability to produce a consensus for a Bill of which we can all be proud. I emphasise that not to disparage anyone else, but simply to say that about him.
</p>

<a name="51108-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Thirdly, we do need more time, because the Government have not yet shown us the colour of their money. Fourthly, the reason my lawyers talk about &quot;without prejudice&quot; negotiations is that it does prejudice negotiations if one talks about them in public. Indeed, when the Minister was speaking, there were one or two things she said I thought might prejudice negotiations, but in fact I do not think they will.
</p>

<a name="51108-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>Lastly, if we can reach an agreement, it should be done before Third Reading by way of negotiation. Then, on Third Reading, provided that the House is content with the bargain that has been struck, we can send the Bill to the other place and avoid such ghastlinesses as ping-pong and the Parliament Act. I therefore entirely agree with the way the Government suggest that the negotiations should proceed. In the end this will save parliamentary time and produce a better Bill.

<a name="51108-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>The proposal to continue negotiations in the hope of reaching a settlement and then bringing that forward to Third Reading is perfectly appropriate. I welcome that as a way forward. It is far preferable to seeking confrontation with the other place. I have never found that attractive except in the most exceptional circumstances.
</p>

<a name="51108-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>I am anxious about a matter that I have raised on several occasions and which so far the Minister has not addressed. That is now further focused by the Government&#039;s proposal to have an offence concerned with the glorification of terror. My understanding&#151;though I may be subject to correction&#151;is that that generally takes place in the context of some religious faith or doctrine. Terror is glorified through the application of that doctrine to the circumstances in which we are now placed. If that is correct there is a danger&#151;unless the language is very accurate&#151;that the Bill in its previous form would cast the protection of criminal law round the glorification of terror in the context of religious belief. This matter needs to be dealt with carefully if the two matters that I have referred to are not to be confused and the relationship between them damaged.


</p>

<a name="51108-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>The other point that I wish to make, because it has been raised by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford, relates to the relationship between race and religion. I am one of those who think that there are substantial differences between the two and I see no reason why religion should be dealt with separately from race, so long as it is dealt with appropriately. One thing that needs to be said about religion is that it may inculcate practices that are themselves hateful. That may well be a matter of judgment, but it certainly is possible; whereas one would not expect that to be a consequence of race by itself. So there is room for considerable difference between the two, and merely separating them in the Bill does not seem to pose any problem in dealing appropriately with religion as well as with race.

<a name="51108-06_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </b>   My Lords, I apologise to the House as I thought that it was right to put a question to my noble friend on the Front Bench before she sat down. It led to something that appeared rather abrupt. With the leave of the House, perhaps I may add that in our manifesto commitment, which is, after all, central to the Government&#039;s argument, the centre point of concern is exactly that which has been put by the right reverend Prelate&#151;namely, what has come to be called the &quot;likely to&quot; test, in addition to intention. Intention is involved in incitement; a ban on incitement is what we promised. The amended Bill does that, but I understand that the Government may wish to deal with particular words at particular places, with such long amendments. However, the &quot;likely&quot; test and the intention test is the core of what we now have, which we should keep.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="51108-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   My Lords, first, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, for giving us an opportunity to see where we are. Secondly, I thank the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_516"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 516</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Minister for suggesting that we should now, to use her phrase, &quot;find a middle way&quot;. I am not sure exactly what that means. I prefer to see it as an intention to seek a level of consensus. That is certainly the right way forward and we will do everything that we can to join with the Government and the many noble Lords with very strong views about how we should proceed. We will certainly do everything we can to assist in meeting the objective that the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, set out.
</p>

<a name="51108-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>I particularly welcome her statement that nothing is set in stone. That was very important, because in Committee noble Lords reached a decision that was very much an expression of opinion&#151;indeed, to coin her view, they comprehensively disagreed. We reached a decision that has been communicated to the Government and that is the way to produce good legislation&#151;to have a Government who listen and then seek to find the right way forward.
</p>

<a name="51108-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>I agree with my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay that one of the most important objectives in all this is to look at the various areas of legislation that are now proposed&#151;he referred to the glorification of terrorism, but there are parts of the Equality Bill and other current legislative proposals which we have to see in context. I share the noble Baroness&#039;s wish to find some way through.
</p>

<a name="51108-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>I strongly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, that we must pay attention to what was said by the Labour Party in its manifesto, but, as I have pointed out previously, the manifesto was clear in its commitment to seek,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;how best to balance protection, tolerance and free speech&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>That, I hope, is how this House has approached the problems before us.
</p>

<a name="51108-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I agree with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford that, in many ways, robust exchanges take place in the context of religion but I prefer the view of my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern that in fact they are very separate. The right reverend Prelate was not so convinced, but I hope that I will have the opportunity of persuading him.
</p>




<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="51108-06_spnew2"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </b>   My Lords, I do not think that either the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, and I fundamentally differ on this issue; it is just that some people are mistaken in thinking that religion is only a matter of choice. Millions of people in the world are born into a religion and other people associate them with that religion. We are not in substantial disagreement on that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="51108-06_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </b>   My Lords, that is exactly my position.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="51108-06_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   My Lords, I sense that consensus is spreading; it is infectious. I am delighted that the Government have decided to accept the infrastructure which is now the Bill. To have the proposed new religious hatred offences set out clearly in their own schedule to the 1986 Act and not lumped <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_517"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 517</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

as an add-on to existing racial offences is an important step forward. I welcome the Government&#039;s concession on that. We can certainly proceed to deal on that basis.
</p>

<a name="51108-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>The change makes it much easier to understand what is proposed in the Bill. It gives us a great opportunity to get the proposals absolutely right. The change means that we can move on to those other three areas, which I will deal with briefly.
</p>

<a name="51108-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>The first is the &quot;likely&quot; limb, as it is now termed. The Minister should be aware that this is a very important point for a range of my noble friends and other noble Lords. On this side of the House we feel strongly that it is important to have the burden of proof where it is: in the Bill, as amended. We are not dogmatic about that, but we feel the need for reassurance about the likelihood of frivolous or vexatious charges being brought under this legislation, or certainly being investigated under it. We do not believe that the original Bill was watertight. I hope that the burden of proof will be firmly on the prosecution.
</p>

<a name="51108-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>The other main question is the nature of threatening, insulting and&#151;in the middle&#151;abusive behaviour. It is important that we recognise that on this side of the House we are deeply uncomfortable with the notion that causing a sense of insult could, of itself, involve the transmitter in the sort of legal proceedings we are talking about. Insult is in the mind of the insulted person, after all. That is such an important point. If the bar is set so low, the belief rather than the believer is unquestionably being protected. That truly would be a new &quot;right not to be offended&quot;. As it stands, &quot;threatening&quot; is much more <i>ad hominem</i> but I look forward to discussing that point with the Minister.
</p>

<a name="51108-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Finally, on the freedom of expression clause, I detect a willingness on the part of Ministers to accept what is in the Bill. After all, we have merely put into legislation what the Government have always said. Now to see freedom of expression so clearly set out is a huge advance. The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes of Cumnock, would rip the heart out of the Bill in its amended form. I know that Hearts are very dear to the noble Lord, even in these troubled times, and I hope that he will not force this matter to a vote.
</p>

<a name="51108-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>Everybody will have their own view on what imperfections there may be in the new freedom of expression clause but as I have pointed out, it does no more than embody what Ministers have been saying all along.
</p>

<a name="51108-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>I welcome what the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, has said, although I have a great deal of sympathy with my noble friends who asked for more time. We probably do need more time, whether by means of a recommitment, as my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale suggested, or simply a period of more open discussion. We need to argue our way through <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_518"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 518</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

this situation rather than take entrenched positions. However, I very much welcome the noble Baroness&#039;s expressions of view today.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="51108-06_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I hope that I am not out of order in responding to some of the points made. I say to my noble friend Lord Wedderburn that I did not by any means wish to be curt but of others wanted to speak.
</p>

<a name="51108-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>There has been much helpful discussion about where we are now. We very much take into account the comments that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, made about ensuring that we look at the broader framework within which this issue sits. He is right to identify a potential difficulty, and we are bearing that in mind as we go forward. The noble and learned Lord is absolutely right to say that we would hate to see a cloak being given to acts which should properly be dealt with by virtue of an assertion that they were made on some basis of faith. We are very alive to that point.
</p>

<a name="51108-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>We are seeking a level of consensus, and therefore I am concerned in case the noble Lord, Lord Lester, feels that I have in any way trespassed into an area which would make that more difficult. I hope that I have not done so.
</p>

<a name="51108-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>This is not an easy area, as I believe we have all demonstrated in our comments. I very much appreciate the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, who asked whether this is the right time. We are where we are, and certainly the consensus view is that we should try to make progress, if we can, between now and Third Reading in the hope and aspiration that Third Reading can take place at a sensible time when we will have had discussions and will be able to make progress. To do otherwise would defeat the whole purpose of the debate that we are having now.
</p>

<a name="51108-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>I shall deal with the issues in order. Like the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, we are absolutely determined to ensure that frivolous and vexatious cases should not be brought. That is very much part of the thrust of what everyone wishes to see and, as we all know, there is already a sift from the CPS and the Attorney-General. However, I listened carefully to the point made both in Committee and today that it is not just the charges that should be taken into account but also the nature of the bringing of investigations. I very much take that on board.
</p>

<a name="51108-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>I take on board, too, comments made in relation to intent and the &quot;likely to&quot; test. We have had a number of discussions about whether intent <i>simpliciter</i> is enough or whether recklessness or other issues should be considered. I simply reassure the House that those issues are exercising our concerted efforts. I just say to noble Lords that we have to keep the benchmark which will enable proper&#151;I emphasise &quot;proper&quot;&#151;prosecutions still to be possible. I am sure that no one in the House would like us to arrive at a situation where proper prosecution of proper cases in relation to inciting racial and religious hatred were not possible because of any changes that we make. I know that that is not what anyone in this House wishes.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_519"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 519</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51108-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>I hope that I have made it absolutely clear that we understand that freedom of expression is the biggest issue which has caused the most concern. Proper debate, proper discussion and proper criticism of differences in faith and religious belief should not be chilled but should be capable of continuing with an appropriate amount of vigour and vim, as would be consistent with a vibrant democracy. We understand that too. So we will look very carefully to see whether a formula can be brought forward with which all parties can feel more content.


</p>

<a name="51108-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>We are seeking consensus, so it will be incumbent upon us all to move a little. We would like a situation where all would be content, if not totally thrilled. That is an aspiration that we should seek to deliver. I emphasise that many say that the Government&#039;s position as presented in Committee was the correct position from which we should not move. We understand that a whole spectrum of views have to be brought together to a position where each can feel comfortable. I know that those sitting on the opposite Benches have similar difficulties going the other way, too.

<a name="51108-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>I understand the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, only too well. He, like myself, loves a political dogfight. On this particular issue, however, it is better to try to move forward by consensus.

<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="51108-07_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, I prefaced my remarks by saying that I did not want to criticise the Government. It is not a matter of having a political dogfight. It is a matter of principle that the Government should work out their policy before the Bill comes before the House. The business managers and the Government decide that. That was what I sought to explore with the Minister, who gave me a very courteous response.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="51108-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Foulkes of Cumnock: </b>   My Lords, is it not wonderful to hear a Government who pay attention to what is said in a debate, take account of it and act accordingly?

</p>

<a name="51108-07_para1"></a>

arrow that was directed at my heart by my good friend the Opposition spokesman, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51108-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="51108-07_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Avebury </b>   moved Amendment No. 2:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>After Clause 2, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_1"></a><br>
   &quot;ABOLITION OF CERTAIN RELIGIOUS OFFENCES

<br>
   The following offences are hereby abolished&#151;


<br>
(a)   blasphemy and blasphemous libel;


<br>
(b)   any distinct offence of disturbing a religious service or religious devotions;


<br>
(c)   any religious offence of striking a person in a church or churchyard.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_87"></a>The noble Lord said: I beg to move the amendment introducing the first new clause. The atmosphere of consensus created by the debate on the previous amendment is very welcome. I particularly appreciated the remarks of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford, who said that there must be robust exchanges on questions of religion. I hope that that means that the Church is coming round to the view that blasphemy should, at last, be abolished. Although it is impossible to imagine that everyone on the Bishops&#039; Benches would agree with that proposition, if several do so it could be a weighty influence in helping the Government to make up their mind. It is the Government whom we have to convince to take this matter forward after today&#039;s debate.
</p>

<a name="51108-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>The last time there was a prosecution for blasphemy in England was the <i>Gay News</i> case of 1976, when the editor of that newspaper was sentenced to nine months&#039; imprisonment, subsequently lifted on appeal, for a poem that appeared in the paper. The arguments for abolishing the offence have been dealt with on many occasions in this House since then: in the Blasphemy (Abolition) Bill of 1995; in the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill of 2000; the Religious Offences Bill of 2002; in the Select Committee on Religious Offences, which spent a whole year examining the matter in 2003; in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill in 2004; and at Second Reading of this Bill only a few weeks ago.
</p>

<a name="51108-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>One of the main reasons for coming back to the proposal now is to make it clear once and for all that this Bill does not, and is not intended to, introduce a new statutory offence of blasphemy by the back door. Subject to this amendment being agreed to, one could say whatever one liked about the sacred entities or beliefs of a faith. There has been no response to the challenge that I issued at Second Reading to draft a form of words &quot;ridiculing holy objects&quot; that would be liable to prosecution under this Bill.


</p>

<a name="51108-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>I mentioned the Ship of Fools website which ran a competition to discover the 10 funniest and 10 most offensive religious jokes. The conclusion was that the Almighty was fair game and that blasphemy was a minority concern. The so-called jokes were indeed grossly offensive and some of them were undoubtedly blasphemous in law as well as according to ordinary English usage, but they would not make any sane person hate Christians. As long as the offence of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_521"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 521</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

blasphemy technically exists, however rarely it is used, there is confusion between incitement to hatred of believers and hatred of beliefs themselves. We have seen quite a bit of that already on this Bill. A new argument for getting rid of blasphemy is that it will help to make that distinction absolutely plain.
</p>

<a name="51108-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>There are several other reasons for abolishing this offence and your Lordships have considered them repeatedly. I refer particularly to the report of the Select Committee and, since it covers the arguments in some detail, it is necessary for me to summarise them only briefly. First, nobody can say with any confidence what is blasphemous, because the CPS and the courts may well take a completely different view today from what they did in 1976. When there was a public recitation of the James Kirkup poem, which had led to the <i>Gay News</i> prosecution, on the 25th anniversary of the case, the police took no action and there was no significant demand for them to do so. But the uncertainty of the law may itself lead to self-censorship or even actual censorship as it did in the Wingrove case, which is described in Appendix 3 of the Select Committee&#039;s report.
</p>

<a name="51108-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>In that case, the European Court of Human Rights decided in 1996 that the British Board of Film Classification had not violated Article 10 of the convention on the basis that Lord Scarman&#039;s speech in the <i>Gay News</i> case had fixed the definition of the offence in common law and that the restriction on freedom of expression was within the limited margin of appreciation accorded to member states in assessing whether the interference was for a pressing social need and was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
</p>

<a name="51108-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>That aim was the protection of the right of citizens not to be insulted in their religious feelings dealt with by the court in the Otto Preminger case. The Select Committee concluded that the European Court had wrongly assumed that the House of Lords had clearly formulated the law on blasphemy in the <i>Gay News</i> case and it doubted whether the Court would have upheld the BBFC&#039;s decision to ban the Wingrove video if the facts had been correctly argued before them. That shows that our blasphemy laws have continued to have reverberations in Strasbourg within the past 10 years and that the uncertainty may well lead to further expensive and divisive litigation in the future.
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="51108-07_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, I do not disagree with what the noble Lord is putting forward, but I have some difficulty in deciding how it fits in with this Bill. Would he kindly tell me whether it does?
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="51108-07_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, it is not for me to argue with the learned Clerks who allowed this amendment to be tabled as they did in the other place. I am satisfied that, if there were any question about whether the amendment fell within the Long Title, your Lordships could deal with that at Third Reading or perhaps when the Bill goes back to the Commons.
</p>

<a name="51108-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>Secondly, the law protects the Christian faith and arguably only the Church of England, which your Lordships will agree is intolerable in a society that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_522"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 522</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

believes in equality before the law, and is contrary to Article 14 of the ECHR on the prohibition of discrimination. As long as this law exists, other faiths may well continue to argue for equal treatment. As your Lordships may know, many Muslims originally believed that the main proposal in this Bill was designed as a substitute for a universal blasphemy offence. Conversely, repealing the offence of blasphemy would make it clear that Parliament does not intend to shield any religion from robust or even offensive criticism.
</p>

<a name="51108-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Thirdly, because of the Human Rights Act, any prosecution for blasphemy today would be likely to fail either on the grounds of discrimination or through the operation of Article 10.2 of the ECHR which allows restrictions on freedom of expression only to the extent that it is necessary in a democratic society for public order reasons. The court would have to consider, first, whether any speech or publication subject to the prosecution was intrinsically blasphemous and then whether restricting the freedom to use those words was proportionate to the aim being pursued. In outlining the case for repeal&#151;which I hasten to add was only one possible course of action that it discussed&#151;the Select Committee concluded that, even if a prosecution were successful, it is likely that it would eventually be overturned on appeal either by the higher courts in the United Kingdom or by the European Court of Human Rights on one or more of the grounds that it is discriminatory, uncertain and a law of strict liability. On that argument, repeal would save the considerable expense of proceedings that might well go to Strasbourg.
</p>

<a name="51108-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Finally, the law is objectionable because, as I said, it imposes a strict liability on a person who wants to publish a document or make a verbal statement about a Christian belief or sacred entity but who has no way of knowing whether he will be committing an offence.
</p>

<a name="51108-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>Some of the witnesses who testified before the Select Committee would have none of those arguments, believing as they did that the prohibition of blasphemy in the Ten Commandments should be part of our domestic law. One cannot have a sensible conversation about any law with people who think that our conduct in the England of the 21st century should be regulated according to instructions supposedly given by God or Allah to individuals living in the deserts of the Middle East in the distant past. We are now living in a multi-religious society where no religious group has the right to impose its rules on the rest of us. Although it is usually best to exercise restraint in speaking about things that are considered sacred, there must be freedom to criticise or attack customs and practices that are said to be sanctioned by religion.
</p>

<a name="51108-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>Scotland and Northern Ireland have survived without blasphemy laws since the middle of the 19th century. Belgium and Spain have no such laws. In Australia, a common law jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of Victoria could not decide whether blasphemous libel was an offence known to the law and, in 1998, threw out the only such case known to have been prosecuted in the whole of the previous century. In Pakistan, on the other hand, blasphemy <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_523"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 523</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

law is alive and well. As the Foreign and Commonwealth Office states in its human rights report this year, that has fostered an atmosphere of religious intolerance and eroded the social and legal status of religious minorities.
</p>

<a name="51108-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>The Bill deals with the real evil of stirring up hatred against people because of what they believe or practise. Our ancestors hated each other, sticking labels on Lollards, Catholics, Protestants and Jews. That led to the burning of heretics, religious wars that cost thousands of lives and to the Holocaust. Hatred was never brought to an end by hatred, so let the rivalry between faiths, including secularism, be conducted by means of argument or even by mockery and derision. Let poets, novelists, comedians, playwrights and broadcasters say what they please. If God exists, He does not need the protection of this or any other law. I beg to move.

<a name="51108-08_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Renton: </b>   My Lords, I am thoroughly opposed to the new clause. It abolishes offences that have been part of our civilisation for generations. Indeed, they have been statutory for a long time. To take blasphemy, civilised behaviour should not legalise blasphemy. To take,

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>that would be contrary to religious freedom, which we all support. To abolish religious freedom in that way is uncivilised. The final item in the new clause is the abolition of,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;any religious offence of striking a person in a church or churchyard&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>In our civilisation, we abolished striking of a person. We are totally opposed to it. How the noble Lord can suggest that striking is justified on religious grounds is beyond my comprehension. I hope that all your Lordships will criticise and vote against the new clause.

<a name="51108-08_spnew1"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </b>   My Lords, I see that I have the pleasure of following the noble Lord, Lord Renton, because clearly he is a very fit man. I read an interesting piece in today&#039;s <i>Evening Standard</i>. Apparently the noble Lord, Lord Renton, managed to run faster than his noble friend Lord Pilkington, who is only in his seventies, in order to catch a cab. I look forward to sprinting against the noble Lord myself.
</p>

<a name="51108-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>I approach Amendment No. 2 with somewhat mixed feelings. It is clearly motivated by a genuine desire to remove the vestiges of religious discrimination from our law and I certainly support the principle of a level playing field and equal respect for all religions. But I do raise the question whether this is the right time and the right Bill for such an amendment.
</p>

<a name="51108-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>I should make it clear that I do not wish to defend the present law of blasphemy and blasphemous libel, and I suspect that that goes for all the other Members on this Bench. I could not agree more with the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that God does not need a law to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_524"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 524</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

protect Him. For myself, there is first the question of what might constitute blasphemy. If blasphemy is defined as what &quot;grieves the heart of God&quot;, I submit that this is above all about human cruelty: unkindness, injustice and all that defaces the image of God in humanity; that violates his children. Personally, I find a very great deal in our society which is lewd, vulgar and distasteful. Some of it is directed to religion. I would rather we lived in a more civilised society which did not display such signs of decadence, but I do not think that such things count as blasphemy in the same way as torture and cruelty.
</p>

<a name="51108-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>So there is the whole question of what actually counts as blasphemy. On a more technical point, as the majority of the Law Commission argued in 1985, the meaning of these offences is legally uncertain in the place that they give to intention. They are unacceptably discriminatory in protecting only the Christian religion&#151;and possibly only the tenets of the Church of England, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, pointed out&#151;and for these and other reasons they are a dead letter. In recent years the Church of England has expressed a willingness in principle to assent to their repeal.
</p>

<a name="51108-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>However, we have advocated a step-by-step approach to deal first with the problem of religious hatred and then to tackle blasphemy. It is asserted that to abolish blasphemy at this point would send a clear message that this Bill is not an extension of the blasphemy law. It is important that such a message should go out and be received. But to deal with blasphemy now runs the risk of sending exactly the opposite message, or at any rate a confused one. If religious hatred is nothing to do with blasphemy, let the two be dealt with separately.
</p>

<a name="51108-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>On the question of disruptive behaviour in church services, places of worship or burial grounds, it is true that Section 2 of the Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860 reflects an historical situation which no longer obtains. It would be desirable to reform the law to reflect the needs of a multi-faith society. The Law Commission recognised this in proposing two new offences: the disruption of communal worship and the desecration of places of worship. But such a reform of the law would require very careful consultation and thought.
</p>

<a name="51108-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>As I have said, I think that I can speak on behalf of all the Members on this Bench in not wanting to oppose an amendment like this in principle, but we have to ask whether this is the right time and the right Bill for it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="51108-08_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   My Lords, my name is down in support of this amendment and, indeed, it is supported by our Front Bench. I should declare a personal and professional interest long past in that I appeared in the Salman Rushdie case when an attempt was made by Mr Choudhury to extend the law of blasphemy to protect Islam against insult. It is right that I should declare it and a little later I shall be saying something about that case and what one may learn from it.

</p>

<a name="51108-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>My task is briefly to explain where I think we are at the moment on the law of blasphemy because the situation now is untenable. The leading English case on the common law of blasphemous libel was decided by the Law Lords in 1979, in the <i>Gay News</i> case. By a majority of three to two, and without the benefit of the framework of the Human Rights Act 1998 or full argument on the issues of free speech, the Law Lords breathed new life into what had been regarded until then as an anachronistic and arbitrary relic of Tudor and Stuart times when draconian powers of censorship had been exercised by the Ecclesiastical Courts and the Court of Star Chamber until they were taken over by the common law courts. As Lord Diplock, one of the dissenting liberals in the <i>Gay News</i> case, observed:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;In the post-Restoration politics of 17th and 18th century England, Church and State were thought to stand or fall together. To cast doubt on the doctrines of the established church or to deny the truth of the Christian faith was to attack the fabric of society itself: so blasphemous and seditious libel were criminal offences that went hand in hand&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>Mrs Mary Whitehouse brought a private prosecution against the editor and publishers of <i>Gay News</i> alleging that they had,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;unlawfully and wickedly published . . . a blasphemous libel concerning the Christian religion namely an obscene poem and illustration vilifying Christ in His Life and in His crucifixion&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>For the previous 50 years, the offence had disappeared from the criminal calendar and was regarded as having become obsolete.
</p>

<a name="51108-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>The <i>Gay News</i> defendants were tried at the Old Bailey and convicted. The editor was sentenced to nine months&#039; imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, and fined &#163;500. The publishers were fined &#163;1,000. The Court of Appeal dismissed their appeal and so did the House of Lords. The only member of the Appellate Committee who referred to free speech was Lord Scarman, who explained that he wished not only to give new life to the offence, but also to extend its reach to protect all religions. In the Irish Supreme Court&#039;s judgment in <i>Corway</i>, where it effectively abolished the law of libel, it referred to what it described as Lord Scarman&#039;s &quot;remarkable&quot; rationale for the existence of an offence of blasphemy. Your Lordships will be pleased to know that I will not read out exactly what Lord Scarman said, but in conclusion, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;I will not lend my voice to a view of the law relating to blasphemous libel which would render it a dead letter, or diminish its efficacy to protect religious feelings from outrage and insult. My criticism of the common law of blasphemy is not that it exists but that it is not sufficiently comprehensive. It is shackled by the chains of history&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>That is an extraordinary statement from a very enlightened judge.
</p>

<a name="51108-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>The previous trial for blasphemy had taken place 50 years previously in the case of Gott. John William Gott was indicted for having published a blasphemous libel by selling to the public two pamphlets entitled <i>Rib Ticklers, or Questions for Parsons</i> and <i>God and Gott,</i> satirising the biblical story of the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, from Matthew Chapter 21, verses 2 to 7, which is based on a literal interpretation of the prophecy that the King of Zion would come,

<a name="51108-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>which is Zechariah Chapter 9, verse 9. One man in the crowd said, &quot;You ought to be ashamed of yourself&quot;; one woman said, &quot;Disgusting, disgusting&quot;. Nothing further occurred. Gott was convicted and sentenced to nine months&#039; imprisonment with hard labour, even though he was suffering from an incurable disease.
</p>

<a name="51108-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>In dismissing Gott&#039;s appeal, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Hewart, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;The appellant has been three times before convicted of publishing blasphemous libels, and he had ample knowledge of what he was doing. It does not require a person of strong religious feelings to be outraged by a description of Jesus Christ entering Jerusalem &#039;like a circus clown on the back of two donkeys&#039;. There are other passages in the pamphlets equally offensive to anyone in sympathy with the Christian faith . . . Such a person might be provoked to a breach of the peace . . . If the appellant is in ill-health, the hard labour will not be enforced so as to injure him. In fact, a sentence of hard labour will cause the prison authorities to pay even greater attention to his health than they would otherwise do&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>The harsh sentence aroused great public indignation, with strong criticism of the press and condemnation by a number of clergymen. But there was no condemnation or criticism by any of the Law Lords in the <i>Gay News</i> case. In fact, Lord Scarman described as &quot;relevant to British society today&quot; the statement of the Home Secretary, Edward Shortt, when pressed to remit Gott&#039;s sentence. The Home Secretary said:



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;The common law does not interfere with the freedom of expression of bona fide opinion. But it prohibits, and renders punishable as a misdemeanour, the use of coarse and scurrilous ridicule on subjects which are sacred to most people in this country. Mr Shortt could not support any proposal for an alteration of the common law which would permit such outrages on the feelings of others as those of which Gott was found to be guilty&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>In the wake of the <i>Gay News</i> case, the Law Commission reviewed the subject and, after a detailed study, its report was published 20 years ago in June 1985. It recommended the abolition of the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel. It identified three main defects in the common law. First, it stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;The law is to an unacceptable degree uncertain&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-08_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>Secondly:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;In so far as the law requires only an intention to publish the offending words and not an intention to blaspheme, the offence is to an undesirable extent one of strict liability&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-08_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>Thirdly, it stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;In the circumstances now prevailing in England and Wales, the limitation of the offence to the protection of Christianity and, it would seem, the tenets of the Church of England cannot be justified&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-08_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>I shall omit the differences of view but I note that Brenda Hoggett&#151;now the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Hale of Richmond, a very distinguished Law Lord&#151;was one of those who recommended total abolition.
</p>

<a name="51108-08_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>Finally, in the case of <i>Choudhury</i> a challenge was made, with the support of many Muslims, to the publication of Salman Rushdie&#039;s novel <i>The Satanic Verses</i>, seeking to prosecute Mr Rushdie and his publishers, Viking Penguin, for blasphemous libel. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_527"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 527</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Reliance was placed upon what I have read to your Lordships in the <i>Gay News</i> case and on the European convention. I acted for Viking Penguin. It was a painful experience because it illustrated the great danger of retaining blasphemy as a criminal offence. The great danger was&#151;and remains&#151;that followers of other faiths seek a blasphemy law to protect their faith against gross insult. One religion&#039;s faith is, of course, another religion&#039;s blasphemy. The Divisional Court rejected the application. It agreed that extending the blasphemy law would be impossible, as did the European Human Rights Commission.
</p>

<a name="51108-08_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>Having had the appalling experience in that case of a major division between, as it were, white liberals like me, on the one hand, and people of genuine, strong Muslim faith who wanted a blasphemy law, on the other, I quite see that there is no equal protection of the law in their eyes&#151;and there is not&#151;so long as Christianity is given special protection against gross insult and other religions are not. The answer, surely, to the problem is not to seek to extend blasphemy law or to misuse the Bill that we are currently discussing and debating, but at last to bury, as has the Irish Supreme Court, the completely outmoded, almost mediaeval, crime of blasphemy.
</p>

<a name="51108-08_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>Unfortunately, in a Written Answer of 24 February 2005, the Minister indicated that the Home Office does not apparently regard the offence of blasphemy as dead. In a further Written Answer the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>&quot;If material or conduct is gratuitously offensive to Christians, and is prosecuted as such, a finding of blasphemy may be the appropriate response by a court to ensure that the rights of others under Article 9 [of the convention] are protected&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 3/3/05; col. <i>WA 40</i>.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-08_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>I protest at that. An official statement of that kind can only encourage bodies such as Christian Voice and the Christian Institute in their bigoted campaign against the BBC and the regional theatres to prevent public performances of &quot;Jerry Springer&#151;the Opera&quot;.
</p>

<a name="51108-08_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>Whether the offence is abolished in this Bill or soon thereafter, it will not be abolished until the Bishops tell the Home Secretary that they are willing to see it abolished. I believe they have moved strongly in that direction and I very much hope that they will be able soon to give the green light so that we can legislate as we should do.

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>It is entirely open to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, to come forward with another Bill, which I should welcome. But to choose this Bill is entirely misconceived, as I have sought to adduce in this short intervention. I believe that the Bill is aimed at dealing with an immediate situation and should not be confused with the issues that the amendment seeks to deal with.

<a name="51108-09_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Crickhowell: </b>   My Lords, I have listened to the debate with considerable interest, and I shall not argue that a case cannot be made for the abolition of the current blasphemy law. I shall not even argue that it cannot be done in this Bill&#151;it may be within the scope of the Long Title.
</p>

<a name="51108-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>Earlier this afternoon we had a debate about timing, and when it was appropriate for amendments to be introduced and considered by the House. We are on Report and a pretty fundamental amendment has been tabled. It covers not only the basic issue of blasphemy but in the proposed new subsections (b) and (c), as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford, said, it deals with other matters, such as the disturbance of religious services. We need to consider carefully appropriate legislation to deal with such offences, not only in the Christian religion but in others, too. I sense that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, is conscious of the strength of the arguments because I, too, noticed the manner in which he concluded his remarks. He spoke about the Bishops coming forward at some point and giving a green light to legislation. He then said that it could not be this afternoon or at this stage in the Bill&#039;s proceedings.
</p>

<a name="51108-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>It has been an interesting debate. It is perfectly sensible for this matter to be raised, and for a signal to be given that we should consider it in a more appropriate way in the future. However, it would be totally wrong to move forward with the clause as it stands at this stage when there will be no proper opportunity to consider the wider implications or whether any substitutes are needed to avoid disturbance of religious services. For those reasons, I could not support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="51108-09_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Plant of Highfield: </b>   My Lords, as one of the authors of the amendment, I should like to say a brief word in its favour. As the noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Lester, have pointed out, the social basis of the blasphemy laws has been entirely eroded. They developed as a common law offence to protect religious belief when it was thought that religious belief, particularly Christian belief, was part of the essential social glue, underpinning the law and the monarchy. Whatever the social glue of a modern society is, it is not generated purely by one religion or one denomination. It seems clear that the doctrines and formulae of the Church of England are given special treatment under the blasphemy laws, so the social basis of the laws has been eroded.
</p>

<a name="51108-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>There are three important arguments, particularly given what my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis said about whether this was relevant to the Bill. If, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said, we go back to the <i>Gay <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 529</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

News</i> trial, Lord Scarman argued that the blasphemy laws, or something like them, should be extended to cover all other religions. The danger is that the Bill will be seen by many people as doing that; it is not what the Government or Parliament intend, but a lot of people think that that is what is being done. To remove or rescind the blasphemy laws would make it crystal clear that we were not following Lord Scarman&#039;s injunction of extending the blasphemy laws to all other religions.
</p>

<a name="51108-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>Secondly, abolition would clarify the nature of the Bill. The Government have argued that it is not an extension of the blasphemy laws but there is little doubt that some Muslim leaders have thought that that is what they are going to get. The abolition of the blasphemy laws would make it crystal clear that that is not the case and would therefore clarify the nature of the Bill. I support the amendment because I think it makes the nature of the Bill much clearer.
</p>

<a name="51108-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>Finally, the Government have argued all along that the Bill as it was first conceived, and still to a very large extent as amended, draws a distinction between belief and believers. For the reasons I gave at Second Reading, that is not a distinction I find very convincing; nevertheless, it is what the Bill turns on. Given that, the blasphemy laws protect beliefs and not believers. Therefore, we would have two pieces of protective religious legislation on the statute book&#151;the Bill, if it becomes an Act, and the blasphemy laws&#151;both embodying contradictory principles. The Bill emphasises the distinction between belief and believer and protects the believer, not the belief. The blasphemy laws protect the belief and, via the Bill, would also protect the believer. However, the blasphemy laws in themselves protect the belief.
</p>

<a name="51108-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>It would clarify the nature of the Bill and the distinction between beliefs and believer to accept this amendment. It would not do, as a way of trying to resist the amendment, to say that the Human Rights Act has made all this irrelevant, otiose or redundant. If it is redundant, we might as well get rid of it because it gives us too many reasons for people to be dissatisfied by what they think of as unequal treatment before the law, depending on which their religious beliefs. For those reasons, I put my name to the amendment. Unlike my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis, I think that it is central to clarifying the nature of this Bill.

However, surely no one can doubt that religious services and religious devotions are entitled to a greater degree of protection against disturbance than, let us say, public meetings at Hyde Park Corner. Surely to propose to abolish, without any words of explanation, the present offence of disturbing a religious service without putting anything in its place is asking the House to do something ridiculous. For that reason, and because the amendment contains subsections (b) and (c) as well as subsection (a), I suggest to the House that this amendment must fail.

<a name="51108-09_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </b>   My Lords, I nearly put my name to this amendment, but, through a failure of timing, it does not appear. The crime of blasphemy, in its medieval origin, is very understandable, but it has shrunk, should shrink further, and should be disposed of by your Lordships, if necessary, today. Of course, I quite understand the argument which Professor Francis Cornford called the principle of unripe time in his little book, <i>Microcosmographia Academica</i>, which was written for fellows of a particular college who engaged in academic politics. He suggested that such readers, when met by the principle that the time is not ripe, should say, &quot;That is to say that the just and right thing should not be done now for fear of doing more just and right things in the immediate future&quot;. For all the reasons given by my noble friend Lord Plant, it is plainly appropriate and sensible to deal with this matter in this Bill.

<a name="51108-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>Very little has been said, except by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, about the nature of blasphemy. It began as a denial of the truth of the Christian religion, the Bible, <i>The Book of Common Prayer</i> or the existence of God&#151;I summarise from the best textbook. That was understandable as a medieval offence, but everybody felt uncomfortable with it as the 19th century began to edge out that summary of the cases between 1514 and 1841. The courts began to say that the offence was not quite just because it was a manifest block on sensible freedom of discussion, a concept that the 19th century began gradually to understand. They came to say that it was such a thing only if it led to a risk of breach of the peace. Lord Sumner said judicially that blasphemous words were punishable,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;for their manner, their violence, or ribaldry, or, more fully stated, for their tendency to endanger the peace, then and there, to deprave public morality generally, to shake the fabric of society and to be a cause of civil strife&quot;.</p>

<a name="51108-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>So we come to the modern cases, where they tend to say&#151;again, this is a summary&#151;that it is blasphemy if the words are couched in indecent or offensive terms likely to shock and outrage the general body of Christian believers in the community. Now, even those who sit on the Benches of the right reverend Prelates are not so easily outraged now as when that summary was first given many decades ago. There are, of course, always traps for the unwary. In the case that Mrs Whitehouse brought against <i>Gay News</i>, that formula was put forward in rather strong terms. When we look at it now, we think that those involved in Mrs Whitehouse&#039;s case, in 1979, perhaps discussed things in a way that is not appropriate to modern times.
</p>

<a name="51108-09_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>It is surely time to say that this particular privilege for the Christian religion has gone away and officially gone a distance that is far from modern mores and thinking. That particular privilege should not be on the statute book for that religion. I said &quot;the Christian religion&quot;, but it is not at all clear that it covers the whole religion. The better view appears to be&#151;I see my noble friend Lord Lester nodding, and on this he is indeed my noble friend&#151;that only the Church of England can make use of that particular crime.

The Irish Supreme Court pointed out that but for the Church of England, there would be no such crime in this country. There is no Church of England in Ireland, therefore they said it was not enforceable in Ireland.

There are Churches of that kind, which tend to disapprove and enforce their disapproval of what goes on in the bedroom, tend to tell you that you have got to believe in myths that seem to evolve, decade on decade, with bodily ascensions and all sorts of other stories, and are very fierce with you&#151;at least in theory&#151;if you do not believe in and do not do what they say in the privacy of your life.
</p>

<a name="51108-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>The Church of England has developed, like the rest of law and practice, into a very modern position. It has freed itself from the wish to impose controls of that kind, and it has come very close, even within itself, to accepting the equality of women, which is one of the most important developments of our time. I am very happy that it brings to such problems a broad and liberal mind. It has a bit of a way to go, and I shall judge it as having achieved its final or near-final step on that road when it demands from the BBC that &quot;Thought for the Day&quot; on Radio 4, to which I am sure all your Lordships listen avidly every morning, includes regular contributions from such noted thinkers as Professor Richard Dawkins and Dr Jonathan Miller, whose programme on disbelief I am sure that your Lordships enjoyed last night.

</p>

<a name="51108-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>The legal notion of blasphemy dates back many centuries, as has been pointed out. It is part of a Christian heritage that formed our constitution, and I am of the view that it cannot be considered in isolation from our entire constitutional settlement. The Christian heritage of this country goes back much more than 1,000 years, and its legacy is still very much present in our national life. I take issue with the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, who said that it would not harm any of it to do away with the blasphemy law. If we chip and chip and chip away, in the end what will we have?

</p>




<p><a name="st_105"></a>
<a name="51108-10_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   My Lords, I am very aware of that fact and thank my noble friend for bringing it to my attention.
</p>

<a name="51108-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>There are things that are required by the law of our country, such as Christian teaching and assemblies at schools. Remembrance Day services are an essential part of public life. When national disasters happen, they are always marked by a Church service, as we saw recently. In the United Kingdom, our culture, laws, democratic institutions, architecture, literature, art and science have all been profoundly influenced by Christianity and cannot be understood without reference to it, no more than any of us could understand Chinese art or any of the buildings that you see in Thailand without reference to Buddhism or the Chinese religions. The Christian faith has played a major part in the many great social reforms of our history, such as the creation of schools and hospitals, the abolition of slavery, the improvement of working conditions and the protection of children.
</p>

<a name="51108-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>Along with the coronation oath, the blasphemy laws are an important expression of principle: that the name of Jesus Christ is above any other name. As the Bible records, God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name. Moreover, the blasphemy laws today are essentially a defensive measure. No one will be put in prison for breaking them, unlike the religious hatred offence proposed in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51108-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>It is the symbolic nature of the blasphemy laws that secularists object to. If that were not so, they would not show such interest in repealing the law on blasphemy, given that it is rarely used in practice. I sometimes fear that the campaign to remove the blasphemy laws is part of a wider agenda to remove all association between the state and Christianity and any reference to the only true God in public life.
</p>

<a name="51108-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>It is sometimes wrongly claimed that a law on blasphemy is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. In fact, several unsuccessful challenges to blasphemy law have come before the European Court of Human Rights in recent years. In the 1996 case of <i>Wingrove v United Kingdom</i>, the court held that this country&#039;s blasphemy laws were compatible with Article 10(2) of the Convention. The court stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;The extent of insult to religious feelings must be significant, as is clear from the use by the courts of the adjectives &#039;contemptuous&#039;, &#039;reviling&#039;, &#039;scurrilous&#039;, &#039;ludicrous&#039; to depict material of a sufficient degree of offensiveness. The high degree of profanation that must be attained constitutes, in itself, a safeguard against arbitrariness&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>We are right to have a blasphemy law. There is good evidence that many ordinary people identify with the Christian faith and many Christian moral values. I have said on several occasions in your Lordships&#039; House that the 2001 census found that 72 per cent of the UK population identified themselves as Christian. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_534"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 534</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Clearly, the state and individuals have embraced secular values and beliefs in many areas, but the UK is not a secular state, and its people are generally theists who believe themselves to be Christians. Even the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper&#039;s editorial, following the publication of the census, stated on 28 February 2003:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;This is a Christian country simply in the unanswerable sense that most of its citizens think of themselves as Christians&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>The truth is that every society that seeks cohesion has laws that enshrine its most fundamental beliefs. Blasphemy law falls into that category and protects our shared values. Any reform or abolition of the blasphemy laws cannot be looked at separately from the constitutional role of Christianity in the state. I oppose the noble Lord&#039;s amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="51108-10_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, it is extremely rarely that I disagree with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford, but I shall do so briefly this afternoon. I hope that he will reconsider some of the main strands of his opposition to the amendment so clearly and well moved by my noble friend Lord Avebury.
</p>

<a name="51108-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>The right reverend Prelate said that he did not see a connection between religious hatred and blasphemy and that therefore it was inappropriate to make the amendment to the Bill. There is a connection, in that blaspheming is one way of expressing and fomenting hatred. He also said that this was not the time to introduce this reform into the Bill&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, spoke about that at some length&#151;but I believe that this is the time.
</p>

<a name="51108-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>The law of blasphemy, as the right reverend Prelate admitted, is more or less a dead letter. It is nearly 30 years since we last had a prosecution, and when we had one it promoted more confusion than light. As a Low Church ecumenical Anglican, I believe that, if anything, the law is now an encumbrance to the Church, and against the spirit of the age, which is one of extreme liberality of view and expression of view. In a strange way it works against the Church, in that it gives some people the notion that it cannot stand on its own feet and fight its own corner as other faiths and organisations have to do. I see no good argument for keeping it in place except the traditional one. I am a traditionalist: a good tradition knows when to steal away.
</p>

<a name="51108-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>For those of us who find the Bill as originally drafted unacceptable in creating an offence of promoting religious hatred, this is a perfect opportunity for the church to sacrifice this legislative bauble to the greater cause; to find a common position with other faiths, particularly Islam at this time; to claim no special protection; to say that we stand with you, the same under law as you are; and to proceed from there. There are public order laws to prevent the worst infractions of order and decency. Such a gesture would resonate throughout the Church community and among the public at large.

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>First, the blasphemy law is out of date. Would we sit down today to consider a blasphemy law for any religion? No, we would not. Secondly, the Church of England does not require the law. The Church is strong enough and important enough not to need such protection. This is a Christian country. Its religion is accepted by the state. It is not a secular state, although there are many people in this country who do not realise that there is a state religion. We are moving towards a loosening of the ties between state and Church. That will benefit both bodies. There was a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_536"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 536</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

time when the state and the Church badly needed each other to keep order. That is not the case today. The Church of England does not need this archaic blasphemy law to protect it.

<a name="51108-11_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </b>   My Lords, I am usually on the side of the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, but not on this occasion, I fear, because if this question of blasphemy is not dealt with, and dealt with now, there will be a continual niggle between the Christian Church and other Churches. It is important that that niggle is removed. Only by removing the blasphemy laws can we remove it.
</p>

<a name="51108-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>A number of speakers, including the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, have said that this Bill is not the right vehicle for these amendments, but if it is in order within the Long Title, it is a perfectly legitimate thing to do. All sorts of Bills are amended in the Commons and in this House because amendments can be got in within the Long Title. Noble Lords should not be seduced by the view that the Bill is not an appropriate vehicle. It is. The amendment is perfectly legitimate, and now is the time for this matter to be settled. As the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, said, that would then give the House of Commons the opportunity to have a go at it, too.
</p>

<a name="51108-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>There is another reason why we should deal with this matter tonight. We all welcome the remarks and the position set out by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford. He has indicated, as did the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, that the Church of England itself is ready for abolition of the blasphemy law. It is true that they say, &quot;Not yet, not through this Bill&quot;, but if they agree in principle with abolition, and that that would assist in achieving peace, if I can put it that way, between the religions, why not consider it and vote for it today? I realise that there are only two Bishops on the Bishops&#039; Bench, but perhaps a few telephone calls could go out to bring in others to support the amendment. I hope that we can reach a conclusion on this matter and we should thank the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for introducing the amendment.

<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="51108-11_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Slynn of Hadley: </b>   My Lords, I am not persuaded by what has been said so far: that the crime of blasphemy no longer performs any useful purpose.

</p>

<a name="51108-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>The stronger arguments at the moment are not in favour of abolishing the crime altogether, but considering its application to at least the three Abrahamic faiths. That is the issue that should be debated in depth, not simply abolition. For that reason, although I do not often disagree with the noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Lester, I oppose the amendment.

That has a place in some situations, but it is particularly important not to try to do too much in one Bill. It has been generally recognised that there has been a good deal of confusion about exactly what the Bill proposes. If the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, are encompassed in the Bill, the confusion will be even greater.
</p>

<a name="51108-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>In so far as the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Plant, is concerned, it seems perfectly possible for people to understand that the reason for rejecting the common law offence of blasphemy, were this amendment agreed to, was that the Bill replaces that law, whereas the Government have been very careful to point out as often as they can that it is quite different. The other point is that the foundation of the argument advanced on behalf of those not protected by the racial discrimination law is that it protects Sikhs and Jews in a way that it does not protect the other religions, including Christianity. That is one of the bases on which this Bill has been put forward.
</p>

<a name="51108-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>Those issues are not simple, and to complicate them in this way would be highly undesirable. I feel certain that if this amendment were agreed to, many would think that we had embarked on a very different course from that on which the Government believe they have embarked and on which we spoke earlier. I may be wrong, but I had the impression that this was the Government&#039;s view in dealing with suggestions of amendments about blasphemy before.
</p>

<a name="51108-11_para10"></a>

<a name="51108-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   My Lords, another advantage of the Bill in its amended form is the ease with which we can discuss an issue as important as blasphemy. We are greatly indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, who has long campaigned on this issue, in delivering what I thought was a tour de force, aided and abetted by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, with his <i>tour d&#039;horizon</i>.
</p>

<a name="51108-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>We have had a very balanced debate. Some wise words of caution have been uttered. We have heard a powerful case for arguing that the rather aged law against blasphemy should be reviewed as part of the new settlement in this troubled area of the law. Does the Minister believe that the law of blasphemy can now coexist with the freedom of expression clause in this amended Bill or, indeed, with any slightly improved version of it?
</p>

<a name="51108-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>As noble Lords will know, some saw in the Government&#039;s original Bill a vehicle not for abolishing the law of blasphemy but for extending it to religions other than Christianity. I believe that that shadow has now passed, and it is entirely right that we should now consider what settlement is appropriate and sustainable in this area in a highly diverse and liberal society. I am not saying that blasphemy has had its day but, in view of the clear view already expressed in this House on the question of freedom of expression in religious matters, I think that the burden of proof is now with those who wish the blasphemy laws to remain rather than those who would abolish them.
</p>

<a name="51108-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>We have heard some very persuasive speeches on either side of the argument. My noble friend Lord Renton made a very good point about paragraph (c) of the amendment, which concerns,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;any religious offence of striking a person in a church or churchyard&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford referred to paragraph (b) concerning,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;any distinct offence of disturbing a religious service or religious devotions&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, is right to say that other areas of the law cover that, but I think that the fact that he seeks to abolish not only <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_539"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 539</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

blasphemy and blasphemous libel but also these other offences justifies my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern in saying ,&quot;Let&#039;s tread carefully&quot;.
</p>

<a name="51108-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, had a point when he talked about taking time and proceeding with caution in such a traditional area. My noble friend Lord Crickhowell made some very good points to justify pausing for a few moments before proceeding, and the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, also made a number of valid points. The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, summarised the position by referring to the doctrine of &quot;unripe time&quot;&#151;a phrase that has been mentioned several times. It is a wonderful, glorious phrase. It is actually a complete paradox or oxymoron because time is never ripe, although many who have expressed views in the past have thought that it is.
</p>

<a name="51108-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>My noble friend Lady O&#039;Cathain made a very well argued speech, pointing up a number of issues that we must consider. Although the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, referred only to paragraph (a) and implicitly conceded that we also have to think carefully about paragraphs (b) and (c), I think that, mainly due to the intervention of the right reverend Prelate, the balance of argument has been on the side of consultation.
</p>

<a name="51108-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>Although my noble friends will be voting in accordance with their conscience on those matters, there is some merit in pausing to consider what, in essence, the right reverend Prelate enunciated&#151;namely, a red signal to this amendment but a green signal to the principle. We have to pause for a moment to try to work out what that means. I suppose it means that we should take a little time carefully to think through what we are doing; or it could mean that the Bishops&#039; Bench want a little time to think through what their advice will be.
</p>

<a name="51108-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>I do not think the argument that this is not the Bill holds up. In its truly amended form, it deals with this issue. Therefore, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has every right to say that this is the moment on which we have to reach a decision. Speaking for myself, however, I find it difficult to vote in favour of the amendment in the face of the red light from the Bishops&#039; Bench and, indeed, some of the good speeches made by my noble and learned friends. On balance, therefore, I would side with caution and consultation, just as we went with caution and consultation about the whole text of the Bill a few moments ago.
</p>

<a name="51108-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>I hope that consultation can be meaningful and speedy. The Government have said that they want their Bill, and that they have instanced the manifesto commitment. Surely, however, particularly in the light of this debate, there is a good argument for saying that we ought now to take the time to get this Bill right before we return it to the other place. I do not see the need of rushing to a date for Third Reading. Rather, as my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour said earlier, there is an argument perhaps for having a recommittal of the Bill, to go through it line by line in Committee. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_540"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 540</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Why is there this rush? It is surely much more important that we get this right than we move speedily to get it wrong.
</p>

<a name="51108-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>These issues are so important that I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, having initiated a good debate, will be content to wait for a further period of consultation before moving to a vote. In the mean time, I leave it to my noble and learned friends to exercise whatever decision the House may be asked to take on the grounds of their own conscience.
</p>




<p><a name="st_125"></a>
<a name="51108-12_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I am glad that I did not rise to my feet more quickly. I did just as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, wanted&#151;I paused. He has just summed up this debate with great skill, and saved me, I hope, the burden of inflicting what I would have said upon the House.
</p>

<a name="51108-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>I agree with the noble Lord about caution and consultation. However, I say as clearly as I can: not in this Bill. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, was right when he emphasised the Government&#039;s clear desire that this Bill should not be seen as a substitution for the blasphemy laws. There would be a deal of confusion if the two became conflated in the way that is suggested.
</p>

<a name="51108-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>We have had an interesting and extensive debate. The hour and 20 minutes we have spent enjoying this debate has been well spent. We have ranged over the full course of the dispute. The noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, clearly said that it is needed. Others said that it may be needed, but that it needs to mutate. That is clear from the speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn of Hadley, and the comments made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford, among others. If we know one thing about this area, it is that we do not currently have agreement. That says something very powerful. The Government recognise the importance of these issues but, like the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford, do not believe that this is the appropriate time to consider the abolition of blasphemy.
</p>

<a name="51108-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>For the purposes of completion, I say to my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis that blasphemy was, in fact, ruled out of scope in the Commons. It came back in because, as noble Lords will know, amendments are not discussed in that way. There is an issue as to whether it is in or out of scope, therefore, but it is quite proper that we debate it at this stage. So while we are grateful for the consideration given to this matter by all noble Lords today, by noble Lords in the Select Committee in 2003 and earlier by the Law Commission, we are aware that there has not been wider consideration of this matter. It is particularly important, given the emotive nature of the issues, that they receive full parliamentary scrutiny, especially in the light of the fact that public opinion is also divided on the subject.

</p>

<a name="51108-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has also made it clear that the Government are not prepared to legislate on blasphemy without first consulting with a range of faith and other interests. Many leaders from faiths not protected by the law on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_541"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 541</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

blasphemy see the symbolic protection for religion as important. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is also keen that any legislation in this area should take place with the full involvement of the Church of England. In the past, there has been confusion between incitement to religious hatred and blasphemy and we should try to put an end to that confusion. Therefore, I am keen that we do not add to it by addressing both issues in the same Bill, especially as we try to chart a rather tortuous path through some of the difficulties with which we are currently faced.
</p>

<a name="51108-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>The Government believe that incitement should be bedded down before moving on and looking at the detail of blasphemy. Therefore, although I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for raising these issues, I say, in the words of my noble friend Lord Wedderburn, that the time is not ripe. On this occasion, the phrase is correct. We have moved a long way, but we cannot quite say that we have considered all views and that this is the time for the abolition of blasphemy. I hope that the noble Lord will not find it necessary to test the opinion of the House, either now or before the Bill leaves this House.

<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="51108-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, at the risk of boring your Lordships, I would like to clear up the question that has been raised by several noble Lords on the offences (b) and (c). The noble Lord, Lord Renton, the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford, in an intervention and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, in winding up all mentioned these two common law offences which have fallen into disuse for centuries. I referred to the Law Commission&#039;s report of 1985 and I remind your Lordships that it refers to statements in Hawkins&#039; <i>Pleas of the Crown</i> to the effect that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;&#039;all irreverent behaviour&#039; in churches and churchyards has been regarded as criminal. More specifically there is authority, by no means strong, for the proposition that it is an offence at common law . . . to disturb a priest of the established Church in the performance of divine worship and also, it seems to disturb Methodists and Dissenters when engaged in their &#039;decent and quiet devotions&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>The cases referred to are <i>R. </i>v<i> Parry</i> of 1686 and <i>R </i>v<i> Wroughton</i> of 1765.
</p>

<a name="51108-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>The report goes on to mention that it is an offence,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;to strike any person in a church or churchyard&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>The cases referred to there are <i>Wilson </i>v<i> Greaves</i> of 1757 and <i>Penhallo</i>&#039;s case of 1590.
</p>

<a name="51108-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>The offences in (b) and (c) fell into disuse centuries ago and have been replaced in modern times by statutory offences such as common assault, for example, in the case of striking a minister in the churchyard. I hope that that will dispose of the point raised by several of your Lordships. I could also refer to the Select Committee&#039;s report, at paragraph 21, but I will not bother to quote that in detail because the point has been sufficiently made. However, your Lordships should allow that it was reasonable to put these other common law offences up for abolition at the same time as blasphemy.

<a name="51108-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>I am most grateful to all those who have taken part in this debate. It is right for me to observe that only the noble Baroness, Lady O&#039;Cathain, and possibly the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, opposed the proposition that blasphemy should be abolished outright. Every other speaker, including the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, speaking from the Conservative Front Bench, has said that it is ridiculous still to have this offence, but this is not the right place to abolish it.
</p>

<a name="51108-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>The Minister repeated what the Home Secretary has said elsewhere: that he does not want to move to legislate on the matter until there has been proper consultation. I do not know what we were doing for a year in the Select Committee: We took evidence from everyone: the Church of England, the Catholics, the Methodists, the Muslims, the Sikhs, the Hindus&#151;you name it, they all came. We spent a whole year examining just this question. Now the Minister wants us to start on another round of consultation. That is an excuse for procrastination.
</p>

&quot;ABOLITION OF CERTAIN RELIGIOUS OFFENCES (NO. 2)

<br>
   Section 2 of the Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860 (c. 32) is hereby repealed.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_128"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, perhaps I may be allowed a comment on that vote. I believe that the Minister will agree that it was worth putting the amendment to a Division because it demonstrated a radical change in the opinion in your Lordships&#039; House since we last debated blasphemy. It is moving in the direction that I would like to see&#151;that of total abolition&#151;and we probably would have got there had there been a free vote on the Government&#039;s side of the House as there was on this side. I will leave the Minister to reflect on that and on whether it is appropriate to embark on yet another round of consultation to substitute for the work that has already been done at such great length by the Select Committee, as she acknowledges.
</p>

<a name="51108-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>Of all the statutory offences against religion that are left over from the 19th century and examined by the Select Committee on Religious Offences, the only one that has been used in recent years is Section 2 of the Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act, which forbids,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;riotous, violent or indecent behaviour in a church or chapel of any denomination, or in any place of worship certified under the Registered Places of Worship Act 1835&quot;.</p>
</ul>

</p>

<a name="51108-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>It is also an offence under this section to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;molest, let, disturb, vex, or trouble . . . any preacher duly authorised to preach therein&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>That extends also to ceremonies held in a churchyard or burial ground.


</p>

<a name="51108-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>The question is not whether churches, mosques or gurdwaras need the protection of the law against people who might disrupt their services or other religious activities but whether they should have some additional safeguards which are not available in secular premises, and, if so, whether this elderly statute is the right answer. As far as non-Christian places of worship are concerned, they do not appear to see the ECJA as useful considering that only a very small fraction of them have registered under the 1855 Act. It has never been used, to the best of our knowledge, in relation to any place of worship other than a church of the Established Church. The Select Committee found it extremely difficult to obtain any statistics and the Home Office acknowledged that its figures were unreliable because of errors in the procedure for coding offences in the courts.
</p>

<a name="51108-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>The Home Office was unable to identify any of the cases behind the statistics. Separate inquiries by the Select Committee unearthed details of two convictions which were classified as ECJA but where charges of criminal damage had been preferred at the same time and the courts had ultimately convicted under that heading. The third case where details were available was the very well known one of Mr Peter Tatchell, who was prosecuted in 1998 for causing a disturbance in Canterbury Cathedral, I believe while the Archbishop was preaching. The stipendiary magistrate fined him &#163;18.60, showing neatly what the court thought of the case. But if disturbances were considered serious enough to justify prosecution, they could be dealt with under the Public Order Act and, if the offence was found to be religiously aggravated, the offender would be liable on summary conviction to a sentence not exceeding six months&#039; imprisonment.
</p>

<a name="51108-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>Since the Select Committee&#039;s report, the data for 2003 have been published showing that there were three prosecutions and one conviction during the year. Assuming that the initial charge was correctly recorded, the conviction may well have been for some other offence, as with the 2002 cases I have mentioned. We have no means of knowing. The Home Office is obviously not interested or it would have taken steps to collect the information when it was put on notice of the difficulties that were experienced by the Select Committee. The data for 2004 have yet to be published&#151;they are due on 17 November&#151;but the Home Office has kindly allowed me a preview and I can tell your Lordships that so far this year there have been 15 prosecutions, resulting in 10 acquittals, four findings of guilty&#151;in two cases a fine was imposed, in one a community sentence and in one imprisonment&#151;and one under the heading &quot;otherwise dealt with&quot;.
</p>

<a name="51108-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>Churchwatch, an organisation that monitors offences of all kinds on church premises, believes that the ECJA is a convenient means of dealing with <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_546"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 546</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

disrespectful conduct falling short of actual criminality, such as eating or smoking in church, men wearing hats or going bare-chested, or skateboarding in churchyards. Some churches have printed notices with the text of Section 2 and their own explanation of the meaning of the word &quot;indecent&quot;, which they give to people engaging in such activities and ask them to leave the premises. They find that often this works. But they also acknowledge that the same result might be achieved by using printed copies of Section 4A of the Public Order Act.
</p>

<a name="51108-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>These minor breaches of good taste and decency have to be seen in the context of a general deterioration in standards of behaviour, including respect for places of worship and ministers of religion, and a steep growth in crimes against persons and property belonging to churches, which, sadly, has led to many being locked except during services. That is not a problem that we can deal with here by legislation, and certainly not by the archaic language of the ECJA, which is unfamiliar territory to most prosecutors and the public.
</p>

<a name="51108-14_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>The ECJA has been superseded by modern laws on criminal damage and public order. It is hardly ever used, as I have demonstrated, and it is not of sufficient consequence for the Home Office to bother keeping reliable statistics or enabling the cases to which they refer to be retrieved. This is a good opportunity for Parliament to remove a piece of clutter from the statute book. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="51108-14_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for raising this issue. As he has identified, Section 2 of the Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act provides protection from low-level public mischief taking place in churches of the Established Church to other registered places of worship. As a point of information, it is important that we recognise that 1,587 non-Christian places of worship were registered under the Religious Places of Worship Act 1855 at the time of the Select Committee&#039;s report. Therefore, they, too, are eligible under the ECJA for protection. Unlike blasphemy and a number of the other offences to which the noble Lord has referred in the past, this provision is used, as is demonstrated by the figures cited by the noble Lord.
</p>

<a name="51108-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>The Select Committee on Religious Offences heard evidence from the Director of Public Prosecutions that it provides a route to prosecution for some forms of undesirable behaviour which would not be covered by other parts of the law. So it is not otiose. Although prosecutions have been few in recent times, the Director of Public Prosecutions told the committee&#151;I am sure the noble Lord will remember this&#151;that it was used sufficiently regularly for it to be considered a useful offence. We are dealing with a single-issue Bill today and, as with blasphemy, we are very keen to have a single message and to convey it with clarity. It is for that reason that we consider it unhelpful to cloud the issue with further matters which may cause unnecessary confusion. It is quite right that these and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_547"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 547</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

some of the other issues to which we will turn shortly may well be properly the subject of further discussion, but not in this Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="51108-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, the Minister is right to cite the DPP&#039;s assertion that this offence provided a means of dealing with offences that were not covered by other parts of the criminal law. However, she omitted to add that the DPP, when challenged, also was unable to provide the committee with details of a single case where someone had been prosecuted for the offence. As I have said, when we looked into the matter we found that some of the offences were misclassified because the code number used by the courts began with three digits, which applied to some 50 or 60 other miscellaneous offences, and the clerks entering the details into the computer frequently made mistakes. Also, as I have explained, prosecutions under the ECJA were accompanied by charges brought under some other statute, and the statistics collected by the Home Office do not reveal what the ultimate conviction was for; they reveal only what the charges were. So if a person is charged under two different offences, and the main one happens to be under the ECJA, the figures are not corrected to cover the changes that may have been made during the proceedings.
</p>

<a name="51108-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>I continue to assert that not only is the offence used very rarely but that, where it is used, it could very well be dealt with by some other provision in the criminal law. I can see, however, that I am not going to persuade the Minister of that today. I shall reflect on what she said and I may well come back to the matter at Third Reading. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_132"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is to the schedule and would extend the meaning of religious hatred. The schedule states that,

</p>

<a name="51108-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>My amendment would add the need to take into account the desecration of sacred objects.
</p>

<a name="51108-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>I say at the outset that my amendment does not reflect my party&#039;s policy, but I want to explain my concern about recent events that have done serious harm to the religious beliefs of our different faith communities. Two recent events demonstrate how inadequately we deal with hatred of this kind. Last week we learned that more than 40 Muslim graves were desecrated in Birmingham. It is easy to deal with such matters as criminal damage, or to use other legal means, but the underlying hurt does irreparable damage to our faith communities. The shockwaves of what happened in Birmingham were felt across the whole country.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51108-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>The second incident was reported in our national newspapers only yesterday. I am aware that the matter is under investigation by the Metropolitan Police, but suffice it to say that an allegation has been made by a Muslim man that a police officer desecrated his Koran by throwing it into a rubbish bin when arresting him. The incident is alleged to have happened last Monday in south London, and the man also alleges that he was assaulted while being detained at his home. Muslims believe that a copy of the Koran is sacred and must be treated with respect. Throwing it in the bin could be viewed as a grave insult amounting to desecration. I shall not go further into that case, but we await the outcome of the investigation undertaken by the Metropolitan Police.
</p>

<a name="51108-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>There are other examples that are hurtful to the community. All of us are aware of the alleged mishandling of the holy Koran where the US military confirm that it had identified five incidents in which the holy book was mishandled by American personnel at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp. The report sparked protests across the Muslim world. In Afghanistan, riots resulted in at least 15 deaths. I do not believe that we shall ever find out whether the holy Koran was flushed down the toilet, but it is not disputed that such incidents create extreme hurt to our Muslim community.
</p>

<a name="51108-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>There are incidents of pig heads being left outside Mosques. It is only recently that prison officers who deal with Muslim inmates have understood how to handle the holy book. It is not uncommon that even the most gentle inmates become violent when their religious beliefs are hurt.
</p>

<a name="51108-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>Another incident relates to some Christian fanatics who vandalised a Hindu temple. Two young white men reportedly intruded into a temple service in Ealing Road, in London. One of the men snatched the microphone and shouted that there was only one God and that the congregation was stupid to worship a stone. They then shook the idol until it was broken. The Hindu community was deeply offended that its sacred images were desecrated by those two persons. Of course we could argue that there are powers to deal with religiously aggravated criminal damage cases. In this case the Hindu community said that it had lost confidence in the ability of the CPS to prosecute in such cases. The community has a list of regular incidents from 1993 in which temples and festivals have been vandalised. Very few of such incidents have resulted in prosecution. Jewish cemeteries are regularly vandalised. Synagogues have been painted with swastikas and headstones covered with anti-Semitic graffiti.
</p>

<a name="51108-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>There are powers to deal with religiously aggravated criminal damage, but they fail to take into account the wider insecurity of communities that feel that their hurt is never clearly understood or dealt with. The Government were keen to tell the Muslim community about the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill, and we all know about the letter sent by the Home Secretary to the mosques in this country prior to the election. I very much hope that the Home Secretary will write a <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="51108-15_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Desai: </b>   My Lords, I have great respect for the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, but I am not sure that I support the amendment. I do not like the Bill, as is well known. It was supposed to be about believers, not about belief. We are trying hard not to overstep the mark by criticising or obstructing people&#039;s dislike of religion, but we want to stop them hating those who hold certain beliefs.
</p>

<a name="51108-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>The line is difficult to draw, but we know precisely the sort of thing that can happen. Once we start down that road it is hard to say what objects are held sacred. As a former Hindu I can imagine that a number of objects could be held sacred by a Hindu; there is no precise limit. Because of my lack of religious belief, I do not want to privilege books which, to me, are only books. They may be holy books to some people, but they are merely printed paper to me. If someone says that such printed paper is holy, sacred and so on, and that I cannot do something with it, my right to handle such books will be restricted because they happen to be religious books. I may want to do something that others may find insulting, but to me it would be only a book.
</p>

<a name="51108-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>Let us stop and think a little further. Are there not laws on the books already that allow people to be prosecuted for vandalising temples or destroying icons and figures? If someone feels deeply insulted by the way in which the holy Koran is treated, it may be a matter to consider, but it does not constitute hatred of a religious person. I do not want to go in that direction. Let us keep the Bill fairly restricted and narrow because it is bad enough as it is.
</p>




<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="51108-15_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness D&#039;Souza: </b>   My Lords, perhaps I could remind your Lordships of the time in the early 1990s during the height of the Rushdie affair when Muslims thought it right and proper to burn copies of his novel <i>The Satanic Verses</i> and effigies of Salman Rushdie himself. Where would such actions fall under the amendment? It suggests that the amendment needs greater definition. Of course we all deplore the desecration of the graves that we have heard about recently, but the amendment is still too broad.
</p>

<a name="51108-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>Another area that might come under its aegis, which again is contentious, and which has certainly been tested in the US, is flag burning. I remember going to great lengths, along with many other people&#151;some of whom are in your Lordships&#039; House&#151;to defend the burning of flags. It may be that we would fall on the wrong side of the law if the amendment were agreed to.
</p>




<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="51108-15_spnew3"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   My Lords, the amendment is undoubtedly well intentioned, but your Lordships owe some respect to the English language when legislating. How on earth can religious hatred include desecration? Hatred is a state of mind; desecration is a physical act. To say that hatred includes desecration is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_550"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 550</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

such a gross perversion of the English language that, however well intentioned the amendment, your Lordships should not put that remarkable phrase on to the statute book.


</p>




<p><a name="st_136"></a>
<a name="51108-15_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Harris of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, I have considerable sympathy with the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. If we want the clearest possible evidence of religious hatred, it is the destruction, or desecration, of symbols or sacramental objects. I was party to meetings in Ealing about the experience the noble Lord mentioned. I am very well aware of the very strong sense of hurt that was felt about those actions because of the nature of belief and the nature of the objects which were destroyed and damaged.
</p>

<a name="51108-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>Given the debate in this House and elsewhere about how to define religious hatred, this is the most tangible way in which we can demonstrate that it occurs. For that reason, I hope that my noble friend will in her reply give careful consideration to the arguments. What causes frustration and a feeling that society and the criminal justice system care little about these matters is the fact that the only charges that could be brought under these circumstances are fairly minor ones in terms of criminal damage, with no indication of the severity of the hurt that has been caused and no understanding of the feelings of the communities concerned about the hatred that is being expressed towards them and their beliefs.
</p>

<a name="51108-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>I have respect always for my noble friend Lord Desai. The Bill is designed to protect individuals rather than their beliefs. However, the amendment is not about beliefs but about the impact that those acts of desecration have on a large number of individuals. Having heard the very strong views expressed by several hundred people at the meeting I attended, I think that the Government need to look at this very carefully.

<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="51108-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, there is no doubt that the offence of desecration arouses extremely strong feelings. We had plenty of evidence of that in the Select Committee. We must consider whether, as my noble friend hinted, the problem is one of adequate penalties under the existing law or of the difficulties that the police have in bringing cases to court. Criminal damage attracts a penalty of 10 years&#039; imprisonment for the basic offence, which can go up to 14 years if the offence is religiously aggravated. The problem is not one of the inadequacy of the penalties that are available but of the difficulties the police have in catching the perpetrators of the offences described by my noble friend and bringing them to court.
</p>




<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="51108-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Harris of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, part of the difficulty is the way in which the courts react to issues of criminal damage. The examples cited at the meeting I attended were about the very minimalist penalties imposed on people who had committed acts of criminal damage which had caused enormous offence.
</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="51108-16_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Avebury: </b>   My Lords, the Home Office collects figures of offences that are racially or religiously aggravated and publishes them from time to time, but they are very difficult to get at.

</p>

<a name="51108-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>We know from the figures that I have already given your Lordships on the Ecclesiastic Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860 that the Home Office collects these figures. It can say how many cases were prosecuted and what penalties were imposed but it cannot describe the individual ingredients of particular offences. I urge the Minister to see whether something cannot be done to collect that information and make it more widely available so that at least some reassurance can be given to the communities which are affected that proper efforts are being made by the police and the Crown Prosecution Service to bring the culprits who do these horrible things to justice.

<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="51108-16_spnew3"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Newcastle: </b>   My Lords, I, too, support in principle the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. It is important for the message and the recognition that this will give to our various religious communities up and down the land. Although the wording may need closer definition, it would be enormously reassuring to many people from different religious communities were the amendment to be included in the Bill. I give it my support and hope that the Government will look kindly on it.

</p>

<a name="51108-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>It might be helpful to see what would happen if the words proposed in the amendment were added to the Bill. New Section 29A, entitled &quot;Meaning of &#039;religious hatred&#039;, would read:

<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>That emphasises the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady D&#039;Souza; we must be very careful about adding these words in the context in which they are proposed. That point was also made by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe.
</p>

<a name="51108-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>Although I sympathise with what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, I fall back on the wise advice of the noble Lord, Lord Desai.

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 552</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

revulsion one has about such attacks. It is important that the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, has expressed his personal view on these matters, because it underlines why we all recognise the importance of dealing with hatred, whether it is stimulated by virtue of race or religious belief. It is important, therefore, that we view the amendment in that light.
</p>

<a name="51108-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>I say with the greatest delicacy that to proceed with dealing with racial and religious hatred in a way that impacts on individuals, we need to be quite clear about separating objects from people. There are already a large number of offences which would bite on such acts of desecration and criminal damage, also enabling the court to deal much more trenchantly and effectively with the perpetrators. We have done that by giving the courts the ability to attack such behaviour if they believe it is racially or religiously motivated in an improper way. There is of course an issue about how to express our distaste for that in the way in which the courts deal with it and in sentencing. The Sentencing Guidelines Council will be empowered to look at all those issues. That may be the most appropriate place to deal with the matter.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>The amendment would effectively create a statutory offence of incitement to the desecration of religious objects. As I have said, to incite another to such activities could already be prosecuted. It would be very difficult to make the argument in public that it is people whom we really want to protect by virtue of this offence and not religion per se. While we believe that a maximum sentence of seven years&#039; imprisonment is appropriate for those who seek to pit entire communities against each other, we doubt whether it is appropriate in the case of objects to give a similar protection.

<a name="51108-16_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   My Lords, am I right in saying that the gangsters, the thugs&#151;however one might characterise them&#151;who desecrated 40 Muslim graves can, if caught, be prosecuted for a whole series of different offences and that, if they are convicted, their crimes could be regarded also as racially or religiously aggravated, for which they could be charged as well?
</p>




<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="51108-16_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is absolutely right about that. I am grateful to him for mentioning that a whole series of graves has been desecrated. We were deeply wounded by the number of Jewish, Muslim and other graves that were desecrated. All those desecrations cause great alarm and great fear in the affected communities because those graves are the graves of loved ones and should be the more precious for that.
</p>

<a name="51108-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>So I absolutely understand, bearing in mind particularly the events of the past few weeks and days, why the noble Lord brought this important matter before the House for debate, but this is perhaps not the most appropriate Bill for it, not least because, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester, quite rightly said, there are other means by which we could properly address this really quite disgraceful behaviour.

<br>

<p><a name="st_147"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I hope that I may be forgiven if I briefly say before I turn to my amendments that when the two Front Benches swap pieties at a difficult moment, I always feel that I am going to be lost and will probably be faced with a Bill and certainly with consequences which I do not welcome. I am sorry to say this to the noble Baroness, whom I admire immensely, but at the end of her remarks she left me nourishing the dark suspicion that where she was heading was back to the old Bill and presenting us with the Government&#039;s original intentions as declared in their manifesto.
</p>

<a name="51108-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>I have only one more comment to add to that: I have never been able to subscribe to the idea that any party manifesto deserves the status of holy writ that is normally accorded to them. They are dreadful documents. I recall with pain having once had something to do with one. I remember the aching boredom and the total frustration that accompanied the process. That anybody should elevate the results of a manifesto to the status of holy writ is beyond my imagination.
</p>

<a name="51108-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>Perhaps I may proceed very briefly to the amendments and say to your Lordships that, after this afternoon&#039;s proceedings, I hope to endear myself to your Lordships at least by my brevity. The amendments owe a great deal to the unfailing kindness of the Public Bill Office. I was extremely uncertain about the definition of &quot;religion&quot; and I am extremely grateful to the Public Bill Office for its usual courtesy, co-operation and help.
</p>

<a name="51108-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>I take the subject of the amendments very seriously indeed. If I am right in thinking that religion is part of man&#039;s age-long search for a better understanding of God, it is therefore surely an area which governments should enter only with the utmost caution and with greater respect than they are normally accustomed to showing to anyone except themselves.
</p>

<a name="51108-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>I have four points. First, I regard the fettering of expressions of opinion in any event as an encroachment on freedom which is usually wrong and almost always counterproductive. Secondly, to plead <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_554"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 554</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that it has been done previously, as did the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, compounds rather than excuses the offence. When the Lord Chancellor started to talk about gaps in the law, he made me think of a rather over-zealous dentist looking round the teeth of a patient to see whether any holes need stopping.
</p>

<a name="51108-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Thirdly, the lack of a definition in the original Bill worried me. It contained expressions such as &quot;likely to&quot;. The repetition of &quot;likely to&quot; in as little space as a single line made it too horrible a piece of legislation for me to wish to dwell on. I regard vagueness in legislation as asking for trouble. I hope that the Government, whatever else they may do, will not attempt to repeat phrases such as &quot;likely to&quot; in their next version of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51108-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>I turn to the last of my detailed points. If discussion is going to be stifled, does one stifle it everywhere or just in some places? Does one leave Members of either House of Parliament free to say whatever they want and to be reported however likely to disturb their words may be, or is it intended to stifle discussion in your Lordships&#039; House and another place?
</p>

<a name="51108-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>I conclude with this single comment: for a government&#151;even a government who see themselves as wholly secular&#151;to intrude and make criminal the expressions of opinion which were originally uttered or printed without any intention to provoke anybody is a monstrous intrusion and a piece of arrogance which I would find very hard to forgive. I await with some interest, and a little hope, the Minister&#039;s reply. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="51108-17_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </b>   My Lords, I have considerable sympathy with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Peyton of Yeovil, but I am going to be very careful in what I say for this simple reason: I do not want to say anything which is likely to make it more difficult to reach an agreement with the Government along the lines that were suggested earlier today. Therefore I will make only a couple of points. Firstly, one should not seek to define religion by Act of Parliament. The Human Rights Act 1998 did not do so; neither does the European Convention on Human Rights. If this definition were to be regarded as appropriate to theistic religions, it would not be regarded as appropriate to, for example, Buddhism. As I understand it, that is not a theistic religion. That may be a boring and technical reason, perhaps an important one, but it is one which anyone who has followed the Charities Bill will understand. The Government eventually changed the whole approach on the meaning of religion in the Charities Bill to make clear that it included non-theistic religions, especially Buddhism.

</p>

<a name="51108-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>That is beside the point, because the main point which the noble Lord makes is that one should only criminalise freedom of expression where, in his words, there is,


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>&quot;justifiable and immediate fear of violence.&quot;</p>

<a name="51108-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>That was the approach of Oliver Wendell Holmes, of Justice Brandeis and of Justice Cardozo in all the great American free speech cases. On one reading, it is also the approach under the European Convention on Human Rights. I have great sympathy for that point, and for limiting the scope of what we have to a justifiable and immediate fear of violence, or something resembling it. However, I believe that the amendments passed by your Lordships&#039; House in Committee strike a fair balance between freedom of expression, freedom of religion, the right to equal treatment without discrimination, a fair criminal process and the principle of legal certainty and proportionality, and so on.
</p>

<a name="51108-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>I hope that the Minister will respond fully to the important speech made this evening by the noble Lord, Lord Peyton. However, speaking for myself, were the House to divide and accept the amendment, it would make it that much more difficult to secure overall agreement within the principles&#151;and the three essential safeguards&#151;that your Lordships&#039; House has already approved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_149"></a>
<a name="51108-17_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Desai: </b>   My Lords, I am reminded of the remark recently made by Madonna; that Tom Cruise could do what he liked, even if he wants to worship a turtle. It does not bother her if some people worship turtles as superior beings. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, anticipated something that I wanted to say. This definition of religion certainly does not cover Buddhism, Sikhism or Jainism. None of those three belief systems would be covered by a belief either in God or in a supreme being. In the case of Sikhs, they might actually worship a book&#151;the <i>Guru Granth Sahib</i>&#151;or, in the Jain case, a number of gurus. If we are to have a definition of religion, and whether we do is a matter for the Government to choose, I would wish for the definition to be cast much wider than it currently is. Certainly, it should cover all religions.
</p>

<a name="51108-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>I was once asked by someone, in an application for the Charities Commission, whether I supported Scientology being a religion. Since I believe anything can be a religion, I said &quot;Yes&quot;. Therefore I wrote a definition that a religion was, more or less, a coherent set of inconsistent, irrational beliefs about the nature of the universe. The Scientologists objected to my definition and asked me to withdraw the letter in their support. But there is, possibly, some point in defining religion, provided we can do it broadly enough so that all religions can be covered by it.

<a name="51108-17_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   My Lords, I rise strongly to support my noble friend Lord Peyton of Yeovil, who made some important points. I think that even he would admit that it is difficult to find a perfect definition. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, reminded me that in the Charities Bill&#151;which we shall shortly be discussing&#151;the Government attempt to define religion. Clause 2(3) of that Bill states that religion is to include:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;(i) a religion which involves belief in more than one god, and (ii) a religion which does not involve belief in a god&quot;.</p>

<a name="51108-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>It is difficult to find the right definition, as my noble friend has conceded. But that in no way detracts from the valid points that he made in a commendably brief and remarkably succinct speech&#151;which, as I say, I strongly support. His reference to &quot;likely to&quot; was a particularly important intervention.
</p>

<a name="51108-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>I hope that my noble friend is wrong, and that the Minister does not still hanker after the old Bill. As I understand what she said earlier today, she is prepared, in a spirit of compromise, to accept the new infrastructure of the Bill&#151;which has been agreed by this House in Committee&#151;and will now seek ways in which to improve the wording. I hope she will be able to tell my noble friend that she accepts many of his points, and that they will be included as we deliberate on the best way forward. The noble Lords, Lord Desai and Lord Lester, are quite right. We must be mindful of those who so strongly believe in Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism and a number of other key religions. My noble friend admitted that we must proceed with the utmost caution. Yet it is important that his points are answered in this debate, and continue to be answered in the discussions which lie ahead.

I am to avoid piety and agreement in an egregious manner with members on the opposite Bench and still answer his questions. I hope to be able to do that in a way which satisfies him. The Deputy Chief Whip tells me that it would be almost a physical impossibility for a Home Office Minister, of whatever complexion, not to hanker after the old Bill. But I can tell your Lordships that it is a temptation which I find very easy to resist, because I am a total realist and pragmatist about where we now find ourselves.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>The most important thing now is to try to chart a way through this issue and bring consensus. I hope that I outlined clearly in my comments earlier today that we have accepted the construct and framework set out by the view expressed by the Committee when we dealt comprehensively with those matters. We are looking with a great deal of purposeful energy at how we can express better the freedom of expression criterion so that it does not do violence to our ability to prosecute these offences. It should honour the real concern which was expressed all around the House&#151;just as volubly, indeed, from our own Benches&#151;that freedom of expression has to be preserved and promoted in a way with which others will feel content. There are more difficulties, and I have set out what they are. My hope and aspiration is that we will be able to mediate a way through them to arrive at consensus. That is certainly what we&#151;each of us, as I understood it&#151;have set our minds to achieving. So I hope that in that sense we shall be able to satisfy noble Lords.
</p>

<a name="51108-17_para7"></a>

unnecessary. I am sure, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, made clear, that the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, accepts that his definition does not cover all the religions that are recognised as the major religions&#151;and Buddhism has been mentioned among others.
</p>

<a name="51108-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>I agree with what was said about the European Convention on Human Rights. The definition advocated in this amendment is not as comprehensive or rigorous as the approach to the meaning of religion adopted by the courts in relation to the convention. That approach requires a religion that contains a coherent set of beliefs. All those are things with which I believe that we probably agree&#151;and I know that the noble Lord&#039;s amendment is a very piercing probing amendment to ensure that I do not slip off the straight and narrow. I assure him that I know the direction of travel in which we shall have to go to settle this matter&#151;if it can be settled&#151;in a way that is honourable, fair and delivers what we would all wish to see.

<a name="51108-18_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, it might be helpful before we get into the detailed consideration of the Bill to make a short statement on the vote that was held on 12 October on Report. Your Lordships will recall that the House voted into the Bill an amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, which removed the control of the Minister for the Civil Service over the terms and conditions of the staff of the new Charity Commission, substituting a provision that would allow the commission to determine the remuneration of its staff subject to an overall remuneration budget agreed with the Treasury. The amended provision is now paragraph 5(3) to a new Schedule 1A to the Charities Act 1993, which appears at line 41 on page 80 of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51108-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>The Government have since had time to reflect and explore the effects and implications of that amendment. My understanding is that a significant effect of it may well be to remove from the Home Civil Service the staff of the new commission, with the exception of the chief executive, over whose terms and conditions ministerial control survives. That must in turn call into question the status of the commission under the amended Bill as a non-ministerial department. It was and remains the Government&#039;s intention that the staff of the new commission should be in the Home Civil Service, as the staff of the present charity commissioners are. I do not believe that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, intended by his amendment to remove the staff of the new Charity Commission from the Home Civil Service. Accordingly, the Government will consider what steps they can take in another place to ensure that the commission staff will continue to be in the Home Civil Service from the moment when the provisions converting the existing commissioners to the new commission take effect.

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>I apologise for returning to this issue on Third Reading, but since we last considered these matters the Government have produced their education White Paper, which in my view has changed the climate in which this debate takes place.


</p>

<a name="51108-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>The problem at heart is that the Government believe that the public schools&#151;including, for example, Eton and Harrow&#151;are charities. I ask myself, &quot;Who in the Government believes this nonsense?&quot;. In my 40 years&#039; membership of the Labour Party, I have never heard it argued that Eton is a charity. The public do not believe it, and neither do Labour MPs, as they will inevitably express in a few weeks when the Bill hits the House of Commons.
</p>

<a name="51108-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>The charitable status of public schools brings charity law into disrepute. The fee-paying schools desperately cling on to that status for the tax benefits. It is perfectly reasonable for public schools to have tax benefits because they reduce the pressure on public expenditure, but charity status is the wrong vehicle to use to provide those benefits. If the fee-paying schools want tax benefits, they should come under separate provisions in the Finance Act in return for providing public benefit. We should just take them out of the area of charity law. The Bill does not do that, though; it leaves it to the Charity Commission to decide their public benefit contribution.
</p>

<a name="51108-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>A Charity Commission that has left Eton, Harrow and other public schools as charities over the years has a question mark hanging over it. Indeed, during consideration in the Joint Committee, I asked around in the charitable sector why it was that the commission, in the view of some, was so timid. I did not like the reply, but I will put it to the House. I was <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_560"></a>

told that it was because the commission&#039;s management was riddled with people who have interests in private education for their own children, and they do not want to rock the boat.
</p>

<a name="51108-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>The truth is that I do not trust the judgment of the Charity Commission. They will duck the hard decisions on private education that are required, which brings me to my amendments. They are both about the need for political, parliamentary influence to be exerted on commission decisions in relation to fee-paying schools. Amendment No. 5 draws on the work of the Nathan committee, which made recommendations in 1950 about the future of charities. It recommended that the Charity Commission and the education Minister share responsibility for the charitable status of fee-paying schools, the reason being that the charitable, voluntary and endowed schools and the technically non-charitable LEA-maintained schools were part of the same national system. That position was written into the Charities Act 1960. As a result, until 1973, the Secretary of State for Education was charity commissioner for educational charities, and shared responsibility for those schools with the Charity Commission.
</p>

<a name="51108-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>In 1973, the government changed the law and removed that provision&#151;primarily, many believe, in order to emphasise that there should be two separate school systems: one of fee-paying education out of the reach government for some, and a free education under government supervision for the others. In retrospect, that was a significantly deliberate political Act of Parliament. In 1974, a change of government took place, and a Select Committee of the Commons unanimously recommended that fee-paying schools should retain their charitable status only if they could prove public benefit. That then became my party&#039;s policy.
</p>

<a name="51108-18_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>Today the Nathan principle is as compelling as it was in 1950 and 1960, and it is against that background that the Government, like their 19th-century predecessors, are seeking to create in their White Paper the concept of a national system of education that is more intact. I remind the House that, during the 19th century, governments of both parties assumed that fee-paying schools were part of the state system, and many committees and commissions were set up to keep a state system for education intact.
</p>

<a name="51108-18_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>Only yesterday the <i>Times</i> reported that a fee-paying charitable school in Liverpool was to become a maintained non-fee-paying school&#151;a healthy development. That school has decided to become part of the non-fee-paying state system. In the circumstances of the new policy, it is absurd that the Charity Commission, which has little educational expertise, should, with the courts as a longstop, be effectively the only arbiter of the place of new maintained schools in the state system.
</p>

<a name="51108-18_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>Nathan was absolutely right: whatever the status of schools, the Secretary of State responsible for the national system of education should be given reasonable purchase on the shape, framework and operation of a new developing state system. My <br>&nbsp;<br>

amendment would restore the shared responsibility between government and the Charity Commission that existed before 1973. I believe that my argument in this regard is compelling, and if your Lordships do not recognise that, I hope that the Commons does when it comes to consider these matters.
</p>

<a name="51108-18_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>Amendment No. 1 concerns the height of the public benefit hurdle that fee-paying schools will be compelled to surmount if they wish to maintain their charitable status. The issue has been well rehearsed in previous stages, and I do not want to go down that route. The Government&#039;s brief, for which my noble friend is required to argue, has been unconvincing. It is an immensely political issue, and one that dominates debates on education in our party. Many obvious and genuine charities resent their charitable status being entangled by the Government with that of Eton, Harrow and the other fee-paying schools.
</p>

<a name="51108-18_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>The proposition that this criterion should simply be left to a quango&#151;the Charity Commission&#151;and the courts, bodies whose individual members cannot be considered disinterested parties in the light of their personal commitment to private education, is offensive. Decisions about the nature of public benefit should be enshrined in statute by Parliament, particularly by the elected House of Commons. If the latter amendment does not appeal to your Lordships, I hope that the Commons will see the sense of it. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="51108-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market: </b>   My Lords, as in previous debates on this subject on this Bill, I declare an interest as the deputy chairman of the Association of Governing Bodies of Independent Schools. We have already discussed at some length the position of independent schools, and I do not intend to go over the previous ground in any detail. The only way I will follow the noble Lord is in being as brief as I can about the issues.
</p>

<a name="51108-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>I strongly disagree with the noble Lord about the value of charitable status and the way that independent schools look at it. He put particular emphasis on the financial benefits. The tax benefits amount to something like &#163;100 million a year. In past debates I have gone into rather greater detail about the financial aspects, but suffice it to say that, if one takes into account all the other aspects, broadly speaking, the independent schools contribute twenty times that to education as a whole and to the public good. So one may well ask, &quot;Why put such emphasis on the financial benefits?&quot;.
</p>

<a name="51108-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>The noble Lord conceded the financial benefit point and suggested that this could best be dealt with in a Finance Bill. We have debated this in Committee, and he knows as well as I do that that is no commitment. It would perhaps be an inappropriate place to deal with the issue. Given the nature of the problems facing the Chancellor with his fiscal deficit, I doubt whether it would happen. We cannot go down that route.
</p>

<a name="51108-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>There is another point. If the financial benefits seem to go the other way, why does the independent sector value charitable status so much? There are two basic <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_562"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 562</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reasons. It has a strong sense of public good, and charitable status underlines that. There is another practical problem. If charitable status is lost, there would be difficulties regarding all the assets that belong to independent schools. That would threaten the whole nature of independent schools. I wish that the noble Lord had not talked only about Eton and Harrow. I could have talked about a much wider range of independent schools that make a major contribution to public benefit&#151;indeed a substantial proportion of pupils now attending independent schools receive some form of bursary help.
</p>

<a name="51108-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>That leads me on to my second point about public benefits. I want to underline the fact that the independent schools entirely accept the position in the Bill about public benefit. Increasingly over the past 10 years, more and more has been done by the schools to provide public benefit in all sorts of ways. I have elaborated on those before and do not intend to do so now. They take the matter very seriously.
</p>

<a name="51108-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>I have two reasons for speaking against the amendments, and they follow the general principles that have run through our debates on the Bill. First, we have constantly emphasised&#151;in relation not just to this sector but to all charities&#151;the importance of flexibility in defining public benefit, as social needs and conditions change. That is best preserved as it is in the Bill. Secondly, we have stressed above all the independence of the commission. We have resisted setting out detailed definitions of public benefit in the Bill, and we should not therefore legislate for a Secretary of State&#039;s direction on one charitable activity alone for that one sector. Those two principles are undermined by the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51108-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>Ministers have rightly insisted on those principles throughout our debates. As this is possibly my last contribution to the Bill, I would like to pay tribute to the Minister, my noble friend Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts and the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, for the way in which they have conducted the passage of the Bill. It has been a model of how the House of Lords can contribute greatly to the legislative process. The Minister has been superb in the way he has listened to the debates and dealt with points and as a result the Bill is greatly strengthened.
</p>

<a name="51108-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>I agree with the two principles that Ministers have insisted on in the Bill, and I hope that we shall stick with them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="51108-19_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, before I contribute I declare an interest, as this debate concerns independent schools. I have previously declared my interest as a governor of Shrewsbury School, one of the great public schools of the Public Schools Act 1868.
</p>

<a name="51108-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>The general issue has been discussed many times, most notably at our last meeting on a slightly broader amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, which was tested in the House and was not successful. I continue to support the Government. They have reached a delicate balance&#151;not a fudge&#151;on the issue. It stands on three pillars. First, we are all agreed on the need for an independent Charity Commission. The <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_563"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 563</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government have done much to buttress that independence particularly with new sub-section (4) in Clause 6. We made a further buttressing change&#151;I know that the Minister did not like it&#151;on the last occasion to paragraph 5(3) of Schedule 1. We have made the Charity Commission as independent as we can. That is the first leg.
</p>

<a name="51108-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>The second leg is that this independent body has responsibility for establishing and enforcing the public benefit, and there is the requirement that there is proper consultation in Clause 4(4). It has a playing field to work on&#151;and a level playing field at that. It is unfair of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, to say that commission members will duck hard decisions before they have even set out down the road. He says they have little educational experience. We are talking about a range of charities here. He is over-harsh.
<a name="time_16"></a>
<a name="51108-19_time0"></a><h5>6.45 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="51108-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>The third leg is that we require the public benefit test to be complied with continuously and not just at the commencement of a charity&#039;s life. A level playing field has been established. In his first amendment, the noble Lord wants to reach down and tilt that playing field in respect of one narrow subsection that has caught his eye&#151;or should I say &quot;his ire&quot;?
</p>

<a name="51108-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>The second amendment shows precisely why, we believe, the Charity Commission should be completely independent and free from political interference of whatever kind. I accept that the noble Lord&#039;s remarks would fit into a debate on education policy rather than a debate on charities. They do not belong to the issues that we are discussing tonight. With the help of the Government and with amendments from the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, and from us we have got the Charity Commission in an independent and strong position. I hope that the Government will stand firm and reject the amendment. 
</p>




<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="51108-19_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, when I heard the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market, congratulate the Government on their handling of the Bill, I was going to say, &quot;No wonder. They have not laid a glove on his beloved independent schools&quot;. Then he went on to say how much I had contributed, and I would not now think of making such a remark.
</p>

<a name="51108-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>There has been&#151;I will use the word&#151;a &quot;fudge&quot; over the issue in the Bill. I have twice proposed an amendment of the purest moderation that would have required the Charity Commission to have regard to the effect on access to independent schools in its consultations and considerations, particularly in respect to their fee-charging structure.
</p>

<a name="51108-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>I am not going to agree with the noble Lord who has tabled the two amendments. Hereafter I am going to hoist the Government with their own petard. Their constant refrain to my amendment was: &quot;It&#039;s not necessary, old boy. It&#039;s all there, and of course the Charity Commission will do precisely as your amendment would have them do&quot;. There will be extremely close scrutiny from some quarters to see whether the commission does that.

</p>

<a name="51108-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>I am particularly dissatisfied with the amendments as tabled. The noble Lord, Lord Corbett, and I served on the joint scrutiny committee, and its members were very unhappy with the formulation on public interest. The noble Lord has made some fair points on that matter.

</p>

<a name="51108-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>The reason that I do not support him is that he remarked that he did not trust the Charity Commission. I certainly do not trust Secretaries of State from one party to the next to issue directions on this sensitive issue. We could have a zig-zag course as we have had over central policies over decades between the two main parties and, who knows, my own party. I find the notion that a Secretary of State can simply weigh in and give directions on management and other matters very unsatisfactory, more unsatisfactory than leaving the matter to the Charity Commission in whom I have more faith than the noble Lord. He was wrong in saying that commission members had no educational experience; they have a lot by now. It is true that they took over educational charities only 20 or 25 years ago, but they have a lot of experience. They will have to engage people with the necessary experience in order to undertake the consultation that is cast upon them under the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51108-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>I sit down an unhappy man, but one who will look closely at what happens, particularly if we have been sold a pup by the independent schools. We all talk about them as if they were a single monolithic group; they are not. We have heard here and in Committee from the best of them&#151;the high master of Manchester Grammar School, Jonathan Shephard of the Independent Schools Council. They genuinely, I have no doubt, want to pursue the public interest path, and they have done that&#151;admittedly, under the prospect of legislation of which they were wary. If it is the case that, once they have the Bill more or less in the shape that they want, they rest on their oars and the schools that have done nothing thus far do even less tomorrow, we will have cause to question our deliberations on this part of the Bill and we should return to the issue and seek to do something about it.

<p><a name="st_167"></a>
<a name="51108-20_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I first thank the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market, for his kind comments about us all. Rather like the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, I was thinking, &quot;Well, yes, perhaps the noble Lord would say that, wouldn&#039;t he?&quot;. The generosity of his view is well meant, and we have tried hard to make this as consensual a process as possible. That is not to say that we always agree on things and, in a sense, the amendment throws light on an area where there has been some considerable disagreement&#151;properly so, because it is a difficult <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_565"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 565</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

debate where many trenchant views are expressed. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, put his view well, eloquently and forcefully&#151;and rightly so.
</p>

<a name="51108-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>That reaches the core of an important issue. It has certainly been the case, as several noble Lords have said, that one of the strong themes regarding the future of the Charity Commission is a desire to ensure that it is independent from the Government. There may be some difficulties about the formulation, as expressed in the amendment, to which I referred, and some work will need to be undertaken to see what can best be done about that position.
</p>

<a name="51108-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>It is undoubtedly the clear will of your Lordships&#039; House and of the Government that the commission&#039;s independence has been firmly established by statute and is highly desirable. As other noble Lords have said, the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, are entirely at odds with that overall theme, because they clearly state that the directions or guidance be issued by the Secretary of State, rather than the Charity Commission itself, which we can fairly trust to be of independent mind. I heard what my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours said about it being an organisation that was, I think he said, &quot;riddled&quot; with people sympathetic to public schools. That is rather a harsh judgment and is unfair. In my experience, the Charity Commission takes a powerful, independent and professional view. I do not believe that personal views come into the way that it operates in the manner that the noble Lord&#039;s comment suggested. I know that those were not his own views; he was reflecting on something that others had said.
</p>

<a name="51108-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>In considering whether or not an organisation meets the public benefit test, the commission should, and will, as the Bill is drafted, act in an independent manner. The idea that a government Minister should give directions about whether a charity in a particular class meets the public benefit requirement is unacceptable and should be unacceptable in the framework that we have set out. It would undermine the notion of a credible independent commission and undermine the principle that charitable status is decided objectively under the law.
</p>

<a name="51108-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>It has been said before&#151;it is the Government&#039;s view&#151;that existing and proposed charities should be subject to examination by the commission of their public benefit credentials on the basis of a public benefit requirement established under the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, raised the issue that he put in earlier amendments of whether the charging of a fee would be taken into consideration in terms of access and so on to demonstrate public benefit. We take the firm view that that is a proper consideration, and no doubt the commission will reflect that in the way that it publishes its guidance and how it clarifies the public benefit test.
</p>

<a name="51108-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>The commission has said that it is able to apply the current law under the existing framework, as amended by the Bill, by removal of the presumption of public benefit that religious education and poverty relief charities currently enjoy. The commission has already published illustrative guidance on public benefit and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_566"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 566</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on how it intends to go forward with guidance and the application of the law, once the Bill is enacted. It will apply to all organisations that aspire to charitable status and to existing registered charities. Independent schools will be no exception to that. Some of them might not meet the public benefit requirement, but there is no justification for singling them out, or any other class of charity, for the purposes of ensuring that the commission must have regard to ministerial directions or guidance when it considers their public benefit. Nor is there any justification for allowing the Secretary of State, as my noble friend&#039;s Amendment No. 5 would appear to envisage, to intervene in the commission&#039;s regulatory supervision of charitable independent schools.
</p>

<a name="51108-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>In summary, there is nothing that attracts us to either of my noble friend&#039;s amendments or that is justified. On reflection, I thought that he gave us an interesting historical introduction, and I have little doubt that there will be a debate on the subject in another place.

That is why nothing is changing. The political decision is to be found in the debate that surrounds the introduction of the Education Act 1973, which transferred the entire responsibility in these areas from the Secretary of State to the commission.

<p><a name="st_172"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I hope that I can move this amendment speedily. This is the same amendment as I advanced in Committee and on Report. For those noble Lords who want the reference, we last debated it on 12 October, as reported at cols. 321 and 322 of <i>Hansard</i>. The point of the amendment is to make it easy and smooth for a CASC&#151;a community amateur sports club&#151;to register as a charity without having first to dissolve and then reform as a new charity.
</p>

<a name="51108-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>The argument that the Minister advanced against that on the previous occasion was twofold. He admitted that the amendment would smooth the transition from a CASC to a charity, as indeed it will. But the objections were, first, that there could be a tax charge on a charity becoming a community amateur sports club, and, secondly, that that would therefore create practical difficulties for a charity that follows that route.
</p>

<a name="51108-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>My amendment covers only the route I indicated: a CASC wanting to become a charity. It does not affect a charity which would become a CASC. Indeed, for a charity to become a CASC would be an odd thing to happen in any event but to do it&#151;and the Minister was right&#151;it would have to wind itself up; the disposal of its assets would not be liable to tax; it would have to dispose of its net assets for charitable purposes, and that would not, or might not, allow it to transfer all its assets to the new CASC. If it did, the assets would have to be ring-fenced so that they could be used only for charitable purposes by the CASC.
</p>

<a name="51108-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>This amendment will not affect many CASCs because most of them will not want to become charities. The main category of CASCs that might want to become charities are those who want to get major grants from those grant-making bodies that can only make grants to registered charities. That might induce a CASC to seek that new and slightly different status. I beg to move.

<a name="51108-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>Under the amendment, a club registered with the Charity Commission cannot be a CASC or become one. The effect of the amendment is that every time a charitable club moves towards, and attempts to assume, CASC status it is pulled back into charity by the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, which provides that, as a charity, it ceases automatically to be a CASC. So in order for a charity to become a CASC it would need to cease to be a charity first, so that there was a gap in time between its ceasing to be a charity and its subsequent assumption of CASC status. That would enable it to enter CASC territory as a non-charity.
</p>

<a name="51108-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>The problem is that, at the point at which it ceased to be a charity, a deemed disposal of assets for capital gains tax purposes would occur, with an associated tax charge that arises because, at that point, the club is not yet sheltered by the tax reliefs available to CASCs.

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>I appreciate that it is somewhat hard to follow. I find it hard to trace too, but it explains why, although there is an attraction to the amendment, it would be unworkable in practice. It is for that reason alone that we continue with our resistance.

<a name="51108-21_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, I understand what the Minister is driving at here and I do not want to strike a sour note at this hour. I am concerned about how one decides what are &quot;appropriate cases&quot;. My original objective in pressing for the inclusion of the desirability of facilitating innovation was to ensure that the Charity Commission, with its new role and powers, did not put the voluntary sector into an unnecessary straitjacket. As I have said several times in the past, regulation is by its very nature risk averse&#151;I have been a regulator in the City myself and I know how quickly one becomes risk averse. By contrast, the voluntary sector needs to be flexible and innovative to meet the needs of our rapidly changing society.
</p>

<a name="51108-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>It is interesting that the Better Regulation Task Force has just produced a booklet called <i>Better Regulation for Civil Society: Making life easier for those who help others</i>. Page 20, which is about social innovation, says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;Regulation is often based on standard service models and can therefore threaten social innovation by those VCOs that provide innovative services, for example to people with complex and multiple needs that other organisations frequently cannot meet. For example, social care is regulated because of market failure. This means that people receiving social care often have imperfect information on what care is available and its quality. They also have little purchasing power to exercise choice. It would clearly be unwelcome if some kind of &#039;one-size-fits-all&#039; social care regulation were to prevent VCOs from developing and providing innovative care and greater choice.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>That is the sort of thing that I was concerned about. With the original clause, I did not think that risk-averse box-ticking would prevail over the need to think creatively. With these slightly weasel words &quot;appropriate cases&quot;&#151;who decides it?&#151;I am not so sure. So although I understand what the Minister is driving at, I would like him to reassure me further about how this subsection will be exercised.
</p>




<p><a name="st_178"></a>
<a name="51108-21_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, by contrast, I am delighted with the amendment and grateful to the Government. I would like to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, that actually this prevents what he fears&#151;that is to say the one-size-fits-all approach. There are classes of charity that are not about innovation at all, for example, almshouses, which I mentioned last time&#151;there are a lot of categories. I think this is useful and I hope that the Minister will reassure the noble Lord.
</p>




<p><a name="st_179"></a>
<a name="51108-21_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I hope that I can reassure the noble Lord. I am rather surprised that he has raised the issue in the way in which he has. What we have tried to do&#151;unusually with this piece of legislation&#151;is be more flexible, imaginative and focused. It should work where it is appropriate; that is what we are after.

this clause will be applied sensibly and that the Charity Commission will have listened to what the noble Lord said&#151;and to all of us who have been involved in the debates on this issue&#151;and will take very careful note. We do not want it to go wrong.

&quot;7.      In performing its regulatory functions the Commission must act fairly and reasonably, and with regard to the interests of charity beneficiaries and other people who are stakeholders in charities.&quot;

<p><a name="st_181"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I start by thanking the Minister and the chairman of the Charity Commission for their letters, which have been most helpful. The purpose of the amendment is to require on the face of the Bill that the Charity Commission must act at all times, when regulating charities, in a manner which is fair and reasonable and to require the commission to have regard to the interests of the people involved in charities, with particular emphasis on the beneficiaries, as well as a charity&#039;s material assets, which, as far as I can see, is all that is covered under the 1993 Act.
</p>

<a name="51108-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>The requirement for fair and reasonable behaviour by the commission has had much support within the House, and many of your Lordships have said that they want these words in the Bill. The reasons given so far by the Government for not accepting the amendment, or a similar one, appear both surprising and difficult to understand. The issue identified by the Minister on 12 October<i>&#151;</i>that is, that the commission,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;would not change its behaviour as a result of the addition of these words, and so the amendment would have no practical effect&quot;&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 12/10/05; col. 335.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>is not one that the amendment seeks to address. There are two issues of importance which it does seek to address. The first, critically, as the noble Lords, Lord Phillips of Sudbury and Lord Dahrendorf, and others have argued, is that it is the perceptions and concerns of charities&#151;especially the smaller ones, whose activities have been seriously adversely affected by commission regulatory conduct in the past&#151;that need to be addressed.
</p>

<a name="51108-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>The second issue relates to the High Court judge&#039;s ruling in the Little Gidding Trust case, where the judge, on grounds of shortening the hearing, ruled that he would not take into account whether the commissioners had acted fairly and reasonably in the making of the orders which were the subject of trustee appeal on grounds that the commission had acted with bias, unfairness and unreasonableness in the making of them.
</p>

<a name="51108-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>It is not sufficient for the Minister to attempt to deal with this case law precedent by saying that he understands that the judge so ruled in order to shorten the hearing. Had the Charities Act 1993 placed upon the commission a specific duty to act fairly and reasonably, the judge would have been obliged to take into account the grounds of the appeal and how the commission had acted. I took part in debates on the Bill that produced that Act. Such a measure was not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_571"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 571</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

considered necessary at that time but, in my view, it is obviously necessary now when taking into account the Charity Commission&#039;s behaviour, as I have described to your Lordships.
</p>

<a name="51108-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>When, on 12 October, we last debated the issue of the commission&#039;s duty towards a charity&#039;s people, the Minister said several things&#151;at col. 342 of the <i>Official Report</i>. He said that this amendment was unnecessary because it was not possible for the commission to comply with the new objective, which requires the commission to promote the effective use of charitable resources without taking into account the needs of beneficiaries. He suggested that the commission&#039;s new duty to increase public trust and confidence in charities would require it to take account of a charity&#039;s stakeholders. Such conclusions seem to me to be extremely tenuous and difficult to support from the wording on the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51108-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>The Minister further suggested that the commission&#039;s new customer network consultative group will influence the commission to take account of charity people. The requirement on the commission to be accountable and transparent, even if it takes customer service seriously with its new feedback group, has nothing to do with the need to stop the commission occasionally acting in a cavalier and damaging way towards a charity&#039;s people. A hand-picked feedback group addressing a commission agenda can, and will, be ignored.
</p>

<a name="51108-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>Finally, the Minister referred to the commission&#039;s duty to be accountable. A government agency may be transparent and accountable in a general way to a Minister or Parliament but still sometimes do outrageous things in individual cases to the organisations and people that it regulates without being accountable to them for its actions.
</p>

<a name="51108-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>The Minister&#039;s claims are too general. He refers to the general behaviour of the commission in its broad role. Some of the commission&#039;s past behaviour can give no confidence that that is sufficient. There is a real need to focus the minds of the commission&#039;s staff on an unequivocal statement that they are required to take account of the people and be fair and reasonable when they are pulling a charity apart.
</p>

<a name="51108-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>Is the Minister perhaps afraid that some downtrodden trustee or beneficiary might successfully sue the commission? Offering the ethereal accountability of the commission to the state is totally inadequate. What is needed is accountability to the individual through the courts, and this amendment will help to provide it.
</p>

<a name="51108-21_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>The charity sector remains founded on morality, and charities expect standards of regulation likewise founded on a moral bedrock of decency. The commission&#039;s behaviour has not always met this high standard, and it is necessary that it should meet it and be seen to meet it. I beg to move.

<a name="column_572"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 572</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

amendment seeks to bring together two separate amendments that he tabled previously. The first part concerns a duty for the commission in performing its regulatory functions to act &quot;fairly and reasonably&quot;, and the second concerns a requirement for the commission to have regard to the interests of beneficiaries and other stakeholders.
</p>

<a name="51108-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>We have discussed the &quot;fair and reasonable&quot; part of the amendment on five separate occasions and I feel slightly shamefaced in offering the same argument. Nevertheless, it remains the case that we consider that part of it to be unnecessary because the Charity Commission has always recognised that it has a duty to act in a fair and reasonable way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_183"></a>
<a name="51108-22_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord but he will be interested to know that when I visited the Charity Commission this morning, it had in its reception area free postcards. On them, in very large print, was the word &quot;Fair&quot;, so perhaps the noble Lord&#039;s amendment is not so unnecessary after all.
</p>




<p><a name="st_184"></a>
<a name="51108-22_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, presumably, it does not have the word &quot;reasonably&quot; on another postcard. That is very good.
</p>

<a name="51108-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>For the benefit of those who have not heard the Government&#039;s position before, I will place it on the record. We completely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, that the commission should act in a fair and reasonable way. We listened to the views expressed in the House on previous occasions and were moved to include a duty on the commission to have regard to the principles of best regulatory practice when performing its functions, so far as relevant. Those principles are set out in the Bill for the avoidance of doubt. They are that regulatory activity should be proportionate, accountable, consistent and transparent and should be targeted only at cases in which action is needed. In our view, those words express more than adequately the concept of fairness.
</p>

<a name="51108-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>I repeat the assurance that I gave on previous occasions that we are under no doubt that the commission is under a duty in administrative law to use its powers reasonably. If Parliament thought it necessary to give the Charity Commission this duty, as I have said in the past, the implication taken would be that the commission did not have the duty at present, but I do not think that that can be argued to be the case. The commission is fully aware that it already has this duty&#151;it has a postcard. On Report, the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, himself said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;Many noble Lords, like me, believe these words need to be placed on the face of the Bill because the commission has not always behaved in that way&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 12/10/05; col. 331.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>As the commission is already sure that it has such a duty, and as the principles of best regulatory practice are now in the Bill, we do not think that the amendment would have any practical effect on the commission&#039;s behaviour. If the noble Lord believes that the commission has acted unfairly and unreasonably in any case, then I argue that this is not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_573"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 573</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the way to rectify that. The Charity Commission&#039;s own internal complaints procedure, the Independent Complaints Reviewer and the Parliamentary Ombudsman are already the routes through which charities may challenge the commission on grounds of maladministration. While touching on that, it is perhaps worth reminding the House of the recent annual report produced by the Independent Complaints Reviewer, who received and considered only 32 complaints in 2004, covering 110 individual allegations of maladministration, 86 per cent of which were not upheld.
</p>

<a name="51108-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>I turn again to the noble Lord&#039;s suggestion that the commission must have regard to charities&#039; beneficiaries and other stakeholders, which we have also debated previously. The commission already has a general object, contained in Section 1(4) of the Charities Act 1993, to:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;act in the case of any charity . . . as best to promote and make effective the work of the charity in meeting the needs designated by its trusts&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>This means the needs of the beneficiaries. A quick glance at the commission&#039;s new objectives in the Bill should also show that the interests of beneficiaries sit at the heart of the commission&#039;s work. The fifth objective requires the commission to enhance the accountability of charities to beneficiaries. The fourth objective requires the commission to promote the effective use of charitable resources, which will result in charities being able to help their beneficiaries in the most effective way.
</p>

<a name="51108-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>I mentioned earlier that the second part of the noble Lord&#039;s amendment is harmful and unacceptable. It suggests that the commission should have equal regard to a range of unspecified stakeholders in charities as to the interests of beneficiaries. That cannot be right. Charities, after all, exist to serve their beneficiaries, and the commission as regulator is ultimately there to protect the interests of current and future beneficiaries of charities. If there was a situation, for example, in which a charity&#039;s beneficiaries and the charity&#039;s staff had conflicting interests, then it would be right for the commission to have the interests of the beneficiaries at the heart of its considerations and whatever it undertook to do. This amendment would seem to require the commission to give equal weight to promoting interests of other people with a stake in the charity. This would represent a fundamental change in the role of the commission, one which is not at all desirable.
</p>

<a name="51108-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>I can understand why the noble Lord tabled the amendment. We strongly believe that, while the first part is unnecessary, the second is unacceptable. For these reasons, despite his admirable persistence, I cannot find favour with the noble Lord&#039;s amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_185"></a>
<a name="51108-22_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Swinfen: </b>   My Lords, the Minister says that the first part of the amendment is unnecessary. It may be. It should be. He makes me think, however, of the situation in a mine where the managers put safety precautions in place, but the people at the coalface do not follow them because they are intent on producing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_574"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 574</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

as much coal as they can, in order to increase their bonuses. I may be being unfair to the mining industry, but I am using it as an example.
</p>

<a name="51108-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>I am sure that the people at the top of the Charity Commission wish to be seen to be acting in a fair and reasonable manner. As I have pointed out on numerous occasions&#151;the Minister says five; I have lost count, myself&#151;there have been numerous instances in which they have not acted in a fair and reasonable manner. However, the main effect of this amendment would be that they would be fair and reasonable to charity beneficiaries. I appreciate that adding:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_7"></a><br>
2A   THE CHARITY INDEPENDENT COMPLAINTS REVIEWER

<br>
(1)   There shall be a complaints reviewer to be known as the Charity Independent Complaints Reviewer (in this Act referred to as &quot;the Reviewer&quot;).


<br>
(2)   The function of the Reviewer will be to investigate complaints against the Charity Commission&#039;s performance of its regulatory role and where appropriate make financial awards of compensation against the Charity Commisison, whether limited consolatory payments or unlimited payments for financial loss, and make recommendations.


<br>
(3)   Except where the Reviewer finds the complainant has acted frivolously, vexatiously or unreasonably, the complainant shall not be required to pay any part of the costs of the investigation.


<br>
(4)   No complainant shall be required to use an internal complaints procedure of the Charity Commission, the Ombudsman or the courts before the Reviewer will consider the case and any consideration by the Reviewer will not prevent the case subsequently being considered by the Ombudsman or the courts.


<br>
(5)   The Reviewer shall be appointed by the Lord Chancellor on such other terms as he, after consultation, shall think fit.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_187"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of this amendment is to set the existing Independent Complaints Reviewer on a statutory footing, who is at present appointed by the Charity Commission to look at complaints against itself, with the following significant alterations to the current arrangements: first, to allow the reviewer the power to award <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_575"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 575</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

financial compensation, instead of merely being able to recommend it; secondly, to allow the reviewer to award compensation to a complainant for financial loss arising from a failure by the Charity Commission, as well as the existing consolatory payments for maladministration; thirdly, to minimise delay in assessing the reviewer by not requiring that the complainant use the Charity Commission&#039;s internal complaints procedure first. Together, these changes will bring about a genuinely independent statutory alternative dispute resolution procedure, which will provide an alternative to the High Court as a route to access justice by charities, trustees and others.
</p>

<a name="51108-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>The reason for this amendment is to create a truly independent mechanism for charities, trustees and others to be able to challenge the Charity Commission when they think it is guilty of maladministration or acting unfairly, unreasonably or disproportionately, and to obtain financial compensation for maladministration and financial loss. At present, the Independent Complaints Reviewer is a creature of the commission, which may be ignored if the commission so chooses. By requiring the ICR not to take cases until they have been through the commission&#039;s own complaints procedure, the commission has been able to use the complaints and the ICR process as a mechanism of delay&#151;in one case, I am told, in excess of five years.
</p>

<a name="51108-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>The ICR is forbidden to even recommend to the commission the payment of compensation where a charity has suffered real loss as a result of the commission&#039;s unfair, unreasonable or disproportionate behaviour. The ombudsman routinely refuses to take up cases where there is still the legal possibility of pursuing the commission through the courts. As we all know, this is a ruinously expensive process for charities and trustees, who have no recourse to legal aid.
</p>

<a name="51108-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>I understand from a letter that the Charity Commission sent to me when I asked how often it had paid compensation that, once, the expenses of Lincoln County Council for Voluntary Services&#151;about &#163;3,500 plus VAT&#151;were paid by the Charity Commission. Another case was pointed out to me where a receiver and manager was appointed on a contingency basis. As the charity had no cash assets at the time, an indemnity was offered. The costs, however, were eventually met by the charity. So, in fact, there is only one occasion when the Charity Commission has paid out of its own pockets.
</p>

<a name="51108-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>In answering this proposal, the Minister drew comparisons between the advantages of the ombudsman and the proposed ICR, concluding that, on the whole, the ombudsman route is advantageous. I do not doubt that it is, but it is rarely available to charities in practice. In replying to the amendment on 12 October, as reported at col. 382 of <i>Hansard</i>, the Minister drew attention to the fact that the Parliamentary Ombudsman can deal with commission maladministration and can recommend financial compensation for real losses. Since the introduction of the Charities Act 1993, the Parliamentary Ombudsman has investigated only eight complaints <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_576"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 576</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

about the commission&#039;s conduct, upholding three of them and recommending financial compensation in two cases. For most complainants, his door has been firmly closed.
</p>

<a name="51108-22_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>The Minister may be right when he suggests, at col. 381, that the Parliamentary Ombudsman could do financially better for a charity or trustee than a statutory ICR. There are other reasons, however, for having a statutory ICR beyond financial compensation. It would have, and be seen to have, independence from the commission, would be likely to provide a quicker turnaround of complainants and would have greater experience of charities and the commission. At the moment, it looks to me as though we have a prosecutor, jury and judge all rolled into one. I beg to move.

<a name="51108-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, deserves considerable praise for his tenacity over his attempts to get a more practical and effectual remedy for those who feel hard done by by the Charity Commission. In the course of the debates, we have talked at length about the different layers of remedy and the fact that the Parliamentary ombudsman is a more available source of recompense and assistance than perhaps had been thought. Although this House has done well on many aspects of the Bill, this one has not received the focus that it deserves. In responding, will the Minister assure the House that the Charity commission will at least put out a new, simple, revised leaflet for those who want to make complaints, which tells them exactly where they may go and what they may do? That would help, because there is plainly a lot of misunderstanding about the extent and availability of the existing remedies.
</p>




<p><a name="st_189"></a>
<a name="51108-23_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I have listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, in the many debates on this matter and read again the debate on Report. I appreciate not only his tenacity but that the noble Lord feels very strongly about this matter. We do not want to deny people a way of challenging the commission when they feel that it has not acted properly, misled them, or given them advice that led them to make decisions that they would not otherwise have made. There must always be a proper way of challenging the commission. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has been one of the drivers behind the creation of a tribunal to ensure that there is a more accessible form of redress. I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, about the need to ensure that there is proper and adequate information about the means of redress. I shall certainly speak again with the commission officials to that point because the information needs to be not only in leaflet form, but on the website and the various other means in which it can be communicated.
</p>

<a name="51108-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, was concerned about three main issues regarding the existing arrangements. The first was the delay in accessing the ICR or the ombudsman because of, in the case of the ICR, the need to go through the commission&#039;s internal <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_577"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 577</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

complaints procedure, and in the case of the ombudsman, the need to go through an MP. In relation to that, he also said that the ombudsman routinely refuses to investigate cases where there is the possibility of High Court redress&#151;a point that he repeated in his latest remarks.
</p>

<a name="51108-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>The second main issue that the noble Lord raised was the need for a power to award compensation as well as consolatory payments, and the third issue was the independence of the reviewer from the Charity Commission. We do not accept that the current system involves an unacceptable delay to complainants. Under the current arrangements, complainants are asked to raise their complaint with the commission in the first instance before taking their complaint to the existing ICR if still dissatisfied. It is good practice that departments have the chance to respond to complainants themselves in the first instance. The Charity Commission&#039;s customer service team dealt with 103 complaints in the year 2004&#150;05. In the same period, the ICR received 32 complaints. Clearly, many of those who were dissatisfied with the commission&#039;s standards of service were satisfied by the commission&#039;s response to their complaint when they first raised their complaint with the commission. It is right that the ICR is there for those complainants who are not satisfied with the initial response from the commission. We are not aware of any evidence that this system is unacceptable to complainants or that there is real feeling that the commission&#039;s internal complaints procedure is a barrier to access to the ICR.
</p>

<a name="51108-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>At Report stage on 12 October the noble Lord also expressed concern that in order to access the ombudsman a complainant has to go through his or her Member of Parliament. Again, we are not aware of any evidence that this is a problem in practice, as confirmed by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, during our Report stage debate. While it is absolutely fair that those with a real cause for concern have easy access to the ombudsman, it is important that only genuine cases reach the ombudsman. The noble Lord also mentioned the need in some circumstances for charities to obtain a certificate from the commission before going to court, the cost to charities of going to court and the difficulties charities have of representing themselves against the Attorney-General. He doubted that such arrangements make for easy access to justice.
</p>

<a name="51108-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>We must distinguish between the differing roles and remit of the court and of the ombudsman. The court looks at legal decisions of the commission. We have some sympathy with the concerns of the noble Lord about the difficulties of challenging the commission in the High Court. That is why we are setting up the Charity Appeal Tribunal, in order to make challenging the commission&#039;s legal decisions easier. However, this is a separate issue from complaints about the commission on the grounds of poor service or maladministration. The ombudsman looks at maladministration, not legal decisions. The ombudsman would be able to look at any maladministration of the commission even in a case which had been decided by a court or a tribunal on a point of law. As the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said last <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_578"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 578</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

time, there is no need for High Court remedies to have been exhausted in order for the ombudsman to get involved. However, if legal action had been commenced, the ombudsman would not intervene while it was in train.
</p>

<a name="51108-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>The second issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, when moving his amendment on Report was the need for a power to award compensation as well as consolatory payments. I said in our debate on that occasion that the ombudsman can recommend any level of redress if the complainant has evidence to show that he or she has experienced quantifiable financial loss directly as a result of the commission&#039;s maladministration and I gave an example to demonstrate that this does happen in practice. As it turned out, on the day of our debate, the ombudsman recommended financial redress of &#163;100,000 in a particular case.
</p>

<a name="51108-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>We do not see any need to duplicate this existing power by setting up a second body for that purpose and I note that the proposed statutory ICR in this amendment would have the power actually to make financial awards. I am not sure how that would work unless the ICR had a budget comprised of public funds. We think that the current arrangements&#151;whereby the ombudsman recommends payments and the departments pay out of their own funds&#151;works and does not need change. If the commission chose to ignore a recommendation of the ombudsman to provide compensation, the ombudsman would refer the commission to the Select Committee on Public Administration, so there is a strong incentive for departments to make the payments recommended by the ombudsman.
</p>

<a name="51108-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>The final point which concerned the noble Lord was the need for a reviewer who is independent of the commission. The ICR is indeed appointed by the commission. However, in common with other similar offices, her terms of reference underline her independence and authority. In addition, there is no evidence that in practice the ICR can be shown to act in a way which is not independent, for example, by showing bias to the commission or by toning down recommendations. In the year 2004&#150;05, the ICR received only one complaint about her service from a Charity Commission complainant. That complaint was related to dissatisfaction with the review findings, rather than the way in which she had dealt with the matter. The ombudsman is appointed by the Queen and reports directly to Parliament and provides an independent final recourse for complainants who have not been satisfied by the investigations of the commission or the ICR into their complaints.
</p>

<a name="51108-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>I also mentioned last time that in the recent annual report the ICR herself doubts whether a &quot;potentially overlapping&quot; office as proposed in the amendment would add anything for the citizen &quot;other than confusion&quot;. I do not believe that there are the gaps in the present arrangements as the noble Lord has suggested in his amendment. The current ICR provides a different but valuable and valued addition to the ombudsman service.
</p>

<a name="51108-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>I am sorry that I was not able to convince the noble Lord last time that the current arrangements are satisfactory. I apologise to the House for going over at <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_579"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 579</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

length why we feel that the situation is best served by the current arrangement. I hope that my explanation this time, although perhaps not to the noble Lord&#039;s liking, has helped hin through some of the arguments that we see as obstacles to choosing the course recommended to us by the noble Lord.
</p>

<a name="51108-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>I accept that the amendment is moved in good spirit and is well-intentioned, but it would add confusion and would not provide much, if any, benefit to potential complainants.
</p>




<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="51108-23_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Swinfen: </b>   My Lords, the suggestion by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, of a new, clearer leaflet by the Charity Commission is probably a good idea. I am glad that the Minister welcomed that. I admit that I had some difficulty hearing a great deal of what the Minister said&#151;and, indeed, of seeing what he said, because he had his head down reading his brief, which is perfectly understandable. That is not his fault. He needs to read his brief. I know that I am a deaf nit, but I have to put up with that. Unfortunately, at this stage, I do not have the opportunity to read what the Minister said before the next stage of the Bill.

</p>




<p><a name="st_192"></a>
<a name="51108-24_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Swinfen: </b>   My Lords, there is no need for the Minister to apologise. The worst people are those with thick moustaches and heavy beards&#151;you cannot see their lips and so what they are saying. I am glad to say that the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, has his moustache and beard neatly trimmed, so that, if he were to take part in the debate, I could see what he is saying, but not everyone is so considerate.
</p>

<a name="51108-24_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>I still think the provision rather odd and very dubious in many respects because, as would occur under the scheme as it stands, if I needed to be investigated and were to employ the investigator on my terms to investigate me and my behaviour, no one else would take the report with anything other than a pinch of salt. I still feel that, with all due respect to the current holder of the office&#151;who I am certain is perfectly honourable&#151;in future, someone may be incapable of doing the job properly. That is why I want there to be someone who is seen to be totally independent. Having said that, I shall withdraw the amendment. I am sure that someone else will take it up in another place.

<a name="51108-24_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting </b>   rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 12 October be approved [5th Report from the Joint Committee].
</p>




<p><a name="st_195"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving that the draft Family Procedure (Modification of Enactments) Order 2005 be approved, I shall speak also to the draft Access to Justice Act 1999 (Destination of Appeals) (Family Proceedings) Order 2005 and the draft Revised Legal Services Commission Funding Code 2005.
</p>

<a name="51108-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>First, the orders and revisions to the code are minor definition changes to facilitate the implementation of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and the Civil Partnership Act 2004, both of which come into force in December. The orders are the only two affirmative instruments tabled by the Department for Constitutional Affairs relating to the implementation of the Adoption and Children Act 2002. They provide continuity of current provisions as we move from the soon-to-be-repealed Adoption Act 1976 to the Adoption and Children Act 2002. For ease, we have tabled these with the revised funding code, prepared by the Legal Services Commission, which simply adds the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and the Civil Partnerships Act 2004 to the list of legislation covered by the code.
</p>

<a name="51108-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>I turn to the effect of the orders. The Family Procedure (Modification of Enactments) Order 2005 will enable family proceedings courts to continue to issue witness summons, which has previously been provided by Sections 97(1)(a) and (2) of the Magistrates&#039; Courts Act 1980. The Access to Justice Act 1999 (Destination of Appeals) (Family Proceedings) Order 2005 allows appeals in adoption matters to continue to be heard by the courts to which they are currently assigned. Appeals would otherwise lie directly to the Court of Appeal in almost every case, which is neither time nor cost-effective.
</p>

<a name="51108-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>Both those orders are needed to ensure a smooth transition from the old to the new rules. They underpin the adoption policy of the Department for Education and Skills, which has already been approved by Parliament&#151;including by affirmative debate on two instruments moved by my noble friend Lord Adonis on 8 June. All other strands of DCA&#039;s court rules have been consulted on and approved by the Family Procedure Rules Committee. In addition, the Lord Chancellor has consulted the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, the President of the Queen&#039;s Bench Division, the President of the Family Division and the Chancellor of the High Court on the destination of appeals order. No comments were made on that order.
</p>

<a name="51108-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>On the funding code, the amendments are all minor, non-controversial changes that essentially update the funding code to capture the new proceedings being introduced by the Adoption and Children Act 2002 on 30 December 2005 and the Civil Partnership Act <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="51108-24_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, when I first looked at the Forthcoming Business and saw that these three orders were expected to take 45 minutes to debate, I thought that some serious issues would arise from them. I was therefore a little surprised, having read the draft orders and the helpful accompanying Explanatory Memoranda, that there was nothing to argue about. That now seems to be the case.
</p>

<a name="51108-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>It is plain that these amendments are minor ones consequential mainly on the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and, to a lesser extent, on the Civil Partnership Act 2004. In the circumstances, I am happy to see them go through.
</p>




<p><a name="st_197"></a>
<a name="51108-24_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My Lords, I share entirely the view of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that these orders are both uncontroversial and desirable.
</p>

<a name="51108-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>The Family Procedure (Modification of Enactments) Order 2005 serves two purposes. First, it enables a justice of the peace, at the hearing of an application under the Adoption and Children Act 2002, to issue a witness summons. Secondly, it ensures that in such applications a warrant of arrest cannot be issued instead of a witness summons. It is clear that in so doing this order will facilitate the purpose of the Adoption and Children Act 2002; namely, to minimise delay in the court process, thus putting the interests of the child first. These aims were supported by the Opposition and by Liberal Democrat Members during the passage of the Act through both Houses.
</p>

<a name="51108-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>The Access to Justice Act 1999 (Destination of Appeals) (Family Proceedings) Order 2005 is also uncontroversial. It sets out the route of appeal in adoption proceedings, providing for two routes. Appeals against a decision by a district judge in a county court shall lie to a county court judge. Appeals against a decision of a district judge which go to the High Court, the Principal Registry of the Family Division or a costs judge will lie to a judge of the High Court. This order is necessary to preserve the status quo under the RSC 1965 and CCRs, once the Adoption and Children Act 2002 comes into force on 30 December 2005.
</p>

<a name="51108-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>On the amendments to the criteria underlying the Legal Services Commission Funding Code, the first amendment at Section 2.2 includes, in the definition of &quot;family proceedings&quot;, references to proceedings under <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_582"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 582</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and the Civil Partnership Act 2004. The second amendment includes in the definition of &quot;other public law children cases&quot; applications for a placement order. This new order will be available once the 2002 Act comes into force on 30 December. The final amendments are to the introductory paragraphs and simply reflect the fact that it is a revised code that will come into force only when approved by the Lord Chancellor and by Parliament. These amendments are non-controversial and bring the LSC Funding Code up to date with primary legislation that comes into force at the end of the year.

   &quot;RECEIVER AND MANAGER TO BE PAID BY COMMISSION<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_583"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 583</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
   In section 19(6)(b) of the 1993 Act, for &quot;the income of the charities concerned&quot; substitute &quot;the Charity Commission for England and Wales&quot;.&quot;

<p><a name="st_203"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of the amendment is to make the Charity Commission responsible for paying its own receivers and managers and not the charity on which they are imposed. There are cases, such as the Little Gidding Trust case, where the commission initially refused to appoint a receiver and manager when the trustees requested it because it was believed that the charity did not have sufficient liquid funds to pay. The amendment runs counter to the arrangements for commercial companies, but the situation in charities is very different.
</p>

<a name="51108-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>First, funds to be used are not private commercial money of companies whose management has been incompetent. In charities, the funds are donations given by the public for charitable purposes. As I understand it&#151;perhaps the Minister will confirm it&#151;by law those donations must be used for the purposes for which they were given, not for spending on receivers and managers. Secondly, the commission has too often shown itself to be grossly irresponsible with charity funds in appointing receivers and managers.
</p>

<a name="51108-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>I shall give only one example today as I have given several in the past. That is the recently published case of the Kings Ministry Trust, also known as the Kingsway International Christian Church or KICC. This unincorporated trust has for some years been remunerating its trustees for various services and doing so quite openly. It made the mistake of not realising that it should have altered its constitution explicitly to allow that to be done. If something needs the commission&#039;s permission, that is routine and not a large hurdle.
</p>

<a name="51108-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>I am told that the commission&#039;s inquiry lasted nearly three years and has cost the charity &#163;1.2 million for the receiver and manager and his eight consultants as well as considerable damage to its charitable work. The practical result is that this trust has been turned into a charitable company. Token restitution is to be paid by one of the trustees and some new trustees have been brought on to the board. With some advice from the commission and the use of the charity lawyer, the trustees of this charity could have affected these changes for some &#163;12,000&#151;one-hundredth of the sum the commission has already spent. Even if the trustees had been wildly extravagant, they could not conceivably have spent more than &#163;120,000&#151;one-tenth of the sum squandered by the Charity Commission.
</p>

<a name="51108-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>On 18 October, at col. 688 of <i>Hansard</i>, the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, said that the Charity Commission had secured charity assets to the tune of almost &#163;20 million for the seven cases which concluded in 2004&#150;05. However, he did not mention, and probably does not know, that nearly the whole of the seven charities&#039; &#163;20 million was the assets of the KICC, much of which I am told was quite safe in the form of the church&#039;s buildings and land in Hackney. The Charity Commission did not therefore secure or protect &#163;20 million of charitable assets&#151;most of it was <br>&nbsp;<br>

not under any discernable threat. Or at least it was not until the commission decided to blow &#163;1.2 million of charity funds on some expensive City consultants.

<a name="51108-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>Noble Lords may be interested to learn that the commission gave such careful consideration and supervision that under the receiver and manager it appointed to the Little Gidding Trust the quoted price rose from &#163;10,000 to &#163;25,000 by the time the inquiry closed. At the Cancer and Leukaemia in Childhood charity the receiver and manager was appointed for the price of &#163;22,000, which had risen to &#163;65,000 by the end of his investigation. At Iran Aid the contract price was &#163;97,000, but when the receiver and manager left the charity was poorer by &#163;470,000. In the KICC case, the quoted and contracted price was &#163;140,000, which, as we have heard, rose to &#163;1.2 million under the careful supervision of the Charity Commission&#151;nine times the original price.
</p>

<a name="51108-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>The Minister invited the House to agree with the basic principle that it should not fall to public funds to pay for the cost of a receiver and manager. I put it to noble Lords that there is an overriding principle that funds donated for charitable purposes should not be made available to a regulator which has demonstrated time and again its ability to lose control of its own consultants and squander funds held in trust by charities for their beneficiaries.
</p>

<a name="51108-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>The amendment will have the practical effect of encouraging the commission to take considerably more care in its use of consultants than has hitherto been the case. I suggest that it will cause an immediate fall in the sums paid to receivers and managers and that this can only have a beneficial effect for the charities.
</p>

<a name="51108-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>When considering the remuneration of receivers and managers, Section 19(6)(b) of the 1993 Act states that the regulations made by the Secretary of State may make provision with respect to,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;the remuneration of such persons out of the income of the charities concerned&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="51108-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>Can the Minister confirm that in the cases I have mentioned&#151;and in all cases&#151;the remuneration of receivers and managers is paid out of the income of charities and not out of their capital assets? I beg to move.

<a name="51108-25_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, it will be best if I repeat the key points that I made on Report, when the noble Lord moved an identical amendment. I say that because they still represent the Government&#039;s view.
</p>

<a name="51108-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>In practice, the appointment of an interim manager is usually a last resort for the commission when it considers that it is essential to secure the assets of a charity where it has found evidence of serious <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_585"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 585</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

misconduct or mismanagement in the administration of a charity, or where it is clear that assets are at risk. A formal inquiry into the charity must also be under way under Section 8 of the Charities Act 1993.
</p>

<a name="51108-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>Before taking the serious step of appointing an interim manager the commission will have considered all other options. In the majority of cases appointments are made after a tender exercise to get the right person for the job at value for money. We still believe that in these circumstances it is usually appropriate that the charity pays for the cost of the interim manager. Charities must be responsible for their own affairs and responsible for the consequences of their decisions and actions. This includes the consequences of mismanagement. In most cases public funds should not be used to pay the costs of an interim manager appointed to a charity because of the actions of the trustees.
</p>

<a name="51108-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>I also mentioned on the previous occasion that the cost of the appointment of an interim manager should be weighed up against the benefits to charities. In the seven cases which concluded in 2004&#150;05, as the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, acknowledged, &#163;20 million-worth of charity assets were secured.
</p>

<a name="51108-25_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>The commission has the power, where appropriate, to meet the fees and expenses of an interim manager from public funds. In its recent letter to Peers who spoke on Report, the commission gave details of two occasions during the past two years when this happened. The first was in the case of Lincoln Council for Voluntary Service, where a receiver and manager was appointed from July 2003 until November of that year. The cost was &#163;3,500 plus VAT. The second case is a case in progress. The commission&#039;s letter states that this is where,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a>&quot;a receiver and manager was appointed on a contingency basis on 13 December 2003. As the charity had no cash assets at that time an indemnity was offered but the costs were eventually met by the charity. Because this case is still in progress the name of the charity has not been made public&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-25_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>However, we would expect the use of public funds to be in exceptional cases.

</p>

<a name="51108-25_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>The commission has a statutory responsibility to supervise all receiver and manager appointments, which it discharges in all cases. In some cases, the costs of professional advice incurred by the interim manager would be incurred by the trustees were the interim manager not in place. The commission is very aware of the sensitivities involved in appointing an interim manager, and particularly of the resultant costs to the charity. It has recently started publishing the costs of interim managers.
</p>

<a name="51108-25_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>In July this year it published the costs of receiver cases concluded in 2004&#150;05, and the details are still available on its website. The commission, when publishing the details, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;Details of individual appointments are provided in the Inquiry Report which is published after the conclusion of each Inquiry. These reports are available on the Commission&#039;s website. However to further increase transparency the Commission has decided that at least once each year it will publish together certain details of all R & M appointments closed in the financial year and the number of such appointments remaining in operation&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="51108-25_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>I will also add that the new powers to give directions to be conferred on the commission under Clauses 20 and 21 may lead to a reduction in such appointments as they will provide an alternative and simpler route to dealing with some of the concerns that currently give rise to appointments.
</p>

<a name="51108-25_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, referred to the Kingsway International Christian Centres appointment and receiver managers. A recently published report of an interim manager appointment related to the Kings Ministries, where the actions of the interim managers appointed by the commission secured charitable funds of more than &#163;19 million. KICC took over the running and management of it on 23 March, having been appointed sole corporate trustee of the Kings Ministries. The Kings Ministries&#039; financial performance during the period of the appointment was very impressive. The charity&#039;s income grew to more than &#163;8.5 million in its financial year ending March 2004, and the interim managers made gift aid claims to the value of &#163;3.3 million for the financial years 2000&#150;2004. The commission believes, understandably, that the future success of this charity is assured by the charity having new trustees, a new senior management team, an extremely strong financial performance and a new incorporated structure. That demonstrates the benefits of such appointments.
</p>

<a name="51108-25_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, asked whether the receiver&#039;s remuneration always comes out of a charity&#039;s income rather than its capital. As far as I can be certain, that is the case.
</p>

<a name="51108-25_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>We have covered the issue several times, and I think that we have the legislation and the framework right. The type of intervention that I have described is a good example of what can be achieved through the right sort of appointment when a charity in the past has perhaps operated below par or inappropriately. I trust that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.

But the noble Lord does not seem to have taken on board that the vast majority of that amount were the assets of the charity in the form of property, which was not in any danger. I understand that the problem was that the person running the charity had paid himself some &#163;200,000 and that arrangements were being made for him to repay that in any case.

subject to a condition as to the use of that gift, the charity can use it only according to that condition. Most gifts are not of that nature, and are therefore usable for any purpose. If a charity finds itself in the position of having no other assets out of which to meet its obligations other than assets donated to it subject to condition or trust, in those circumstances it will have to have recourse to those earmarked gifts to discharge its obligations.

<br>
&quot;74AA   TRANSFER WHERE CHARITY HAS PERMANENT ENDOWMENT


<br>
(1)   This section provides for the operation of section 74 above where a charity within section 74(1) has a permanent endowment (whether or not the charity&#039;s trusts contain provision for the termination of the charity).


<br>
(2)   In such a case section 74 applies as follows&#151;


<br>
(a)   if the charity has both a permanent endowment and other property (&quot;unrestricted property&quot;)&#151;


<br>
(i)   a resolution under section 74(2) must relate to both its permanent endowment and its unrestricted property, and


<br>
(ii)   that section applies in relation to its unrestricted property in accordance with subsection (3) below and in relation to its permanent endowment in accordance with subsections (4) to (11) below;


<br>
(b)   if all of the property of the charity is comprised in its permanent endowment, that section applies in relation to its permanent endowment in accordance with subsections (4) to (11) below.


<br>
(3)   Section 74 applies in relation to unrestricted property of the charity as if references in that section to all or any of the property of the charity were references to all or any of its unrestricted property.


<br>
(4)   Section 74 applies in relation to the permanent endowment of the charity with the following modifications.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_589"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 589</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(5)   References in that section to all or any of the property of the charity are references to all or any of the property comprised in its permanent endowment.

<br>
(6)   If the property comprised in its permanent endowment is to be transferred to a single charity, the charity trustees must (instead of being satisfied as mentioned in section 74(4)(b)) be satisfied that the proposed transferee charity has purposes which are substantially similar to all of the purposes of the transferor charity.


<br>
(7)   If the property comprised in its permanent endowment is to be transferred to two or more charities, the charity trustees must (instead of being satisfied as mentioned in section 74(4)(b)) be satisfied&#151;


<br>
(a)   that the proposed transferee charities, taken together, have purposes which are substantially similar to all of the purposes of the transferor charity, and


<br>
(b)   that each of the proposed transferee charities has purposes which are substantially similar to one or more of the purposes of the transferor charity.


<br>
(8)   In the case of a transfer to which subsection (7) above applies, the resolution under section 74(2) must provide for the property comprised in the permanent endowment of the charity to be divided between the transferee charities in such a way as to take account of such guidance as may be given by the Commission for the purposes of this section.


<br>
(9)   The requirement in section 74(11) shall apply in the case of every such transfer, and in complying with that requirement the charity trustees of a transferee charity must secure that the application of property transferred to the charity takes account of any such guidance.


<br>
(10)   Any guidance given by the Commission for the purposes of this section may take such form and be given in such manner as the Commission considers appropriate.


<br>
(11)   For the purposes of sections 74 and 74A above, any reference to any obligation imposed on the charity trustees by or under section 74 includes a reference to any obligation imposed on them by virtue of any of subsections (6) to (8) above.


<br>
(12)   Section 74(14) applies for the purposes of this section as it applies for the purposes of section 74.&quot;</p>

It deals with an issue I raised at Report stage but, having heard the arguments then put forward by both the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Phillips&#151;the noble Lord has an amendment in this group, which aims down the same alleyway as mine&#151;I have returned to it on a narrowed basis. The amendment is concerned with Clause 43 and the power to spend capital. Clause 43 is the replacement for Section 75 of the Charities Act 1993.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_590"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 590</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51108-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>Perhaps I may briefly summarise the background again. I remain concerned by the unsatisfactory and unclear position of what is known as &quot;permanent endowment&quot;. Permanent endowment is defined in Section 96(3) of the Charities Act 1993 as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a>&quot;A charity shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to have a permanent endowment unless all property held for the purposes of the charity may be expended for those purposes without distinction between capital and income, and in this Act, &#039;permanent endowment&#039; means, in relation to any charity, property held subject to a restriction on its being expended for the purposes of the charity&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>The result of this definition is that unless a donor specified that a gift was not to be regarded as permanently endowed, it would be so regarded. Gifts that may have been made centuries ago are therefore trussed up in a way that is probably quite at odds with the wishes of the now long dead original donor.
</p>

<a name="51108-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>My amendment on Report sought to reverse this position by taking into permanent endowment only those gifts so specifically designated by the donor. The present position is that charities can be inhibited in maintaining their assets in their most effective form; for example, selling a small piece of land with planning permission and using the proceeds to enhance and improve the charity&#039;s other buildings will require the Charity Commission&#039;s consent. This may be given only the basis of a scheme of &quot;recoupment&quot;, which requires the replacing of the fixed asset over a period of years.
</p>

<a name="51108-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>To my commercial, but non-legal, eye&#151;I am aware that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, dislikes fudges&#151;recoupment seems to be a classic fudge. Recoupment is normally carried out on a straight, pound for pound basis. This means that neither interest nor inflation is taken into account. So if recoupment is really meant to protect the alleged wishes of the original donor, it fails to do so. So why should we not be open and clear about it? Let us accept that proving a negative is extremely difficult and allow that, unless the donor expressly wished it, permanent endowment will not apply.
</p>

<a name="51108-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>On Report, I tabled two amendments, the second of which was a redefinition of Clause 96(3) of the 1993 Act. On reflection, having re-read the debate of 18 October, I think that I was being overambitious. Amendment No. 14 is therefore a narrower amendment which would permit &quot;land&quot; to be included in &quot;available endowment fund&quot;. That would be achieved by leaving out lines 17 to 19 of page 45 of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51108-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>I have heard it suggested that this amendment is unnecessary because when the land is sold it becomes cash and so no longer falls within the prohibition, but instead qualifies as &quot;available endowment fund&quot; under Clause 43(7)(a) and (b). If this is indeed the case, the whole clause must be without purpose. It must indeed be a farce.
</p>

<a name="51108-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>In our earlier debate, the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, asked me three questions to which I owe him a formal reply. First, do I seek to apply this principle to charity law generally? Yes, I do. Secondly, he asked me to define and explain the issue of &quot;intention&quot;. This is no <br>&nbsp;<br>

longer relevant because I am not seeking to redefine &quot;permanent endowment&quot; any longer. Thirdly, he asked about the application of the new approach. Again, some of its force has been reduced by the narrower objective of the amendment, but I of course seek to reach back to solve the problem of donations made many years ago where no specific wish was expressed by the donor. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, and his colleagues in charity law are now well aware of this problem and so always ensure that present donors&#039; views are made clear when the gift is made.
</p>

<a name="51108-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>I conclude. It is generally accepted that the definition of &quot;permanent endowment&quot; in the 1993 Act is unduly restrictive, clumsy and unhelpful to charities. My amendment seeks to achieve clarity and to free charities from dependence on the inevitably capricious judgments that are made from time to time by the Charity Commission.
</p>

<a name="51108-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>I do not wish to divide the House on my amendment unless I have to. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me by making a commitment to look further at this issue during the passage of the Bill in another place. At the very least, the Minister needs to put on record his expectation that the Charity Commission will act expeditiously and flexibly in this important area. I beg to move.

<a name="51108-27_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, although my Amendment No. 15 is grouped with Amendment 14, it might be clearer to the House if the Minister were to reply to the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. If the Minister prefers that the pair be dealt with together, I will be content; but I wonder whether it will not be confusing things to have two different amendments&#151;which are complex enough&#151;being responded to on a single occasion. What does the Minister think?
</p>




<p><a name="st_219"></a>
<a name="51108-27_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the Minister thinks it would be wise to deal with them both together, so that we can move business rather faster.
</p>




<p><a name="st_220"></a>
<a name="51108-27_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, that is irresistible reasoning. My amendment is directed at a situation where a charity has endowed property in the form of land&#151;sometimes called <i>in specie</i> land&#151;which is surplus to its requirements; or at least where the land could better be used by its being sold and invested in other land; or, more likely, sold and invested in buildings on the land.
</p>

<a name="51108-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>The amendment in my name would, subject to its provisions, allow the trustees of the charity, without recourse to the Charity Commission, to go ahead with the sale&#151;and to use the proceeds on a building which had an expected life of not less than 75 years, or on other land used for the purposes of the charity. Secondly, it would allow that to be done without the need for recoupment. The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, put it well; there is a burden of recoupment, especially as it normally has to come out of the charity&#039;s income. Imagine a charity realising &#163;1 million on the sale of some land which it was going to use for a building for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_592"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 592</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

its own purposes; there might then be a recoupment order which would so reduce the net income of the charity, year to year, as to make the whole venture impractical.
</p>

<a name="51108-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>Amendment No. 15 therefore says that, if its conditions are to be complied with, then, first, the excluded endowment, as it is called,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a>&quot;is surplus to . . . current and foreseeable needs&quot;;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>secondly, that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a>&quot;the trustees are satisfied that the purposes of the charity could be carried out more effectively&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>if that excluded land were to be sold and the proceeds used for purchasing other land and erecting new buildings; thirdly and importantly, if it be the latter&#151;that is to say, the funds are to be used for the building of premises&#151;a qualified architect must certify that the expected life of the new buildings is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a>&quot;not less than 75 years&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>Then, to bolt and bar the arrangement, because it is quite a radical departure from the current one, the Charity Commission, in looking at the resolution of the trustees importing the provisions of this amendment, would have to be satisfied,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a>&quot;as to the wishes of the donor&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>and take those into account. It should also take into account,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a>&quot;changes in the circumstances relating to the charity&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>since the making of the land that is being sold. Thirdly, it would have to have regard to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a>&quot;the spirit of the gift or gifts&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>Provided it was satisfied on those three counts, there would be a more or less automatic endorsement of the resolution of the trustees to get on with the sale for the purposes mentioned.
</p>

<a name="51108-27_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, will identify himself with my remarks. It seems to me to be an exception to the hitherto iron rule protecting endowment in the form of land. It is practical and it will speed the better use by charities of surplus land. It should therefore be encouraged by the Government. I hope that the amendment will commend itself to the Minister.

<a name="51108-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the effect of Amendment No. 14 would be that permanent endowment land held on trust to be used for the purposes of the charity would fall within the scope of the new power set out in Clause 43 to permit unincorporated charities to spend capital in certain circumstances. That, if I understand rightly, is the purpose of the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. It would facilitate the use of capital proceeds of sale of such land without the need for it to be recouped out of the future income of the charity. I believe that that is also the intention behind the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. He seeks, in the circumstances set out in his amendment, to permit the expenditure of proceeds of the sale of land in some cases. This would be when the land was held on trust, when it is stipulated that it is to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_593"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 593</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

be used for the purposes of the charity, and when the land is surplus to current foreseeable needs, when the purposes of the charity could be more effectively carried out and the proceeds used to purchase land or erect buildings which are to be used for the purposes of charity, and when the buildings are to be erected by a qualified architect who has certified that the proposed buildings have an expected life of not less than 75 years.
</p>

<a name="51108-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>We do not believe it right to override that stipulation, when trusts on land which is held specifically set out that land is to be used for the purposes of the charity. That remains our position. Having said that, in recognition of some of the concerns that have been expressed, the commission has told me that it will carry out a fundamental review of its interpretation of the law on practice when it exercises its discretion whether to require recoupment. That review will also cover the principles governing the circumstances of recoupment in any particular case. In particular, the commission assures me that it will consider whether an apportionment of the value of sales proceeds between the value of the land and the value of the buildings, the latter only requiring recoupment, may be appropriate. It will also consider whether in the provision of substantial buildings lasting, say, over 75 years, and when the proceeds may be surplus to the charity&#039;s reasonable requirements, any recoupment may be necessary at all.
</p>

<a name="51108-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>There may be other factors as well, but the commission has assured me that it will carry out a review, which it hopes to complete in the next few months. I believe that these matters are best dealt with by the commission on a case-by-case basis, given the different circumstances that apply to each charity that may be affected. It is not best dealt with by statutory intervention&#151;and I think that the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson probably agrees with that from the hint that he gave in his earlier comments on what he expected out of our discussion of these amendments.
</p>

<a name="51108-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>I reassure the House that the commission has recognised the issue and will review it. I hope that, having heard that, the noble Lords will feel able to withdraw, or not move, their valuable amendments&#151;valuable because they focus on a genuine issue&#151;and that we can proceed in that way, as it would be a more constructive approach.

We are saying that when it is not made clear by the original donor it will be assumed that he or she did not want permanent endowment, as opposed to the other way round. We are not trying to undermine the position, and I do not believe that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is trying to do that either. All we are saying is, &quot;Back then, they didn&#039;t know what they were saying, so can we give some flexibility so that the charity can go forward?&quot; That is what I believe is <br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
75ZB   POWER TO SPEND CAPITAL WHICH CONSISTS OF EXCLUDED ENDOWMENT


<br>
(1)   This section applies to any excluded endowment of a charity which cannot be spent under the provisions of section 75A and &quot;excluded endowment&quot; means land held on trusts which stipulate that it is to be used for the purposes, or any particular purposes, of the charity.


<br>
(2)   Where the conditions in subsection (3) below are met, the charity trustees may resolve for the purposes of this section that the excluded endowment, or part of it, ought to be sold and be freed from&#151;


<br>
(a)   the restrictions with respect to expenditure of capital; and


<br>
(b)   any restrictions with respect to the use to which the land must be put;


<br>
that apply to it so that the proceeds of sale may be used to purchase land or erect buildings (or both) to be used to further the purposes, or any particular purpose, of the charity.


<br>
(3)   The conditions referred to in subsection (2) are that&#151;


<br>
(a)   the charity trustees are satisfied that the excluded endowment (or part thereof) which they propose to sell is surplus to the current and forseeable needs of the charity;


<br>
(b)   the charity trustees are satisfied that the purposes of the charity could be carried out more effectively if the excluded endowment, or the relevant portion thereof, were sold and the proceeds applied in purchasing land or erecting buildings (or both) to be used for the purposes, or any particular purpose, of the charity; and


<br>
(c)   that, where the charity trustees propose using the proceeds of sale of the expendable endowment (or part thereof) to erect a building, the charity trustees have obtained a certificate from a qualified architect that the proposed building has an expected life of not less than 75 years.


<br>
(4)   The charity trustees&#151;


<br>
(a)   must send a copy of any resolution under subsection (2) to the Commission, together with a statement of their reasons for passing it and a certified copy of the statement referred to in subsection (3)(c) above; and


<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(5)   Subsections (6) and (7) of section 75A apply to this section.


<br>
(6)   When considering whether to concur with the resolution, the Commission must take into account&#151;


<br>
(a)   any evidence available to it as to the wishes of the donor or donors mentioned in section 75A(1)(a),


<br>
(b)   any changes in the circumstances relating to the charity since the making of the gift or gifts (including, in particular, the needs of its beneficiaries, and the social, economic and legal environment in which it operates),


<br>
(c)   the spirit of the gift or gifts mentioned in section 75A(1)(a) (even though a sale would be inconsistent with the restrictions imposed upon the gift or gifts).


<br>
(7)   Before the end of the period of three months beginning with the relevant date, the Commission must notify the charity trustees in writing either&#151;


<br>
(a)   that the Commission concurs with the resolution, or


<br>
(b)   that it does not concur with it.


<br>
(8)   In subsection (7) above, &quot;the relevant date&quot; means&#151;


<br>
(a)   in a case where the Commission directs the charity trustees under subsection 75A(6) (as applied to this section) to give public notice of the resolution, the date when that notice is given, and


<br>
(b)   in any other case, the date on which the Commission receives the copy of the resolution in accordance with subsection (4) above.


<br>
(9)   Where&#151;


<br>
(a)   the charity trustees are notified by the Commission that it concurs with the resolution, or


<br>
(b)   the period of three months mentioned in subsection (7) above has elapsed without the Commission notifying them that it does not concur with the resolution,


<br>
the excluded endowment (or portion) may, by virtue of this section, be sold and expended in carrying out the purposes, or any particular purpose, set out in the resolution mentioned in subsection (2).


<br>
(10)   In this section&#151;


<br>
(a)   &quot;qualified architect&quot; means an individual registered with the Architects Registration Board; and


<br>
(b)   references to the erection of buildings includes any expenditure reasonably necessary to equip such buildings for the purposes of the charity.&quot;</p>

These amendments fulfil the undertaking I think I gave the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, on Report on 18 October, to consider in consultation with him a number of concerns he had about the operation of the merger provisions in Clause 44. The noble Lord pointed out that the Bill, as drafted, contained measures that meant a merger in which a vesting declaration is used does not need to be notified to the commission. He argued that the vesting declaration was a novel and powerful piece of legal machinery, the use of which ought to be notified so that it would be registered by the commission.
</p>

<a name="51108-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>We accept the argument, so one effect of these amendments, in particular Amendment No. 24, is to require notification to the commission of any merger in which a vesting declaration is used. That notification will then trigger registration of the merger by the commission.

<p><a name="st_230"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 17 I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 18 to 23, which are grouped with it. Clause 44 is designed to make certain types of merger between charities easier. It does so with two legal devices: one is the vesting declaration, to make the transfer of property from a transferor charity to a transferee charity easier, and the other is a device to ensure that gifts to a transferor charity that take effect on or after the date of registration of the merger belong automatically to the transferee charity, unless they are excluded gifts.
</p>

<a name="51108-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>The Bill provides for the Charity Commission to keep a register of mergers. It allows for any relevant charity mergers to be notified to the commission and requires the commission to enter in the register every relevant charity merger that is notified to it. A relevant charity is defined in subsection (4) of the new Section 75C which is inserted through Clause 44 of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51108-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, identified at an earlier stage what he considered to be shortcomings in the relevant charity merger definition. It is these shortcomings that this group of amendments seek to address. The effect of the amendments is to make it clearer than the existing words do that a relevant charity merger includes a merger in which the transferring charities have already gone out of existence on the transfer of their property to the merged charity and the merger in which the transferring charities are in future to go out of existence. In other words it clarifies that a merger in which a transferring charity or charities have transferred all their property and are intending to go out of existence but have not yet done so counts as a relevant charity merger and thus can be notified to and registered by the commission.

It allows the Charity Commission to refer matters to the Charity Tribunal which have arisen in connection with the exercise by the commission of any of its functions and involve the operation of charity law or the application of charity law to a particular state of affairs.

(b)   of any charity which is a subsidiary undertaking,

must ensure that the accounting records kept in respect of the charity under section 41(1) of this Act not only comply with the requirements of that provision but also are such as to enable the charity trustees of the parent charity to ensure that, where any group accounts are prepared by them under paragraph 2(2), those accounts comply with the relevant requirements.


<br>
(2)   If a parent charity has a subsidiary undertaking in relation to which the requirements of section 41(1) of this Act do not apply, the charity trustees of the parent charity must take reasonable steps to secure that the undertaking keeps such accounting records as to enable the trustees to ensure that, where any group accounts are prepared by them under paragraph 2(2), those accounts comply with the relevant requirements.

Some concerns have been expressed about the relationship between the audit thresholds for group accounts and for single-entity accounts. The approach that this amendment adopts will allow us to give more thought to that relationship and to consult more widely on it. The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, may have raised that point earlier.

<a name="51108-30_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, I wish to ask the Minister a question about Amendment No. 38. It removes paragraphs (a) and (b), at the bottom of page 106 and the top of page 107, which set the aggregate gross income at &#163;500,000 and tie that to an accounts threshold or an asset trigger of &#163;2.8 million. As he mentioned, I have distaste for such multiple triggers, but they are at least on the face of the Bill. I am not clear from what he said whether the accounts threshold will disappear and we will have only a gross income figure and an asset figure, or whether the Government are just thinking about whether the threshold will disappear. If it is to disappear, I shall give three cheers, because that is one more threshold out of the way. If not, how will it make its reappearance? If I remember correctly from Committee, the accounts threshold is a Companies Act figure&#151;nothing to do with charities regulation itself. A word of clarification would be helpful.

</p>

<a name="51108-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>I understand that, in practice, a large number of charities send the commission copies of the documents that I have referred to. Strictly speaking that fails to comply with the statutory requirement, which is for the actual documentation&#151;not copies of it&#151;to be sent in. A further anomaly is that the existing law also requires trustees to preserve their annual accounts for six years, which of course they cannot do if they comply with the requirement to send them to the commission.

<a name="column_603"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column 603</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(1)   The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision for the conversion of a community interest company into a CIO, and for the CIO&#039;s registration as a charity.

<br>
(2)   The regulations may, in particular, apply, or apply with modifications specified in the regulations, or disapply, anything in sections 53 to 55 of the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004 or in sections 69G to 69I above.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_250"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, A community interest company, or CIC, is the new type of company introduced by statute in 2004. A CIC cannot, as we have discussed before, have charitable status, but it must carry on its activities for the benefit of the community.
</p>

<a name="51108-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>There would be no general objection to a CIC&#039;s seeking to become a charity. It may be, therefore, that some CICs would seek to become charities by converting to charitable incorporated organisation, or CIO, form. This amendment allows the Home Secretary to make regulations providing for CICs to convert directly to CIO form. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_251"></a>
<a name="51108-31_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, could I just search out a little truth from the Minister? Subsection (2) of Amendment No. 47 proposes that regulations in the Charities Act will, or could, disapply Sections 53 to 55 of the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004. Am I right in assuming that it is a sort of cross-referencing where we will pick into another Act and change or disapply it? If so, that is the sort of maddening thing that makes legislation very complicated and difficult for people to understand because they do not realise that they have to reach across to another Act to find out that it no longer applies because it has been changed in an Act with which there is no immediate connection between charities and the Companies Act 2004. Have I got it right or am I being unduly paranoid?

<p><a name="st_252"></a>
<a name="51108-31_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, any difficulty that might be experienced by a charity or a CIC or a CIO can be averted by providing charities in general with access to information about how this Act applies to other Acts. I have a feeling that at an earlier stage we discussed ways in which we could achieve some form of consolidation and I suspect that that may help as well. That is probably the answer to the noble Lord&#039;s point.

Most recently, we debated an amendment similar to this one on Report on 12 October. I think that it was Amendment No. 55, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury. During that debate, I said that the Government wanted to give the matter further thought and return with an amendment of their own covering the commission&#039;s protective powers under the Charities Act 1993.
</p>

<a name="51108-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>It is the commission&#039;s usual practice to inform trustees why it has taken any significant action using its protective powers. The amendment will make that a statutory requirement, subject to certain safeguards. It will require the commission to provide the trustees&#151;or the charity, if a corporate body&#151;with a copy of the order where it exercises a protective power under Section 18 and new Sections 18A, 19A, and 19B of the Charities Act 1993. It will also require the commission to provide a statement of reasons for making the order. However, the commission would not need to comply with this requirement&#151;or not comply with it in relation to the statement of reasons&#151;while it considered that to do so either would prejudice any inquiry or investigation or would not be in the interests of the charity.
</p>

<a name="51108-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>We are responding to an issue that was raised at an earlier stage by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. I hope that noble Lords will welcome the amendment, and I beg to move.

<a name="51108-32_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill do now pass. I ought to put on record a few thanks. Prior to today&#039;s deliberations, we had debated the Bill for no fewer than 57 hours, so my guess is that we have topped 60 since it was first introduced in another place in December 2004.
</p>

<a name="51108-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>I thank in particular the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, and the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, for one of the most thorough and constructive considerations of a piece of legislation I have ever had any connection with in your Lordships&#039; House. Although he is not here, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, for his persistent and telling approaches. I did not always agree with them, but he nonetheless did good service and stayed the course.
</p>

<a name="51108-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, played an important part. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, made in interesting series of interventions. I can even remember the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn of Charlton, keeping us entertained for some hours in the early stages of Committee. At that stage, I almost gave up the will to live. I did not mean that, but I am sure noble Lords understand what I mean. Back-Benchers have played a commendably important role in the Bill, and I express my gratitude to them.
</p>

<a name="51108-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>I also thank the charities that have become involved in the process. Their advice to Members from all parts of the House has been helpful. There have been some amendments that would not otherwise have found <br>&nbsp;<br>

their way onto the statute book without them. There are also one or two individuals who petitioned us for particular things, showed some powerful insights into the operation of the law and enabled us to make some constructive changes. Bodies that represent charities and their interests, particularly the Charity Law Association, are owed a debt of gratitude. I am most grateful to them for their rigorous critical thinking and sensitive, informed approach to the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51108-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>Finally, I thank my colleagues in the Whips Office for putting up with my grumpy nature and occasional ill humour as I have had to go through the Bill in great detail over such a long time. Of course, we all ought to thank the officials who have serviced these debates. The Bill team has been magnificent, and the collaborative work between it and the Charity Commission has enabled us to solve some problems that otherwise might not have reached a friendly and intelligent resolution. So, to all those parties, I say a big thanks. It has been a pleasure, and I hope that the Bill now finds favour in another place.

I also mention, <i>en passant</i>, NCVO, which has put a lot of work into this Bill; the Law Society; and one must not forget, although one might, the Association of Charitable Trusts, which has been dogged, if ever that word had meaning; and particularly Judith Hill at the Charity Law Association, who has been the <i>generalissimo</i> of its terrific efforts.

<a name="51108-32_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, I add my sincere thanks to the Minister for all that he has done and for his patience. It seems to have been a long time since we started. The Second Reading of the Bill in its original form was on Thursday 20 January, so I am not surprised that there have been 60 hours of debate. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, who kept me on the straight and narrow from a legal point of view. I also thank the Bill team and the Charity Commission. I felt that we would never get to a position where there were fewer than 100 amendments on the Marshalled List. We got down to 59 today, which was a big advance.
</p>

<a name="51108-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>Those of us who want to keep legislation short should remember that we have managed to expand the Bill from 72 to 78 clauses and from 129 to 172 pages. That is the result of our efforts, so we have not been as good at holding down the size of the legislation, but I am sure that, thanks to the work of the Minister, the Bill team, Members of the House and outside advisers, the Bill is a very much better piece of legislation. As we wave the Bill goodbye, I express the hope that, in the nicest possible way, we never have to see it again.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 2, line 8, leave out &quot;the agreement includes&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>The noble Lord said: In speaking to Amendment No. 1, I shall speak also to the other amendments in the group and to Amendment No. 8, which relates to a similar issue although it is slightly more complex. Like all Members of the Committee, we are extremely grateful for the extensive briefings we have had from organisations, a number of whose representatives I see on the red seats. In going through amendments on which we have had extensive lobbying, I shall in some cases move the amendment although I have not been joined by the Conservative Opposition, and in other cases they will move an amendment in which I do not join them. In a lot of cases we have put our names to each other&#039;s amendments. But on all the amendments we look forward to the Government&#039;s response. By definition, every amendment has to be a probing amendment because we cannot vote on it. In the light of the Government&#039;s reaction we will consider what to do with the issue on Report.
</p>

<a name="51108-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>The first group of amendments, which are quite technical, relate to procedural issues in regard to declarations made by high net worth borrowers. Amendment No. 8 is more substantive and relates to the application of the later provisions in the Bill on unfair relationships. As Members of the Committee will be aware, Clause 3 inserts new Section 16A into the 1974 Act. That provision would give the Secretary of State power by order to provide for the exemption of consumer credit agreements or consumer hire agreements from the regulation of the 1974 Act where the debtor or hirer has a &quot;high net worth&quot;.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC132"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC132</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51108-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>In order that an agreement may be exempted, certain tests must be met, including that the debtor or hirer must be a natural person&#151;that is, not a partnership, unincorporated association or a body corporate&#151;and must make a declaration in the specified form that he or she,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;agrees to forgo the protection and remedies that would be available . . . under [the 1974] Act if the agreement were a regulated agreement&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>Representations have been made to us by a number of bodies that the high net worth debtor exclusion has a number of shortcomings. For the benefit of <i>Hansard</i>, it would be useful to list what it is thought that they are. First, unlike the similar exemption in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, this exclusion does not allow for self certification and is administratively very cumbersome for high net work debtors and affluent customers.
</p>

<a name="51108-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>Secondly, it makes the carve-out unworkable because the customer will need to deal with yet another adviser for certification and is often reluctant to do so. His or her advisers may be unwilling to provide the statement required given the liability issues involved where, for example, income can be readily verified. A requirement for a person of specified description to substantiate what is clearly apparent is clearly disproportionate for this group of individuals.
</p>

<a name="51108-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>Next, there is a requirement to update certification annually, which is onerous and burdensome. Overdrafts, for example, require annual review, but it is unlikely that a high net worth individual consumer&#039;s asset base and/or income would substantially alter year to year. Further, it only covers customers acting in their individual capacity and not otherwise. The current draft requires the declaration to be made in the agreement&#151;that is, in proposed new Section 16A(1)(b). Lenders will therefore need to maintain a separate suite of agreements containing the specified declaration. That creates unnecessary red tape and expense.
</p>

<a name="51108-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>The territorial application of the Consumer Credit Bill is not clear and potentially applies to overseas clients or to transactions with an overseas element. In particular, it is not clear what triggers the application of the Bill. Is it <i>inter alia</i> the UK residence of the debtor, the creditor&#039;s principal place of business, that the agreement is negotiated and sold in the UK or simply signed in the UK, or that credit is extended in the UK or repaid in the UK? Those of us who have had experience of those jurisdictional issues will know the potential concern.
</p>

<a name="51108-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>High net worth borrowers are invariably sophisticated borrowers acting with the assistance of professional advisers. The prospect that they might be able to reopen an agreement is unnecessary and destabilising, and there is concern that some element of the business will go overseas were the clause to remain in this form.
</p>

<a name="51108-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>The substance of the amendments is as follows. In the first place, the high net worth debtor exclusion would be amended to promote self-certification or to give the Secretary of State power to decide whether to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC133"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC133</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

require a third certificate or self-certification. Secondly, the exclusions would be expanded to cover unincorporated vehicles in line with the FSMA (Financial Promotion) Order; namely, high net worth unincorporated bodies or persons. Thirdly, in the interests of reducing the unnecessary burdens on business that I referred to earlier, it is preferable that a declaration can be made in a document separate to the agreement, and that would be achieved under Amendments Nos. 1 and 2.
</p>

<a name="51108-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>Fourthly, we are suggesting the Secretary of State exercise existing powers under Section 16(6)(c) of the 1974 Act to clarify that the Consumer Credit Bill will not regulate a consumer credit agreement other than where the borrower is in the UK, except obviously&#151;and you would expect me to say this&#151;in connection with the possible implementation of the consumer credit directive. Fifthly, we are also looking to remove proposed new Section 16A(8), which would continue to apply provisions relating to unfair relationships to high net worth individuals otherwise exempted under proposed new Section 16A. Sixthly, we feel it would be appropriate when life partners&#151;husband and wife&#151;borrow jointly but income is concentrated in an individual&#039;s name for one of the two partners to be able to certify, so that certification is not necessary for both partners.
</p>

<a name="51108-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>The Government have already accepted that high net worth individuals may in specified circumstances forgo the protection of the 1974 Act. In the RIA, they give the reason for making that exemption:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;In respect of high net worth consumers, we have considered the concerns of industry that such consumers seeking large sums by way of personal borrowing would, if constrained by regulation under the Act, simply move their business to offshore financial centres with the consequences of a significant reduction in business for British consumer credit businesses&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>Next, we suggest that any application of the provisions on unfair relationships to exempted high net worth individuals militates against that objective, particularly while the provisions lack detail and are unclear. We will obviously come on to that in later amendments. As machinery has been put in place to exempt high net worth individuals, we feel that it is inappropriate to do so on a partial basis, and these amendments deal with that anomaly.
</p>

<a name="51108-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>I have gone into some detail on the reasons for the amendments, for which I apologise. However, I emphasise that the proposals do not reduce consumer protection at all. High net worth individuals will still be required to make the declaration, and there is every chance that setting out the declaration as a separate document will mean that more attention is drawn to it than if it formed part of a larger document&#151;part of the agreement. I beg to move.

<a name="51108-34_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  The amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, seek to alter the requirements that exist in relation to the manner in which the exemptions for high net worth debtors and hirers are obtained. It may assist the Committee if I set out the background to Clause 3 and the manner in which it is intended to work.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>As Members of the Committee are aware, Clause 2 will remove the financial limit above which credit and hire agreements are currently not regulated by the Consumer Credit Act. That means that, generally speaking, credit available to consumers will always be subject to regulation under the Act, whatever the amount. One exception to that rule is in respect of what the Bill calls high net worth borrowers. A considerable number of wealthy people receive very particular services from banks and other financial institutions, sometimes called private banking. Those services can include the provision of credit services and the leasing or hiring of expensive items. Faced with constraints on instant access to those services that regulation imposes, many such people&#151;they are generally financially savvy, well advised and well able to pay for the credit or hire&#151;may choose to take their business offshore. We are well aware of that fact, which is why we have introduced the concept. It is a concern that has been voiced by the credit industry, which pressed for such individuals to have the freedom to opt out of regulation.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>The clause therefore adds a new Section 16A to the Consumer Credit Act, allowing the Secretary of State to make an order that would give high net worth borrowers and hirers the option of exempting themselves from regulation. To do so, they must satisfy specific criteria. New subsection (1) requires a borrower to do two things to obtain the exemption. The first is to obtain and hold a statement from a specified person certifying that during the entirety of the previous financial year the borrower met the criteria for a high net worth individual. At this stage, we propose that such statements will be made by professionals whose status is independently verifiable, such as solicitors, accountants and FSA-recognised independent financial advisers. However, we will consult on the issue. After the Act&#039;s passage and a period of consultation, the Secretary of State will lay a statutory instrument setting out who may give the statements. Secondly, the potential borrower must also make a declaration in the agreement on their own account that they agree to forgo the protections otherwise available to them under the Consumer Credit Act. The exemption is available only to individuals&#151;it will not apply to partnerships or unincorporated associations, which are not legal persons.

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>New subsection (2) sets out the two criteria for a person to be a high net worth individual, which are income or net asset value. One of those criteria must be met. New subsection (3) requires that a statement of high net worth must be current&#151;specifically, that it must be given in the year ending with the day on which the agreement was made. So, it will not be necessary to obtain a separate statement for each agreement made within the period of the currency of the statement.

<a name="51108-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>The new Subsection (5) makes it clear that where there are joint borrowers or hirers, each of them must fulfil the high net worth criteria.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 would mean that the signed declaration to be made by the debtor or hirer at the time the credit is obtained could be separate from the agreement. The Government&#039;s concern is that the person should make the declaration of high net worth at the time the agreement is made. The best evidence for this is that the declaration is made as part of the agreement, so that it is perfectly clear that the person wants to take advantage of the exemption when he or she obtains the credit. Agreements made with high net worth individuals need not comply with the formal requirements of the Act and the regulations&#151;this is part of the reason why the exemption exists.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>Clause 3 simply provides that agreements with those wanting the exemption should include the declaration. The form of this will be specified in regulations. The Government believe that the solution proposed in Clause 3 provides the best means of clearly verifying that the person seeking the exemption wants the benefit of that exemption.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>The noble Lord&#039;s Amendment No. 4 is directed to permitting the debtor to self-certify as to their high net worth, but only in circumstances where the statement is made on the basis of &quot;independently verifiable documentation&quot;. The Government have considerable concerns about self-certification and the possibilities for abuse. The exemption is a general one, open to any consumer meeting the criteria. Equally, it applies to any lender&#151;whether a private bank or a small lender. Our concern about abuse is that unscrupulous lenders&#151;who want to avoid their obligations to consumers under the Act and the regulations to provide information and comply with the standards imposed in regulations&#151;will pressure consumers into self-certifying that they are high net worth individuals. Our concern is not primarily about those lenders who deal with genuinely high net worth individuals but those who lend to the vulnerable and who, seeing an opportunity to take advantage, will do so.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>For this reason we have required that the certification be made by a third party. The verification of the debtor&#039;s position is a matter for the person making the statement. It is that person who will consider the debtor&#039;s position and make the statement. They will provide the &quot;independent verification&quot;.

<a name="51108-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Amendment No. 5 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, would allow a statement of high net worth to be treated as current if made up to two years prior to the making of the agreement, rather than up to one year as is provided in Clause 3(3)(c) of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Some have argued that the requirement that the statement be made within one year prior to the agreement would be unduly onerous, so it should be extended to a period of two years. Noble Lords will appreciate that a lot can change in two years. By requiring a one-year period of currency, we are simply ensuring that the statement reasonably reflects the customer&#039;s current circumstances. By extending this period of currency we undermine the applicability of the statement to agreements made some distance in time from the time that it was made.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>It is also claimed that in relation to some agreements that are reviewed annually, for example, overdrafts, the requirement for current statements no more than a year old would be burdensome. Given that credit arrangements may be reviewed annually, the Government&#039;s view is that it is appropriate for the currency of the statement to reflect the interval imposed by the lender itself, and not rely on some older view of the customer&#039;s state of affairs. So if it is appropriate to review the credit arrangements annually, it is appropriate also to have a statement of high net worth on an annual basis.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>The Government understand the concerns of noble Lords about the potential for burdens on both debtors and creditors. We have tried to balance those things with the need for proper consumer protection. The Government believe that they have this balance right.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>The noble Lord&#039;s Amendment No. 6 would permit the statement, in circumstances where there are two or more debtors or hirers seeking the exemption, to be made in respect of one of them rather than both. No doubt some noble Lords may think this sensible in the case of a husband and wife. A perhaps unintended consequence of the amendment would be to permit debtors to club together and, provided that one of them meets the requirements, they will all be exempt. However, the Government do not agree that one statement should suffice in such cases. No joint debtor should be deprived of the protections of the Consumer Credit Act unless that debtor is a high net worth individual on his own account. To do otherwise could potentially leave consumers vulnerable to harm. To that end the Government&#039;s position is that each and every debtor involved in a transaction should have a statement made in respect of them, regardless of their relationship with the other joint debtors.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 7, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, would be to remove the ability of those persons using the high net worth exemption to seek redress where appropriate under the unfair relationships provisions of the Bill, which are set out in Clauses 19 to 22. The unfair relationships test will apply to all consumer credit agreements except for mortgages regulated by the FSA. This maintains the scope of the existing extortionate credit test, which applies to all credit transactions including pre-FSA mortgages.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51108-34_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>The Government&#039;s position is that no lender should be exempted from the ability to be challenged on the basis of an unfair relationship. A credit relationship is capable of being unfair regardless of whether it has been entered into by a high net worth individual or a person on state benefits. And, as the test applies in the context of the individual circumstances of each case, it can take account of the different issues at play in different types of credit transaction, including the degree of regulation applied to the transaction.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>The exemptions in the Bill are to reduce the impact of regulation in some cases, and to enable lenders to conclude agreements quickly. For this reason business has been generally supportive of the exemptions.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Noble Lords will appreciate that the right for a consumer to challenge a credit relationship because it is unfair does not impose a burden that does not otherwise exist on lenders. Lenders should not enter into unfair relationships, whatever the consumer&#039;s net worth or purpose. While I understand that the noble Lord seeks to reduce the burden of regulation on lenders, I hope that he and other noble Lords recognise that the exemptions for both high net worth and business lending are designed to do that. The disapplication of the unfair relationships test would not reduce the burden of regulation, but it would reduce consumer protection significantly. And consumers, of whatever status, are entitled to enjoy the same basic level of protection.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>I hope that this explanation of the Government&#039;s position on this clause will satisfy the noble Lord. On that basis, I ask him not to press Amendment No. 7.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>I shall deal with two other questions. The noble Lord raised the question of the territorial application of the Consumer Credit Act. The question of what national regulatory regime applies is not covered by the Act; it is covered by the Rome convention and other international instruments governing the applicable law for consumer transactions.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The noble Lord also spoke to Amendment No. 8. The new clause proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, raises the issue of the level of protection provided to unincorporated associations, partnerships and trusts. The Government have opted to retain the position in the 1974 Act regarding those bodies. The proposal for an exemption of high net worth individuals was set out in the DTI&#039;s consumer White Paper, which was published in December 2003. That built on previous consultations, including a consultation undertaken in November 2002 concerning financial limits and exemptions under the Act. The only expression of interest or concern that the Government received on this issue was in connection with the noble Lord&#039;s amendment. That was received only last Friday afternoon, so I think we are unsure about the need for the change.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>Furthermore, the Government&#039;s view is that the new clause may have limited effect in practice for two reasons. First, borrowing by these bodies for business purposes is protected only for transactions up to &#163;25,000. So the protection they receive is limited. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC138"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC138</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Secondly, an unincorporated association or partnership has no legal identity&#151;except from its individual members&#151;and cannot borrow money or hold property unless its purposes are charitable, in which case any property is usually held in trust. Thus, there may be practical difficulties in calculating the value of the net assets in such a body.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>With regard to trustees of the high value trust, the Government believe that this category of person is conceptually distinct from high net worth individuals. Trustees ultimately act in the interests of beneficiaries under a trust instrument. The new clause may impact on the protection afforded under the Act to such beneficiaries.
</p>

<a name="51108-34_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>Furthermore, given that the proposed clause removes consumer protection from a class of bodies currently protected under the Act, the Government, before making any decision, would need to understand the issue fully, including any potential benefits from such a course. For example, it could impact on associations that might be asset-rich in terms of land and buildings, but otherwise have small cash reserves. It could have implications in situations where, in the event of some call on the association&#039;s assets, the members become personally liable for any liabilities arising from the credit transaction. Given the absence of any pressure for such a change&#151;except, perhaps, the new clause tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall&#151;the Government do not believe that the amendment is currently justified on the basis of the evidence of the need for change. Should such pressure arise&#151;we do not consider that it exists at present&#151;and the results of a formal consultation support the need for change, the Government might reconsider their position. On that basis, I ask the noble Lord not to press Amendment No. 8.

I shall not detain the Committee as long on these amendments as I did on my previous amendments. To a considerable extent, these amendments mirror the amendments I tabled in Clause 3 with regard to high net worth individuals. These amendments relate to business lending.

</p>

<a name="51108-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>The purpose of the first two amendments&#151;which are very similar to those I moved in the previous clause&#151;is to determine that it is unnecessary for the declaration to be included in the agreement. As lenders will need to maintain a separate suite of agreements containing the specified declaration, there is no reason why the declaration should not be in a separate document. That would have the effect of reducing burdens on business without reducing consumer protection in any way. The third amendment is similar to an amendment I moved in the previous clause. It provides that new Section 16B(6) of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, which would continue to apply provisions relating to unfair relationships, should be removed with regard to business lending that is otherwise exempted under Section 16B. All the arguments that I used on the last amendment, which failed to persuade the Government, apply equally to this. While supporting the provisions on unfair relationships, we do not think that it is necessary to apply them to business arrangements that are otherwise exempt under the Act. I beg to move.

<a name="51108-35_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   The amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, will change the requirements that exist in relation to the manner in which the exemption for business lending is recognised by the lender. It may assist noble Lords if I explain the manner in which Clause 4 works. Clause 4 deals with the exemption of business lending from regulation under the Act. It inserts a new Section 16B into the Act to do that. Noble Lords should note that when I say &quot;lending&quot; or &quot;credit&quot; when speaking to this clause, I also mean &quot;hire&quot;.
</p>

<a name="51108-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>Clause 2 will have the effect of removing the financial limit above which credit is not regulated under the Act. That means that in future credit of any amount made available to consumers will be regulated except where specifically exempted under the Act. The new subsection (1) provides one such exemption. It states that the Act does not regulate consumer credit or consumer hire agreements for more than &#163;25,000 where that agreement is entered into wholly or predominantly for a business purpose. Agreements for business purposes of &#163;25,000 or less will continue to be regulated under the Act. But the effect of Clause 1 is that, in future, this will apply only where the borrower is a sole trader, an unincorporated association, or a partnership of three or fewer people.

</p>

<a name="51108-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>A &quot;business purpose&quot; is not defined. We believe that to try to do so would be unhelpful. It would either exclude from regulation some consumer transactions; or mean that many transactions that are for business purposes would continue to be regulated. The best persons to determine the purpose of the credit are the parties to the agreement.
</p>

<a name="51108-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>New subsection (2) provides that a person may make a declaration as part of the agreement that the credit is either wholly or predominantly for a business purpose. Such a declaration will give rise to a presumption that the borrowing is for business purposes and will serve to reduce any burden on the business to establish the purpose of the loan before extending credit. But under the new subsection (3) the presumption will not apply if the lender, or a person acting on his behalf, knows or reasonably suspects that the credit is not wholly or predominantly for a business purpose. The new subsection (5) provides that, where an agreement involves more than one lender, such knowledge on the part of one of them will bind them all.
</p>

<a name="51108-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>The Secretary of State may, under new subsection (4), make regulations setting out the form and content of the declaration as to a business purpose.

</p>

<a name="51108-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Turning to Amendments Nos. 9 and 10, I have explained to noble Lords the reasons why the Government were not minded to accept the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, in relation to the manner in which a debtor exercises the high net worth exemption. The Government will resist Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 for similar reasons.
</p>

<a name="51108-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Lenders are free to lay out the agreement in any way they see fit, provided that they comply with the requirements of the Act and with the regulations concerning the form and content of agreements. The clause provides that the declaration be part of the agreement. The requirements on the face of the Bill are sufficiently flexible so as to address any concerns about the need for additional suites of agreements for business lending. It leaves to regulation its form, content and the manner of signing those declarations. The Government will consult on the precise requirements and are keen to work with industry to ensure that the declaration may be made in a practical and cost-effective way.
</p>

<a name="51108-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 11 would be to remove those persons covered by the exemption for lending wholly or predominantly for business purposes from the application of the unfair relationships provisions of the Bill, which are set out in Clauses 19 to 22. This amendment therefore has a similar effect to the noble Lord&#039;s Amendment No. 7, which sought to remove the application of the unfair relationships test from lending covered by the high net worth exemption. The Government will resist the noble Lord&#039;s amendments for similar reasons, in essence because debtors should be entitled to challenge <br>&nbsp;<br>

I wonder how much extra work that will entail. I suspect that both parties to the loan would benefit from the facts declared in the mid-term statement. The amendment seeks to include loans from one year down to two months. I believe that most people can remember where they are, repayment-wise, during an eight-week period but not more. With more than eight weeks, it is easy to be unclear about the exact position unless every payment has been made absolutely routinely. How many borrowers can really match up to that?

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>I shall deal with the simplest amendment first, which is Amendment No. 13. I need add nothing to the words of the amendment; it permits the requirement to provide annual statements to be satisfied if the lender and borrower agree that information about the agreement can be accessed electronically by the borrower. That is straightforward, and the Government will say either yes or no; they do not require any further argument from me.
</p>

<a name="51108-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>So far as the other amendments are concerned, perhaps it is necessary for me to explain a little about the effect of Clause 6, which will require creditors in regulated fixed-sum credit agreements to provide debtors with annual statements in the specified form. If the creditor does not give the debtor an annual statement when required to do so, the creditor is not entitled to enforce the agreement during his non-compliance, and the debtor is not liable to pay a &quot;sum of interest&quot; during that period. The concern that I express relates to new Section 77A(6)(b), which will deal with the issue of interest and states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;the debtor shall have no liability to pay any sum of interest to the extent calculated by reference to the period of non-compliance or to any part of it&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>Despite many years as a lawyer, I cannot explain clearly what that means; I defy the many lawyers who entertain us so often in your Lordships&#039; House to do so. Nor is it clear how the provision would affect different types of credit, particularly where the credit is structured in such a way, as is sometimes the case, that interest is not spread evenly over the period of the loan. Without wishing to push the point too far, the clause could create the possibility of market distortions and could affect different credit products differently. All noble Lords will agree that this issue is complex.
</p>

<a name="51108-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>There is an irony in this amendment, and in further amendments that we and the Conservatives have tabled. We have bored the House for several years on the question of why the Government insist on doing things by regulation rather than by putting them on the face of the Bill, but there are many areas in the Bill where we think that it would be preferable for the Government to take power to deal with these issues by regulation rather than putting them on the face of the Bill, particularly where the clause is opaque at best.

<a name="51108-36_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   This group of amendments, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, and the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, concerns the provision of annual statements to debtors. I shall address the amendments in small groups as their Lordships&#039; amendments are directed to different purposes.
</p>

<a name="51108-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>Amendments Nos. 12 and 14, tabled by the noble Earl, concern the provision of statements to agreements of less than one year&#039;s duration. Amendment No. 13, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, concerns the electronic provision of statements and Amendments Nos. 15 and 16, also tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, concern the penalties that apply to a failure to provide statements.

</p>

<a name="51108-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, has emphasised an important issue by tabling his amendment. Consumers are entitled to be kept informed about their credit situation and the level of their indebtedness. The amendment provides that debtors will receive clear and concise information about their fixed-sum credit agreements on a regular basis.
</p>

<a name="51108-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>I will explain what we are seeking to achieve with Clause 6 of the Bill. It inserts a new Section 77A into the Consumer Credit Act 1974 which requires creditors to provide debtors with annual statements in respect of fixed-sum credit agreements that have a duration of more than one year&#151;that is agreements that carry on for more than one year, rather than those that have a term of more than one year specified in the contract. A fixed-sum credit agreement arises where a single amount of credit is repayable, usually over a fixed-term in regular instalments.
</p>

<a name="51108-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>Subsection (1) states that a creditor must provide a debtor with annual statements. The first statement must be provided within one year after the day on which the agreement was made. Subsequent statements must be provided at intervals of no more than one year after the previous statement was issued. It does not necessarily require statements to be issued on the anniversary of the agreement first being made, but permits the lender the flexibility to determine the date during the year that it will issue the statement. The Secretary of State will specify the form and content of annual statements in regulations to be made under the new subsection (2). These requirements will be consulted upon once the Bill becomes law. The new subsection (3) states that a creditor cannot impose a charge on the debtor for the cost of producing an annual statement. The new subsection (4) states that a creditor is not obliged to provide annual statements after the debtor has made his final payment. The obligation to provide a statement is intended to be self-enforcing.

</p>

<a name="51108-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>New Sections 77A (5) and (6) state that where a creditor does not give the debtor an annual statement <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC144"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC144</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

when required, the creditor is not entitled to enforce the agreement until a statement is provided; the creditor cannot charge interest during the time when no statement has been provided; and the debtor is not liable to pay any default sum that would have been payable during the period when the statement should have been provided or refers to a breach of the agreement which occurred during that period.
</p>

<a name="51108-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The default sum is defined by Clause 18 and includes any sum, except interest which will become payable by the debtor in connection with a breach of the agreement, such as a late payment charge. New subsection (7) defines the period of non-compliance which is the period from the day after the last day on which the statement is required until the end of the day when the creditor provides the statement. New subsection (8) makes it clear that the requirement for annual statements does not apply to non-commercial agreements&#151;that is agreements that are not made by the creditor in the course of business&#151;or to small agreements of &#163;50 or less. Debtors should be regularly informed of their financial situation, and this clause ensures that they are.
</p>

<a name="51108-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>I turn to Amendment Nos. 12 and 14, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, which form the first category of amendments in this group that I shall address. The Government have considered providing consumers with clear and relevant information in some detail. However, this is an area where we need to strike a balance between providing information to debtors and imposing requirements on lenders. The Government believe that in Clause 6 we have found a balance between those concerns and the practical issues associated with providing the required information. Agreements for periods of less than one year are generally for smaller amounts of money and are unsecured. Consumers with such agreements often use credit products that provide information about the loan in the form of account books which the consumer retains.
</p>

<a name="51108-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>I turn to the question raised about some of the bookkeeping being illegible. The OFT is an independent regulator, constituted under the Enterprise Act 2002. As such, I cannot commit the OFT to a position on the manner in which it would conduct its regulatory functions. There are also other transparency requirements intended to protect the debtor at key points&#151;arrears and defaults&#151;to ensure that potentially serious problems may be highlighted early and sorted out.
</p>

<a name="51108-36_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>In relation to larger loans over longer periods, a particular problem is that in many cases no information is provided. However, we recognise that all borrowers should receive information that they need at critical points when they are at risk of problems. For that reason, we shall require in the Bill that all lenders give consumers early information about arrears and default sums. As I said before, the Government believe that this policy recognises a balance between providing information and the administrative burden on lenders. The amendment tabled by the noble Earl would require lenders to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC145"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC145</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

repeat a lot of information that consumers already have in a different form. It would also require lenders, many of whom are at the smaller end of the scale in terms of business size, to issue statements at a specific time in relation to each agreement. For many lenders who have many loans of different durations, such an exercise could be complex. It could pose difficulties for small lenders with limited administrative resources, which are particularly common in this sector.
</p>

<a name="51108-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>Perhaps I can emphasise that point. The noble Earl wondered whether there would be a real difference in administration. If one envisages someone wishing to send out annual statements and doing so by reference to predetermined fixed dates for which their systems are geared up, if those systems then had to be tailored to each specific loan under this proposal, it would create a situation of quite a different scale. Imposing that kind of burden could limit the range of products available to consumers by decreasing the flexibility of products on offer and increasing their price, which could disadvantage those consumers who seek short-term credit. Lenders whose agreements last for more than one year will be required to provide annual statements. While the Government agree with the noble Earl that lenders should be transparent in all their dealings with consumers, the Government do not believe that this proposal balances the interests of consumers in receiving information with the potentially considerable administrative burden on lenders that this proposal would create.
</p>

<a name="51108-36_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>On Amendment No. 13, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, the Government understand the sentiment behind it and are keen to facilitate the information to consumers in the most appropriate and practical manner. However, the noble Lord&#039;s amendment is unnecessary. My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State made reference to this point in Standing Committee in the other place and explained that Amendment No. 13 is unnecessary because the Bill, and the current provisions in the CCA, do not prevent the statement being sent electronically and, in fact, facilitate electronic communications between debtors and creditors.
</p>

<a name="51108-36_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>New Section 77A (1) states that the creditor shall give the debtor the statement. &quot;Give&quot; is defined in Section 189 of the CCA as,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;deliver or send by an appropriate method to&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-36_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>and would, therefore, cover an electronic communication. The Consumer Credit Act 1974 (Electronic Communications) Order 2004 amended the definition of &quot;give&quot; to ensure that it covered electronic communications such as e-mails.
</p>

<a name="51108-36_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>The form of any statement under new Section 77A will be specified in regulations. Any regulations that are made under new Section 77A(2) will obviously be drafted in a manner consistent with Section 77A(1) and will not preclude the use of e-mail. Section 176A of the CCA also provides that the person to whom a document is being sent electronically must agree to it being sent to a particular electronic address and in a particular electronic form.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC146</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51108-36_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>The last category of amendments contained in this group concerns the penalties that apply to creditors who fail to provide statements as required under new Section 77A. The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, proposes in his Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 to allow the Secretary of State, by order, to specify the degree to which the debtor is liable to repay any interest in circumstances where the creditor has failed to provide a statement in accordance with new Section 77A.
</p>

<a name="51108-36_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>It may assist the Committee if I explain the manner in which the sanction for non-compliance with the obligation to provide annual statements works. The obligation to provide a statement is intended to be self-enforcing. New Sections 77A (5) and (6) state that where a creditor does not give the debtor an annual statement when required: the creditor is not entitled to enforce the agreement until a statement is provided; the creditor cannot charge interest which relates to the period during which the required statement has not been provided&#151;I understand that in certain circumstances that might be quite a complex calculation, but the principle is very clear; and the debtor is not liable to pay any default sum that would have been payable during the period when the statement should have been provided. A creditor either provides a statement in accordance with the section, or he does not. The Government&#039;s view is that there should be clear sanction for that failure to comply with the law. The clause as drafted provides that.
</p>

<a name="51108-36_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>There should also be one sanction. The Government do not believe that it can be argued that some debtors ought to be treated differently because of some difference in their situations or their agreements. Nor do the Government believe that the sanction should be diluted. Lenders will be required to provide statements. If they fail to do so, they should suffer a penalty. There is no scope for half-measures&#151;the statement must be provided as required. It is the Government&#039;s view that the penalty should be one which strikes most directly at the creditor&#039;s failure to provide the statement&#151;by removing the interest owing under the agreement&#151;and provides real encouragement to compliance. Noble Lords will appreciate that creditors do not have to incur these sanctions; they simply need to comply with new Section 77A.
</p>

<a name="51108-36_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>I hope that I have explained to noble Lords why these amendments are problematic for the Government. While our commitment to transparency is a strong one&#151;as shown by the penalties included in the Bill for non-compliance&#151;we are also very conscious of the need to ensure that the obligations are not unduly onerous for business. Accordingly, I ask that noble Lords withdraw their amendments.

<a name="51108-37_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </b>   The Minister said that my proposal to extend this period from 12 months to two months would be too difficult, or too difficult for the professionals in the industry. Have the professionals had more of the ministerial ear than people who work in debt counselling and those who must take up these loans? I fared better with my <br>&nbsp;<br>

question about illegible and incomprehensible records. While I appreciate that the Minister cannot commit the Office of Fair Trading, I hope that he will encourage it to look further at this matter.
</p>

<a name="51108-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>I picked up the idea that someone with a loan for than 12 months could get a statement if they were in arrears. Perhaps I did not hear the Minister correctly. I was not very impressed by the idea that it was going to be too complex. Is not the nature of the business that you decide to make hundreds of loans of small amounts? That is what you decide to do. A shopkeeper who decides to sell lots of things for 25p has to record all those sales. That is the nature of the business.
</p>

<a name="51108-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>I have a final suggestion. It is not beyond the wit of man, and it has happened before. As this is a United Kingdom Bill, certain things could be tried in various parts of the country. I recall the community charge in Scotland and compulsory seatbelts in Northern Ireland. Is it possible within the legislation to run a trial in Scotland of extending the period to two months? Could the Bill cope with that?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="51108-37_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   I will take the points individually. I understand the point the noble Earl makes in suggesting that it is too difficult for professionals. In the Bill, we seek to strike a balance between proper protection for the consumer and not unreasonable burdens on lenders. I repeat the point: there is a real difference between a business being able to set out in advance when it wants to send out its statements and having to tailor specific requirements for each loan, other than in circumstances where there are events of potential default and arrears where other provisions kick in.
</p>

<a name="51108-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>The noble Earl suggested that we might trial the provision in Scotland. If it is administratively difficult to do so nationally, to encourage lenders to try it with the additional burden of identifying where the lender or the borrower is in relation to Scotland will add an even greater burden. I think that on reflection he will see that. For those reasons, we would still ask for the amendment to be withdrawn.

</p>

<a name="51108-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>The only point I make in response to the Minister is that, with respect&#151;and as we all know we only say that when we fundamentally disagree with what he has said&#151;I do not think that he actually answered my point about the inadequacies of new Section 77A(6)(b). We were not arguing that there should be a reduction in the sanction on the creditor who fails to provide the statement. The substance of our argument was that as new Section 77A(6)(b) is drafted, it will be very difficult to ascertain to what extent the sanction applies to the debtor in relation to the payment of interest. We say that the paragraph is opaquely drafted, which is why we suggested that the calculation and how it should work should be dealt with by regulation.

<p><a name="st_23"></a>The noble Lord said: We are now getting into more substantive consumer protection issues. Amendment No. 17, which is a probing amendment to test how the Government see this issue, is quite straightforward. We submit that when the millions of people who owe the billions of pounds on their credit card statements make part payments, quite often it is not clear to what extent part payments are being applied to the different transactions that have taken place within those credit card statements; for example, balance transfers, cash advances or cheques issued by a credit company drawn on by individuals. The purpose of the amendment&#151;which I appreciate is crudely drawn but is nevertheless succinct&#151;is to flesh out whether the Government believe that there should be further legislation protecting individuals to make it clear that a credit card company ought to apply first to the lowest interest-bearing balances within an account if a part payment is being made.

Committee, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, will forgive me if I ask for a point of clarification. Are we absolutely clear that what is intended in the amendment is that payments should be allocated to the lowest rather than the highest interest-bearing balances? As I understand it, that seems to be unnecessarily hard on the borrower, especially for a Liberal Democrat amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="51108-37_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   I should put that down to a mistype. It should say the highest. As it is a probing amendment, I am sure that Members of the Committee will bear with me.

<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="51108-37_spnew8"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   The Government recognise the need for consumers to receive information about the implications of not making repayments or only making part payments on running account agreements. Those were issues raised by the Treasury Select Committee in the other place and the Government have sought to address them through Clause 7.
</p>

<a name="51108-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>The noble Lord&#039;s amendment on the allocation of part payments is timely, and the Government are aware of concerns about the practice and the degree to which consumers understand that it occurs and how it applies. The Government see transparency as an important issue. That is why&#151;in the regulations concerning the form and content of agreements&#151;the Government have required lenders to make clear the terms of the agreement, including how payments will be allocated, and to ensure that such key information is prominent so that it is brought to the attention of debtors. The intention of Clause 7 is to ensure that debtors are made aware of the potential hazards of behaviour associated with either not making repayments or making only part payments.
</p>

<a name="51108-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>Clause 7(1) allows the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring additional information to be included in the statements given to debtors. The power is quite broad, and the department will consult about the form of those warnings with interested stakeholders before the Secretary of State makes any regulations. We will take into account any views that emerge during that consultation to the effect that the regulations should, as the noble Lord suggests, contain a warning concerning part payments made in circumstances where that payment will be allocated to the lowest interest-bearing part of the account.
</p>

<a name="51108-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>If, having considered those views and any opposing ones, the Government believe that such a warning is necessary and justified, it may be prescribed. However, I cannot commit the Government to such a course at this stage. We believe that the clause is broad enough to cover a warning of the type proposed by the noble Lord. With that in mind, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

&quot;CALCULATION OF INTEREST

<br>
(1)   Section 78 of the 1974 Act (duty to give information to debtor under running-account credit agreement) is amended as follows.


<br>
(2)   After subsection (1)(c) there is inserted&#151;


<br>

<p><a name="st_29"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 18 is grouped with Amendment No. 20, standing in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, and the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley. In different ways, we are both trying to address the same issue, which is how to calculate interest in an agreement. There will be common ground, certainly between us, that in very many credit agreements the calculation of interest is unsatisfactory, opaque and not consistent with the way in which interest is calculated by other lenders. There are many ways in which we can approach the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that we are the only western democratic country that puts the stress on the APR&#151;annual percentage rate. I am not sure that other countries attempt to calculate annual percentage rate. I may be wrong, but certainly a lot of them do not. The probable reason for that is that it is often very difficult to calculate and is calculated inconsistently by different lenders. This is a probing amendment to seek how far the Government are prepared to go to better define the calculation of interest for the purpose of these agreements. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="51108-38_spnew2"></a><b> Lord De Mauley: </b>   We concur with the spirit of Amendment No. 18 proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, but it is not necessarily immediately related to Amendment No. 20. The purpose of Amendment No. 20 is to require the Secretary of State to make regulations defining the meaning of APR&#151;the annual percentage rate&#151;which is supposed to inform the debtor of the rate of interest that he is paying on a loan or credit card account. The problem is more acute for credit card debts than for simple loans and hire purchase agreements, because in the latter cases there is often a fixed amount of interest added to the loan and then the total is divided by the number of months over which the debt is due to be repaid.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>Even that supposedly simple situation can become confused when the creditor has the right to vary the rate of interest throughout the period of the loan or when the lender adopts the practice, which some do, of calculating the amount of capital outstanding at, say, the beginning of a year and then adding a year&#039;s interest to it. I am not suggesting for one moment that any of the various practices are in any way reprehensible or wrong. It is simply that they are inconsistent with each other or, rather, that they are <br>&nbsp;<br>

confusing and make it impossible for a lay person who is not an accountant or an actuary to work out precisely the rate of interest that he is being asked to pay.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>The situation is even more difficult than that because different creditors have different ways of calculating their APR. It is even the case that creditors may use different rates of APR in the same advertisements or a series of advertisements advertising different financial products. The Consumers&#039; Association, in its magazine <i>Which?</i>, has described the variables that may be employed in calculating APR, which include from the date of a purchase; from the date that the debit is posted; when the statement is issued; when the payment is made; or allowing for new purchases during a promotional interest-free period.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>It has been put to me that providing for a standard method of calculating APR is anti-competitive, but we contest that. What is uncompetitive is a situation where the customer cannot compare one with another and cannot know where one lender is in reality charging more or less than that other. The laudable element of encouraging competition comes in when all the suppliers of credit talk the same language&#151;that is, where the APR of X per cent for credit card A is exactly the same as that of credit card B&#151;and the debtor can see which lender is charging more or less than another.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>It is a regrettable fact that most members of the public could not tell you what APR means if you were to ask them. I also regret to say that from my own modest, empirical observations&#151;to the shame of our educational system&#151;large numbers of the public do not even understand what percentages are or how they work. But most people will know that 10 per cent is less than 12 per cent. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure absolute clarity. It does not seek to impose any specific rate of interest on the industry. It can charge whatever it likes or whatever the market will stand. All that it will be required to do is to calculate and advertise rates in a uniform way with others in the same field. I have no doubt that in fixing the method of calculating the APR, the Secretary of State will consult to the fullest possible extent with industry and either come up with a consensus or, more likely, find a consistent formula acceptable to a substantial portion of them.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>We thought very carefully about the sanction for a failure of a creditor to apply the correct method of calculating APR as sanctioned by the Secretary of State. The simple sanction would be that the agreement would be deemed to be an unfair agreement within the meaning of Section 19. That in turn will bring into play Section 20, which gives the court the opportunity to modify the terms of the agreement. If the court decided that in a specific case the misstatement of the APR was inadvertent or immaterial, it could take that into account in making any order. However, a creditor that persistently misstated the APR could be subjected to sanctions by the OFT. This is not an amendment against competition in the industry. On the contrary, it will <br>&nbsp;<br>

heighten it by making it more open and transparent. But, above all, the amendment would makes things, especially what debtors are paying by way of interest, more understandable. That cannot be a bad thing.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="51108-38_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   Amendments Nos. 18 and 20 concern issues of transparency. I will deal with each of the amendments in turn. Amendment No. 18, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, is concerned with the information that consumers need to make informed decisions about credit products. Transparency of information for the consumer has been at the heart of the Government&#039;s approach to consumer credit reforms.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>New regulations are already in force, which require consumers to be given pre-contract information about the key features of credit products. That will help consumers to shop around for better credit products and will serve to increase competition in the UK. The Government have also revised the regulations on the form and content of credit agreements. These prescribe equal prominence throughout the credit agreement, so that lenders can no longer hide details away in small print. They also provide that certain key information about the agreement is included up-front. The noble Lord&#039;s amendment is more concerned with post-contract transparency.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>The 1974 Act has limited requirements dealing with post-contract information. Those are primarily limited to information about running account credit agreements and, more generally, situations of default. The Bill will address that significant deficit in information provided to consumers. As Members of the Committee will know, the Bill includes provisions requiring lenders to provide more information to debtors during the life of the loan. The Committee will know that a lack of information can cause serious problems. All too often debtors do not know their true debt position and that, in turn, can lead to a significant increase in the amount owing.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>The new information requirements will mean that debtors receive, where appropriate, regular information about the state of their credit account; arrears; default sums; whether they are incurring interest on judgment debts and how much interest they have incurred; and how to deal with debt management problems. Many lenders already provide much of that information, but we want to ensure that all lenders provide clear, concise information to consumers. We will consult on the content of new information requirements and the form in which it should be provided, which will be implemented through secondary legislation.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>Turning to the specific purpose of the noble Lord&#039;s amendment, I draw the attention of Members of the Committee to Section 78(4) of the 1974 Act and to the Consumer Credit (Running Account Credit Information) Regulations 1983, made under that provision. Section 78(4) requires lenders to provide debtors with regular statements about a running account credit agreement, including prescribed information about the state of the account. The information prescribed in the 1983 regulations <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC153"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC153</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

includes, among other things, the amount of any interest payable by them and applied to the account during the period to which the statement relates.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>The regulations further provide that, where the statement shows that interest has been applied to the account during the period to which the statement relates, the debtor shall be given sufficient information to be able to check the calculation of the amount of the interest that has been applied; or a statement concerning the rate of interest which has been used to calculate the amount of the interest so applied; or a statement that the rate of interest which has been used to calculate the amount of the interest so applied will be provided by the creditor on request, together with a clear explanation of the manner in which the amount of the interest so applied has been calculated.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>In setting out additional information requirements under the Bill, we need to strike a balance between what is reasonable for the lender to provide and what information will be of most benefit to the consumer. We need to bear in mind information requirements that already exist. While the Government agree with the noble Lord that lenders should be transparent in all their dealings with consumers, they do not believe that this proposal would provide consumers with any additional information rights as compared with those that already exist under the running account regulations.


</p>

<a name="51108-38_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>Amendment No. 20, which was tabled by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, seeks to do two things. First, it seeks to provide that the Secretary of State shall be empowered to specify in regulations the method in which an annualised percentage rate must be calculated. It also provides that if the rate is not so calculated, the credit relationship that it relates to shall be &quot;deemed&quot; to be an unfair one. That there should be a standard method by which annualised percentage rates are calculated is an important and necessary measure, and it is something that the Government have done. I draw the attention of the Committee to Section 20 of the 1974 Act, which provides that the Secretary of State may make regulations,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;for determining the true cost to the debtor of the credit provided . . . under an actual or prospective consumer credit agreement&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>It also permits the Minister to prescribe what may be taken into account when making that calculation, and what method should be used when making the calculation.
<a name="time_4"></a>
<a name="51108-38_time0"></a><h5>4.45 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="51108-38_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>Members of the Committee will understand that the Minister has the power to specify in regulations the method by which the total charge for credit&#151;the presently accepted method of which is the annualised percentage rate or APR&#151;may be calculated. Thus subsection (1) in the amendment is not needed. The Minister has exercised that power through the Consumer Credit (Total Charge for Credit) Regulations&#151;they were amended in 1999 after extensive public consultation&#151;to standardise the manner in which APRs are calculated. In addition, in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC154"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC154</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

2004 new rules were introduced in relation to the way in which APRs are to be used in advertising and other pre-contract disclosure.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>The second point on Amendment No. 20 relates to the provisions on unfair relationships, which we shall discuss later in more detail. The Government&#039;s position is that an unfair relationship cannot be defined in every circumstance as simply being the presence of one thing. The provisions in the Bill are designed to provide consumers with a means to obtain redress in relationships that are unfair. Whether a relationship between a creditor and a debtor is unfair will depend on the circumstances of the individual case.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>The point that the amendment seeks to make is that, if an APR is not calculated or disclosed in the specified manner, the relationship will automatically be deemed unfair. That cannot be right. The APR may not be disclosed properly, but that may not disadvantage the debtor&#151;indeed, it could be to his advantage. The arbitrary approach adopted by the amendment would simply deem such conduct to amount to an unfair relationship, even when there was no unfairness. The amendment proposes that a procedural issue should, in effect, conclusively define whether the substance of the relationship is unfair. The test is about permitting the court to examine the substance of the relationship and not just its form. It is general because there are many ways in which unfair relationships can manifest, and we want the courts to have a test that is flexible enough to tackle them.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>The amendment also seeks to deploy the provisions on unfair relationships as a specific sanction for non-compliance with a part of the Act. The 1974 Act already sets out penalties flowing from a failure to comply with the requirements on the total charge for credit. Those penalties are appropriate to the particular non-compliance with the Act. It may be that not complying with the Act&#039;s requirements about APRs is relevant to the question of whether there is an unfair relationship, but it is not and cannot be determinative.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>The standard calculation of APRs is important, as recognised in powers given to the Minister in Section 20 of the 1974 Act. But the amendments are either not necessary or impose inappropriate sanctions for a failure to comply with the Act&#039;s requirements. Accordingly, I ask that the noble Lord withdraw his amendment.
</p>

<a name="51108-38_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>There was particular comment about what had been prescribed in the way in which APRs are calculated. The Government believe that businesses should be able to determine the manner in which interest is applied to accounts, otherwise businesses would lose an important element of product differentiation. I hope that that will satisfy the Committee. In relation to some of the specifics of the APR calculations, if Members of the Committee were happy to send us some examples we could have a chance to look at them.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>After Clause 7, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_4"></a><br>
   &quot;PRIOR CONSENT OF DEBTOR

<br>
   In section 78 of the 1974 Act (duty to give information to debtor under running-account credit agreement) after subsection (3) insert&#151;


<br>
&quot;(3A)   The creditor has a duty to ascertain information from the debtor that he has given prior consent before&#151;


<br>
(a)   the distribution of credit card cheques from the creditor to the debtor,


<br>
(b)   the limits on a debtor&#039;s credit card or equivalent are increased by the creditor.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_34"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment provides for the insertion of a new clause, and again goes to the heart of consumer protection. I am obliged for the briefing and representations made by citizens advice bureaux on the issue. As I am sure that the Committee will agree, they are at the sharp end of what I might call sharp marketing practices, because they are the people who often have to deal with their victims. In their view one of the problems&#151;which I believe the Bill touches on&#151;is the need to discourage irresponsible borrowing and to encourage responsible borrowing by individuals. The hardship and the tragedies which result from irresponsible borrowing&#151;which often end up in citizens advice bureaux&#151;are often due to sharp practices on the part of irresponsible lenders leading to personal financial difficulties for the borrower. They argue strongly that no one should be sent an unsolicited credit card cheque and no one should be given an unsolicited increase in their credit card limit or its equivalent.
</p>

<a name="51108-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>Leaving aside the obvious point about forcing people often at the bottom end of the credit ladder into unnecessary debt, they make three specific points. First, additional charges levied by the card companies through higher interest rates are often charged on cheques rather than on card purchases because they are treated as cash advances which, for many lenders, carry a higher interest burden. For those at the bottom of the income ladder that is often an unknown charge that they then have to bear. Secondly, it is all too easy for consumers to see credit card cheques as the equivalent to cash in the bank rather than as an expensive and sub-optimal means of borrowing money. People simply think that they have cash in the bank and that they can write a cheque. When the interest rate charge comes in at the end of the month, it is unexpected. I am sure that Members of the Committee will be aware that the joint and several liability protection afforded to UK consumers under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 does not necessarily apply to credit card cheques in the same way that it does to credit card purchases.
</p>

<a name="51108-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>I move this as a probing amendment, but it is an issue that the citizens advice bureaux and others regard as important. I look forward with interest to hearing the Minister&#039;s response. I beg to move.

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC156</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

credit agreements&#151;which are agreements like credit and store card accounts&#151;in relation to a &quot;duty&quot; to ascertain that the debtor has consented to the provision of credit card cheques and any increases to the debtor&#039;s credit limit.
</p>

<a name="51108-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>The Government are giving careful consideration to the issues that the noble Lord raises and believe that while it is important that consumers have access to fair and affordable credit, it is imperative that lenders behave responsibly. First, I will discuss the part of the amendment that concerns the distribution of credit card cheques. The noble Lord is no doubt aware that the issue was raised during earlier stages of the Bill&#039;s progress through Parliament and was also considered by the Treasury Select Committee&#039;s inquiry on credit card charges and marketing.
</p>

<a name="51108-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>Since then the department has been engaged in discussions with a range of stakeholders. Following on from those discussions a consultation paper is due to be published shortly that will consider whether further steps should be taken concerning the regulation of credit card cheques. Among other things, the consultation will seek to find any specific evidence of consumer detriment as a result of the issuing and marketing of credit card cheques. If action is to be taken, it is important that we establish such a link to justify the need for legislative intervention. That is particularly necessary given that much of the debate to date has been concentrated on what I might call the &quot;irritation factor&quot; associated with such cheques.
</p>

<a name="51108-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>I do not want to prejudge the outcome of the consultation but I think that it is fair to acknowledge that the industry has recognised it needed to implement measures to improve best practice concerning credit card cheques. The Banking Code and its guidance for subscribers as well as the APACS best practice guidelines have been amended to try to address those concerns. A number of new requirements are now in place. In particular, credit card cheques are now to be sent only to qualifying cardholders. That means that they should not be sent out to customers who are in arrears or over limit; customers with a limited scope to borrow more; and accounts where there are problems of fraud or procedures pending to deal with lost or stolen cards. Furthermore, the Banking Code now provides a right for consumers to opt-out of receiving credit card cheques if they wish.
</p>

<a name="51108-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>I turn to the second part of the noble Lord&#039;s amendment, regarding credit limit increases. That matter is also now dealt with in the Banking Code and the APACS best practice guidelines. In particular, the latter provide that lenders should carry out appropriate checks on customers&#039; ability to repay before increasing credit limits and that any increase should always be in proportion to the customer&#039;s risk profile. Nor should credit limit increases be offered to customers who are in arrears or to those who fall below credit scoring thresholds. That issue was discussed by my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State when he met with APACS&#151;the industry body representing card issuers&#151;in July of this year. My honourable friend also made it plain that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC157"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC157</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Government were watching industry&#039;s progress on this issue with considerable interest. APACS is looking at ways of ensuring that all lenders covered by the Banking Code will adhere to the best practice guidelines to prevent increases being made to at-risk and vulnerable consumers.
</p>

<a name="51108-39_para7"></a>

<a name="51108-39_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon </b>   moved Amendment No. 21:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>Page 14, line 16, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_5"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   Regulations may make provision indicating the circumstances in which the relationship between the creditor and debtor may be regarded as unfair.&quot;

<p><a name="st_38"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 21, 22, 23 and 24, all of which relate to the concept of unfair relationships between creditors and debtors. The victim of the unfairness is likely only to be the debtor. The clause, in introducing the concept of unfair relationships, is seeking to protect debtors against creditors, who are presumed to be in the stronger position. Clause 19 gives the court power to determine whether, in the circumstances of a case, the relationship between the parties is unfair to the debtor. This principle is found in new Clause 140A(2), which is being added to the 1974 Act. It allows the court to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;have regard to all matters it thinks relevant&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>I should mention in passing that Clause 20, with which this amendment is not concerned, describes the consequences of such a determination of unfairness. Very sensibly, the clause does not attempt to describe all the circumstances in which an agreement could be regarded as unfair. As I have just said, under new subsection (2) that is left to the discretion of the court, depending on the facts of the case. However, despite rightly leaving open the question of what in the abstract is or can be described as unfair, there is no reason why, if we can pinpoint specific instances where something obviously and unarguably is unfair, we should not define it in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="51108-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>The four amendments to which I am speaking seek to put specific clothes on the general terms of the clause without interfering with the concept of generally leaving matters to the court in all cases. Amendment No. 21 introduces a new subsection which empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations to establish further defined grounds under which an agreement should be deemed unfair. The previous Consumer Credit Bill is, as we all know, more than 30 years old. We do not wish to wait another <br>&nbsp;<br>

Any such new regulations provide flexibility but will require parliamentary approval.

</p>

<a name="51108-39_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>Amendment No. 22 slightly modifies the discretion given to the court when it decides whether an agreement is fair. In addition to taking into account all matters that it thinks relevant, the court is also to consider whether the part of the agreement that is complained about is in plain, intelligible language. It will still be up to the court to decide, in its complete discretion, what is clear and intelligible.
</p>

<a name="51108-39_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>Amendment No. 23 follows from that. It provides that if the court decides that the language of the agreement is clear and intelligible to the debtor, the onus of providing that the agreement is unfair is shifted to the debtor instead of the creditor having to prove that it is fair. That brings me to the main part of my amendment to Clause 19. The amendment introduces a new section to the 1974 Act, which my marginal note describes as &quot;the duty of creditors&quot;. In essence, the duty it imposes on creditors is the simple, sensible and appropriate one of requiring creditors to make inquiries about the ability of the debtor to pay before granting credit or an increase in credit.
</p>

<a name="51108-39_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>At Second Reading, I reminded your Lordships of the notorious Meadows case where an original liability of just &#163;5,750 ballooned to a staggering &#163;384,000. The court used judicial ingenuity to cancel that debt. I also referred to the case of a student, Rose Heiney, who was approved for her third gold card in two months, which had a credit limit of &#163;6,000 and drawing facilities of &#163;500 per day in cash.
</p>

<a name="51108-39_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>For practical and commercial reasons I have provided for some obvious exceptions from this rule of checking the debtor&#039;s ability to pay. They are: clearing banks; mortgages to building societies and similar organisations; hire-purchase agreements involving less than &#163;1,000, which the Secretary of State can increase from time to time with inflation; and any financial organisation granted special exemption by the OFT, which will cover, for example, reputable overseas banks, pawnbrokers and loans by individuals.
</p>

<a name="51108-39_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>I must tell your Lordships that one credit card company complained to me that exempting clearing banks was an unfair advantage. It also told me that it invariability made full inquiries before issuing a card and setting limits. I thought, &quot;Good for them, but what&#039;s their problem?&quot;. Any reputable organisation not being one of those I have suggested should automatically be exempted. It can apply to the OFT for exemption under proposed new subsection (2)(d). I do not think that I said that very well, but I was trying to say that if there was a company that I had not mentioned as an exemption, it could apply.

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>Even where there is no exemption from the section, either automatically or by licence from the OFT, complying with the provisions of this new clause is not onerous. Proposed new subsection (5) requires the potential creditor to make only,

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>The provision goes even further to modify the creditor&#039;s obligation to make enquiries. He is allowed to rely on any written statements of the debtor that are not manifestly incorrect or improbable. On the other hand, it will be of no use for a creditor to accept without proof&#151;as happened in the Rose Heiney case&#151;that a student living in digs is in receipt of an annual income of tens of thousands of pounds a year or possesses assets worth millions of pounds.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>To facilitate the checking of information provided by a potential debtor, subsection (6) allows the Data Protection Registrar to allow the exchange of information between creditors on the credit history of a particular applicant. The sanction for non-compliance with this section&#151;the failure to check the credit worthiness of the potential debtor&#151;is that the transaction shall then be presumed to be unfair. However, even that sanction is modified in the creditor&#039;s favour since the section allows the presumption to be contravened in appropriate cases. I beg to move.

<a name="51108-40_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   The Government do not think that the approach set out in Amendment No. 21 is appropriate. We believe that it would undermine the effectiveness of the unfair relationship provisions. I believe it would assist noble Lords if I briefly explained the Government&#039;s position in relation to the test and the need to define unfair relationships.
</p>

<a name="51108-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>The new test is general so that it can catch all unfair relationships. It does not exist in a vacuum&#151;Parliament and Ministers have already specified in other legislation those terms and practices that are unfair when considered alone. The new test is broader and is directed at looking at the substance of the relationship between the debtor and the creditor. This consideration will depend on the circumstances of the particular case. The court can consider anything that is relevant in deciding that there is an unfair relationship. Therefore, we do not want to give undue emphasis to some things by spelling them out, as this could mean that in practice the range of issues that the court considers is limited. It is not possible to define an unfair relationship as being certain things, or combinations of specific types of conduct, without limiting it in some way. That would serve to reduce the effectiveness of the test and the ability of the court to tackle unfair relationships&#151;whatever form they take.
</p>

<a name="51108-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>This type of approach meant the old test did not work for consumers. The test means that lenders have to look beyond simply complying with procedural rules, to ensuring that the substance of the relationship is not unfair. The Government believe that it is possible to lend fairly to anyone; it simply requires the <br>&nbsp;<br>

lender to ensure that the relationship with the consumer in the particular case is not unfair when considered as a whole.
</p>

<a name="51108-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>Amendment No. 21 proposes that the Minister can specify those things that would indicate that a practice is unfair. It does not say what regard the court should have to such an indication. In addition to questioning the underlying approach, the amendment does not address all that the noble Baroness wants. It is important to draw the attention of noble Lords to a court decision in relation to the extortionate credit test that highlights the dangers of the approach suggested by the noble Baroness in the amendment. In <i>Broadwick Securities </i>v<i> Spencer,</i> the Court of Appeal was asked to consider an &quot;extortionate&quot; practice by the lender. The practice complained about did not fall within the list of factors set out in the existing Section 138 of the Act. The debtor asked the court whether the practice could come under Section 138(2)(c) on &quot;any other relevant considerations&quot;.
</p>

<a name="51108-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>The lender&#151;in this case offering a &quot;variable rate&quot;&#151;had as its policy not to reduce the rate of interest if market rates fell. It did not tell that to the debtor when making the agreement. The court was not prepared to look at &quot;any other relevant considerations&quot; broadly. It considered that it should read this catch-all category in the light of the other factors listed in the Act, so it gave &quot;other relevant considerations&quot; a narrow meaning. It is a good example of the dangers of thinking that &quot;grey lists&quot; or &quot;factors&quot; can address all cases. The case was not appealed to the House of Lords and so remains conclusive on this issue.
</p>

<a name="51108-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>The approach suggested in this amendment has serious limitations. It would encourage a tick-box mentality among lenders, who can go on thinking that as long as they comply with formal rules they can ignore the substance of credit relationships. The test is about the substance, and not simply the form, of credit relationships. It could also mean that those debtors whose circumstances are not specifically identified receive reduced protection because the Secretary of State has not at some previous time decided that the innovative methods used by a lender to exploit consumers are indicative of an unfair relationship.
</p>

<a name="51108-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Most importantly, the proposal ignores the fundamental principle underlying the Government&#039;s approach. Lenders already have lots of lists telling them what not to do when dealing with consumers. They need only look at: the Consumer Credit Act; the unfair contract terms regulations; the new Unfair Commercial Practices Directive and the domestic legislation that will flow from that; and other laws and regulations which regulate the interaction of businesses with consumers, such as those dealing with trade descriptions or fair trading. Lenders do not need another list of specific practices as those are already made clear in other legislation, although complying with all of them will not necessarily mean that a relationship is fair.
</p>

<a name="51108-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>On Amendment No. 22, lenders are subject to specific requirements under the Consumer Credit (Agreements)(Amendment) Regulations 2004 <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC161"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC161</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

concerning both the form and the content of agreements. As noble Lords will appreciate, what a lender considers plain and intelligible can be very different to what a consumer, no matter how sophisticated, can understand. The Government have sought to address that, as lenders are required under the Act to have agreements that comply with the specific transparency requirements in all circumstances. Those requirements are designed to make agreements plain and intelligible to consumers by making them transparent. This is one of the many problems that the Government are tackling in their reforms to the United Kingdom&#039;s consumer credit laws.
</p>

<a name="51108-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>I can explain what the Government think that the effect of the amendment will be. No other factors like this are identified on the face of the new unfair relationships test. If this factor were included, it would elevate it to a significance that it did not deserve, and could suggest that if an agreement were in plain and intelligible language it was not an unfair relationship. That could not be right. It is perfectly possible for a lender to treat a debtor unfairly despite the plainest and most intelligible of agreements. Given the breadth of the unfairness test, it would be open to the court to take that factor into account in any event.
</p>

<a name="51108-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>I have already explained the Government&#039;s concerns about Amendment No. 22, and those concerns apply equally to Amendment No. 23. If I may summarise, the use of clear and intelligible language cannot be said to indicate categorically the fairness of a relationship, even if only on a <i>prima facie</i> basis. Lenders can and do exploit consumers using the plainest of language. That is not to say that the form of the agreement&#151;which noble Lords will recall must be in compliance with the regulations governing the form and content of agreements&#151;may not be a relevant factor, but that is all that it can be.
</p>

<a name="51108-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>The amendment seeks to put the burden of proof on the debtor who has raised the issue of an unfair relationship, in relation to those agreements where the court concludes the agreement was in clear and intelligible language. Proposed new Section 140B(10) provides that the debtor must allege that an unfair relationship exists before the creditor must show that it is not. Under the existing extortionate credit test, the burden of proving that the credit bargain is not extortionate lies with the creditor, and we are not changing that approach. We consider that this is essential. It ensures that consumers do not find it prohibitively difficult to bring a case under the new test. We acknowledge that access to justice can be an issue, and to a very great extent that should be ameliorated by the existence of the alternative dispute resolution scheme in the Bill. But we want the new test to be accessible and to be an effective redress for consumers.
</p>

<a name="51108-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>The amendment would impose a new hurdle for debtors that had little to do with the substance of the relationship, and would mean that many debtors who might have clear and intelligible agreements&#151;but unfair relationships&#151;were faced with a huge job in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC162"></a>

proving that the lender behaved badly, no matter how clear and intelligible the terms of the agreement might be. Lenders are better placed to show that their conduct is not unfair. Furthermore, consumers have practical problems in accessing relevant information. The issue of the burden of proof is important, and I hope that the explanation provides noble Lords with a clearer understanding of the Government&#039;s proposals.
</p>

<a name="51108-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>Amendment No. 24 seeks in effect to introduce a duty to lend responsibly. It then goes further, and sets out various exemptions from that duty. I shall first deal with the Government&#039;s position on the responsible lending duty and then with the proposal put forward by the noble Baroness that some lenders may be exempted from that duty. Previously, in relation to the Government&#039;s position on proposals to specify what constitutes an unfair relationship, I have explained our objections to such an approach. Our position on a responsible lending duty is not dissimilar. All lenders should behave responsibly when lending. The amendment could have the effect that, if certain things are done, it will be difficult to argue that that does not in all cases amount to responsible lending. Whether lending is responsible will depend on the debtor&#039;s personal circumstances and on the type of transaction involved.

<a name="51108-40_time0"></a><h5>5.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="51108-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>Any duty to loan responsibly would mean specifying what is and is not responsible lending. However, if we were to take the route of specifying what is and is not responsible lending, which the Government do not believe is appropriate, we would need to do so with some degree of detail. The amendment does not do that and so highlights the problem of such an approach. A list of things that lenders must do is not enough. It would encourage a tick-box mentality, with lenders assuming that because a number of specified procedural steps have been undertaken they are somehow responsible lenders. A lender may undertake those steps, but that does not mean that the underlying relationship is fair or that the lender has lent responsibly in a particular case.
</p>

<a name="51108-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>The next component of the amendment is the proposed exemption of whole categories of lending from the noble Baroness&#039;s suggested duty to lend responsibly. I propose to address this matter, not because the Government accept that an explicit duty to lend responsibly is in any way appropriate, but because it seems necessary to make clear the Government&#039;s position on the suggestion that we can impose differing standards of conduct on different categories of lender. The Government do not accept that we can attempt to impose general duties that apply only to lenders who are regarded as having a tendency to harmful behaviour. The point of regulation in this sector is that all lenders have at least the potential to enter into credit relationships that are unfair and that harm consumers.

<a name="51108-41_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   I was explaining that the Government cannot accept that we can attempt to impose general duties that apply only to lenders who are regarded as having a tendency to harmful behaviour. The point of regulation in the sector is that all lenders have at least the potential to enter into credit relationships that are unfair and that harm consumers. That is as true of high street banks and building societies as it is of doorstep lenders. Indeed, it may be the case that, for example, a high street bank is generally responsible in its lending policies. However, isolated cases of unfair relationships do happen. Noble Lords will be aware of the regular reporting of cases in the press of regrettable practices being engaged in by the representatives of all classes of lender.
</p>

<a name="51108-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>So, the Government cannot accept that in this regard, or in any other similar respect, that there can be one standard applied to categories of lenders who might be regarded as &quot;good&quot; and another for those categories who are &quot;not so good&quot;, by whatever measure. All lenders should lend responsibly. The manner in which they do so will depend on the needs of the customers that they serve. For this reason we do not think a specific duty in the context of this legislation is necessary or appropriate. For all those reasons, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<p><a name="st_44"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving amendment No. 25, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 26. Clause 20 gives the court power to intervene when a credit agreement is found to be unfair. It gives the court wide powers to remedy any perceived unfairness. Clause 20(2) provides that the very useful remedies available to the court can only be made on the request of the debtor or a surety. The amendment provides that the Official Receiver or the debtor&#039;s trustee in bankruptcy <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC164"></a>

can also ask the court to intervene in the same way. If a person goes bankrupt, the Official Receiver or his trustee in bankruptcy stands in his shoes under the general law as regards all legal rights and remedies he may have. If the debtor is a bankrupt, he may have no interest or incentive to seek relief from the court as provided in this section. However, there may be other creditors of the bankrupt person who have every interest in getting the unfair debt modified because the less that is owed to the unfair creditor, the more can be shared out among those who have a bona fide debt. There is no reason why an unfair creditor should be relieved from suffering any remedy simply because the debtor has been driven into bankruptcy, possibly as a result of the actions of that creditor. Also, the higher the debt, including any unfair element, the harder it will be for the debtor to make a new start. I feel that the omission of the provision that we are asking for is an oversight and this simple amendment puts it right.
</p>

<a name="51108-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>Amendment No. 26 deletes new subsection (4) which states that any order under new Section 140B(1) rectifying an unfair agreement shall not affect any judgment. This seems to be contradictory. If the court makes an order under, say, new subsection (1)(a) to repay money, that affects any judgment that the creditor may have obtained, possibly in default of appearance by the debtor. No doubt, the Minister will tell us what the draftsman had in mind. I beg to move.

<a name="51108-41_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   Amendment No. 25 raises an important issue. While the Government support the noble Lord&#039;s attempt, the Bill already achieves the result that he seeks. In each of the United Kingdom&#039;s legal jurisdictions, the estate of the debtor, which includes any rights of action at law or under statute that the debtor may have, is invested in the Official Receiver or the trustee in bankruptcy when the debtor is placed in liquidation or becomes bankrupt. There is no need for an amendment of the type proposed by the noble Lord and I ask him not to press Amendment No. 25.
</p>

<a name="51108-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>Amendment No. 26 removes the bar set out in new Section 140B(4) which provides that an order made by the court under new Section 140B(4) shall not alter the effect of any judgment. It is intended to prevent the court setting aside judgments previously made in order to give effect to the rule that a statutory jurisdiction to reopen a transaction does not enable the court to reopen a transaction that has been subject to a previous judgment made by the court. The Government recognise the issues raised by the noble Lord, and by others in discussions the department has had with interested practitioners, and are considering the effect of this provision in the context of the rules governing civil procedure in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment at this stage, and we may return to it on Report.

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_7"></a><br>
   &quot;APPROPRIATION OF PAYMENTS

<br>
(1)   Any payment made by a credit card or store account debtor in respect of the sum due from him may be appropriated by him at the time of making the payment to any part of that debt, and, in the absence of any such appropriation, it shall be deemed to be appropriated to the debt in the chronological order in which it was incurred.


<br>
(2)   Every statement of account sent to the debtor shall prominently and in simple language draw the attention of the debtor to the effect of this section.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_48"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment is to ensure that credit card holders have the same rights as regards payments made on their running accounts with their credit card creditors as they would have with their bankers in respect of their current accounts.
</p>

<a name="51108-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>Let me, with some diffidence in a House whose Members include so many distinguished lawyers, explain in a very brief form what the law is. We are discussing running accounts&#151;where the whole debt is not cleared at any one time, while further debits may be added to it before it is cleared. The debtor has the right to specify when he makes a payment which part of the account&#151;which invoice perhaps&#151;he is paying. If he does not specify which part of the running account he is paying, the creditor has the right to appropriate the payment to any part of the running account that he chooses. That could even be to part of the account that was no longer enforceable because it was statute-barred, or to an unsecured part of the debt where he has security for another part. The creditor also has the advantage of not having to make the appropriation at once, as the debtor does, but he can do it at any time.
</p>

<a name="51108-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>In the case of banks, however, the rule is modified to the extent that there is a rebuttable presumption that the earliest payments are appropriated to the earliest debits. That presumption is known to every first-year student of the law of contract as the rule in Clayton&#039;s case. Clayton&#039;s case was decided in 1816, almost 190 years ago, and has operated throughout the banking system perfectly satisfactorily ever since. There were, of course, no credit cards in 1819, and some credit card companies are operating their systems to the distinct disadvantage of their customers.

</p>

<a name="51108-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>The Committee will have noticed that I said some credit card companies; not all of them operate the unfair or undesirable practices that I am about to describe. Some offer to transfer debts owing to other companies at a rate of 0 per cent for a period of, say, six months. However, when the customer incurs further debits on that account, the card company may credit payments to the zero-rated part of the account rather than the interest that is bearing the new debts. Other credit cards have varying rates of interest on differing parts of the account. There may be significant differences between interest charges on purchases of goods and services and cash advances. Some credit card companies can and do appropriate payments on account to the lowest interest-bearing part of the account, to their advantage, and to the disadvantage of the debtor. The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, tabled Amendment No. 17, which had been grouped with this amendment. I would have left it there had I seen that he meant highest, not lowest. When I saw &quot;lowest&quot;, I thought that I did not want the amendment to be grouped with mine as that was not the way I wanted to go.


</p>

<a name="51108-41_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>In operating running accounts, to all intents and purposes, credit card companies are no different from banks operating current accounts. There is no essential difference between a customer signing a debit slip, instructing the credit card company to pay a bill on his behalf, and the same person handing over a cheque drawn directly on his current account. Many, but not all, of the credit card companies are themselves extensions of the business of clearing banks. There is no reason why these quasi-bankers should operate under a different set of rules from what I might call the &quot;proper banks&quot;. Indeed, if some predictions I have heard are correct, in our increasingly cashless society, and with the advent of electronic banking, banking accounts operated by paper cheques will possibly become obsolete in the future.
</p>

<a name="51108-41_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>The effect of this amendment is to place the credit card companies in the same position as banks, which, as I have pointed out, to all intents and purposes they are. The amendment provides that in the absence of any contrary instruction from the customer, the first payment is to be treated as payment of the first debit.
</p>

<a name="51108-41_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>The second paragraph of my proposed new clause requires the credit card company prominently to draw the attention of their customer to his right to appropriate any payment on account to any part of his account. This will not need any obscure or legal phraseology, which might be confusing to the customer.
</p>

<a name="51108-41_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>It would be sufficient simply to say, &quot;If you are only paying part of the total account, you have the right to apply it to any of the items with which you have been charged. If you want to exercise this right, say how much and which item here&quot;. I have been told by the representative of one credit card company that this provision would interfere with the automatic <br>&nbsp;<br>

payments system they use. I do not accept this as a reason to exempt credit card companies from the rules that apply to other parts of the modern banking system.
</p>

<a name="51108-41_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>An optical reading device will soon spot an entry on a bill and flag it up for attention by a real human being, rather than by an impersonal machine. In any case, it is probably true that most credit card debtors will fail to avail themselves of this facility, but then the rule of &quot;first in, first out&quot; will apply in the same way as with ordinary bank accounts.
</p>

<a name="51108-41_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>The fact is that the right of appropriation probably exists anyway, unless negatived by the minute print of credit card contracts. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, for supporting this amendment. I hope the Government will accept that this is a provision which not only has cross-party support, but which also provides the same justice to debtors of credit card companies as Clayton&#039;s case has provided to bank customers for almost 190 years. I noticed that when I started this amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Mackenzie, mouthed the words &quot;Clayton&#039;s case&quot;. I pointed out that this is very much something that first-year students of law would know about, providing they did not, like me, suffer senior moments and forget all about it.
</p>

<a name="51108-41_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>I should tell the Minister that, totally aside from the amendment, when we were looking up the matter, I opened a book. On its flyleaf it said that it had been presented to me as head girl of the school in 1950&#150;52. I had written down the right side&#151;and I showed it to my noble friend&#151;all the law cases that I had gone through in the book. I can say honestly and truthfully that Clayton&#039;s case and the other one, <i>Carhill v Carbolic Smoke</i>&#151;the Committee can laugh at that one&#151;stand out as something one never forgets.

<a name="51108-42_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   I feel extremely churlish, after that passionate appeal, in resisting this amendment. Let me do so. The noble Baroness&#039;s amendment is directed at the practice of lenders in the credit and store-card sector applying payments to the part of the account incurring the least interest.
</p>

<a name="51108-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>It is a practice for those products where different rates might apply in relation to different services&#151;for example, cash advances&#151;to apply any payment made to the account to the element of the indebtedness incurring the least interest. The Government&#039;s position is that this is an issue of product differentiation and transparency. Lenders are entitled to charge different interest rates on different parts of the account. Lenders are entitled to apply the payments to the account in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. If the terms of the agreement permit the lender to apply the debtor&#039;s repayment in a particular order, that will bind the debtor.

<a name="51108-42_time0"></a><h5>5.45 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="51108-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>The Government have already made regulations to improve the quality and clarity of information provided to consumers before an agreement is made and on the face of the agreement. Under the Consumer Credit (Agreements) Regulations, the agreement must contain a statement explaining to the debtor how sums are applied and appropriated under the agreement. It is important that that statement must appear upfront in the key financial information sector of the agreement, so it is not buried deep in the footnotes. The statement must also be included in the pre-contractual information provided to debtors before they enter into an agreement.
</p>

<a name="51108-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>That brings me to product differentiation. Lenders are free to inform consumers that they apply payments in a particular way, including that which is most advantageous to the debtor. Indeed, the department is aware that some lenders do that. Others do not. The Bill is not designed to stifle product innovation and product differentiation. It, along with the Government&#039;s other reforms in the area, is designed to enable consumers to understand their agreements and to receive regular information about them. If a consumer does not want the lender to repay in a certain way, they need not choose that product.
</p>

<a name="51108-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>The amendment also raises the issue of proportionality. It permits a debtor to specify how a repayment is made to the account. In accounts with several applicable rates depending on the service provided, the allocation should be quite complex. That potentially poses considerable administrative burdens for lenders in processing such requests and dealing with the payments to the account on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. So far as we know, there is no regulatory rule requiring the allocation of payments in a particular way to clearing banks, but we will look into that and write and confirm the position. On that basis, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="51108-42_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   I certainly will withdraw it, because I have no choice. Having said that, I will look very carefully at what the Minister said and may want to bring the amendment back. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
(c)   that a provision of this Part which is not in force (whether or not by virtue of this subsection) shall come into force and remain in force for a specified period not exceeding 24 months.

<br>
(3)   Notwithstanding any orders made by the Secretary of State under subsection (2), sections 19 to 22 shall, by virtue of this subsection, cease to have effect at the end of the period of ten years beginning with the day on which they are brought into force.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_52"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is grouped with Amendments Nos. 38 and 39, and I shall speak to Amendment Nos. 28 and 39. The first amendment results from the study that we have made of the Government&#039;s practice on terrorism legislation when a difficult and rather troubling issue arises. In this case, it is how the definition of &quot;unfair relationship&quot; should be dealt with, with those on this side of the Committee arguing for it to be dealt with in one way and the Government resisting that. As the Government found on their Prevention of Terrorism Act, the easiest way to deal with the difficulty is to produce a sunset clause. Amendment No. 28 is an attempt to follow the Government&#039;s normal procedure in these matters&#151;to produce a sunset provision when we find that we cannot reach consensus on something where the objective is shared by all Members from all parties represented here.
</p>

<a name="51108-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>I hope that the Minister will treat this amendment in the spirit in which the Government move their sunset clause in the House of Commons tomorrow on the Terrorism Bill, as the point is exactly the same. We are clearly not going to agree with the Government on how unfair relationships should be dealt with in the Bill, and the substantive argument from the Government is that law practice and procedures need to develop. It seems sensible to us therefore to put a sunset clause on the provisions, so that they have to come back to Parliament for review in the periods prescribed. Bearing in mind their practice with the Terrorism Bill, I have no doubt that the Government will greet the proposal with eager anticipation.
</p>

<a name="51108-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>Amendment No. 39 is an amendment to Schedule 3. Although in the group, it raises a different point. The amendment modifies the transitional arrangements in respect of provisions relating to unfair relations. It is intended to represent a fairer and more balanced approach between the interests of lenders and consumers. That relates particularly to concerns that have been raised as to the impact of Schedule 3 on the annual securitisation market and the reputation of UK capital market generally.
</p>

<a name="51108-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>As Members of the Committee will be aware, securitisation normally involves the bundling together of finance assets which are sold to investors, who are often overseas investors. That has provided a very cost-effective means for companies in the consumer credit industry to raise capital and to offer competitive products competing with the traditional high-street lenders and a competitive market for consumer market and mortgages. The concern that has been expressed in a number of quarters is that the changes, as set out in Schedule 3, mean that lenders and investors face a financial exposure which was wholly unforeseen when the loans were written.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="51108-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>In the original detailed consultation on the unfair relationships provisions, the DTI, in its policy statement of February 2004, said that measures dealing with unfairness would be applied in any forthcoming legislation to all existing agreements, but that lenders would have no financial liability in respect of actions taken before the law was changed. In respect of existing agreements, the legislation would apply only to


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;payments demanded or sums charged after the Bill becomes law&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>In other words, lenders would be given the opportunity to make necessary adjustments with the new legislation during the transitional period. I am told by those who have lobbied extensively on the issue that the lenders have been planning for this new regulatory framework on the basis of this approach to retrospection.
</p>

<a name="51108-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>However, as noble Lords will realise and as the Government know, the current draft of Schedule 3 contradicts the DTI&#039;s policy statement of February 2004 and would permit challenges to agreements which would otherwise comply with the law at the time they were made.
</p>

<a name="51108-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>I am sure Members of the Committee from all sides of the House would accept that it is a fundamental legal tenet that people should not be punished for actions that they have undertaken in good legal faith, and in accordance with the law as it applied at the relevant time. So, when announcing its February 2004 policy the DTI said that the policy then,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;represented a balance between the interests of business and consumers&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>and limited the financial exposure of lenders to potential challenges based on actions undertaken legally in the past. We agree with that policy statement and regret that the Government have seen fit to reverse it.
</p>

<a name="51108-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>Before it reached that conclusion the DTI consulted widely. Yet, I am told, at no stage has the DTI informed industry stakeholders of the change of policy represented by the drafting of Schedule 3 until the Bill was published. Indeed, as yet, no rationale or explanation has been given for the policy shift.
</p>

<a name="51108-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>In planning for the new legislative framework&#151;as the Committee knows, we welcome this Bill in general and most of its specific provisions&#151;the Government should provide, while providing protection for consumers, financial certainty for the financial services industry and allow business to plan for the future. I suspect that this policy has undermined the industry&#039;s ability to plan for the future in this respect with any degree of confidence, particularly the securitisation market. I look forward to the Government&#039;s explanation for the change of policy. The amendment is, I suppose, at the extreme end of proposals about how to deal with this difficulty. If the Government reject this amendment, I should be grateful if they would look to see whether there are any other ways in which they can deal with what clearly is an issue for that industry. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="51108-43_spnew0"></a><b> Lord De Mauley: </b>   On Amendment No. 28, as noble Lords will be aware, we have for the present withdrawn our amendments relating to the unfairness <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC171"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC171</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

provisions. We take the position that the change in the test from &quot;extortionate&quot; to &quot;unfair&quot; is a step in the right direction in the field of consumer credit. For that reason, we would have preferred to improve the relevant clauses rather than to allow the option of removing them altogether, albeit after two years. Nevertheless, we see the amendment as a fall-back position, and, as such, we reserve our position to support it.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>Amendment No. 38, which is in the group, would exempt from the requirements of paragraph 14 of Schedule 3 those credit agreements that have less than two years to run at the end of the transitional period. Noble Lords will know that the new unfairness test as drafted will apply retrospectively to any credit agreement that continues beyond the transitional period, which is set at one year from the date of commencement of Clause 20. The amendment, which was first put down by my honourable friend the Member for Wealden in the other place, accepts an element of retrospection. The noble Baroness, Lady Clark of Calton, said in winding up on Second Reading:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;Some of the agreements are extremely long&#151;15 or 20 years&#151;and we cannot wait that long to protect consumers&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>; 24/10/05; col. 1054.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>As was shown at the time of the consultation, the UK securitisation market, which has brought in some &#163;235 million of new funds to the lending markets in this country, relies, as the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, mentioned, on investors being able to subscribe to a package of loans that are stable and consistent in their terms and conditions and for which a risk profile can therefore be established. Retrospective application of legislation cuts right across that principle, so we reserve our position to support the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, in Amendment No. 39 or to put down a wider-ranging amendment on Third Reading if this one is not accepted, because lenders should not be penalised for actions taken that were fully compliant with the law at the time.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>The Minister might like to contemplate, for instance, the possibility of exempting credit agreements that are currently subject to the Financial Service Ombudsman Scheme on the grounds that the real target of retrospective application ought to be the loan sharks rather than <i>bona fide</i> lending arrangements. However, in seeking a compromise, we support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="51108-43_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, proposes that the new unfair relationship test should have some form of sunset clause. The Government have some difficulty in understanding the benefits of such a provision, which seeks to impose a sunset clause on a right given or extended to citizens. That is different from a situation where the rights of citizens are removed or limited. I do not think Magna Carta would have got very far if people had said, &quot;We extend these rights to you, but <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC172"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC172</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

there is a sunset clause in two years, after which they will be withdrawn&quot;. So having a sunset clause for a right is not appropriate.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>I have explained why a new test is necessary and why the existing law is flawed and requires reform in relation to the amendments to the unfair relationship test proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley. The Government do not see this necessary reform to the ability of consumers to access redress as a temporary measure. The new unfair relationship test is a right enabling consumers to seek redress. Consumers are entitled to seek redress where they have suffered harm. That is not something that can be offered as a temporary measure and then taken away.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>An important discipline on lenders is the prospect of consumer action in response to harmful behaviour. An important lesson arising from the history of the existing extortionate credit test is that where the possibility of consumer action is extremely remote it only encourages lenders to behave in ways that exploit the impotence of consumers to challenge their behaviour.
<a name="time_8"></a>
<a name="51108-43_time0"></a><h5>6 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="51108-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>The noble Lord&#039;s amendment also has another perhaps unintended consequence. By imposing a sunset clause of this type the amendment does not say what would replace the new test. The old test in respect of all new agreements and any agreements in existence at the time the new test came into force would not apply. The Bill abolishes it. Consumers would be left only with the very limited protections afforded by the common law.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>The Government do not believe that we can take away the new test simply because at some future point in time the market has been &quot;fixed&quot;. The history of the old test shows that when consumers are unable to obtain effective redress, this situation can be exploited by the unscrupulous. The noble Lord&#039;s amendment would make the situation worse than it is now, leaving consumers only with the rudimentary protections afforded by the common law. I understand that the noble Lord is concerned to ensure that the effectiveness of the new test and the entirety of the reforms contained in this Bill are reviewed. As my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State said in the other place, and as is set out in the 2003 White Paper, the department will review the effectiveness of the reforms and part of that review will necessarily include a review of the effectiveness of the unfair relationship provisions.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>I hope that the noble Lord understands the Government&#039;s reasons for opposing this amendment and will withdraw it. It would serve to remove the balance between the interests of consumers and lenders which is contrary to the spirit of the Bill and what the Government are trying to achieve.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 38. It seems to provide that the unfair relationships provisions should not apply to agreements that are made before the unfair relationships provisions are brought into force but end <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC173"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC173</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

within a period of two years from the end of the transitional period. It seems to be a further transitional period in addition to the transitional period already provided for in the Bill. This seems to misconceive the way in which the transitional provisions work. The unfair relationships provisions will apply to all new agreements entered into on the day on which those provisions commence. There is no transitional period in relation to these agreements and there is no need for one.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>The unfair relationship provisions will apply only to existing agreements made before the day on which these provisions commence that are ongoing after the completion of a transitional period. The provisions will not apply to any such agreements that end prior to the completion of the transitional period. The transitional period will be a minimum period of 12 months. The Secretary of State may extend it by order and different transitional periods may apply to different classes of agreement. So there does not need to be one transitional period. There may be several, each applying to different classes of agreements, and these may be for different lengths of time. The department will consult with industry to determine whether there are particular types of agreements that should be treated differently and also to consider the circumstances in which the period should be extended. Indeed, it has held some preliminary discussions with industry groups on this issue.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>As I understand it, this amendment would have the effect of adding a further transitional period in addition to the transitional period now provided for in the Bill. The transitional period is intended to provide creditors with time to adjust. We have set the minimum period at 12 months but, as I said, this can be extended by different periods for different types of loans. The provisions are flexible and we built in the ability to change the requirements if necessary. Therefore, the provision is both unnecessary and unjustified. I understand the concern that some noble Lords have about ensuring time for industry to adjust but the Bill provides flexibility to allow for that. On that basis I ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 39 of the noble Lord, Lord Razzall. This would seek to limit the financial exposure of creditors who have been found to have entered into unfair relationships. The amendment would prevent the court ordering the repayment of sums paid prior to the end of the transitional period.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Schedule 3, at paragraphs 14 to 16, provides that there may be different transitional periods for different purposes, and, at a minimum, the period for all agreements should be set at 12 months. To assist noble Lords in their consideration of Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 I will explain the transitional arrangements in relation to the new test. The way that the transitional provisions apply in relation to unfair relationships is quite straightforward. There are three key dates to keep in mind: the date of Royal Assent; the commencement date, which is when the unfair relationships provisions are brought into force, and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC174"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC174</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which we expect would occur about 12 months after Royal Assent; and the date of the end of the transitional period, which will be no less than one year after the commencement date.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>The new unfair relationships test will apply to all new agreements made after the commencement date. The new test will apply to all agreements made before the commencement date that continue after the end of the transitional period. Any agreement that ends before the transitional period ends will continue to be covered by the old test in Sections 137 and 140 of the Act. These provisions will continue to apply for these purposes only. The transitional period is designed to allow businesses time to adjust. There is a minimum transitional period set at 12 months in the Bill. Schedule 3 allows the Secretary of State to extend the transitional period, if necessary, and to extend it for different periods for different purposes. The department will consult on the length of the transitional period and whether particular categories of agreement need different transitional periods. The new provisions will apply to ongoing existing agreements from the end of the transitional period.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>In deciding which agreements the new test ought to apply to we have considered carefully the interests of all sides of this issue. As I have explained, the new provisions will not apply to agreements that end prior to the completion of the transitional period. This gives some certainty for lenders that agreements ending before the end of the transitional period cannot be challenged. But there must be a point at which the new test will apply. And the new test will apply to all agreements existing and carrying on after the date that the transitional process ends. It will apply to them without any limitation.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>All consumers should be entitled to the same treatment on an ongoing basis. Obligations under existing agreements are ongoing; they do not relate only to issues occurring in the past. This means including agreements that exist at the time the new laws came into force&#151;subject to the transitional period. If we did not apply the new test to ongoing agreements, some debtors could have been left unprotected for a very long time. Noble Lords will appreciate that some loan agreements last for 15, 20 or even 25 years. This would mean that some lenders could go on treating consumers unfairly safe in the knowledge that those consumers&#151;because of the current restrictions on their ability to challenge harmful or exploitative conduct&#151;cannot seek redress. We would, by excluding those agreements, effectively sanction the continuance of unfair relationships, which many in your Lordships&#039; House and the other place have said must stop.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, raised the question of the potential impact on the securitisation market. For some considerable time the Government have been very mindful of the potential for an impact on the securitisation market. They have taken account of the views of those involved in that market in formulating their position. The Government&#039;s position is straightforward. No funding arrangements should be based, even in part, on the inability of consumers <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC175"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC175</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

effectively to seek redress for behaviour by lenders that cause them harm. This applies as much to past securitised arrangements as it does to future ones. Some claim that the law as it stood permitted lenders to behave in a more robust manner than is provided for in the Bill. It did not. It did, however, prevent consumers effectively taking action to prevent or seek redress in respect of that behaviour. The Bill is designed to change that.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>Concerns have been raised about certainty. We believe that the industry has certainty. That belief is confirmed in the views expressed on this issue by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. As I have explained, and as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State explained in the other place, &quot;unfair&quot; is not a new or unfamiliar standard for the industry to deal with. The Government have taken account of the concerns of those involved in the market. We have provided for a transitional period and we have provided that the transitional period may be extended for different periods for different purposes. The department has had some preliminary discussions with industry representatives on the issue. The Government have not concluded the circumstances in which such extensions will be made, nor have they expressed any definitive view as to the way in which they could apply in relation to the particular sectors. As I have said, these are issues for consultation.
</p>

<a name="51108-43_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>The noble Lord also suggested that the Government had changed their position on this matter. The provisions in Schedule 3 have in fact been present since the Bill was introduced in November 2004. I hope therefore that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment. It would not achieve the objective that he desires. The Government do not accept that its result would be practically workable or desirable.

<a name="51108-44_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   I believe that at this stage I am withdrawing Amendment No. 28. The Minister is right when he says that the effect of the amendment&#151;which is obviously crude&#151;would be to withdraw the rights that consumers need. That is, of course, the purpose of it. The whole point of having a sunset clause in any legislation is to force the government, more specifically government managers, to introduce the appropriate legislation to ensure that consumers are not deprived of those rights. If it was not a very blunt instrument, it would not have that effect and there would be no point in proposing the amendment. That is the intention.

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a> Now is not the time not to press Amendment No. 39; that will occur almost at the end of our proceedings. However, I should like to reiterate the point. With respect, I fundamentally disagree with what the Minister said. He did not answer the point I made or even address the amendment. No one is suggesting in the amendment that if there is a lengthy agreement payments made under that agreement after the transitional period comes to an end and the agreement comes into effect will not be subject to the unfair relationship provisions. The amendment says that the agreement,

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>The representations I have had on the matter&#151;I suspect like those that the Conservative Party has had on it&#151;do not indicate that the industry, and in particular the securitisation industry, are happy with this.

<a name="51108-44_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Howe of Idlicote </b>   moved Amendment No. 29:

</ul>

&quot;(   )   The OFT shall include within the guidance a duty of licence holders to lend responsibly.&quot;

<p><a name="st_57"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am moving the amendment in the absence of the noble Lord, Lord Borrie.
</p>

<a name="51108-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>The simplicity and ease with which some consumers can access credit is a major cause of concern. There have been a number of quite horrific cases of vulnerable people being lent sums that they will obviously be unable to repay. Last year, for example, Mr Stephen Lewis committed suicide after building up debts of &#163;70,000, spread over 19 separate credit cards. There was also the case of Mr Scott Smith, who committed suicide after building up debts of &#163;15,000. Even when it was known by his bank that he was in difficulty with credit card debts, he was nevertheless granted a personal loan by the same bank. Thankfully, those are extreme cases. However, they vividly highlight the risk of credit providers lending irresponsibly. Therefore, as part of the OFT fitness guidance to which lenders will have to subscribe as part of their credit licence, I should like to see a duty imposed on credit providers to lend responsibly.
</p>

<a name="51108-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>Most credit lenders now use an automated process to score credit applications using superficially sophisticated computer modelling. In doing so, however, they do not check by examining actual income and expenditure or whether credit repayments are or are not affordable to the borrower. Instead, they often rely on the information held in a customer&#039;s credit reference file which includes only payment records of past credit and loans. Those, of course, prove nothing about the future. Therefore, someone with no past record of defaulting on payments will be regarded as having a good credit rating regardless of their current income and number of outstanding credit commitments.
</p>

<a name="51108-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>Last year, a journalist from the <i>Observer, </i>in one morning&#039;s work, managed to accumulate a dozen credit cards with a total value of more than &#163;100,000 without any of the credit providers questioning whether he had the capacity to repay the money. I do not know the average salary of an <i>Observer</i> employee, but it surely cannot be right that <br>&nbsp;<br>

so much debt can be taken out in such a short period of time without any serious questioning or checking being carried out.
</p>

<a name="51108-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>I trust that this minor, yet crucial, amendment to the Bill will improve what is already a fairly strong piece of legislation. While consumers in the UK have undoubtedly benefited from our competitive and flexible consumer credit market, the fact remains that there are still too many consumers being let down by bad practice. I hope that these amendments will offer them a better deal and I hope that the Government will feel able to support them. I beg to move.

<a name="51108-44_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   In supporting the noble Baroness, I must say how sorry I am that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, was unable to be in his place to move the amendment. I understand he is not well. We all wish him a speedy recovery.
</p>

<a name="51108-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>The citizens advice bureaux have made a strong case for this. The noble Baroness indicated a number of tragic cases that they have highlighted. As I said on an earlier amendment&#151;I believe to general acceptance&#151;citizens advice bureaux are very often at the front-end of these disastrous cases. They have made quite a strong case for the insertion of this matter in the OFT guidelines.
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="51108-44_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   We associate ourselves with the sentiments expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, about the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. We believe that the amendment is eminently sensible. I suspect it is possible that the Government will say that their own new Section 140A(2) gives the court discretionary power to take into account any factors that it believes are relevant. Am I right in assuming that that would include responsible lending? If so, that would make matters very much easier to understand.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="51108-44_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   The examples given by the noble Baroness are all regrettable. The Government are working to ensure responsible lending. We believe that these issues are capable of being dealt with in the unfair relationship test that we are introducing and with the improved Office of Fair Trading powers. We are coming at the issue in what we believe is a practical and sensible way.
</p>

<a name="51108-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>The amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Borrie concerns the guidance on fitness to be issued by the Office of Fair Trading in relation to its licensing function. This guidance will provide lenders with information as to those matters that, in the opinion of the OFT as a licensing authority, might indicate a lack of fitness to hold a consumer credit licence. My noble friend Lord Borrie also raised the issue of responsible lending and suggested that the OFT be required to specify a duty to lend responsibly in this guidance.
</p>

<a name="51108-44_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>Before I address the issue of responsible lending I shall, for the benefit of noble Lords, set out the intended function of the OFT&#039;s guidance on fitness to hold a licence under the Act. The OFT, in its function as the regulator responsible for the Consumer Credit <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC178"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column GC178</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Act, has certain functions in relation to the regulation of the activities of businesses holding licences to conduct a business that either provides consumer credit, consumer hire or some related services. Key to this function is the issuing of licences.
</p>

<a name="51108-44_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>In order to hold a licence under the Act, a business is required to be &quot;fit&quot;. As part of its function as the licensing authority, the OFT may issue guidance to businesses to assist them in their compliance with the requirements of the Act or to assist them in knowing what types of conduct might mean that they will be considered to be unfit to hold a licence. The OFT can look at any evidence of irresponsible lending when assessing a lender&#039;s fitness to hold a consumer credit licence. The draft OFT guidance on fitness states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;Fitness takes into consideration any matter which may have a bearing on your ability to deal with consumers, including credit competence and evidence of trading practices.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="51108-44_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>Accordingly, it is generally the case that guidance takes a negative form. It tells affected persons what types of conduct might expose them to OFT enforcement action or to being denied a licence.
</p>

<a name="51108-44_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>The Government believe that all lenders should behave responsibly when lending. The manner in which they do is a matter for them to determine, depending on the circumstances of the debtor and the nature of the transaction. But the Bill does not include a specific duty to do so, as it is implicit in both the unfair relationships and fitness tests. For many, &quot;responsible lending&quot; imposes a requirement that lenders do certain, specific things before extending credit. But this approach does not take into account the debtor&#039;s particular circumstances, nor does it accommodate the many different ways in which credit can be provided.
</p>

<a name="51108-44_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>Any duty to lend responsibly would lead to pressure to compile a list of what is and is not responsible lending. Given the ways in which lending can be undertaken, this could potentially be a complex exercise. Such a list would not be enough. It would encourage lenders to think that as long as they have complied with the list, they have lent responsibly. But that cannot be so in all cases. Therefore, the Government&#039;s position is that it is inappropriate to require OFT to include a specific positive duty to do something. As we believe that a duty to lend responsibly is a core theme of the Bill, we do not believe that requiring the OFT to include it specifically in its guidance, with the almost inevitable list of what is or is not responsible lending, would be helpful, leading, as we believe it would, to a tick-box culture where businesses claim fairness and fitness simply because they have ticked all the boxes on the list.
</p>

<a name="51108-44_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>The Government are keen to encourage responsible lending and believe that the Bill will do that. I hope that in the light of this explanation the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="51108-45_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Benefit Fraud Inspectorate Report: Boston Borough Council</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="51108-45_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions  (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </b>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (James Plaskitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51108-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>On behalf of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the BFI inspection report on Boston Borough Council was published today and copies have been placed in the Library.
</p>

<a name="51108-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>In 2004&#150;05, Boston Borough Council administered some &#163;13 million in housing benefits, about 44 per cent of its gross revenue expenditure.
</p>

<a name="51108-45_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>In 2004&#150;05 the council reported that it was taking 57 days on average to process new claims to housing benefits. At the time of the inspection in July 2005 the majority of the management team had been in post only for a few months but performance was beginning to improve as the backlog of claims had been cut. Allowing for some misreporting of performance the council was taking an average of 47 days to process new claims in the first quarter of 2005&#150;06. However, significant further improvement is needed to meet the standard of 36 days.
</p>

<a name="51108-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>BFI found significant delays at each stage of the new claims process and in processing changes of circumstances. The longest delays were in the time taken to obtain all required information from customers. No monitoring of the throughput or clearance of work meant there was a lack of control over the flow of work. A limited management checking regime meant the council did not have reliable feedback on the quality of work done or the ability to identify areas where performance needed to be improved.
</p>

<a name="51108-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State is considering the report and may ask the council for proposals in response to BFI&#039;s findings.

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="51108-45_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51108-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>Excellent progress has been made on implementing the two key commitments on debt relief made by G8 leaders at the Gleneagles summit in July. In addition, the UK has granted further bilateral debt relief over <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS48"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column WS48</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the summer, and I take this opportunity to provide an update on the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
</p>

<a name="51108-45_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>At Gleneagles, the G8 proposed 100 per cent cancellation of the debts owed by qualifying countries to the International Monetary Fund, the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank, and the African Development Fund (AfDF) of the African Development Bank. Since then, the proposal has been discussed by the board of directors of each institution and received broad support, including from African countries. The IDA and IMF components were agreed at the annual meetings of the World Bank and IMF. The approval process is underway at the African Development Bank. We are working with others to resolve outstanding technical issues, and are confident that implementation of the new debt relief will begin in 2006. Up to $55 billion will be cancelled for the current 38 HIPCs, and we estimate that about $1 billion a year will be freed up for spending on poverty reduction in 2007, rising to $1.7 billion by 2010.
</p>

<a name="51108-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>Countries will receive this 100 per cent irrevocable debt cancellation when they complete the HIPC Initiative. There will be no further conditions attached. Countries that have already completed HIPC will need to demonstrate that they have maintained their commitment to poverty reduction and good macro-economic and public expenditure management. The allocation of additional donor resources through the existing performance based allocation systems will then maintain a strong incentive for good policy and performance. In addition, bank and fund staff will continue to monitor and report on the overall efficiency of public expenditure as well as on progress in reducing corruption and enhancing transparency in recipient countries.
</p>

<a name="51108-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>To ensure that the financing capacity of the World Bank and African Development Bank is not reduced, we and other G8 partners have committed to cover our share of the cost of the debt cancellation for IDA and the AfDF. We will make funds available ahead of the debt cancellation to cover the costs to the World Bank and African Development Bank for the next three years. We have committed to meet our share of ongoing costs for the duration of the loans, which in some cases is 40 years. These funds will be additional to the resources we had already agreed for these institutions as part of the recent replenishments of the concessional funds of the World Bank and the African Development Bank. G8 Finance Ministers have agreed that in future replenishment rounds the costs of the debt relief initiative be reported separately to ensure that they are clearly distinguishable. Debt relief at the IMF will be funded through internal resources as far as possible, but donors will provide additional resources if needed to ensure that the IMF&#039;s financing capacity is maintained.
</p>

<a name="51108-45_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>The G8 also made a commitment to the achievement of a fair and sustainable solution to Nigeria&#039;s debt problems with the Paris Club of government creditors. I am able to report that a deal was formally agreed at <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS49"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column WS49</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Paris Club on Thursday 20 October. This deal sees approximately $18 billion of Nigeria&#039;s debt cancelled, the remainder being repaid by Nigeria using part of its oil windfall. The UK&#039;s share of the debt cancellation is approximately $5.1 billion. The deal will be implemented in two phases over the next six months, after which Nigeria&#039;s entire debt to Paris Club creditors will have been resolved. This is the largest single debt deal ever reached with an African country. The government of Nigeria have committed to ring fence the debt savings of about $1 billion a year to tackle poverty, and have invited national and international monitoring of all the spending, including by representatives of UK NGOs.
</p>

<a name="51108-45_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>Steady progress is being made in implementing the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. This targets the poorest, most indebted countries, reducing their debt burdens to sustainable levels, alongside reforms that help to ensure that resources freed up are spent on poverty reduction. Rwanda, Zambia and Honduras all completed the HIPC process earlier this year and received irrevocable debt stock reductions. Most recently Burundi completed the first stage of HIPC by reaching decision point and so qualified for relief on its debt service payments. We expect other countries to qualify or complete the process early next year. The IMF and World Bank have stated that several more countries will be considered for the exceptional debt relief under HIPC. This is a result of the extended &quot;sunset clause&quot; which now gives countries until the end of 2006 to meet the criteria for being considered under HIPC&#151;an extension that the UK was instrumental in lobbying for. A final list of countries is expected in early 2006. Both creditors and debtors need to maintain their efforts to ensure the full financing of the HIPC Initiative, and the full participation of all creditors. The UK is the second largest bilateral contributor to the HIPC trust fund, which helps multilateral organisations deliver their HIPC assistance in a timely manner. The UK has committed $436 million to date (including our share of the EC contribution) and in August made our latest payment&#151;$20 million to cover the costs to the African Development Bank of debt stock write-off for Rwanda.
</p>

<a name="51108-45_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>Once implemented, the G8 multilateral debt cancellation deal will supersede the UK&#039;s Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) for HIPC countries. For other qualifying countries, we will continue to cover 10 per cent of their debt service to IDA and the AfDF.
</p>

<a name="51108-45_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>In addition, the UK will give debt relief on about &#163;42 million of development loans granted via the EU in the 1970s to 40 less developed countries. In 1978 the (then nine) EU member states provided the World Bank&#039;s International Development Association (IDA) with $428.5 million to be lent on concessional terms. Earlier this year it was agreed that these should be treated as bilateral rather than joint funds. Consequently we will manage the UK share of these loans in line with international and UK policy on debt relief. All the nine member states involved have agreed to cancel the loans to countries that have completed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS50"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column WS50</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

HIPC. In line with our policies, the UK will forgo payments from decision point and hold in trust payments between December 2000 and decision point; these moneys will then be repaid when countries reach completion point. The total cost to the UK of cancellation for the HIPC countries will be about &#163;22 million. In addition, I have decided to provide relief on our share (about &#163;20 million) of the loans to the poorest non-HIPC countries, provided they are committed to poverty reduction, human rights and sound public financial management.

</p>

<a name="51108-45_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>I have decided to grant assistance to the government of Belize for a further year under the Commonwealth Debt Initiative (CDI). This decision will mean that Belize will not repay &#163;1.458 million worth of official debt to the UK (representing payments that were due in the financial year 2003&#150;04). The government of Belize will put the money towards agreed poverty reduction initiatives and associated economic reform.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>The overall payment performance of Government is 97.09 per cent.

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="51108-46_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My honourable friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality (Tony McNulty) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51108-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>Section 36 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 allows for the electronic monitoring of those liable to be detained under the Immigration Acts. This includes asylum seekers, illegal entrants, those found working in breach of their conditions of stay, overstayers, people subject to further examination at a port of entry, and those refused leave to enter.

</p>

<a name="51108-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>Electronic monitoring takes three forms: telephone reporting using voice recognition techniques, tagging and tracking. These are being used, in combination with face to face contact at immigration reporting centres, to improve compliance with the requirements we place on    people to remain in contact with us. Contact management, including electronic monitoring, is a key aspect of the new asylum model as described in the five-year plan.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS52"></a>

<b>8 Nov 2005 : Column WS52</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="51108-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>During the passage of the 2004 Act, the then Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Beverley Hughes, stated that an electronic monitoring requirement would be imposed only with the consent of the individual. This commitment was reiterated when her successor Des Browne wrote to the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Consent is not a statutory requirement but was introduced as a matter of policy in recognition of the novel use of electronic monitoring in the immigration context.
</p>

<a name="51108-46_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>The electronic monitoring pilots have generally been a success, but asking for the subject&#039;s consent is inconsistent with any other area of contact management. It hampered our ability to manage contact with people flexibly because the need for consent left us with very little recourse if the individual failed to give it or where, having initially agreed to be monitored electronically, they subsequently failed to comply. That is why I agreed a change in the policy before the summer recess to allow the immigration service to draw up contact management plans without first seeking the consent of the individual. The consideration of whether the individual will comply with specific requirements will be part of the process of deciding how best to manage contact and this change places us in a stronger position by enabling us to consider what action to take where someone fails to comply with an electronic monitoring requirements.
</p>

<a name="51108-46_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>The impact on compliance in the short period since the change in policy has been positive. Between July and September, of 53 people who failed initially to comply with telephone reporting, 47 began to do so after one written warning that their continued failure may lead to their re-detention. Since the start of the pilot in October 2004, we have tagged 49 people, 23 of them since the policy on consent was changed, but we have seen no adverse impact on the level of compliance notwithstanding that we have tagged a larger proportion of high risk cases without seeking their consent.
</p>

<a name="51108-46_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>This is a promising start, but we shall continue to monitor the situation as electronic monitoring is applied in increasing numbers. I will update the House on the progress we are making in a further Statement early in the new year.

</p>
</ul>
<a name="51108-46_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>Ministers committed to consult further on such legislation. This consultation started on 25 July 2005 and ended on 20 September 2005.

</p>

<a name="51108-46_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a>The Railways Act 2005 provided for the transfer of certain health and safety functions on the railway (and other guided transport systems) from the Health and Safety Commission to the Office of Rail Regulation. In addition, regulations are required to transfer responsibility for the enforcement of health and safety legislation relating to such transport systems from the Health and Safety Executive to the Office of Rail Regulation.

<p><a name="wms_st_8"></a>
<a name="51108-47_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="51108-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>On 17 October the World Health Organisation and Sudanese Ministry of Health published the report of the second Darfur mortality survey. This was a six-month retrospective mortality survey, covering the period from Eid ul Fitr in November 2004 to the start of the survey in May. The first survey was undertaken in August 2004 and covered deaths over a two-month period.
</p>

<a name="51108-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a>The report showed that while mortality rates in Darfur are still above baseline levels, they are significantly lower than the first survey and are below the international crisis threshold of one death per 10,000 people per day. In north and south Darfur, the average mortality rate was found to be 0.8 deaths per 10,000 people per day, and in west Darfur it was measured at 0.6 deaths per 10,000 people per day. The Red Cross/NGO &quot;Sphere&quot; project on minimum standards in disaster response puts the baseline mortality rate for Sub-Saharan Africa at 0.44 deaths per 10,000 people per day.
</p>

<a name="51108-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>Due to poor security, the survey teams were unable to access some parts of Darfur&#151;especially south Darfur where the results apply only to internally displaced people in camps. The report also notes that there are times when mortality rates rise because of temporary increases in violence, seasonal disease outbreaks or breakdowns in food supply. Applying these mortality rates to the entire region for the entire year would therefore be misleading.
</p>

<a name="51108-47_para3"></a>

comprise an assets freeze and a travel ban, with individuals being proposed by the UN Commission or Lebanese Government with the agreement of a UN sanctions committee established by UNSCR 1636 (2005). The sanctions committee will also be responsible for making decisions on permissible exemptions to the application of the individual measures. Such exemptions are defined by the resolution as including travel for humanitarian purposes (including in connection with religious obligation) and funds for basic expenses such as medical treatment, food and accommodation.
</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a>The measures will remain in place until the sanctions committee reports to the Security Council that all investigative and judicial proceedings relating to the assassination have been completed, unless the Security Council decides otherwise.

<a name="51108w02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   We provided the names of the senior civil servants involved in examining the classification of roads expenditure on the basis that we would normally expect the names of staff at this level to be in the public domain.

<a name="51108w02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The advice of the international military assessment team on the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) during a visit in March 2005 was that the mandate was adequate, but that more troops were needed to deliver it effectively. AMIS has now deployed around 5,500 military and civilian personnel, and 1,000 civilian police, as part its current expansion to more than 7,700 personnel.

<p><a name="wa_st_10"></a>
<a name="51108w02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The African Union (AU) has now deployed around 5,500 military and civilian personnel, and 1,000 civilian police, as part of the AU Mission in Sudan&#039;s (AMIS) current expansion to more than 7,700 personnel. It is likely that South Africa will now be unable to provide a military battalion, and it has proven difficult to generate appropriately qualified civilian police. There was a three-week delay in deployment in September for infrastructure improvements to be made, and due to Sudan-wide fuel shortages.

<p><a name="wa_st_11"></a>
<a name="51108w02_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   The United Kingdom ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on 16 December 1991. It came into force in the UK on 15 January 1992.
</p>

<a name="51108w02_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_7"></a>This Answer covers the UK&#039;s two reservations on immigration and the separation of young offenders as well as under-eighteens serving in the Armed Forces, which were the subject of discussion on 19 October.
</p>

<a name="51108w02_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_8"></a>With regard to immigration, the Government have carefully reviewed the reservation in light of recent requests that it should be withdrawn. We believe that it is necessary to retain this reservation which makes it clear that nothing in the convention is to be interpreted as affecting the operation of UK immigration and nationality legislation. The UK has entered other, similar reservations in respect of other human rights instruments.

</p>

<a name="51108w02_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_9"></a>However, no child will be denied their human rights as guaranteed by the Human Rights Act when in the UK. We have also worked hard on proposing new measures to address some specific and practical <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WA72"></a>

issues relating to children. For example, a White Paper in 2002 proposed that specially trained immigration staff will be able to interview children about their asylum claims in a wider set of circumstances than at present. This will give officials a greater understanding of children&#039;s background and circumstances and help them better determine appropriate levels of care.
</p>

<a name="51108w02_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a>In addition, as I explained in the House of Lords on 19 October, the level of support for children here as part of an asylum seeking family is equivalent to that provided for children in families on income support. The full support package includes fully furnished accommodation, associated utility bills and council tax is paid for centrally. The total support package is roughly equivalent to income support levels.
</p>

<a name="51108w02_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_11"></a>The dispersal of unaccompanied asylum seeking children is not automatic. The Government will not generally seek to disperse those who have been in care and for whom a decision on their asylum claim has not been made. The cases of other unaccompanied young asylum seekers are judged on merit&#151;they may not, for example, be dispersed if they are already in full-time education or if they have younger siblings in care.
</p>

<a name="51108w02_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_12"></a>With regard to detaining under-eighteens in the same accommodation with adults, I should like to stress that we are doing all that we can to be in. a position to be able to withdraw the reservation about custody and accommodation, if following review, we decide that this is desirable. We have made good progress in this field. We are building four new separate facilities for 17 year-old girls; one opened in December 2004 and a second in September 2005. The other two are due to open shortly.

</p>

<a name="51108w02_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_13"></a>In terms of under-eighteens serving in the Armed Forces, we have made excellent progress since ratification of the UNCRC. The UK ratified the optional protocol (OP) to the UNCRC on the involvement of children in armed conflict on 24 June 2003, subject to a declaration. The declaration states that the UK will take all feasible measures to ensure that members of its Armed Forces who are under 18 do not take a direct part in hostilities. However, the UK understands that the OP does not exclude the deployment of under-eighteens where there is a genuine military need to deploy a unit or ship to an   area where hostilities are taking place or the urgency and nature of the situation merits their involvement.
</p>

<a name="51108w02_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_14"></a>Work has focused on reviewing the Armed Forces&#039; policies and practice for the recruitment, employment and deployment of under-eighteens to ensure that they accord with the requirements of the OP. In addition, all possible steps are taken to ensure that no serviceman or servicewoman under 18 is deployed on operations unless it is purely for humanitarian reasons. No applicant under 18 years of age may join the Armed Forces unless the application is accompanied by the formal written consent of his/her parent or guardian.
