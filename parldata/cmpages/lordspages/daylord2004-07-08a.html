<a name="40708-01_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Wild Birds: Importation</h3>

<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What discussions they are having with other European Union member states and with the European Commission on the future of imports of wild birds.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Whitty): </b>  My Lords, there have been no specific discussions with EU member states or the Commission on the question of imports of wild birds, although we meet on a regular basis to discuss the implementation of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species&#151;or CITES&#151;which protects about 1,700 species of bird.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, I am disappointed in the Minister&#039;s reply. I should have thought that this unnecessary and destructive trade was something that the EU would want to bring to an end. Does the Minister think that the current position amounts to a kind of bird racism? The EU has a strong policy in its birds and habitats directive, while this country has strict regulations on the licensing and capture of wild birds&#151;and, indeed, the killing of them, as was shown by the incident of the three robins last month. However, a trade is allowed to continue that is literally raping the rain forest of its species.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, as regards the endangered species, there are of course very strict rules under CITES on the importation, transportation and the capture of and dealing in birds in the native country. There is no such provision in relation to non-CITES species; they are of course legally capturable in those countries and trade in them is legal. Subject to general animal welfare regulations, there is no reason why the trade should be stopped.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that the trade that is dealt with under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species is crucial? Of the 99 seizures of animals and birds that took place in 2003, how many were birds? <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_912"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 912</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Does the Minister accept, too, that of the 411 seizures last year, with not one prosecution taking place, this Government are dragging their heels? That is an absolute disgrace.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   No, my Lords, I do not accept that. The figures for seizures are not kept separately for animals and birds, so I cannot give the figures to which the noble Baroness refers. However, I would be reasonably confident that birds would be in a minority in those figures.
</p>

<a name="40708-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>Clearly, Customs enforces a large number of seizures&#151;2,000 animals and birds were seized last year. There is a very strong enforcement at the point of entry. The prosecution that has been successful in recent years has also ended with an exemplary sentence, with one person being sentenced to five and a half years&#039; imprisonment. So it is not fair to say that the enforcement authorities are not doing their job.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, how do the two things fit together&#151;the question of endangered species, such as the tortoise, and the right of people to bring in a pet, if they have lived abroad somewhere? It is possible that someone might even have had a wild bird in the country of origin for years and might want to come to this country and bring it. Are permits available, or is there an absolute ban in all such cases, even if they would comply with the Passports for Pets scheme?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, within Europe there would of course be free movement, subject to the border regulations on pets and the pets passport system. Beyond Europe, there is no entitlement to bring a bird into this country unless it is allowable in terms of trade and, if it is an endangered species, one is observing the regulations under CITES. There is no absolute ban, but pets do not qualify any differently from any other point of trade, in that respect.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   My Lords, in relation to the number of seizures referred to by the Minister, could he hazard a guess as to what percentage of the total illegal trade that may represent? Is there any evidence that that is just the tip of the iceberg?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, by the nature of things, I cannot give figures on undetected illegal trade. The indications are that there is some illegal trade going on, but through the airports it is unlikely to be very substantial as there are tight Customs controls and birds and animals are reasonably detectable. I cannot really give any indication of total size, but there is some illegal trade, and Customs and other authorities are doing their best to stamp it out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, might I press the Minister further? There have been 411 cases and only one prosecution. My question did not suggest that the enforcement agencies were not doing their job; my question was about why the Government were not having more prosecutions.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_913"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 913</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness knows, the question of prosecution for all smuggling offences is a matter in the first instance for Customs and Excise in most cases. Customs and Excise judges that its best efforts are focused on detection, seizure and, if necessary, destruction. Only in the most blatant and provable cases does it engage in prosecution. When it has done so, in this area&#151;unlike in other areas in which I might have more sympathy with the noble Baroness&#151;the sentence was exemplary.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister acknowledge that the introduction of the Wild Bird Conservation Act in the United States has converted the USA from a major importer of wild birds to a non-importer? There are no more wild birds being imported into the USA. Would the Minister consider introducing legislation in the United Kingdom to that effect? Clearly, present legislation is inadequate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, as the noble Lord knows, any move on importation would have to be an EU decision, not a UK decision. Indeed, half of the non-poultry birds imported into the UK come directly from European sources rather than from elsewhere. The single market would continue even if we were to ban non-EU trade. The situation is therefore not the same as that in the United States.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, given that reply, will the Minister initiate discussions with the EU since the European Union and Japan are now the two major markets for wild birds captured from the rain forests?
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, one must make a judgment on priorities and the judgment we have made is to stop the destruction of endangered species. The prime concern is focusing on those listed under CITES&#151;both birds and other species&#151;to try to tighten and enforce all trade and welfare controls relating to CITES birds. We may come to the wider issue, but the endangered species must surely be the priority.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Walmsley: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister accept that when these birds are seized by our Customs the damage has already been done and that it is far too late? What are the Government doing to talk to the countries from whose rain forests the birds are coming?
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Whitty: </b>   My Lords, to a large extent I agree with that but it does not destroy the need for effective action at the point of entry. So far as CITES species are concerned, there are obligations on the country of origin and on those who are trading in such species as well as on Europe or any receiving countries. The same is not true of non-CITES animals and birds.

<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Smith of Clifton </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Why the cost of external consultants to the Northern Ireland Office has risen from &#163;10 million to &#163;18.6 million between 1998&#150;99 and 2002&#150;03; and whether this represents value for money.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40708-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My Lords, the figures quoted in the Question were presented in a recent Northern Ireland Audit Office report. That report acknowledged that consultants bring short-term expertise when it would be poor value for money to recruit and retain staff for discrete pieces of work. The increases referred to occurred as a result of devolution and the associated increase in work requirements, together with the introduction of new initiatives, such as resource accounting.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040708/text/40708-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Smith of Clifton: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Lord President for her reply, as far as it goes. This rise is of at least 80 per cent in a five-year period. I say &quot;at least&quot; because the report notes that there has been severe underreporting in certain areas, so it is not a comprehensive report. Does the noble Baroness agree with me that it is a damning report, in so far as the NIAO offers strong criticism of poor procurement, sloppy procedures, failure to follow DFP guidelines and little evaluation of results? As a benchmark, what was the corresponding figure for the use of consultants by government in England and Wales over the same five-year period, 1998&#150;99 to 2002&#150;03?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the report identifies areas that need improvement and action has now been taken to address those areas. With respect to a comparison with England and Wales, there are no official data to hand but survey evidence suggests that expenditure on consultancy by the public sector in England has risen significantly. A survey done in April    2004 by the Management Consultancies Association highlighted how expenditure by public sector bodies had almost doubled in the year to 2003 to a figure of &#163;1.3 billion.
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   My Lords, I have with me a collection of documents that I picked up off my desk just now. They all arrived in the past month or so. They are all consultations of one sort or another. Is this a satisfactory and efficient way of carrying on the democratic process? What are the print runs of such documents and what percentage of them are read or, in particular, responded to by anyone?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, there have been many discussions in this House about the importance of consulting on policy questions and I think we all agree about that. I shall have to write to the noble Lord on the specific question of print runs.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Dubs: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that at least part of the reason for the increase in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_915"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 915</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consultants&#039; fees in the period was the restructuring of Northern Ireland government departments from six to 10 because of devolution? It was essentially a one-off expenditure so that one would expect consultants not to have to be used further for those purposes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is quite right. Some of the increase is related to restructuring. It is also related to the move to resource accounting and to devolution. It is important that we recognise that it would be poor value for money for departments to recruit and retain highly specialised staff whose contribution is not necessarily needed on a permanent or on-going basis. I cannot say that it is one-off expenditure but we need to make sure that we are giving value for money.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree with me that this is a very incomplete report on the use of consultants? If one tries to piece together some of the evidence one cannot actually get to the actual expenditure on consultants. In 2001&#150;02, it was certainly in excess of &#163;34 million, which is more than &#163;20 per man, woman and child in Northern Ireland, but the worst element of all in this is that in 88   out of 100 cases studied in this report there has been no proper evaluation about whether there was any benefit in these consultants being hired.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, as I said in relation to an earlier question, the report identifies deficiencies, and those have now been addressed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   My Lords, does the figure include the cost of image consultants? If so, what was the conclusion on those image consultants employed through the activities of the North/South Ministerial Council&#039;s recent discussions with loyalist and republican paramilitary groups? How do we assess value for money for image consultants for paramilitary groups?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, I have no idea whether the report includes the cost of image consultants, but I will find out and write to the noble Lord.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Elton: </b>   My Lords, what were the deficiencies that the Minister says have been remedied?
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, there were concerns about inconsistencies in the definition of &quot;consultant&quot; and about some of the monitoring mechanisms put in place. Guidance has been tightened and sent to departments.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </b>   My Lords, are the Northern Ireland consultants engaged by competitive tender? That is a very good way to make sure that one gets value for money.
</p>

<p><a name="qn_2"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Knight of Collingtree </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>Whether there are any legal or technical reasons why direct flights are currently not permitted between Ercan airport in Northern Cyprus and United Kingdom airports.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </b>  My Lords, the British Government fully support the agreed EU policy of ending the isolation of Turkish Cypriots. Direct flights to Northern Cyprus could play a useful role in bringing that about. We are currently examining the feasibility of such flights.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. The very encouraging statement from the European Commission&#151;it came out only last night&#151;mentions, among other things, opening Turkish-Cypriot ports. Does that mean that the airport in Northern Cyprus can be used by those who seek to sell their produce abroad or visit the country? If so, can she give the House any idea when the ports, including the airports, might be opened?
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew15"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness said, the proposals came out last night. The Commission made it clear that the proposals have been concerned with establishing a regime to permit trade between Northern Cyprus and the EU, and did not go into the issue that was really the subject of the Question&#151;that is, the direct air links. They did not go into the direct maritime links either. We are examining what the Commission said. As the noble Baroness knows, my right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have said that they want to do what is possible to enable trade, and to end the isolation in a broader sense and a transport sense as well. The proposals certainly look encouraging.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Hannay of Chiswick: </b>   My Lords, the Minister agrees that the objective of bringing the north of Cyprus closer to the European Union is a worthy one; she has already said that. Does she agree that the Greek Cypriots ought to realise, if they took a calm look at the matter, that is in their interests too that the prosperity gap between them and the Turkish Cypriots should be narrowed? They are likely to benefit economically from an increase in economic activity in the north.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, there is a great deal of common sense in what the noble Lord says. We welcome the fact that the Government of the Republic of Cyprus have stated their commitment to work to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots. I very much hope that they will continue to demonstrate their support for that goal, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_917"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 917</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

not merely by their general statements but by their willingness to engage in real facilitation on those points.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew18"></a><b> Lord Lea of Crondall: </b>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that those of us who attended the meetings earlier this week with the new Prime Minister of Northern Cyprus were very impressed by his statesmanlike approach? He pointed out that it may be more difficult for airports, which are under the International Civil Aviation Organisation&#039;s jurisdiction, than seaports to do something as quickly as the European Commission has suggested. As the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said, it will be very important to encourage the Government of Cyprus to realise that the moral high ground is increasingly occupied by Northern Cyprus, and that the threat of the Republic of Cyprus to use its veto in the European Union is not the way to go.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="40708-02_spnew19"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, as I said, I hope that what the Government of the Republic of Cyprus in Nicosia have said&#151;that they want to end the isolation of the Northern Cypriots&#151;can be taken at face value. They must now look at practical ways whereby that might be possible. The noble Baroness&#039;s Question about direct flights is very important, and I feel that we have somewhat moved away from it in supplementary questions. We must also recognise that the issue is highly contentious, as I am sure that she does, but enormously critical. By examining those issues, as we are doing at the moment, and recognising all the problems around legalities and air traffic control, we are trying, as the Prime Minister has said, to look at ways in which the flights can begin as soon as possible. The Prime Minister has said that.

<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="40708-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that all the issues will be examined and reviewed <i>ad nauseam</i>, but the policy of the European Union seems to be to have direct flights to Ercan. It is also the policy of the Government, who say that flights should happen as soon as possible, and of the noble Baroness herself. Ercan airport has been transformed and upgraded, travellers want to travel and tourists want to tour, and the airlines want to run the flights, so why do we not simply get on and allow them?
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="40708-03_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, we cannot do that because it is an enormously complicated and difficult question, as I have explained. The noble Lord may not like it, but we have to get things right legally. The open-skies policy of the European Union does not extend to the air links between sovereign states within the EU, so direct air links are a matter for bilateral agreements. Such agreements have to be properly licensed. That is what is being looked at. I could not be more positive than I have been to the noble Baroness, short of saying that we will begin flights tomorrow. I indicated that my right honourable friends want them to happen, that the Government would like <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_918"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 918</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to find a way through the problems, and that officials and lawyers are looking at the issue very actively. I hope that that will satisfy the noble Baroness.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="40708-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, that response from my noble friend was very helpful. She said that the flights would have to be licensed bilaterally. Who has to license them? Who is stopping them?
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="40708-03_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I did not say that. The flights do not get licensed bilaterally, but are agreed by bilateral agreements. Those agreements have to be licensed internationally by the Chicago Convention. I am jolly glad that I asked about that before I came into the Chamber.

<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="40708-03_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the decision on whether to investigate an attempted fraud rests solely with the police, who will take into account available resources, national and local policing priorities, the likely eventual outcome, and the competing priorities of fraud and other criminal cases already under investigation. The Home Office works with the police and industry to tackle fraud and other online crime through a number of other initiatives.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="40708-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   My Lords, I hope that I am not alone in finding that an extremely woolly and unsatisfactory Answer. Is the noble Lord aware of what it feels like to be told that, effectively, part of the place where one works and lives is off limits to the police&#151;that one can see a crime being committed but the police do not express the slightest interest in investigating it, locally, nationally or through the department? What does he think that that does for one&#039;s impression of the Internet as a place to do business, and of the police as people who should keep law and order in this country? Such simple things could be done by the police to make matters better, if only they would get off their bottoms and do them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="40708-03_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am quite clear   that the police will devote resources to the investigation of fraud perpetrated over the Internet where a case is considered sufficiently serious. Where there is clear evidence of serious and computer-enabled criminality, nationally and internationally, the National High Tech Unit within the National Crime Squad is more than prepared to deal with such cases. This Government have put large resources into ensuring effective and successful policing of the Internet.

Considering the recent statistics that 50 per cent of home computers are subject to fishing attacks, and that 70 per cent of e-mail is spam, most of which is sent through hacked computers, do the Government plan to allocate greater resources to tackle this ever-growing problem?

<a name="40708-03_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am aware of the statistics that the noble Lord has drawn to the attention of the House. We work closely with the industry to ensure that the problems to which he referred are tackled. The Government take these issues most seriously and for that reason we have begun to put in extra resources. Indeed, in the next year, we are providing extra funding for the City force so that it can expand its capability. It is estimated that some 600 officers are dedicated to tackling fraud and a large part of that work will involve them in dealing with crimes which operate through the Internet.

<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="40708-03_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Sheldon: </b>   My Lords, as the use of the Internet is due to increase greatly in the years ahead, it is most important that trust be maintained. In the United States, the FBI sponsors the Internet Fraud Complaint Center. Will not users need to have that kind of confidence in the Internet if usage and interest are to be maintained?
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="40708-03_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, obviously, it is up to each jurisdiction to decide how best to organise its resources to counter Internet crimes. The noble Lord is right that we must have trust in the Internet. For that reason, we have invested more money in tackling Internet crimes and fraud, and the Government are committed to ensuring that we do so effectively. As I explained, we have the National High Tech Crime Unit, which concentrates a great deal of its resource and time in that area of tackling criminal activity.

Unfortunately, the money is located in China, the United Arab Emirates and in other parts of Europe and he needs my assistance with air flights. This is of course of interest because my noble friend Lord Rennard and the Liberal Democrat by-election fund could well use that kind of money. There is a certain <i>caveat emptor</i> in dealings on the Internet&#151;the citizen has a certain responsibility to himself or herself when getting involved. I am certainly taking advice on this offer.

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>On the wider point, is the Minister convinced that the police are not over-restricted by RIPA and the Data Protection Act and are not over-interpreting them, thereby stopping themselves taking action under that legislation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="40708-03_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am fascinated by the kind of e-mails that the noble Lord receives. I have not had an e-mail of that kind, but perhaps I should check more closely. Perhaps the Liberal Democrat funds could benefit from such an injection, but they might find that that kind of scam relieves them of money rather than advances them some.
</p>

<a name="40708-03_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord McNally, that individuals have a responsibility in this respect, but I cannot see how the RIPA provisions and those in the Data Protection Act can be a bar to the police acting effectively in this area. It is a complex one for police investigating and no one should underestimate that. There are simple measures and good advice that members of the public can make and receive, which will enable them to deal with the problem.

<a name="40708-03_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>Does my noble friend also agree that a great deal of fraud is not reported, particularly by the financial institutions because they seem to believe that it brings disrespect to the organisations?

<p><a name="st_61"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 2 to 4 and 30 to 36. This first group of amendments contains various minor and consequential changes to the Bill&#039;s provisions concerning the statutory recognition and derecognition procedure. However, I should like to mention Amendments Nos. 31 and 33. They deal with the consequences for a union where the Central Arbitration Committee declares that it is not entitled to recognition because of unfair practices that it has committed. In those circumstances, the union is not entitled to reapply under the statutory procedure for recognition in the same or similar bargaining unit for three years. The amendments change the starting point for that three-year period.
</p>

<a name="40708-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Noble Lords will remember that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, tabled an amendment to Clause 9 about the three-year moratorium in Grand Committee. I think that she was then mainly concerned whether there was a moratorium of any sort in such circumstances. In response, my noble friend Lord Treisman reassured the noble Baroness that the union was debarred from reapplying for the same or similar bargaining unit for three years. He stated that the starting point for that three years was the date on which the union&#039;s unsuccessful application was declared admissible by the CAC.
</p>

<a name="40708-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>However, following remarks of the noble Baroness in Grand Committee, the Government have reconsidered the issue. Those deliberations revealed an inconsistency that Amendments Nos. 31 and 33 are now intended to rectify. The Government consider that the moratorium that results where an application fails because of unfair practices should be consistent with that which applies where the union loses the ballot. Otherwise, a union would have to wait slightly longer before it could apply again for recognition if it lost the ballot fair and square than if it had been guilty of repeated or serious unfair practices. Amendments Nos. 31 and 33 therefore amend the statutory procedure to bring the relevant dates into line.

</p>

<a name="40708-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Amendment No. 31 provides that the three-year moratorium on further Part 1 applications in respect of the same, or substantially the same, bargaining unit contained in the admissibility provisions of Paragraph 40, where the original application failed because of unfair practices, should start on the day after the CAC&#039;s   declaration of non-entitlement to recognition. Amendment No. 33 makes the same change to the validity provisions contained in Paragraph 48. I am <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_67"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the Bill sets out the core issues on which negotiation may take place once recognition of the trade union has been agreed. Those include wages, hours of work, and so on, but not pensions. In Committee, my noble friends and I sought to include pensions among those core items. We were   not especially keen on our wording, but were anxious to get the matter debated and to learn the Government&#039;s attitude. We drew attention to the fact that the Government did not seem very sure that it was right to exclude pensions, as, later in the Bill, arrangements are included whereby the Secretary of State can by order arrange for pensions to be included as an item for collective bargaining.
</p>

<a name="40708-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>In Committee, the Government did not accept our amendment or the principle involved. At col. GC65 of <i>Hansard,</i> we were told that there was a question <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_924"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 924</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

whether pensions had achieved the same status as bargaining items as pay, hours and holidays. We were informed that research was being undertaken into actual bargaining procedures. Apparently, where pensions are regularly a bargaining issue, the Government will consider activating the power in the clause enabling the Secretary of State to make an order. We were informed that the Government were sympathetic to the argument behind our amendment and the Minister said that he looked forward to the time when pensions were indeed a core item in collective bargaining, but that the time was not yet.
</p>

<a name="40708-04_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>We were not happy about that response, and I said so. Indeed, I said that we would return to the issue on Report, although we might choose a different form of wording. That is what we have indeed done, although we accept that this wording may not be as complete as it might be. Our amendment simply reverses the clause that removes pensions from the collective bargaining agenda under the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40708-04_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>Recent developments indicate just how important pensions have become for employees. At one time, pension provision was felt to be an item of concern solely to white-collar employees. The large unions organising manual workers were thought to be concerned only with the workaday rate for the job. That was never entirely true and is certainly not now. Recently, one of our most powerful unions achieved a noted success when the employer was forced to abandon its plan to close its final salary scheme to new entrants and gradually phase it out. The final salary scheme was saved when the closure of the whole railway network was narrowly avoided in a dispute not about wages, hours or holidays, but simply to save the final salary scheme. That lesson will not be overlooked by others. Pensions are a core item for employees. I hope that the Government will now agree that they should be included as a core item for collective bargaining.
</p>

<a name="40708-04_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>I emphasise again that unions now take pensions very seriously. They employ people who develop specialist skills and buy in expertise as and when they need it. As I have said on many occasions, my union includes pension training in its schools and specifically runs training courses for members who are nominated to act as pension fund trustees. We need the Government to change their approach on the issue. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="40708-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   My Lords, we have had difficulty in finding a form of words acceptable in principle and practice and have tried a different one this time. The amendment would change &quot;does not&quot; to &quot;shall&quot;, so that there is a general right for pensions to be included if a union wins a recognition claim. However, it would leave in place the rest of the clause, which enables the Secretary of State to modify, circumscribe or specify what that right would be in practice. That would seem to be in line with what the Government wanted in Committee, if we understood it correctly.
</p>

<a name="40708-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>The Government have not come out and said, as they did in 1999, that pensions are insignificant and that workers do not want to negotiate about pensions. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_925"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 925</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

No, they admit it. They admit that pensions have become one of the most important items on any negotiation or consultation agenda. There are very good reasons for that. In the absence of any influence over employers on pensions during the past 10 years or so, there have been significant pensions scandals. Companies have gone broke and have had no money to pay contractual pensions. Companies have for years milked their pension funds by reducing their value and giving themselves a pensions holiday. The workers did not know about that.
</p>

<a name="40708-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>As my noble friend said when moving the amendment, the Government accept that. They want to do something about it in the Pensions Bill by introducing consultation. But that is not enough. It is not enough for workers to be consulted because all that happens is that when the organisation decides to have a pension scheme, it consults. It has already decided what the pension scheme will be, how much it will pay or whether it will reduce the provisions of an existing scheme, and then it consults. If there is a mechanism for consultation in the firm&#151;there may not be&#151;all that the workers can say, if they have a proper representative system, is that they like the scheme, they do not like it or they wish it were changed.
</p>

<a name="40708-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>If there was collective bargaining and if, where the union was recognised for bargaining purposes, that could be done by the Secretary of State, that could be limited so that it was allowed only where there was recognition for collective bargaining. If there was recognition for collective bargaining, then the recognised union would be able to put up its own scheme. From the beginning, it would be involved in the formulation of the scheme.
</p>

<a name="40708-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>A pension is regarded by many workers as, in effect, deferred pay&#151;that is what it is. In the present society, it may be even more important than pay, because if you do not like your pay, you can go somewhere else. However, if you retire and find that your pension is not worth anything, there is nothing you can do. Pensions are at least as important as pay. If the Government accept, as they have, that they should assist workers to get trade union recognition for core matters, those core matters should involve pensions. I support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="40708-05_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, the importance of pensions could hardly be more powerfully stated. I thank all noble Lords for their contributions in Grand Committee and today. The Government understand the strength of feeling that exists on the issue of pensions among trade unions and their members. I am sure that all workers hope that they can look forward to a comfortable and secure retirement without financial hardship. It is right and proper that trade unions should vigorously defend their members&#039; pension rights.
</p>

<a name="40708-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>The Government are taking positive steps to address this very serious issue in the Pensions Bill, which includes assistance to those who have lost their pensions and a right for employees and their <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_926"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 926</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

representatives to be consulted on significant changes to their schemes. There is no question that the importance of the issue to workers and their unions is understood, and we acknowledge the positive effect that employee involvement on pensions can have.
</p>

<a name="40708-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>The question is whether it is appropriate at this time to make pensions a subject for statutory collective bargaining. In looking at this, we need to bear in mind the aims of the statutory procedure and the factors which have made it a success to date. Key to this is the principle that the statutory procedure is a fallback. It is designed to encourage the voluntary resolution of recognition claims. It is intended as a last resort, where attempts by the parties to resolve a claim among themselves have ended in failure. That is why the Government do not believe that it would be appropriate at this time to add pensions to the core topics for collective bargaining. The evidence suggests that pensions are not commonly bargained about in voluntary recognition deals. So if we were to add them to the statutory bargaining topics, this would, in effect, make the statutory procedure broader in scope than most voluntary agreements.
</p>

<a name="40708-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>That would risk making it far more attractive to unions to go to the CAC than to try to reach a voluntary agreement through dialogue with an employer. For this reason, the Government are making it clear that pensions should not be regarded as part of pay for the purposes of statutory collective bargaining.
</p>

<a name="40708-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>I do not accept the contention that the Government are uncertain about this. We are trying to gauge what should be done, and the time at which it should be done, against the realities of experience and the results of research in this area. Recognition of the importance of pensions, and the fact that they appear to be moving up the bargaining agenda, means that we are taking a power so that we can add pensions to the list of core topics at such a time as evidence emerges that their inclusion as a topic for bargaining in voluntary agreements has become typical.
</p>

<a name="40708-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>As I indicated in Grand Committee, the Government are undertaking research to get a clearer picture of the coverage and content of agreements signed since 1998. This will act as a benchmark against which to compare the results of further periodic surveys on this subject.

</p>

<a name="40708-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>From my own experience, unions often prefer to deal with pensions in ways other than collective bargaining, especially where schemes relate to a specific professional or occupational group, or to a particular tier in a workforce. Unions often elect&#151;sometimes appoint, but generally speaking these days they elect&#151;trustees to pension schemes. This concentrates expertise in a way which is not always apparent in the generality of collective bargaining. From the point of view of the trustees of the scheme&#151;not just the employer trustees, but the union or the workforce trustees&#151;they discuss issues which are for the trustees to decide, not those involved in the practice of voluntary agreements. That is the nature of trusteeship in most cases. It sometimes means that where a union shares collective bargaining <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_927"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 927</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

responsibilities with other unions, but the pension scheme relates to a particular group or tier of workers for which one union happens to be responsible&#151;rather than all the unions that are involved in that collective bargaining process&#151;then that union can deal with those issues specifically, using its specific expertise. For purposes of illustration, that is the common practice across education at all levels in the arrangements for pensions. A general right would not be helpful or appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40708-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>The Government have tried to strike a balance between the desire to encourage dialogue between employers, unions and workers on pensions, and the need to protect the smooth running of the statutory procedure. I hope noble Lords will feel that we have struck the right balance and expressed it. In the light of my explanation, I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment, conscious of the fact that I doubt whether there is any lack of understanding on any side of the House of the importance of pension arrangements to workers.

<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="40708-05_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, the evidence is being assembled through the research of Dr Sian Moore of the Working Lives Research Institute of the London Metropolitan University. The first phase of research has already taken place and some detailed data have been collected. The second phase is under way, which will look at how recognition has occurred in practice, and whether its scope and depth have developed over time, including in respect of pensions. We hope to publish the results of the second phase later this year.

If there were 50 per cent recognition of pensions in the recognition sector, would that shift get us a selective or general right? Would it need to be 45 per cent? What is &quot;typical&quot;?

<a name="40708-05_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, that question was asked in Grand Committee. I shall not answer it at the same length because I am very happy to refer back to what was said then. The Government do not believe that it would be appropriate to set a simple, quantifiable threshold, as that would not take account of the complexities of the issue. Collective bargaining on pensions may take many forms, as my noble friend Lord McCarthy will know. Employers and unions might bargain about the establishment of pension schemes, the eligibility of workers to be members of such schemes, the level of contributions and so on. Likewise, there may be a difference between what a recognition agreement says on paper and what the parties actually bargain about in practice. I know from experience that they are not always one and the same.

<a name="40708-06_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his response; it is similar to that given in Grand Committee, about which we were not entirely happy. We were told that, although our proposal was regarded sympathetically, it was not felt to be a matter for statutory requirement in the same way as the core items listed in the Bill. We disagree with that concept. We believe that it is very high up the agenda of bargaining nowadays. As I am sure my noble friend is aware, the TUC is running a campaign about pension rights at the moment. It has had meetings and issued a great deal of material about the need for trade union action in the pensions field.

</p>

<a name="40708-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>My noble friend referred to trustees. As I indicated, our union and others run training schemes for member-nominated trustees. We are well aware that, when introducing a pension scheme, there is a difference between being a trustee and being a negotiator. In such schemes I have often negotiated with employers, but we have had entirely different members act as trustees, with a different remit&#151;we know that a trustee is responsible in a different way to the whole membership of the scheme, and that the situation as regards negotiation is different.

</p>

<a name="40708-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>I wish to say three things. First, this is a very long story. For a long time, employers have attempted to discourage trade union membership and activism by various inducements: bribes, favours, promotions and so forth. Nothing could be done about that and nobody attempted to do anything about it until Section 53 of the Employment Protection Act 1975. That worked a little, but we never got rid of the problem entirely until the Ullswater amendment in 1993.
</p>

<a name="40708-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>We argue that it was discovered in the Wilson and Palmer judgment that the state of English law was almost the same as it had been before any legislation had been enacted. Unless the Government are prepared to accept our amendments&#151;the first set deals with the problem of &quot;sole or main&quot;&#151;we will not comply with the judgment.
</p>

<a name="40708-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Several things are wrong with the way in which the Government have attempted to modify their approach in respect of the employer&#039;s purpose. The judgment said that if the purpose involved an attempt to induce workers to leave the union, and if that purpose was detected by a tribunal, it would mean that the worker was not fully protected and therefore was entitled to compensation. But the Government have changed that. They say that that applies only if the court decides that it is &quot;the sole or main purpose&quot;. That takes us right back to the Ullswater amendment, and it is not enforceable.
</p>

<a name="40708-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>Any employer could say at any time that an element of what he did was not related to putting pressure on the union. For example, he could argue that, although he may have put pressure on the union or the consequence of what he did may have put pressure on the worker to give up the union, he had other considerations also. That is exactly what the Ullswater amendment says. So long as the employer can find that he had a mixed motive or set of motives, it would be easy to argue that there was no sole or main motive and that if there was one, it was not to discriminate against the union.
</p>

<a name="40708-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>We have had most of these arguments; I do not want to repeat myself. However, I wish to respond to several things that the Government said in Grand Committee. We were told that if our amendment were agreed it would be disastrous for employers and that it would be impossible for them to manage the plant efficiently. That is complete nonsense. In most of what we seek, it would be the easiest thing in the world, if the Bill read as we want it to, for the employer to show that no part of his purpose involved discriminating against the union. For example, he would have to show that if he promoted someone or gave them a bonus he was not doing it exclusively for non-union members. As in other forms of discrimination, the employer would have to show that he was applying the benefit across the board and that the promotions or benefits were awarded for reasons other than to put pressure on the union.
</p>

<a name="40708-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>The only situation in which it might be difficult for an employer to defend himself, if the Bill were amended as we wish, is if he wanted to do precisely what was done in the Ullswater case&#151;to move a considerable group of workers out of an area of collective bargaining into an area of non-bargaining and therefore in some way to discriminate against the union as much as against them. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_931"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 931</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

What would the consequences of that be? The worker could retain a very large part of the benefits that he enjoyed as a result of union membership&#151;for example, the right to raise grievances and to bring in his trade union official. If the employer was transferring that group of workers into a non-union area to pay them more money, it would be extremely difficult for either the union or the member to show that there had been any disbenefit.
</p>

<a name="40708-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>It is almost certain that in most cases it would be easy for the employer to defend himself against a charge of discrimination unless discrimination was his central purpose. So we do not take the view that disastrous things would happen if our amendment were agreed. We commend it to the House. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="40708-07_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   My Lords, I agree that this section of the Bill was very thoroughly discussed in Grand Committee. It was considered by the Joint Committee on Human Rights on two occasions and there was an exchange of correspondence with the DTI, which we have seen. According to that correspondence, the DTI accepts that this is a very difficult issue. It says that it is important to ensure that a remedy is available for all cases that fall within the scope of the well known Wilson and Palmer judgment. That is why we have again proposed that &quot;sole and main&quot; be left out, because the purpose of the clause is so important.
</p>

<a name="40708-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>It is surely clear that even the purpose of rewarding valuable staff might well be accompanied by another purpose&#151;perhaps even the main purpose&#151;of weaning staff away from union representation. Indeed, plenty of employers would perhaps regard it as rather valuable to have staff who were willing to move to individualised contracts and to give up trade union representation. As we understand it, one of the purposes of the Bill is to protect such people from being intimidated in any way into giving up union representation. As my noble friend Lord McCarthy has explained, we have put the amendment before the Government on a number of occasions. The wording as it now stands contains a loophole which employers can utilise in order to claim that they are not attempting to wean people away from trade union rights and representation and that that is really in the interests of business or the individuals. I ask the Government to think again about the matter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="40708-07_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   My Lords, this is an extensive group of amendments. They would all delete words from the Bill and they are clearly designed to make an absolute prohibition against offers being made to employees outside collective bargaining which do not interfere at all with union membership. However, the Government have clearly stated both in the White Paper and in our debate in Committee that such offers are not to be prohibited or objectionable.

</p>

<a name="40708-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>Amendments Nos. 16 and 18 would preclude an employer from making an offer if there were an element in that offer which might, however fancifully, be construed as one of the matters which the clause, as drafted, already prohibits. In other words, the amendments are too restrictive. Furthermore, the use of the phrase &quot;sole or main&quot; throughout Clause 28 certainly induced me to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_932"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 932</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

withdraw the revised version of the &quot;Miller amendment&quot;; that is, Amendment No. 63 in Grand Committee. I hope that the Government will reject the amendments.
</p>

<a name="40708-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>As regards Amendments Nos. 22 and 23, the Bill already imposes an onus on the employer to justify his purpose in making such an offer. That should be more than enough protection for the interests of the worker from inappropriate offers. Therefore, the amendments are unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="40708-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>The two subsections to which Amendments Nos. 24 and 25 relate are similarly stringent in requiring justification, supported by evidence, for the making of an offer by the employer. Again, that extra obligation should provide more than adequate protection from inappropriate offers being made, thereby dealing with the problems that the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, and the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, think are likely to arise.
</p>

<a name="40708-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 would alter the Government&#039;s amendments to the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. That Act   refers simply to &quot;the purpose&quot;. The Government propose to amend that to &quot;sole or main purpose&quot;. Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 would restore the original wording. I do not understand why the Government want to do that. If carried, the amendment would completely negative the Government&#039;s amendment, which could of course be the proposer&#039;s intention, but I do not suppose that that is the wish of the Government.

<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="40708-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, Clause 28 contains the core of our proposals to ensure that UK trade union law complies with the European Convention on Human Rights in the wake of the judgment in the Wilson and Palmer case. This large group of amendments deals with an issue which was examined by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in assessing whether Clause 28 complies with the convention. We discussed the same or very similar amendments in Grand Committee.
</p>

<a name="40708-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>I shall discuss the six amendments which would remove the various references in Clause 28 to the &quot;sole or main&quot; purpose of the employer in making offers. The words &quot;sole or main&quot; are an essential component of the   regime that we are seeking to construct. They are necessary to ensure that employers have some flexibility in setting their reward systems. We do not consider that employers should be prevented from making offers for justifiable business purposes just because a by-product or incidental consequence of making such offers would be to deter a person&#039;s involvement with a trade union.
</p>

<a name="40708-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>My noble friends Lord McCarthy and Lady Turner of Camden consider that this will allow ill intentioned employers easily to evade the law. We do not share that view. Tribunals are expert at making the kind of judgments required, and can distinguish between true and fabricated accounts by employers of their underlying purposes. That is what they do every day in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_933"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 933</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

unfair dismissal cases. To assist the tribunals, we have placed the burden on the employer to demonstrate what was the sole or main purpose of his action.
</p>

<a name="40708-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>Our proposal is fully compatible with the Wilson and Palmer judgment. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has considered the matter in some detail and it now accepts that there is a case for retaining the &quot;sole or main&quot; purpose test. The Minister for Employment Relations, Gerry Sutcliffe, has also written to the Joint Committee confirming that the Government will monitor the operation of these provisions when they come into force.
</p>

<a name="40708-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 relate to our proposals to introduce an explicit &quot;sole or main purpose&quot; test into Sections 146 and 148 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act   1992. Both sections currently refer to the &quot;purpose&quot; of the employer&#039;s act or failure to act. As my noble friends would agree, these sections contain important protections against detrimental treatment by the employer on grounds of trade union membership and activities.
</p>

<a name="40708-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>As we explained in Grand Committee, our proposals are designed to create a consistent set of provisions across related trade union rights. As we have introduced a &quot;sole or main purpose&quot; test in Clause 28, there are advantages in using the same wording in Sections 146 and 148 of the 1992 Act.
</p>

<a name="40708-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>As well as achieving consistency across these closely related provisions, our insertion of the &quot;sole or main&quot; test will clarify the law. The tribunals have to deal with situations where two or more purposes might have driven the employer&#039;s conduct. Where that occurs, Sections 146 and 148 of the 1992 Act are unclear about the consequences because they use the term &quot;purpose&quot;; that is, the singular form of the noun.
</p>

<a name="40708-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>It is highly likely that, in such cases, the tribunals would interpret the current wording as implying a &quot;sole or main&quot; purpose, but the original wording leaves the position open to at least some doubt. That is a potentially confusing situation which does not help parties to enforce and respect trade union rights.

</p>

<a name="40708-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>In Grand Committee, my noble friends Lord McCarthy and Lady Turner of Camden asked my noble friend Lord Triesman to cite an actual case where that situation had arisen. We have checked back through some cases. In fact, we did not need to look very far to find one. I refer here to the Employment Appeal Tribunal&#039;s judgment of 24   February 2004 by his Honour Judge Richardson in <i>Smyth-Britt </i>v <i>Chubb Security Personnel. </i>In that case, counsel for Mr Smyth-Britt argued that the employer had been motivated by dual purposes in taking detrimental action against him. Although the case did not turn on the point, the Employment Appeal Tribunal gave a clear view on the meaning of Section 146. It said:


</p>

<a name="40708-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>My noble friends are concerned that the introduction of an explicit sole or main test will diminish the existing protections that they provide. But, as I have argued, the extent of the existing protections is not as wide as they might think, because the sole or main test would probably be applied anyway when complicated cases arise. In fact, our proposals, taken in the round, significantly enhance the protections for trade unionists under Sections 146 and 148.
</p>

<a name="40708-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>We are confident that our proposals are fair and workable. In our view, they comply with the European Convention. I therefore ask my noble friend to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="40708-07_spnew3"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   My Lords, two points have been made to which I must reply. First, there is the analogy that is constantly drawn with the situation in other forms of discrimination, where the onus of proof is precisely the same as that proposed in the Bill and where it is said that tribunals know how to separate the issues. However, they often have great difficulty in doing that. Those involved in the process often consider that there was discrimination but that it was not possible to prove it. So it is not generally accepted by the parties involved that using this kind of formula has been a total success&#151;not at all.

</p>

<a name="40708-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>In any case, there is a substantial difference between the situations. I tried to make this point in Grand Committee, but I probably did not make it well enough. In other types of discrimination case, if the employee wins it is usually because the employer is manifestly a liar. It can be seen that he or she is a liar. When asked, &quot;Why did you fail to promote?&quot;, &quot;Why was this excellent person on your shortlist, yet never got the job?&quot;, or &quot;Why was there no black face or woman involved at any stage?&quot;, they lie because they do not have an answer. They say, &quot;Oh well, this person was a bad performer&quot;. When they are asked to provide evidence of that, there is none. When such employers say, &quot;Her attendance record was bad and she kept going off to have a baby&quot;, and they are asked for evidence, the employers&#039; answers are manufactured, for the most part. Therefore, when those answers can be shown to be manufactured, the case goes in favour of the employee because the employer has not proved the case.

</p>

<a name="40708-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>It is quite different in this case. The employer will not have to manufacture. He or she will not suddenly decide to do something about trade unions, sack the branch secretary and say that is the end of that and all that he says is bogus. It is not bogus. The man is probably a good worker who is entitled to be promoted, moved, made a supervisor or whatever. At least the Government threw out the Ullswater amendment, which was not the same. It specified that even if there was evidence that the employer was discriminating, if he could show that he had some general restructuring reason, he could not be penalised.
</p>

<a name="40708-07_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>The amendment provides for exceptional cases. It will not do all the terrible things that the Government believe. If they do not take the initiative now and fully comply with the decision of the court, they will find themselves back there again. It will be expensive, unjust and the Government would do much better if they took action now.

<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="40708-08_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden </b>   moved Amendment No. 17:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>Page 32, line 28, leave out &quot;which is recognised by his employer&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 19, 20 and 21 in this group.
</p>

<a name="40708-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>Essentially, we are talking about trade union rights. Clause 28 sets out a whole package of new rights which have been drafted as a response to the Wilson and Palmer judgments. The Joint Committee on Human Rights made a series of recommendations which we discussed in Grand Committee. However, the new clause limits the protection and rights accorded to members of recognised trade unions only. In Grand Committee we sought to amend that to include members of unrecognised unions. In doing so, we were able to point to the recommendations of the Joint Committee, which also agreed that the clause should cover members of unrecognised unions.
</p>

<a name="40708-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>The Government did not accept our view and we have returned to the issue, first, because it is important and secondly, because the Minister at the time gave the impression that the Government were willing to look at the recommendations in the Joint Committee&#039;s 13th report, although they made no firm promise that they were likely to alter their view. However, the Bill is about trade union recognition. Its objective, as we understand it, is to make recognition more easily achievable through a set of fairly simple procedures.
</p>

<a name="40708-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>All unions are unrecognised before they are recognised. The unrecognised union obviously campaigns to achieve recognition so that it may represent the interests of its members adequately. It will already have members in the employ of the company concerned. Such members are entitled, as individuals, to the protection which Clause 28 offers to members of recognised unions. As we said in Grand Committee, it is a matter of individual human rights. I do not understand the Government&#039;s opposition, particularly in the light of the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. For that reason we have returned to this issue on Report.
</p>

<a name="40708-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>The other amendments in the group, in particular Amendment No. 21, again deal with union rights. The Joint Committee on Human Rights made it clear that in its view an important part of the ECHR judgment had not been adequately dealt with in this clause. The judgment clearly indicated that by using financial incentives and detriment in order to induce workers to give up their rights to have unions represent them, the rights of both individual workers and the union were infringed.
</p>

<a name="40708-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>However, the Bill deals with the rights of individual members only. It has nothing to say about union rights. As it stands the Bill would not enable a trade union to bring proceedings to obtain a remedy for an action taken by an employer to offer inducements for employees not to join a trade union or take part in its <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_936"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 936</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

activities. The Joint Committee stated categorically that this was wrong. It said that failing to provide unions with an avenue for redressing a violation of their rights under Article 11 could result in a violation of that article.
</p>

<a name="40708-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>In Grand Committee we drew the Minister&#039;s attention to the findings of the Joint Committee. However, at that stage the Government were unwilling to accept our amendment and said that they did not agree with the Joint Committee. However, the Minister did say that the Government would consider seriously what the Joint Committee had to say before deciding their final position. Therefore we have tabled a slightly reworded amendment in the hope that perhaps the Minister will be able to say that the Government have reconsidered their view on the basis of the Joint Committee&#039;s recommendations. Naturally, I hope that their view has changed to accept our arguments. I beg to move.

<a name="40708-08_spnew1"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   My Lords, this group of amendments deals with the other thing that is wrong with the Government&#039;s reaction to the Wilson and Palmer judgment. It will not take long, but I should read a short section of what the court said in the Wilson and Palmer case. Listening to this, how can the Government say that the limitations that they have placed on the rights of non-recognised unions and the rights of unions to defend their members&#151;whether recognised or not&#151;are in conformity with this judgment?

<a name="40708-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>Section 46 says,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;It is of the essence of the right to join a trade union for the protection of their interests that employees should be free to instruct or permit the union to make representation to their employer or to take action in support of their interests on their behalf&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-08_para7"></a>

</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;If workers are prevented from so doing, their freedom to belong to a trade union, for the protection of their interests, becomes illusory&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>Now, we turn to what the present situation is.


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;However, as the House of Lords judgment made clear, domestic law did not prohibit the employer from offering an inducement to employees who relinquished the right to union representation&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>nothing about representation in a recognised situation&#151;

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;even if the aim and outcome of the exercise was to bring an end to collective bargaining and thus substantially to reduce the authority of the union&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>Notice that we are talking about the authority of the union, not just the worker. This is supposed to affect the influence, power and position of the union. That is what the judgment says,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;as long as the employer did not act with the purpose of preventing or deterring the individual employee simply from being a member of the trade union&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>I am almost finished.


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;Under United Kingdom law at the relevant time it was, therefore, possible for an employer effectively to undermine or frustrate a trade union&#039;s ability to strive for the protection of its members&#039; interests&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="40708-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>Not just to recognise them. Perhaps a recognised union does not have to struggle in the same way. Perhaps an unrecognised union needs more assistance rather than less; that is what the judgment seems to say.


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;The Court . . .  considers that by permitting employers to use financial incentives to induce employees to surrender important union rights, the respondent State failed in its positive obligation to secure the enjoyment of the rights under Article 11 of the Convention. This failure amounted to a violation of Article 11&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>Article 11 has two parts. The first part establishes all those rights, and then it lists five specific ways in which you do not have to guarantee those rights. I challenge the Government to tell me any one of those five ways that apply in this case. They apply to the armed services, for example. They have nothing to do with this case. Therefore, I suggest that the judgment affects trade unions as well as workers. It affects trade unionists whether they are recognised or not; it applies across the board, and there are no defences in terms of Article 11 to what the Government are trying to do. I support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="40708-08_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </b>   My Lords, I will make a few comments on Amendment No. 21. There is a slight difference between the amendment as originally put down by the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, and the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, and the current version.
</p>

<a name="40708-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>In the first version, it was proposed that an independent trade union with a member or members whose rights have been contravened may present a complaint to an employment tribunal. The latest version apparently seeks to make the point clearer by saying:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;Where the rights of a worker who is a member of an independent trade union have been contravened . . .  the union may complain&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>In both cases, the amendment asks that the union be given a separate right to complain on its own volition. The effect of the amendment would be that it would enable a union to intervene, even one that is not recognised by the employer, and even if the employees themselves did not object to the offer, or may even have welcomed it. In other words, this amendment seeks to impose a union&#039;s will on workers irrespective of their   wishes and democratic rights. It negates the Government&#039;s stated policy of allowing workers to make agreements outside of a collective bargain when it is appropriate for the workers to do so, and in no way do they interfere with the worker being a member of the union.
</p>




<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="40708-08_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, Amendments Nos. 17 and 19 deal with another issue discussed in Grand Committee, namely whether new Section 145B should apply in some way to the members of unions which are not recognised by the employer. The Joint Committee on Human Rights is also interested in the position of such workers because they are not currently covered by the rights under new Section 145B. The Joint Committee&#039;s main concern centres on the position of members of non-recognised unions who receive offers to persuade them not to seek recognition for their own union.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 938</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40708-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>I note that Amendments Nos. 17 and 19 do not actually deal with that kind of offer. Instead, they focus on offers made to the members of a non-recognised union to opt out of a collective agreement negotiated by another union. We are therefore unsure whether these amendments meet that need, though I thank my noble friends for their suggestions. As I stated in Grand Committee, we are considering the issue again in the light of the Joint Committee&#039;s latest report. We have since opened discussions with key stakeholders on the matter, and that consultative process will be completed in time for us to determine our final view for Third Reading.
</p>

<a name="40708-08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 deal with the question of the union having a right to seek a remedy in its own name. As my noble friends have pointed out, it is the opinion of the Joint Committee on Human Rights that such a remedy should be created. This is in fact a far-reaching idea, which runs counter to the way all other individual employment rights are currently enforced, so it requires very close consideration indeed. We are therefore seeking the views of key stakeholders, both employer bodies and unions, before finalising our position. For example, just yesterday my colleague Gerry Sutcliffe met a delegation from the NUJ that included Mr Dave Wilson of Wilson and Palmer. These consultations will be completed by Third Reading. In the light of the ongoing consultations on both issues, I ask my noble friends to withdraw their amendments.

<p><a name="st_95"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is my last attempt to bother noble Lords this afternoon. Once again this is something on which the Government have moved. At Third Reading in the other place, the Government accepted an amendment to deal with this problem. The problem is that the TUC, which should know, thinks that the amendment does not deal with the problem. I understand that discussions are going on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_939"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 939</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

through the usual channels to see whether we can find a form of words. Our form of words was the form of words that the TUC was seeking to press on the Government in Committee. That was not acceptable, and certain things were said by the Ministers, so we tried to combine the reference to what they said in our amendment today.
</p>

<a name="40708-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>It is about the circumstances in which unions are now to be allowed to expel or refuse to accept members. The Government accept that infiltrating forces of racist, fascist and extremist groups of various kinds are now making a set at British trade unions. Whereas the union might have been able to have dealt with that before the beneficent effect of a shoal of Government Bills in the days of the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, it is now difficult for unions to expel anyone. Of course, there is the case of a union confined to Scotland, which can keep out people who do not live in Scotland; or if you fail to provide subscriptions or run out of dues. After that, it gets extremely difficult. The Government propose that that will be all right if it is in the rules. As I understand it, if it is in the rules, one does not have to admit. But if one does admit, one can expel fascist, racist and other extremist groups, and that is all right.
</p>

<a name="40708-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>However, the TUC does not think that is all right. On looking at union rule books&#151;we discussed this in Committee&#151;blanket rules would have to be relied on. As the Minister said in Committee, many such rules are still in place. But the unions do not believe that they can be used because some of them have used them and were caught in the courts. Nevertheless, on looking at those blanket rules and the way in which the courts have always interpreted them&#151;which is nothing to do with recent legislation&#151;it is doubtful whether using the current rules or even changing them would deal with the problem.
</p>

<a name="40708-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>I looked at a few rule books in order to see how far that is the case. Really, rule books with blanket rules do two things. They contain a number of extremely wide purposes, some of which are rather frightening. One   such purpose refers to &quot;furtherance of political objectives of any kind&quot;. One wonders what that would cover: the founding fathers of the union just shoved in the first thing that they could think of in order to cover everything.
</p>

<a name="40708-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>Another purpose is to &quot;advance the interests of labour&quot;. In what way? How? Why did they put that in? The rules of one very important union refer to &quot;any objectives specified by the executive&quot;. One could be frightened by that.
</p>

<a name="40708-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>We now have a residue of extremely general rules, which were mostly written by the founding fathers and hardly ever used. But there they are.
</p>

<a name="40708-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>There are also the ways in which the unions have interpreted those rules and have sought to expel, exclude or in other ways discriminate against workers who could not be caught by a precise rule. Therefore a blanket rule was used.
</p>

<a name="40708-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>Quite rightly, the courts have interpreted those rules very narrowly. They do not think very much of rules such as the &quot;furtherance of political objectives of any kind&quot; or &quot;any objective specified&quot;. The courts tended to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_940"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 940</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

say that, if a general rule of that sort was being used, there ought to be a lot of precise grounds against the individual. Ultimately, the rule book is supposed to be a contract between the members of the union. That type of thing cannot be called a breach of contract.
</p>

<a name="40708-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>The TUC says that there must be something else. It suggests that the unions could be allowed to specify in policy statements&#151;perhaps of some length with some contemporary relevance&#151;who and what it is they want to guard against. Those principles, not necessarily set out in rule books, could be interpreted by the courts.
</p>

<a name="40708-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>As I say, the Government have shown sympathy for this, but they will not accept the introduction of principles. The Government have said that these objectives and principles could simply be made by the general secretary at an annual conference. He could say, &quot;We are against the BNP&quot;. But that is not good enough. We accept that and we are trying to bring it on board.
</p>

<a name="40708-09_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>I have slightly rewritten our original suggestion. Amendment No. 26 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;leave out &#039;contrary to the rules&#039; and insert &#039;inconsistent with stated rules and objectives&#039;&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-09_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>That would include the rule book, which it must because it tells people what to do and how to do it. But then the objectives have to be stated, published or prescribed. If the Government want to go away and add to that, good luck to them. We are doing our best to try to find a way to do what the trade union movement thinks it needs and the Government say they want to do. I beg to move.

The unions are put in a difficult position if they are not able to deal with awkward people who infiltrate unions in order to carry out anti-ethnic and discriminatory practices from inside the union. We need to have policies and legislation in being that will enable the unions to deal with such people and to enable them to deal with discriminatory practices and attempts at discrimination against their own members from within the union, which does happen.

<a name="40708-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, that it is dreadful that there are people in the unions who ought not to be. I would not want to make it difficult for a union to expel someone when it ought to be able to expel them. On the other hand, it is not right that a person should be deprived of his or her union membership except in the clearest possible terms. If the Government can introduce clearer terms than before, I would not object to that.
</p>

<a name="40708-09_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>I remember that the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;We wanted to ensure that the statute is clear and places reasonable obligations on individual members to act in accordance with widely available and accessible information on the union&#039;s policies and positions.

</p>

<a name="40708-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>I would never pretend to the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, who would never allow me to do such a thing, that I am as knowledgeable as him about union rules. He made a few remarks about some unions having rules that are simply unacceptable, which may be so.
</p>

<a name="40708-09_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>Perhaps the Minister will suggest that he has better wording. But, in the event that he does not, I object to the amendment as it stands.

<a name="40708-10_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen: </b>   My Lords, I, too, support the amendment. I particularly like the words, &quot;and objectives&quot; of the unions, for the reasons that my noble friends have given. On occasion, union rule books can be strange. They have evolved over the years. As my noble friend Lord McCarthy said, it is important that we include the union&#039;s objectives. That would strengthen the union&#039;s position in relation, for example, to racists.

</p>

<a name="40708-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>A minimum award, currently set at &#163;5,900, applies where the union has not admitted or re-admitted the individual to the union at the time the application for compensation is made. We think that the tribunal should be given greater discretion to decide the amount of the award in cases when the exclusion was unlawful because it was mainly attributable to membership of a political party, but where there were other reasons for the union&#039;s decision concerning conduct that were contrary to the union&#039;s rules.

</p>

<a name="40708-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>In choosing the wording we wanted to ensure that the statute is clear and that it places reasonable obligations on individual members to act in accordance with widely available and accessible information on the union&#039;s policies and positions&#151;an aim that is shared on both sides of the House. That is why we refer to the union&#039;s rules within the subsection. The amendment returns to the topic that we discussed in Grand Committee, as my noble friends have rightly said. It would broaden the test which disapplies the minimum award so that it includes subsidiary behaviour that is inconsistent with the stated rules and objectives of the union.
</p>

<a name="40708-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>The Government consider it extremely important to ensure that the test to disapply the minimum award works in pratice. Union rule books vary, although I should say that the survey carried out on behalf of the TUC in 2003 showed that of the 34 unions considered in the sample, 22 had explicit national rules on equality issues. Therefore, on the basis of the sample, that is a reasonable proportion thus far. Some explicitly refer to the union&#039;s opposition to racist attitudes or conduct. Others do not specify many proscribed behaviours, but leave it to other union documents to set out the union&#039;s position on such matters. We recognise that the current wording may not be broad enough to meet union concerns, and we have therefore been working closely with the TUC to devise alternative wording.
</p>

<a name="40708-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>In assessing the alternatives, we must be sure of the openness and clarity of what I have described. That point was made in Grand Committee, and the inclusion of the word &quot;stated&quot; in the amendment is in response to that. I am not sure, however, that my noble friends&#039; latest approach would fully meet the need. Just because something is stated does not mean that it is sufficiently accessible to the relevant individuals, and therefore capable of influencing their conduct. The amendment uses the word &quot;inconsistent&quot;. As was mentioned in Committee, that word is also open to a wide variety of interpretations, and we are not keen to see unnecessary legal debate at tribunals about the meaning of the word.
</p>

<a name="40708-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>I also note that my noble friends&#039; amendment refers to conduct that is inconsistent with the stated &quot;rules and objectives&quot; of the union. I am not sure whether that was intentional or whether, on reflection, they would prefer the word &quot;or&quot; rather than &quot;and&quot;. The proposed wording has the effect that subsidiary conduct would need to be inconsistent with both the rules and the objectives of the union for the minimum award to be disapplied. I fear that the amendment would narrow the scope for disapplication in a way that I am sure was not intended.
</p>

<a name="40708-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>We are in urgent discussions with the TUC, which are progressing well and should conclude in time for Third Reading. I am grateful to Mr Brendan Barber, the General Secretary of the TUC who has provided me with the TUC&#039;s recent documents. I believe that we shall be able to draw on a wealth of sensible thinking, and am confident that that will proceed well in time for Third Reading. In that light, I invite my noble friend to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="40708-10_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McCarthy: </b>   My Lords, I want to make two things clear. First, it is not and never was, our intention to do something that was inconsistent with the rules. If the wording gives that impression, it must be changed. The rules do a whole series of things, and do not deal only with exclusions and expulsions. They set out the power structure of the union. We do not want another generation of practices that are unlawful or enable the union to exclude or expel, and which are not connected to the rules.
</p>

&quot;(4)   If money is provided to a trade union under this section, the terms on which it is so provided shall be deemed to include a prohibition (&quot;a political fund prohibition&quot;) on any of it being added to the political fund of the union.

<br>
(5)   If a political fund prohibition is contravened, the Secretary of State&#151;


<br>
(a)   is entitled to recover from the trade union as a debt due to him an amount equal to the amount of money added to the union&#039;s political fund in contravention of the prohibition (whether or not that money continues to form part of the political fund); and


<br>
(b)   must take such steps as are reasonably practicable to recover that amount.


<br>
(6)   An amount recoverable under subsection (5) is a liability of the trade union&#039;s political fund.


<br>
(7)   Subsection (5) does not prevent money provided to a trade union under this section from being provided on terms containing further sanctions for a contravention of the political fund prohibition.&quot; </p>



<p><a name="st_102"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment makes it clear that unions may not use the money received from our proposed union modernisation fund on their political objects. That was always our intention, but the amendment puts a clear and effective legal prohibition in place. There was consensus in Committee on the need for the amendment, and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, who cannot be here today, for pressing the case to have the greatest possible clarity.
</p>

<a name="40708-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>Clause 54 inserts a new Section 116A into the 1992 Act. The amendment adds four new subsections to that new section. New subsection (4) establishes a prohibition on the payment into a union&#039;s political fund of money provided by the Secretary of State under the new section. Under the 1992 Act, all union expenditure on political objects must be made from a separate political fund. The Act also prevents a union transferring money from its general fund into its <br>&nbsp;<br>

political fund. The prohibition will ensure that money cannot be paid directly or indirectly into a political fund.
</p>

<a name="40708-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>New subsection (5) ensures that the Secretary of State must take such steps as are &quot;reasonably practicable&quot; to recover money which has been added to political funds in contravention of the prohibition. Those steps include the taking of legal action against the union.
</p>

<a name="40708-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>New subsection (6) ensures that the repayment of money wrongly added to a political fund must come from that political fund, and not from the union&#039;s general fund. If that provision were not there, the union could potentially manipulate the arrangement and, in effect, switch money from its general fund into its political fund.
</p>

<a name="40708-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>Finally, new subsection (7) makes it clear that when providing money from the union modernisation fund the Secretary of Sate may include terms providing for other additional sanctions against the union if it breaches the prohibition. Such sanctions will be set out in the contractual terms under which money from the fund is given. For example, the Secretary of State could stipulate that the money must be repaid in full with interest.
</p>

<a name="40708-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>The amendment fulfils the commitment we made in   Committee. It removes any possibility of a misunderstanding about the use of the fund, and addresses the issues that were put to the Government fully and comprehensively. I beg to move.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>Page 8, line 30, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_6"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   The guidance shall cover, among other matters, the respective responsibility of a local traffic authority, the police and fire service to attend to spillages of diesel fuel and render the road safe again for the passage of motorcycles and other vehicles.&quot;

<p><a name="st_111"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I have decided to return once again to the issue of diesel spills. With the patience of noble Lords who have heard it before, I shall briefly outline for those who may have missed it on the previous occasion what the amendment does.
</p>

<a name="40708-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>The amendment aims to ensure that diesel spills are cleared up by the local authorities which manage the roads in question in order that such spills do not pose a threat to road users. My particular concern in this case   is with the relatively small spills that affect motorcyclists and bicyclists.
</p>

<a name="40708-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>I have taken on board what the Minister said on Report&#151;that guidance is available on diesel spills in general&#151;but, on looking at the section to which he referred me in the code of practice for maintenance management, there is no direct reference to diesel spills but only to flooding, high winds, temperature and so on.
</p>

<a name="40708-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>While I acknowledge that the Minister outlined the possibility of this issue being discussed in public consultation on the draft network management duty guidance, the department does not have a duty to take on board all aspects of the consultation; the Bill as it stands allows only that guidance &quot;may&quot; be published, rather than a commitment that it &quot;shall&quot; be published.
</p>

<a name="40708-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>I welcome the fact that local authorities are given advice on the management of incidents, which covers diesel spills, and I support the idea of the emergency services and local authorities working together. But the Minister did not say whether local authorities have to adhere to such advice, nor whether it is ever checked that they are adhering to the advice by the emergency services. Can the Minister clarify this issue?

</p>

<a name="40708-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>It would appear that there is a system in place at the moment for dealing with diesel spills, but in practice it does not always work. The British Motorcyclists&#039; Federation&#039;s journal, the<i> Motorcycle News</i>, on 3 March 2004, revealed that there are now less than 3,000 dedicated UK traffic police, down from 9,000 in 1992. The other 6,000 are now used to tackle a variety of crimes. However, the forces claim that they still have time for traffic duties to ensure that our roads are safe.
</p>

<a name="40708-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>The British Motorcyclists&#039; Federation tested this claim. In five police force areas where, I understand, those 6,000 police officers have multiple roles, it found five dangerous diesel spills, each of which could have caused a crash. It concluded that four out of five of those diesel spills were not made safe, and the fifth one was made safe only because a road gritting lorry went past.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_947"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 947</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40708-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>The Association of Chief Police Officers has stated that if a diesel spill is likely to cause an accident it is deemed an emergency and you can call 999 to report it. If it is not, you should call the local police force or the council. That does not seem to have any effect on cleaning up a diesel spill. It may get a policeman out, but it does not make it safe.
</p>

<a name="40708-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>To highlight this concern, a traffic officer from Norfolk said that a diesel spill should be dealt with as a &quot;grade two emergency&quot;, which means that the police can put on their flashing blue lights and get there. At the officers&#039; discretion it can be changed to a grade one, which means that they can exceed the speed limit and go through red lights. The officer said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;If it&#039;s rush hour and only a grade two, you&#039;ll get there late to find that some motorcyclist has crashed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-11_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>I look to the Government to give an assurance that this issue in particular will be subject to discussions between the department, the emergency services and local authorities, as well as any other stakeholder they deem fit, be it as part of the consultation on another issue or as an issue in itself. This may be a small issue but I believe that it will make a huge difference to road users   and the prevention of accidents, which cause congestion.
</p>

<a name="40708-11_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>I make the point, once again, that motorcyclists represent 22 per cent of those killed on British roads each year, even though they represent only 4 per cent of the traffic. I beg to move.

<a name="40708-12_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am sorry that I was unable to reassure the noble Lord at the previous stage of the Bill that we are tackling the issue of diesel spillage. I recognise that it is a serious issue, particularly in respect of the safety of motorcyclists and others.
</p>

<a name="40708-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>As I mentioned at previous stages of the Bill, there are already regulations aimed at preventing diesel escaping in the first place. It is an offence to spill any oily substance on a carriageway if it is likely to cause danger. The Department for Transport has been tasked with considering the possibility of raising both the profile of the existing regulations and their enforcement.
</p>

<a name="40708-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>Turning to the issue of who is responsible for the removal of spills, this clearly falls to the local traffic authority. Guidance on dealing with diesel spillages and similar accidents is already covered in the code of   practice for maintenance management, and the network management duty guidance reinforces this in its advice to local traffic authorities on the management of incidents.
</p>

<a name="40708-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>In addition&#151;I hope this is a direct response to one of the noble Lord&#039;s stronger points&#151;the department is involved in drawing up engineering guidelines for powered two-wheelers, which will include the concerns of motorcyclists, when advising on the planning, designing, implementing and maintenance of the road network. So the action we are taking is not inconsiderable. As I sought to assure the House on the previous occasion, we recognise the issue raised by the noble Lord as a matter of considerable importance.

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>I hope that the noble Lord recognises the seriousness with which the Government view the safety of motorcyclists. He will be delighted to know that we will soon be launching a motorcycling strategy with a view to improving conditions for all motorcyclists. With that in mind, the department convened an advisory group on motorcycling that included representatives of the Motorcycling Action Group and the British Motorcyclists Federation. They have been working on a report that will contain recommendations to Government on the issues of most concern. We are expecting it to be published next month. Ministers will give it careful consideration when developing the strategy.
</p>

<a name="40708-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>I respect the points the noble Lord made about the accident rate for motorcyclists. Only a short while ago in response to a Question in the House I indicated how concerned we were about the rise in deaths and serious injuries among motorcyclists. That is why we are concerned to take the measures I have outlined. But there is a salient point in relation to the amendment. The noble Lord said that motorcyclists represented 22   per cent of those killed when they comprised only 4   per cent of the traffic. Those are chilling statistics that we take extremely seriously, as we do the upturn in motorcycle casualties, which is a worry to us all.
</p>

<a name="40708-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>However, diesel and oil spillages were present in less than 1 per cent of all injury accidents involving two-wheeled vehicles last year. Although I hope I have convinced the noble Lord, I am sure that he is aware that my colleagues and I have the issues of motorcycle safety very much in mind. We need to pursue the matters with vigour. The amendment relating to spillages is not justified by the figures, but we are taking on board the representations that the noble Lord has made so forcefully again today. We will keep the issue under review. I want to reassure him that motorcycle safety is an important feature of the Government&#039;s perspective on road safety.

<a name="40708-12_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his kind assurances and for the information he gave us about the report due for publication next month. Perhaps my reading skills are not up to it, but I have a copy of the code of practice for maintenance management and we could not find any reference to diesel spills.
</p>

<a name="40708-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>Furthermore, both the times I have come off my motorcycle on diesel spills, neither of those occasions were included in the accident statistics. It would be misleading to think that the accidents caused to motorcyclists due to diesel spills are just 1 per cent; perhaps the figure is much larger because they are not recorded. Notwithstanding that, I am grateful to the Minister for his assurances and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

&quot;(   )   No contribution may be requested under this section in respect of works carried out before regulations under this section have first been made.&quot;

<p><a name="st_131"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I thought that we knew where we were on this new section, and that through the process of Committee and Report we had gained an understanding that no retrospection was involved. But then it appears from comments made very recently by Ministers that there is to be retrospection, and that the way in which this section of the Bill will work is that it will be brought into effect next year some time, but the regulations will not be promulgated for the first time until some years afterwards. When the regulations are promulgated, the whole period between the Bill coming into effect and the regulations being agreed to will then be covered by the section, and there will be an immediate back-charging of the utilities which have done works in that period.
</p>

<a name="40708-13_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>My objection is not that utilities should be charged for such things; we are all agreed on that point. I object, however, to the idea that an unspecified and unquantified charge will suddenly materialise in five years&#039; time. Utilities are presumably meant to reserve for that eventuality&#151;but how can they reserve for something when they do not know the scale and extent of the charges? The Minister has said that these cases will be rare and occasional, but there is nothing in the Bill to say that; it all depends on the nature of the regulations.
</p>

<a name="40708-13_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>The Minister must be straight and keep to what he has said before&#151;that there will not be retrospection. Until it is possible for the utilities to know when the charges will arise and how large they are likely to be, they should not be asked to pay them. That seems to me the very basis of fairness and reasonableness, on which we thought we had agreed.
</p>

<a name="40708-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>My decision on the amendment depends very much on how the Minister replies. Given that we are at this stage, I shall not know until he has whether this is a matter that I want to take seriously. I would hope that if my noble friend Lord Astor and the Liberal Democrats have some reason for me not to divide the House on this matter, if the Government are going retrospective, they will let me know&#151;because I certainly shall divide the House if they are. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="40708-13_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   My Lords, I do not find myself very often in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, so it is a pleasure to agree with him today. It seems quite unreasonable that utilities should engage in work tomorrow, next week or the month after on the basis of the present law, then find that because regulations are made retrospective some time in the future their liabilities are much greater than they thought. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and myself, that that is not intended. Otherwise, I believe that the noble Lord has an important point.

<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="40708-13_spnew6"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   My Lords, I understand the point that my noble friend Lord Lucas is making, and I entirely agree with him. I had thought, although I may have got it wrong, that the Minister had given assurances about this matter before. I may not be right, and it would be very helpful if the Minister could clarify the situation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="40708-13_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I shall address myself to the issues, although I regret that I shall have at one stage to indicate in a rather technical way that the amendment would not quite achieve what the noble Lord seeks. However, it would do the noble Lord a disfavour if I merely addressed the technicality and not the real issues that he has raised.

</p>

<a name="40708-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>As the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, said, we have had considerable debate on these issues in Grand Committee and at Report. The concerns of utilities about the resurfacing powers have been raised previously, and it is right that they should be today. There is not a great deal to add to what I said before; I had sought to meet these points in the assurances given about the use of the powers. The assurances have been given, not only during the proceedings of the Bill in this House and in another place but outside the House by my colleagues in the department.
</p>

<a name="40708-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>I emphasise the point that the provision is not a way for authorities to get their roads resurfaced on the cheap. The Government envisage that the powers would be used only where problems were most serious, and where a succession of works had left roads in a particularly bad condition. Regulations will place the appropriate limitations on the circumstances in which these powers could be used. We gave the assurance on Report that the first of the regulations will be subject to affirmative resolution, so both Houses of Parliament will have the opportunity to consider them.
</p>

<a name="40708-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>We envisage that the authority itself would still be expected to make the largest contribution to resurfacing costs even when the new powers were triggered. The basis on which costs are to be shared between undertakers and the authority would of course be part of the regulations, so there will be an opportunity for this House to scrutinise the powers before they come into effect. As and when the regulations are brought forward, they will be developed with the help of undertakers and authorities, and will be subject to full public consultation.
</p>

<a name="40708-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>The amendments that the Government tabled at Report already limit the liability of undertakers to exclude any works before commencement of these clauses. Amendment No. 10 seeks to stretch that exclusion to the time when regulations are made. I understand the concerns about how contingencies for resurfacing costs can be dealt with by utility companies. But we need to balance that against the principle that where utilities&#039; street works have made a significant contribution towards damaging a road, the utilities in question should contribute towards the necessary resurfacing.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_953"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 953</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40708-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>As I said at Report, the Government have increased substantially the funding of maintenance on our roads, and we do not want to see that investment prejudiced. We do not of course want to make it difficult for utility companies to operate. I can assure your Lordships that all these matters will be the subject of proper discussion and consideration when developing the regulations so that we can come to a reasonable conclusion, which will take on board the point that the noble Lord has made.
</p>

<a name="40708-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>The amendment itself in fact only partially addresses the concerns that the noble Lord articulated so clearly. This is where I shall lapse into the slightly more technical argument. While the amendment would add a subsection making liability start only after the regulations have been made, it leaves intact subsection (2)(a), which was amended at Report to make it clear that the starting point is that, subject to the eventual provisions made in regulations, liability may start at commencement of the clause, irrespective of whether regulations have been made. So the amendment would inadvertently cast doubt on the intended effect of the provisions in new Section 78A, if it were made. That would be deleterious to how we envisage these issues developing and to how the noble Lord addressed them.

</p>

<a name="40708-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>Returning to the point of principle, I want to give the assurance that I have given in the past about these powers. The regulations will be developed in conjunction with the undertakers and authorities. They will take into account all the points that have been raised during the passage of the Bill. They will be subject to the fullest public consultation and of course they will be subject in the first instance to parliamentary scrutiny under the affirmative procedure for regulations. On that basis I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40708-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   My Lords, not really&#151;not at this stage. If my noble friend Lord Astor chooses to indicate that he would rather I did not divide&#151;by a thumbs down or similar motion&#151;I will of course follow his advice. However, I thought that we had established the principle in Committee and on Report that there would be no retrospection, and now we find that there is this long period between commencement and the issuing of regulations when retrospection will apply. Furthermore, there will be no indication of the extent of the coverage or of the costs when they are incurred.
</p>

<a name="40708-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>I thought that we had all agreed that there should be no retrospection, or at least not for more than six months or a year, which is survivable in the context of company accounts. The prospect of five years of retrospection is just not on and what the Minister said did not satisfy my concerns. I appreciate that the amendment is defective, but I hope that it is irritating enough to get the Government to correct it and put something in place that will work in principle. We all agree that utilities should pay their share of the costs. I hope that the amendment will make the Government hurry on the regulations so that they can.

<a name="40708-14_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Berkeley </b>   moved Amendment No. 11:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>Leave out Clause 48.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_137"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a probing amendment about the inspectors&#039; role in looking at road works. I am seeking a few words of comfort from my noble friend that those who do the roadworks well will get some reward for good behaviour because the inspections cost money. There has been a lot of correspondence between my noble friend and the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, on this subject. I shall not go over it now.
</p>

<a name="40708-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>The Government have commented that they see the role of using a stick to punish those companies that do not improve their service. However, they have said little about a corresponding carrot for those who do improve; that is, a reduction in the number or proportion of inspections, and therefore a reduction in cost, if a company&#039;s work is shown to be good. It would good to hear from my noble friend whether the percentage of inspections carried out will vary <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_956"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 956</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

according to the previous performance of the utility, or maybe even the local authority. It would be good to see whether the Government will accept the principle that the better company should, after a bit, have the proportion of its works inspected reduced, even down to something like 10 per cent. Of course, if the inspections found that its work was getting worse, it would be perfectly reasonable to put the percentage up higher. It would be very nice to hear a few words from my noble friend about the carrot as well the stick. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="40708-14_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I appreciate the spirit in which my noble friend proposes to delete an important clause of the Bill. But, despite bringing a nuclear weapon to his aid, I understand that he is seeking to air a concept and a principle that I find attractive.
</p>

<a name="40708-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>As the noble Lord will know, it is certainly the case that in other areas where we have regulation it becomes lighter-touch when the performance record of the body to be inspected merits confidence. I think that that is the burden of my noble friend&#039;s remarks. I think it is an attractive concept and one that is not unknown to government in a number of areas. I will bear in mind the principle that he is identifying. We have quite a way to go before we reach conclusions on these issues so it is a helpful contribution.
</p>

<a name="40708-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>But he will recognise that I defend the clause. It plays an important part in the Bill. If I thought that my noble friend was about to discharge his nuclear weapon then I would be taking great steps to dissuade him or to seek a nuclear bunker to which to retreat after he had done so. I hope that my noble friend will recognise that he has had the chance to articulate an interesting concept and we will look at it carefully.
</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="40708-14_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, I am very grateful to my noble friend for that response. It is exactly what I hoped he would say. I had no intention of throwing any nuclear weapons in his direction. I was trying to convert my thoughts into an amendment that fitted into the Bill in order to get some very helpful words of comfort. I am sure he will understand why I chose the simpler option. I am very grateful to him. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="40708-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham </b>   moved Amendment No. 12:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>Page 45, line 6, leave out sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii).</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>




<p><a name="st_141"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 12 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 15. On Report, we debated an amendment moved by the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, that sought to prevent the immobilisation of a vehicle for a period of 15 minutes after a penalty charge notice had been issued for a parking contravention. On that occasion, I explained that we could not accept that amendment because it would apply not just to overstaying in a paying parking bay but also to other circumstances. It would have also prevented <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_957"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 957</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

immobilisation for 15 minutes following the issue of a charge notice for other parking contraventions, such as parking on yellow lines. That is why we could not accept it as drafted. People who knowingly park unlawfully in the first place should not be given a period of grace against having their vehicles immobilised.
</p>

<a name="40708-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>However, I indicated that we were prepared to amend what is now Clause 68 so that a vehicle cannot be immobilised for contravening the conditions of use of a paid-for parking bay until a period of 15 minutes has elapsed from the time that a penalty charge notice for the contravention was issued. That is the purpose of our amendments to Clause 68 and I think they meet the argument that the noble Viscount advanced in Committee and on Report.
</p>

<a name="40708-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>Amendment No. 12 removes the existing prohibition on immobilisation for overstaying until a period of 15 minutes has elapsed from the end of the period of parking paid for. Amendment No. 13 replaces it with a prohibition on immobilising a vehicle in a parking place for a period of 15 minutes after a penalty charge notice has been issued for failing to pay a parking charge, failing to display properly a parking ticket showing that parking has been paid for or failing to remove a vehicle from a parking space at the end of the time paid for.
</p>

<a name="40708-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>The prohibition on immobilisation for failure to pay a parking charge or to display a ticket would cover, for example, the eventuality of someone who went to a nearby shop to obtain change for the ticket machine and who, as matters stand at present, could potentially receive a penalty charge and have his vehicle clamped while carrying out that activity. The noble Viscount made a persuasive case that people may not immediately be able to meet the requirements of the parking charge, and that an element of grace would be appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40708-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>The proposed new paragraph in Amendment No. 9 replaces the provision on overstaying removed by Amendment No. 8. It means that there would be a period of grace of at least 15 minutes before a vehicle could be immobilised for overstaying. In practice, that period could be longer, depending on when the contravention of overstaying was detected and when the penalty charge notice issued.
</p>

<a name="40708-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 are consequential. They address the anomaly that the Government seek to correct. Rather than a no-score draw, which is how the noble Viscount characterised our position last time we discussed the issue, I hope that we have the most unusual phenomenon of a win-win situation. I hope that he will accept the government amendments in those terms. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_142"></a>
<a name="40708-15_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for addressing the concerns that we raised in Committee and on Report, and for bringing forward his own amendment, which deals with the problem. As I said previously, I have no problem with the issue of a ticket, but my concern has always been for someone who is trying to find a machine that works having to pay a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_958"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 958</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

charge. They might get a ticket and can then write to say that the machine was not working or whatever, but there are too many instances in London where the clamping car follows the traffic warden issuing the ticket. Suddenly the innocent comes back and has been made guilty, inconvenienced, and has to pay and then appeal.
</p>

<a name="40708-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>The amendment will not lead to people parking in places where they should not park, and one advantage of it is that it will reduce the number of appeals in which the payment of clamping has to be refunded, because of the 15 minutes. It will be beneficial to the system, and I support it.
</p>

<a name="40708-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

&quot;(   )   enabling an adjudicator to refer an appeal made under subsection (1) back to the enforcement authority if he sees fit.&quot;

<p><a name="st_146"></a>The noble Viscount said: My Lords, I see that a similar government amendment is grouped with my Amendment No. 16. However, it may be for the benefit of the House if I briefly explain the purpose of mine. The Government have again been very helpful and addressed my concern, and I will leave the Minister to put the case for his own amendment.
</p>

<a name="40708-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Amendment No. 16 is about adjudication, fairness and mitigating circumstances. It gives parking adjudicators the statutory power to refer an appeal case back to the enforcement authority if they feel that the authority should reconsider the case in the light of mitigating circumstances. Amendment No. 17 is the wording suggested by the London chief adjudicator, Martin Wood, who argued that the adjudicators need more teeth so that, in particular cases, they should have the power to alter penalty charges. The example <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_959"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 959</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

raised was if someone has been on holiday and his permit falls off his windscreen, so he returns to find &#163;1,000-worth of tickets that he then has to try to contest.

</p>

<a name="40708-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>The amendment is also supported by the National Parking Adjudication Service and its chief adjudicator, Caroline Shepherd. She and Martin Wood have been enormously helpful to me in addressing the issue, for which I am grateful.
</p>

<a name="40708-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>National and London parking adjudicators have expressed concern, in various annual reports over the years, that some councils have not been using their power to take into account mitigating circumstances when reconsidering fixed penalty notices in the correct manner, and that there should be more scrutiny and transparency. Recent Department for Transport figures published in the <i>Evening Standard</i>, no less, on Tuesday 6 July showed that drivers across England spent &#163;1 billion on parking charges and fines last year, which is 50 per cent up since the Government came to power in 1997. I am not sure what the Minister feels about that, or what it says about motorists&#039; behaviour during the period of his Government, but I leave him to consider that.

</p>

<a name="40708-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>It is important to point out that adjudicators already refer cases back to local authorities, but the adjudicators are concerned that those referrals are not considered properly. Not all local authorities are bad, but not all are   good. I can give some examples of good local authorities&#151;Winchester, Oxford and Harrogate&#151;but in Birmingham and Liverpool it can take up to seven months to get a reply to a letter.
</p>

<a name="40708-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>The amendment ensures that the ability to take account of mitigating circumstances remains with local authorities, but the power of the National Parking Adjudication Service to refer cases back to them will encourage them to be more responsible and accountable in the use of that discretionary power. Importantly, it avoids making the power subject to judicial review, which was a concern of the Minister. Therefore, it will be of no additional cost to the taxpayer. It has received support from the National Parking Adjudication Service as well as the RAC Foundation. It would give tribunals a firmer overseeing principle.
</p>

<a name="40708-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>The National Parking Adjudication Service has highlighted that it is vital, in conjunction with the amendment, to have strong guidance to ensure that when a case is referred back to the local authority it will be undertaken or overseen by the chief executive of the complaints department within that council, so that it is not reconsidered only by the same individual who looked at the case to start with. The NPAS has also called for better standards for dealing with parking penalties, and is calling for secondary legislation to allow the Audit Commission to outline standards that should be met, rather than the arbitrary system of enforcement that exists today. It would be interesting to hear what the Minister says on that.
</p>

<a name="40708-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>The NPAS has also suggested&#151;again, we look to the Minister to give us some understanding of the Government&#039;s thinking&#151;that local authorities should <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_960"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 960</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

not be allowed to spend the additional money raised from parking fines on other things until certain standards have been attained.
</p>

<a name="40708-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>The Government have moved a long way on the issue, and their amendment is rather similar to mine. However, there are still some questions which I hope the Minister will answer when he comes to explain his amendment. I beg to move.
</p>

<p><a name="st_147"></a>
<a name="40708-16_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Viscount for his persistence on the matter. Were my noble friend Lord Bradshaw here, he would add to my thanks, because he has also expressed some concerns about it. In supporting the amendment, I plead guilty to a certain amount of inconsistency. My feeling is usually that most things are best left to local authorities and local discretion. Nevertheless, it has become evident that, at the worse end of the scale, some of the activities of local councils in not taking mitigating circumstances into account are virtually a miscarriage of justice, and cause immense anger and frustration among the public.
</p>

<a name="40708-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>Under those circumstances and given the very strong will of the adjudication service that such a provision be in the Bill, I am glad in principle to support any such amendment on offer today. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.
</p>




<p><a name="st_148"></a>
<a name="40708-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I had it in mind to congratulate the noble Viscount, both on his assiduity in pursuing the issues over a long period and on the considerable success of the drafting of the amendments. We will not move our amendment to score a point over him at all; we merely seek to make eminently workable the case that he has established. I was in my most benign mood, but it never lasts long. It certainly does not last very long if I get an onslaught on the issue of the present parking policy of local authorities and what the Government are meant to do about it. First, we would be here all day on this issue of where the motorist stands in his right to park in certain areas. Secondly, I do not think that this is the time to pick up the cudgels in that respect. There is probably a good deal more agreement between all three Front Benches on these issues than might be thought when tendentious matters arise in particular cases in the press.
</p>

<a name="40708-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>I bear in mind the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, mentioned a moment ago. We have become concerned at the increasing number of cases&#151;and the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, established this case at earlier stages of the Bill&#151;in which there could be a real miscarriage of justice because of the rather rigid way in which the procedures operate. So we are entirely sympathetic to the case that the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, has made so ably and well.
</p>

<a name="40708-16_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>The noble Viscount&#039;s amendment highlights the important issue of the need for proper consideration of cases where penalty charges are incurred, but compelling mitigating circumstances suggest that they should not be enforced. He gave us a number of examples on previous occasions including one in which a vehicle was abandoned in a snow storm the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_961"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 961</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

previous night and the owner was penalised the next day before he could even get to his car. That, to put it mildly, is not the basis on which parking penalties should normally be enforced.
</p>

<a name="40708-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>When we discussed this issue on Report, we said that we intended to take into account how to tackle mitigating circumstances. However, that rests first and foremost with the local authorities undertaking the civil enforcement of traffic contraventions. It is their decisions that are important. The real need is to get enforcing authorities properly to consider mitigating circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40708-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>One element will certainly be our determination to issue statutory guidance to authorities under Clause 76 on dealing with such cases. By virtue of subsection (2) of that clause, authorities will be under a duty to have regard to such guidance. However, giving adjudicators the ability to refer cases back to the enforcing authorities if they think that they have not properly exercised their discretion would be an additional useful string to add to the bow. The noble Viscount has made his case and we agree with him.
</p>

<a name="40708-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>We have subjected the noble Viscount&#039;s amendment, as we are bound to do, to the scrutiny of parliamentary draftsmen. Government Amendment No. 18 would enable regulations to be made providing that mitigating circumstances are a ground for appeal and that the potential outcome of such an appeal is that the adjudicator could decide to refer the matter back to the enforcement authority for reconsideration. That would effectively be giving the adjudicators a supervisory role over how enforcing authorities exercise their discretion in cases where there are mitigating circumstances. If the case is cut and dried and there are no issues to be discussed, the regulations would go through in the normal way. However, we are talking about cases where there might be mitigating circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40708-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>We believe that, with our amendment, Clause 69 will provide sufficiently wide powers to enable regulations to be made to deal with representations and appeals, including giving adjudicators a lever to address the issue of mitigating circumstances. That is the burden of the noble Viscount&#039;s argument and all the discussions on this issue. As I think will be recognised, the detail of those regulations is for another day. However, I assure the House that their preparation will be subject to wide-ranging consultation. We will certainly be discussing their scope with the chief adjudicators.

to the guidance, will the Government undertake to address the point raised by both adjudicators&#151;that it is important that, when cases are sent back to local authorities, they are not overseen by the same individuals who looked at the case initially, but go to the chief executive&#039;s complaint department within that council?

It would not be appropriate to return the matter to those who may not have been as judicious in their assessment as the adjudicator would have liked.

The Bill is going to extend the powers of civil enforcement officers to move vehicles; therefore, there will be much more opportunity for difficulties and problems to arise.

Am I not right that the Lord Chancellor is the person who makes regulations with regard to the adjudicators? Is it therefore not sensible that he should receive the report on how they discharge their functions, as he has set them up to do? Will that still happen? As far as I can see, the Minister&#039;s amendment changes that. The report would go to the Secretary of State, who is not responsible for making the regulations for adjudicators. Will there be a split? It seems a slightly strange process. I may not have phrased the question correctly; I accept that I may not have. However, I should be grateful for clarification from the Minister.

<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="40708-17_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Swinfen: </b>   My Lords, it would be totally illogical if the amendment were agreed to, because the Bill states that the Lord Chancellor appoints the adjudicators and makes the regulations.

</p>




<p><a name="st_158"></a>
<a name="40708-17_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the issue concerns the functional operation of the adjudicators and the effectiveness of their actions. The report goes to the Secretary of State because they are working within his purview. The reason the Lord Chancellor establishes them is that they have a quasi-legal position. But the reports go to the appropriate Secretary of State or, in the case of Wales, the National Assembly.
</p>

<a name="40708-17_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>It is not quite as the noble Lord suggested&#151;perhaps I did not make the matter entirely clear. The Lord Chancellor approves the appointments&#151;they are made with his consent&#151;but the adjudicators are appointed by the enforcing authorities, which are within the purview of the Secretary of State. I should have thought that it was obvious why those appointments are made with the consent of the Lord Chancellor: because of the quasi-judicial dimension. But they are bodies established by the enforcing authorities and answerable to the Secretary of State or, in Wales, to the National Assembly.

<a name="40708-17_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Swinfen: </b>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, if the report states that the regulations need to be changed, which could well happen, surely that should go to the Lord Chancellor, not the Secretary of State.

His consent is required because there is a quasi-judicial aspect to the adjudicators&#039; work. But their work concerns operational matters and their reports are judgments on enforcing authorities.

<a name="40708-17_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, the amendment moved by the noble Lord is identical to one that he moved in Grand Committee on 4 May. He may recall that he and I exchanged some words then and he challenged me to produce figures for the increase in accidents on motorways and on smaller roads that has taken place elsewhere when speed limits have been raised. I then undertook, as president of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents&#151;an interest that I declare in this debate&#151;to ensure that a brief was prepared for the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, and sent to him. That was done three days later and copies were sent to the noble Viscounts, Lord Goschen and Lord Astor.
</p>

<a name="40708-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>I am a little surprised that the noble Lord, Lord   Rotherwick, is moving the amendment again given the information contained in that briefing. For example, it stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a>&quot;A study of the effects of raising the speed limit on Washington State&#039;s rural freeways from 55 mph to 65 mph in 1987, found that the incidence of fatal crashes more than doubled afterwards compared with what would have been expected if the limit had not been raised.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;A 1999 study compared the number of motor vehicle occupants killed in 24 States that raised their speed limits in 1995&#150;96 with the period before the speed limits were increased, and with 7 States that did not increase the speed limit. The study concluded that where the limits were increased deaths on interstates and freeways rose by 15%, but did not increase in those states where the speed limit was left at 65 mph&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>There is a great deal more, but I do not intend to read out the whole letter. I will just make the point that it is a three-page briefing which counters, point by point, the arguments used by the noble Lord in Grand Committee. As I said, it is a pity that he is not using that in this debate.
</p>

<a name="40708-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>I shall give one more example. The briefing states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a>&quot;In states that increased speed limits to 70 mph, deaths were 35% higher than expected based on deaths in states that did not increase their speed limit, resulting in 1,100 extra deaths&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40708-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>It would be the height of irresponsibility for us to contemplate an increase in the speed limit, largely&#151;if I recall the noble Lord&#039;s argument in Grand Committee&#151;on the grounds that, as most people do not observe it, the obvious thing is to raise the limit. The truth is that if the limit were raised, the acceptability of a new breaking of the law would be raised by 10 or 15 miles an hour. Instead of breaking the law at 80 miles an hour, people would be breaking it at 90 miles an hour.

There are many more lanes and there is no outside lane as such&#151;you can pass on either side. Under those circumstances, there may be a case for reducing speed. Those circumstances do not exist on our motorways.

if speed limits were raised to 80 miles per hour, casualties on motorways would rise by between five and 10 per cent. Based on 2002 casualty figures, that would suggest an extra 75 to 150 would be killed or seriously injured.

<a name="40708-18_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </b>   My Lords, on these Benches we have consistently opposed the notion that the speed limit on our motorways should increase. It seems extraordinary, given that our motorways are currently the safest roads we enjoy, that we should jeopardise that position by tacking such a complicated subject on to a Bill such as this, and taking such a drastic step with so little debate and evidence. I hope the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, does not push this amendment, because we will certainly not be supporting it from these Benches.

<a name="40708-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>I have a fragment of sympathy with the noble Lord and his sense of frustration about general speed limit policy. It has become clear that we need a proper debate&#151;what I think people call a &quot;mature debate&quot;, whatever that means&#151;on the whole question of speed limits: how they are set, and whether they are enforced. In that context, I would be quite happy, and would support the Government looking at motorway speed limits again, but not in isolation from all other types of roads, and certainly not in the context of this Bill.

<a name="40708-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>Like every other motorist, I have broken speed limits on a regular basis.

I feel&#151;having done 30,000 miles per year until comparatively recently, much of it on motorways&#151;that an extension of the speed limits in the way outlined in this amendment would be grossly irresponsible.
</p>

<a name="40708-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>We are all familiar with the dangers of driving on our roads. My own motorway experiences tell me that the problem is not so much speed but, quite often, driver reflexes. Even smallish modern motor cars are capable of speeds undreamed of 30 or 40 years ago, when I first got a driving licence. There are far too many vehicles being driven at 80 miles per hour by people with their brains firmly stuck at 30 miles per hour. Anyone who has seen the carnage on our motorways caused by excessive speed would feel that to pass such an amendment after so little debate would be grossly irresponsible.

<a name="40708-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>I notice from reading the national newspapers that there is an organisation called the Association of British Drivers, which seems to be one of the few bodies in favour of this measure. I do not know who it speaks for. It certainly does not speak for me, having held a driving licence for more than 40 years. It is supported by the <i>Daily Mail</i>. I have a simple rule of thumb: if the <i>Daily Mail</i> is in favour of it, I am, by and large, against it. The Association of British Drivers does not speak for the majority of drivers, I am sure. We all think that we are better drivers than we are, I suspect. It is a bit of a male characteristic, as one sees on the motorways. I know that if I catch up with a Jaguar&#151;I used to drive one myself, so I am not picking on Jaguar drivers&#151;with a personalised number-plate, it will rarely move out of the outside lane. All too often, the driver appears to feel that he&#151;and it is invariably a &quot;he&quot;&#151;is somehow diminishing his masculinity by doing so.
</p>

<a name="40708-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>If this amendment were accepted and that driver could drive legally at 80 miles per hour&#151;which, as we all know, would mean 90 miles per hour&#151;it would mean he was driving in exactly the same way, except that he would do so just that bit faster. We need not higher speed limits but better driver education. I know it is not, strictly speaking, a matter for this amendment. Despite the attacks on the proliferation of cameras, I am inclined to drive more carefully since their proliferation, for the reason&#151;like everyone else&#151;that I do not wish to risk my own driving licence.

<a name="40708-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>My noble friend Lord Rotherwick is quite right to draw attention to the fact that, at the moment, we have a totally unacceptable situation with a <i>de facto</i> speed limit on motorways of around 85 miles per hour, below which the police will not stop drivers in good weather. Anyone who drives regularly on motorways will see people driving quite happily at 85 miles per hour and not being stopped by the police. My noble friend is quite right to draw attention to the fact that this uncertainty about speed limits&#151;having a law that the Government know perfectly well is not designed to be enforced at the level set down in statute&#151;is quite wrong. For the benefit of the noble Lord, Lord Snape, my noble friend has already admitted that the Secretary of State has the powers to vary the speed limit without resorting to primary legislation. The purpose of this debate, I would suggest, is more to draw attention to the fact that the Government cannot just brush this under the carpet and pretend it is all too difficult to deal with. There does need to be a proper debate about speed limits. To the <br>&nbsp;<br>

It is not because they think that the speed limit ought to be 10 mph higher, but they recognise that a considerable number of motorists have difficulty in regulating their cars precisely to the speed limit&#151;as evidenced every time one travels on the motorway. That will occur no matter what speed limit is enforced on motorways.
</p>

<a name="40708-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Oppenheim-Barnes, challenged my noble friend Lord Faulkner on his American illustration on the grounds that American roads are not exactly the same as ours. Of course they are not; each country has a road system to reflect its geography, the weight of traffic and to some extent the nature of its drivers. In Europe, where speed limits are much higher than 70 mph&#151;indeed, much higher than noble Lords opposite dream of&#151;we see carnage. The figures for road deaths in France and Italy are horrendous.
</p>

<a name="40708-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>Noble Lords may argue that French roads differ from British roads. That is certainly so, but Britain has tremendous problems with pedestrian deaths on urban roads, which is why children suffer so on our roads. France has much freer motorways and lighter traffic than is customary on all our main motorways. I hate to say it, but whereas there have been 6.1 deaths per 100,000 in the United Kingdom, there have been 11.1 in Italy and 13.8 in France.
</p>

<a name="40708-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>When we debated the issue on Report, the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, asked me whether I recognised that the <i>autoroutes</i> in France were much safer. He asked me when I had been worried about speed in France. I have been worried pretty much every time I have been in France. Whenever the motorways have become crowded, I have been anxious. I doubt that many noble Lords who have driven on French <i>autoroutes</i> are unaware, first, that the speed limit is 10 mph higher than ours, and, secondly, that there is a built-in tolerance level that means that a fair percentage of drivers expect to travel a good deal faster. Therefore when one travels at around the legal limit of 80 mph, in an outside lane, in reasonable queues of traffic&#151;that is to say, those regulated in distance&#151;regularly you have drivers coming at you at over 100 mph. We all know that phenomenon. Not a motoring correspondent in the country does not attest to that from time to time and even indicate that it sharpens one&#039;s reflexes. I am afraid that it also produces drastic accident statistics.
</p>

<a name="40708-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>I accept one aspect of the noble Lord&#039;s argument. He asked whether it was not time that we had a review of speed limits. Yes, it is. Such a review is under way. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_970"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 970</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

We expect it to conclude before the end of the year. It will give us further evidence on how we should tackle the issues.

</p>

<a name="40708-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>When the reputable organisation on whose behalf my noble friend Lord Faulkner spoke, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, produced statistics indicating that speed kills, they were sufficiently strong for the Government to feel the need to convey that message to the whole country. Extending the motorway speed limit would give an indication in the wrong direction. Nevertheless, our minds are not closed on these issues. If our review indicates that we can safely increase the speed limit without deleterious effects, we will return to the issues after the end of the year.

<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="40708-19_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   My Lords, that was an exciting debate. I am not sure whether the rest of the Traffic Management Bill will be so lively; perhaps it will be, now that lunch has finished.
</p>

<a name="40708-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>The emotion expressed is perhaps derived from the fact that people envisage drivers travelling faster on the motorways. Our angle is to try to legalise motorists who already travel at 80 mph and not to criminalise them as they are at the moment. We have already heard from one noble Lord opposite that, if he travelled at 70 mph, everybody overtook him. I do not agree with many of the arguments that increasing speed means that accidents will occur. There was a period in the 1980s when speeds went up and the number of incidents went down, so that cannot be a logical argument.
</p>

<a name="40708-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>Cars in the USA are built to travel at only 50 to 60 mph; they do not perform technically in the same way as European cars. The argument about Europe is more difficult, but I still believe that in some respects the difference is like chalk and cheese.
</p>

<a name="40708-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>I am confused by the views expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Scott of Needham Market, because her party&#039;s Front-Bench spokesman in another place says the exact opposite of what she said. As the Front-Bench spokesman, presumably he has some view. He says:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a>After Clause 84, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_13"></a><br>
   &quot;PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE LONDON CONGESTION CHARGE

<br>
(1)   Section 295 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 (c. 29) (road user charging) is amended as follows.


<br>
(2)   After subsection (1) there is inserted&#151; 


<br>
&quot;(1A)   After the coming into force of section (Public consultation on the London Congestion Charge) of the Traffic Management Act 2004, the Mayor of London and Transport for London may not establish, extend or operate a scheme under subsection (1) above unless the scheme has been approved by a majority of the residents of any London borough proposed to be included, wholly or in part, in the charging area.


<br>
(1B)   The approval of a scheme mentioned in subsection (1A) shall be determined by&#151;


<br>
(a)   a local referendum conducted by the borough concerned under section 116 of the Local Government Act 2003 (c. 26) (local polls); and


<br>
(b)   where at least 50 per cent of the residents of the borough concerned have voted in that referendum.


<br>
(1C)   Subsection (1A) shall not apply in the case of a scheme already in operation, but Transport for London shall take into account the result of any referendum that may be conducted by a borough in which such a scheme is in operation in determining&#151;


<br>
(a)   whether it is reasonable to continue to operate an existing scheme concerned; or


<br>
(b)   whether the existing scheme shall be modified.&quot;


<br>
(3)   After paragraph 3 of Schedule 23 (road user charging) there is inserted&#151;


<br>
&quot;3A.   A charging scheme may only be made by the Mayor if it is also approved by the council of the borough or boroughs, included wholly or partly within the boundaries of the scheme, following a referendum conducted by the borough or boroughs concerned under section 116 of the Local Government Act 2003.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_176"></a>The noble Viscount said: My Lords, this is a simple but important amendment. I see no reason that the Government should not accept it. After all, they believe in local people being consulted on local issues. The amendment requires that the congestion charge should be extended in London only if it is clearly supported by local people and local councils, who know best about the local economy and the effects that the introduction of a charge might have on the local way of life. It does not empower any council to enforce the lifting of an existing charge zone, although it rightly says that the Mayor and Transport for London should take note of local opinion on the impact of the charge.


</p>

<a name="40708-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>The Minister said in a rather brief debate on Report that he accepted that there should be consultation on such a controversial policy&#151;and so there should be. But the trouble with the congestion charge is that its impact on business and local life is very local while the Mayor&#039;s consultation, such as it is&#151;apparently, 3 million letters were sent out to which there was a 3 per cent response; not a very high hit rate&#151;covers the whole of London, including areas far distant and totally unrelated to those areas where the charge is threatened to be introduced. Even the Mayor admits that, according to his private surveys, over 60 per cent of local people are against extending the charge.
</p>

<a name="40708-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>I take no particular view on the charge. I believe, as set out in the amendment, that it is a matter for local people. Surely they must be allowed to decide. The <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_972"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 972</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government legislated for local referendums only last year, so what possible reason can the Minister think of to say that they should not be used as is proposed in this amendment?
</p>

<a name="40708-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>My amendment states that local people should have the right to have their say and that the Mayor should be required to listen to them. In this, as in other areas, we believe in extending the right to choose. I would be surprised if the Government were, by contrast, to defend the Labour Party&#039;s newest member&#039;s right to dictate.
</p>

<a name="40708-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>Local determination featured heavily in the mayoral election and was supported by the Liberal Democrats, particularly by their candidate, Simon Hughes. I am sure that the Lib Dems will show their normal consistency in these matters. Perhaps I may remind your Lordships&#039; of what Simon Hughes said in the campaign:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a>&quot;Liberal Democrats support the principle of Congestion Charging in central London and are committed to making it work better for all Londoners. We will: . . .  Only consider expansion of the zone in boroughs already partly covered by the zone. Decision would ultimately be decided by a vote in a local ballot of registered electors in the possible extension areas&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>That is exactly what my amendment provides. I hope that the Government will support local democracy instead of just paying lip service to it. I beg to move.

<a name="40708-20_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   My Lords, this is a mischievous and misguided proposal. It is mischievous because, among other things, it proposes a hurdle of 50 per cent of the voters having to take part before a referendum would have any validity, knowing that that is a very high hurdle. It is also mischievous because not only today but also on a previous occasion when the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, raised this matter he referred to his amendment as a &quot;simple little amendment&quot;. It is no such thing. It is an amendment that seeks to do battle not just against the existing congestion charge system in London but against any extension of it in London and against the possibility of it being introduced in many other cities and towns, which are naturally thinking about it now because of what we all know to be the great success of the congestion charge system so far in London.

</p>

<a name="40708-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>The other reason why I think that the amendment is misguided, misconceived and mischievous is because it provides that a very narrow electorate should determine for everybody whether the congestion charge system should be extended or initiated in another city. It is concerned to have a vote among,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a>&quot;the residents of any London borough proposed to be included . . .  in the charging area&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>Whether there is a congestion charge in any London borough is of vital interest, not only to the residents or the businesses of that area but also to vast numbers of other people who drive into or through it. I refer not only to visitors but also to people who commute regularly. They have at least as much interest in the matter as anyone else.
</p>

<a name="40708-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>If we are to have voting or consultation, surely it must be done on a wide scale. I need hardly remind the noble Viscount&#151;who knows very well but deliberately <br>&nbsp;<br>

did not mention in his speech&#151;that the Greater London Authority Act 1999 requires the Mayor to consult before any congestion charge system is introduced or extended. Consultation has been carried out already and will be done again. That is a much more sensible way of dealing with the matter than having a narrow voting system as proposed by the noble Viscount.

</p>

<a name="40708-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>One important aspect of the amendment is the issue of local accountability. One of the most unacceptable features of the current congestion charge is that there is no accountability for anybody outside the GLA. Have we ever been told exactly how much the scheme has cost, how much it has raised and how much of that has been put into improving public transport other than empty red bus after empty red bus, one behind another? There is no accountability for the ordinary people who use London&#039;s streets. I would hazard a guess that, given the operating costs, the system is not only not making money but also losing a substantial amount.

</p>

<a name="40708-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>The system is also totally unacceptable for people who live very close to the edge of the zone. The amendment refers to boroughs that are partly but not wholly within the scheme. That is another consideration to which your Lordships should give some thought before deciding whether to reject the amendment.

However, if the measure goes through she will have to pay &#163;5 for the privilege. It would be much cheaper to go out and buy a new toy or colouring book.

The debate so far has given the game away, because, although the amendment purports to be about consultation on the congestion charge, the debate has been about the charge itself. In that sense, he is driving a Trojan bus through your Lordships&#039; House. Sorry, that was a bit feeble. From the point of view of these Benches, it is a matter for London people and the London Mayor. My friend in another place who was our mayoral candidate was quite right if he wanted to offer, as part of his package for Mayor, a local referendum on this subject. It is not for your Lordships&#039; House to impose that condition on the Mayor, who has after all only just been elected on a perfectly open platform.
</p>

<a name="40708-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>I am a little surprised to hear the noble Lord, Lord Monson, refer to the Mayor&#039;s mandate perhaps being wafer-thin because so few people voted. The entire British constitution is based on that. It is often the case that the government do not enjoy a majority. We are skating on rather thin ice if we pretend that immediately after an election the views and the platform on which the winner stood can be overturned by Members of your Lordships&#039; House. From the point of view of these Benches, we take this amendment at face value. It is about whether some sort of local referendum should be a statutory obligation. We do not think that it should, and in that sense there is no inconsistency between that and the voluntary offering of such a ballot or referendum by my friend in the other place.

<a name="40708-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>I take issue with the proposals about a referendum. There are existing, clear obligations on the Mayor of London who was, incidentally, elected by more than a simple plurality of votes. The supplementary vote system required that second choices were counted in the election. There is already a strong obligation on the Mayor of London to consult. Indeed, the consultation that seems to have excited some noble Lords is not about a specific proposal to extend the area of the congestion charge in London. It is about a proposal to amend the transport strategy of the Mayor of London. If having considered the outcome of that consultation, the Mayor of London believes that he should amend the transport strategy, there would then be a further detailed consultation on specific proposals in respect of the extension of the congestion charge zone. There are already substantial requirements on the Mayor to consult in the Greater London Authority Act 1999.
</p>

<a name="40708-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>In his amendment, the noble Viscount is attempting to impose belt, braces, string and sealing wax in a series of tests that must be passed by the Mayor of London before any congestion charge change can take place. Not only would there presumably still be those requirements for two stages of consultation; there would then be the requirement of a referendum and a further requirement for the approval of the individual local authorities concerned. The fundamental fallacy of all of this is that it is restricted to those residents of particular boroughs who are affected by the change.
</p>

<a name="40708-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>I recently fought an election for the London Assembly. The proposed extension of the congestion charge zone did not apply anywhere within the borders of the constituency that I fought in the London Assembly elections. It was, however, an extremely topical issue as far as people in the southern part of my constituency were concerned, because they might have been affected. We have heard the touching tale of the putative issues affecting the family of the noble Lord, Lord Monson, and events of cuddly toys being left behind. However, there were residents in the area that I previously represented for the London Assembly who were concerned that they would have to pay a congestion charge any time they went to the supermarket or to visit the graves of relatives in nearby cemeteries.

</p>

<a name="40708-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>The problem with this amendment is that they would still have no more say in the proposals concerned than exists at present in terms of the consultation. They would not be enfranchised in any way, and they would not be given any more right to intervene. That is a fundamental fallacy in the amendment. I was unconvinced by the logic of the proposed extension to the congestion charge. What we were being asked to do as Londoners was agree to the subsidy of the residents of Kensington and Chelsea, many of whom are extremely well-off already, so that they could get discounts on the congestion charge, whether they were visiting family members or driving at random across central London, because they would be enabled to have the residents discount. Why give a referendum to the people who would benefit from the change&#151;the people who would receive the subsidy&#151;through a reduced payment of the charge? They will get <br>&nbsp;<br>

My reading of the amendment is not that the residents of the borough concerned can make it happen but that they can make it not happen; in other words, they have a veto. Of course, there are others who are concerned and who have a considerable interest. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, referred to commuters. Surely those living in the borough concerned have the greatest interest. Before such a scheme happens, those people at least should really want it. They should not as a group be heavily against such a charge being made within their borough. For that reason, I do not think that this is as nuclear as noble Lords who have spoken against the amendment have suggested. It is merely ensuring that the residents of the borough have the greatest say before anything happens.

All sorts of dreadful warnings were being given at that point of how London would grind to a halt, that people would refuse to pay and that it would add to congestion, not alleviate it. Indeed, we had a debate that the noble Baroness initiated on traffic in London, in which I remember I crossed swords with her on this subject.

It has made a huge difference to the volume of congestion in London. The volume of traffic has fallen by 30 per cent in the centre. Londoners are able to move about much more freely. The air is better; the quality of public transport has improved; the red buses <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="40708-21_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Oppenheim-Barnes: </b>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that figures were published only last week showing that the air quality on Marylebone Road is one of the worst in any inner city in the world?
</p>




<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="40708-21_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, I am talking about air quality in central London as a whole, which has improved as a result of the diminution of traffic.
</p>

<a name="40708-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>We have had a long debate on this. But, briefly, my second point relates to the will of the public. I cannot think of any better way to ask the public what they think than to have an election for the whole of London in which everyone has a vote. That happened in June and it produced a result that was not to the liking of the party opposite. Sadly, it was not to the liking of my noble friend Lord Harris either.
</p>

<a name="40708-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>It is an inescapable fact that in the mayoral election the only candidates who were in favour of scrapping the congestion charge were from the Conservative Party and, I think, the UKIP. All the other parties and candidates were in favour of continuing it and support the Mayor&#039;s approach. If the people of London have spoken in that way, it is outrageous for this House to attempt to undo that result.

<a name="40708-21_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Monson: </b>   My Lords, before the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, sits down, does he not agree that central London, which is mainly non-residential, where there are excellent bus and Underground services, is quite different from the outer, almost totally residential boroughs that do not have such good bus and Underground services?
</p>




<p><a name="st_189"></a>
<a name="40708-21_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, the increase in the number of bus services in the outer suburbs since   the introduction of the charge has been very considerable. Certainly, there are bus routes operating to places like Kensington, Clapham and other parts of London that did not exist before. There are now buses serving parts of London that have been deprived of public transport for many years.
</p>




<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="40708-21_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, I have been lured into the discussions on this Bill in which up to now I have not taken part. I declare an interest as an elected member of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council. The prospect of an amendment dealing with proposals for the extension of the congestion charge into my borough even made me bolt down my coffee to get here in time.
</p>

<a name="40708-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>The amendment handles the principle of extending the congestion charge in London. Currently, that principle relates only to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The Mayor has already said that he has no intention of extending the congestion charge to anywhere else in London.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_978"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 978</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40708-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>As part of the consultation process, the electors of the whole of the Greater London area have been consulted on extending the congestion charge that would apply to 160,000 residents within central London, Kensington and Chelsea and the associated and nearby businesses. It seems to be a very strange consultation that would allow 13 million people to impose on 160,000 people something that the 160,000 do not want. The voices of those 160,000 people would be very muted in terms of the responses from 13 million people. To some extent, here, there is a fairness and justice in how that consultation will and does take place.
</p>

<a name="40708-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Harris, is correct. There has been a consultation. But it is a consultation against the background of the Mayor&#039;s determination to extend the congestion charge into a borough which has said that it does not want it. This is a principle of how to test the voice of those who will be affected. Of course, it is nonsense&#151;if I might say that&#151;to say that those people should not have a say about what goes on within their own streets and boundaries.
</p>

<a name="40708-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>First, the proposals for Kensington and Chelsea exclude about 30,000 residents who live in the area. The boundary is a nonsense. The Mayor knows that it is a nonsense. But because of the technology he cannot change that nonsense into anything that makes a fairness for the residents who live on the western side of the borough.
</p>

<a name="40708-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>Secondly, of course, I am sure it is correct that arrangements will be made for discounts, and so forth. But the residents have got to think and see that there is a problem: there is no existing problem on the main roads going through Kensington and Chelsea at any time, unless, for example, the Grand Prix is being run along Regent Street, which affects us all.
</p>

<a name="40708-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>There does not seem to be any fairness that something of such importance to one part of London should be judged and governed by what has been asked through the rest of London. I am bound to say that I am not sure why the residents of Redbridge, for example, who have just a touching acquaintance with the problems of the traffic in Kensington of Chelsea, should have their voice sought on this matter.
</p>

<a name="40708-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>It boils down, does it not, to how, as part of the consultation process, account is taken of what the residents want to say? Some surveys have been undertaken, most of which I consider to be spurious. But I believe that the only way to hear what the residents believe would be to test their opinion. I have to talk about Kensington and Chelsea because that, currently, is the only area of London where the proposal is to extend. Should the Mayor suddenly decide to go out to the east, I assume that those residents would also want their voice properly taken into account.
</p>

<a name="40708-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>There is independent government in London. The Greater London Authority, under the Greater London Authority Act, has powers to deal with the congestion charge and it has powers over some roads. But the independent government of London rests with the 32 London boroughs. It must be right that not only is the GLA consulted, but that the residents are also <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_979"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 979</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consulted about something that would have a very major effect on them. For those reasons I support the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_191"></a>
<a name="40708-21_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, we have had a most interesting debate on this issue. However, I must say to the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, that if he is accused of putting forward an amendment which is considered mischievous and misguided by my noble friend Lord Borrie, he had better address himself to the quality of his arguments. My noble friend, Lord Borrie rendered most of what I have to say entirely otiose by the way in which he, effectively, destroyed the case for the amendment.
</p>

<a name="40708-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>I shall reiterate the points made in the debate, which show the weakness behind the thinking. First, it has been maintained that the residents should participate because they are most affected. As has been pointed out in several speeches, they are also the people who get 90 per cent of the discount. It has also been suggested that the residents are those most concerned and most affected and that they are the people who should be consulted. That is a very odd concept with regard to traffic.

</p>

<a name="40708-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>As has been indicated, not all of London is affected by the congestion charge and the congestion zone that currently operates. If it is extended, there are implications for a much wider area than Kensington and Chelsea. There are implications for a very large number of people. Why should only the residents of the immediate area be consulted in circumstances where there are interests for a much wider group?
</p>

<a name="40708-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Harris who emphasised this point. Let me make it absolutely clear, that is why we have a Mayor and a GLA. They are charged with the responsibility of strategic consideration of traffic. How can traffic be managed only on an intensely local basis in a vast area like London? That is their responsibility.
</p>

<a name="40708-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>The Opposition set at naught the fact that their candidate who stood against the congestion charge lost and the fact that the candidate who stood in favour of the congestion charge won: they say that we should have a referendum among a relatively small group of those people who are affected. When they have that consultation, will it be on the basis of local democracy? Is the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, saying that of course it should follow normal, local, democratic consideration?
</p>

<a name="40708-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>But that is not so. It would require a 50 per cent turnout of voters, which, I venture to think, would be higher, probably, than any of the councillors in her borough enjoyed at the last election. Of that 50 per cent, it has to be a majority of those who vote. We are creating not a democratic consultation but an artificially high hurdle to win the battle against the congestion charge, which was the subject of the last mayoral election. As has been said, it was a very lively issue in that election, and it was won by the candidate in favour of the congestion charge.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_980"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 980</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40708-21_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>The amendment is mischievous and misguided. It purports to open in this House an issue that was the subject of a democratic election only a matter of weeks ago. The Bill is concerned with the broad issues of traffic management across the country. We recognise how significant traffic is in London, and that is why we want to improve congestion and traffic flow by having a strategic plan across the whole of London. I cannot believe that the House would support an amendment to put all power and all decisions on the next stage of the congestion charge into the hands of any one borough that was directly affected.
</p>

<a name="40708-21_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>I hope that the noble Viscount will think that he has had a good run for his money in an intensive debate, but the amendment should not be on the face of the Bill.

<p><a name="st_192"></a>
<a name="40708-22_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   My Lords, I have to say to the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, that I am somewhat confused by her party&#039;s position. Simon Hughes in his manifesto said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a>&quot;Decision would ultimately be decided by a vote in a local ballot of registered electors in the possible extension areas&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>Not anywhere else. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a>&quot;in the possible extension areas&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>If the noble Baroness, or anyone else had said that the 50 per cent threshold is a bit too high but we accept the principle, I would understand that argument. We could debate that, and at least we would understand the point about letting local people have some say in local democracy. It pains me that the noble Lord, Lord   Borrie, should think that my amendment is mischievous. It is far from it. He said that consultation matters, but the problem with the Mayor&#039;s consultation is that it does not work. Three-million letters were sent out and he had a 3 per cent return. Let us say that half of those were in favour and half were against. That means that 1.5 per cent of the people who responded will be taken into account when deciding major changes in London. That is not good enough.
</p>

<a name="40708-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Harris, talked about local democracy. I sympathise as he has unfortunately met local democracy head on. Perhaps it will give him an opportunity to spend more time in the House. We certainly welcome his presence here. His argument seemed to be that if the local borough did not agree, one should extend it and ask the borough next door. If it does not agree, one should go further and ask the one next door to that. Eventually if one goes far enough, one is bound to get a majority. That does not work either.
</p>




<p><a name="st_193"></a>
<a name="40708-22_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Harris of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, that is a travesty of my argument. I said that there are people who are profoundly affected by the congestion charge who would not get the benefit of the subsidy that would be given to the residents of Kensington and Chelsea in any putative extension of the zone. They are excluded by the terms of the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_194"></a>
<a name="40708-22_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord   Harris, is very much misguided if he thinks that the only reason why people are in favour or against the <br>&nbsp;<br>

congestion charge in their area is because of financial incentive. That is nonsense. There are wider and more important issues that affect local people and businesses. The noble Lord should support my amendment if we follow his logic because he is assuming that because someone in a borough receives 95 per cent discount he will automatically support the congestion charge. His argument falls flat on its face.
</p>

<a name="40708-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Faulkner and Lord Davies, seemed to think that the only issue on which the two mayoral candidates fought was the congestion charge. I admit that I did not read every manifesto as closely as perhaps I should&#151;of course, I read ours very carefully&#151;but my brief glances showed that there were other issues. To say that the result of the recent election was solely because of the congestion charge is extraordinary. There was the recent convert&#151;the returnee to the noble Lord&#039;s party. We must respect that. The election was not won solely on the basis of the congestion charge.
</p>

<a name="40708-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>I hope that your Lordships will accept the principle of my amendment. I accept that we could debate the 50 per cent. The noble Lord, Lord Harris, misreads my amendment. It does not mean that there would have to   be an instant referendum anywhere there is a congestion charge. This is about keeping local democracy with local boroughs in London. That is what is important.

   &quot;LONDON BUS LANE ENFORCEMENT

<br>
(1)   Except as provided in subsection (2) a London borough acting as a local transport authority shall be responsible for deciding and setting the times for bus lane enforcement on any road or any proposed road within its jurisdiction in order to secure the expeditious movement of traffic on the authority&#039;s road network.


<br>
(2)   A road or proposed road designated by the Secretary of State, Transport for London or the Mayor of London as a strategic road during peak rush hour periods shall be exempt from the provision of subsection (1). 


<br>
(3)   In deciding the time for peak rush hour periods for a strategic road, the Secretary of State, Transport for London or the Mayor of London must consult and take have regard to the advice of the relevant London borough or boroughs.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_196"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment seeks to bring a degree of common sense to the issue of bus lanes in London. It does not seek to remove bus lanes; it merely attempts to improve the way in which they are used and to refine their use.

</p>

<a name="40708-23_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>All too often we witness empty bus lanes and congestion in other lanes. On the flip side, we witness bus lanes that have 24 hour/seven days a week enforcement notices on them, effectively banning for ever all other traffic from those lanes. We cannot see the common sense behind this. Why ban traffic from such lanes at week-ends, when the volume of traffic is substantially lower and the number of buses in operation is dramatically lower than during rush hours?
</p>

<a name="40708-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>The approach is inflexible; the amendment seeks to give more flexibility in the use of bus lanes. The policy is too rigid to cope with modern traffic flows around the capital. We have peaks and troughs&#151;not necessarily during traditional rush hours&#151;and if we could be more flexible in the use of bus lanes we would effectively see traffic moving rather better around London.
</p>

<a name="40708-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>Under the Bill, the Mayor and Transport for London could, in effect, nationalise any road they desire in Greater London by designating it as a strategic road. This in itself is an erosion of boroughs&#039; powers. I have no doubt that the number of these 24 hour/seven days a week bus lanes will increase as the Mayor takes over more and more roads.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40708-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>The amendment therefore attempts to ensure that London boroughs have an opportunity to influence the times of bus lane enforcement on strategic roads within their area. On other non-strategic roads the boroughs would be able to decide on the times of enforcement. Surely they and local people in an area know&#151;going back to our previous debate&#151;what their traffic flows and peak times are. They must know the best way to ensure the smooth running of traffic in their boroughs.

</p>

<a name="40708-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>Therefore we are seeking to improve the relationship between all parties with a vested interested in keeping London moving. That is why the Mayor and Transport for London will have a duty under the amendment to consult on the times of bus lanes enforcement on any strategic road in the relevant London borough. That will guarantee that the knowledge and expertise that the boroughs presently have on traffic flow within their areas will not go to waste.
</p>

<a name="40708-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>This is a sensible and rational amendment that will help maximise the use of bus lanes for traffic but also assist in the smooth running of traffic around London. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_197"></a>
<a name="40708-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Snape: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a special adviser to the National Express Group. I used to be chairman of its bus division so I have a strong interest in these matters. I cannot agree with the views of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. It is logical that if London boroughs are to have different times of enforcement for bus lanes the opportunities for confusion&#151;I put it no more strongly than that&#151;are fairly high.

</p>

<a name="40708-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>I am always fascinated when I listen to debates about bus lanes, because the intention behind the amendment&#151;whether or not inadvertent&#151;is to defend the motorist. We live in a world where, even though we are all motorists, there is a strong lobby that says that the motorist is being hounded and pursued and should be&#151;if I may paraphrase the noble Lord&#151;allowed to drive in bus lanes at certain times of the day or week.
</p>

<a name="40708-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>However, the reason why London&#039;s bus lanes are so successful is that people are aware that there is proper enforcement in London and because by and large in central London the bus lanes operate 24 hours, seven days a week. If one shares the view expressed by the noble Lord, there would be different times of enforcement in different boroughs, which would lead to obvious confusion. There would be a temptation for motorists to say, &quot;It was five to seven,&quot;&#151;or whatever time&#151;&quot;there was nothing around and so I thought I would use the bus lane&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40708-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>I am sure that I speak for other noble Lords in saying that there is nothing quite so annoying as sitting in a lane of traffic watching someone driving improperly up the adjacent bus lane. Whether it is white van man or black Jaguar man&#151;it is usually a male of the species who behaves in such a way&#151;it annoys those of us who believe that bus lanes have been enormously successful, particularly in this city.

</p>

<a name="40708-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>Comparatively recently I have taken to using buses again in London, largely because of their efficiency. I took the bus this morning from Paddington to Euston at seven o&#039;clock. It was quicker than the Underground, largely because of the bus lanes on Marylebone Road. They are seven days a week bus lanes. Those who criticise their provision say that much of the time they are empty. Of course the same people would criticise them if they were choked with buses. The reason they are empty is because they are successful and the reason they are successful is because they are reserved 24 hours a day in this city and motorists know that they should avoid them.
</p>

<a name="40708-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>I hope that for those reasons, if the amendment is pressed to a Division, your Lordships will oppose it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_198"></a>
<a name="40708-23_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   My Lords, we have a busy city. One of the Bill&#039;s main points, especially for London traffic, is to have the most efficient road network. If bus lanes are not being used during the day, surely it is only correct that we make the most efficient use of them.
</p>

<a name="40708-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>I understood the noble Lord, Lord Snape, to say that it would be confusing for motorists if we could use bus lanes outside the rush hour when they are not being used. I do not believe that that is the case, because if one drives beside a bus lane one sees blue and white signs stating clearly when it is active. It does not take much to understand whether it can or cannot be used outside those times, so this would not be difficult.
</p>




<p><a name="st_199"></a>
<a name="40708-23_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   My Lords, I support the principle of my noble friend&#039;s amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Snape, did not give the whole picture about bus lanes in London. He said that on some of the busiest routes they operate for 24 hours. That is not the case; for example, on the road from Victoria station to Hyde Park Corner, which I would have thought was a major London route, the bus lanes operate from seven to 10 in the morning and four to seven in the evening.
</p>

<a name="40708-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>I accept that some bus lanes operate for 24 hours but I have always failed to understand why some of them do not have similar hours. Central government should not be over-prescriptive. We should allow sensible local decisions to be made. There are signs that say what the restrictions are, which are easy to see.
</p>

<a name="40708-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>There are bus lanes in Oxford Street permanently clogged with buses. One could probably walk along Oxford Street from bus to bus. There are certain times of day when they do not seem to work at all, which is another problem. There are also contraflow bus lanes. I accept that it would be almost impossible for cars to use those, but some thought should be given to instances where we should be more flexible. I hope that the Minister will be able to give a positive response to my noble friend&#039;s proposals.
</p>




<p><a name="st_200"></a>
<a name="40708-23_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, I am certainly able to give some elements of a positive response to the noble Viscount because I agree that we need flexibility <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_986"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 986</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in the hours of enforcement of bus lanes, which the legislation covering the operational hours of bus lanes is designed to provide. The relevant authority, whether it is a borough or TfL, can decide what times are most appropriate in each situation. They can take into account all the relevant local factors such as the need to service properties alongside bus lanes and many other factors in reaching such decisions.

</p>

<a name="40708-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>I approach the issue of bus lanes with a slight degree of caution. In my former life I had the dubious privilege of introducing the Greater London Authority Act 1999, which brought bus lanes to London. I would glory in that, but at the time we were not sure how to deal with taxis&#039; use of bus lanes and whether they could stop in them. I was persuaded that we had the legislation a mite   wrong only when 300 black cabs invaded my constituency, parked outside my constituency surgery on a Saturday and created the greatest congestion one could imagine in the London Borough of Enfield at that time.
</p>

<a name="40708-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>I am a little cautious about discussing bus lane legislation, but I am confident on this matter. The noble Lord&#039;s proposed new clause does not hit the target that he seeks. It refers to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a>&quot;deciding and setting the times for bus lane enforcement&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>Enforcement is the key word. It means the pursuance of contraventions of the bus lane during its operation hours by the London borough on whose roads it has been installed. Where the borough rather than the police carries out the enforcement, that is done under the London Local Authorities Act 1996.
</p>

<a name="40708-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>The times at which enforcement is carried out are in the hands of the borough concerned. Of course roads may become strategic roads after being designated under the powers in Part 5. The provisions amend the existing powers in the Highways Act 1980 and Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. Similar powers are already provided in the case of GLA roads. That means that Transport for London is, in certain circumstances, able to object to the exercise of any power under those Acts by the borough in any way where it would affect, or would be likely to affect, a strategic road.

</p>

<a name="40708-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>The powers in Part 5 do not extend to other legislation, so Transport for London cannot decide on the enforcement on borough roads, which is what the clause relates to. Therefore the clause as drafted does not have the desired effect, if the reference to enforcement was intentional. That said, we would certainly expect there to be close co-operation between Transport for London and the boroughs on enforcement of bus lanes on strategic roads as many of those roads could be significant bus routes, important both locally and strategically. Of course, the network management duty would also play a key part here given the need for authorities to work together to consider the network as a whole.
</p>

<a name="40708-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, was perhaps really trying to address the decisions about the hours of operation of bus lanes, rather than their enforcement. When bus lanes are installed, the works involved could be covered by the relevant powers in Part 5 in relation to strategic roads&#151;that is, the exercise of powers to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_987"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 987</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

determine the times at which bus lanes operate flow from the powers in the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. Therefore, Transport for London could have a say in what happens on a bus lane when it affects, or is likely to affect, a strategic road, when it is put in or if the times of operation were changed.
</p>

<a name="40708-23_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>In practice, statutory procedures for making traffic regulations orders for bus lanes require consultation between authorities; and the network management duty in Part 2 of the Bill requires co-operation between authorities to keep traffic moving, buses included. Again, we therefore expect to see boroughs and Transport for London working together in ways that both give the priority to buses that is essential to keep the services reliable and attractive and reflect local issues about use of roads.
</p>

<a name="40708-23_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will appreciate that we have constructed the Bill to guarantee that there is necessary consultation and co-operation between the relevant authorities on this crucial issue&#151;and I do not for one moment deny the significance of the issue. However, I must insist to him that the way in which the amendment is drafted does not hit the target he intends to hit. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.

Roads cost a lot of money to build and we want to maximise their use.

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 989</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>




<p><a name="st_209"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the conclusion of a stabilisation and association agreement&#151;or an SAA, as such agreements are also known&#151;represents an important milestone on Croatia&#039;s path towards the European Union. SAAs constitute a formal contractual agreement between the countries of the western Balkans and the European Union, covering <i>inter alia </i>trade, regional co-operation, political dialogue, economic and institutional reform and co-operation in the field of justice and home affairs. In order to conclude an SAA, countries must meet clear political, economic and technical criteria.
</p>

<a name="40708-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>An SAA also confirms that the country in question is a potential candidate for European Union membership. Such agreements are a key element of the EU&#039;s overall policy framework towards the Western Balkans&#151;the stabilisation and association process, intended to help the region move closer to Europe by promoting political dialogue and increased co-operation both with the EU and within the region. The British Government fully support this policy, and the European Union aspirations of the western Balkans countries.
</p>

<a name="40708-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>In Croatia&#039;s case, confirmation through an SAA that she is a potential candidate for EU membership has been somewhat overtaken by events. At last month&#039;s European Council, EU heads of state and government agreed to declare Croatia a candidate for EU membership, with a view to opening accession negotiations in early 2005. That is a significant achievement, which the British Government warmly welcome.
</p>

<a name="40708-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>However, ratification of Croatia&#039;s SAA by the UK Parliament is still a very important step. The SAA will provide the contractual basis for EU-Croatia relations as Croatia moves towards accession. Noble Lords will also recall that a draft order ratifying Croatia&#039;s SAA was laid before Parliament in October 2002, but was subsequently withdrawn due to concern about Croatia&#039;s lack of co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia&#151;the ICTY. Full co-operation with the ICTY is a prerequisite for the further integration of the western Balkans countries into the EU.

</p>

<a name="40708-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>I am pleased to tell the House that there has in recent months been a step change in Croatia&#039;s co-operation with the Hague Tribunal. The ICTY chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponti, has confirmed that she is now satisfied with the level of co-operation being offered by the Croatian Government. In recognition of this the British Government took the decision to restart the parliamentary process leading to ratification of Croatia&#039;s SAA, and I am able to commend this order to the House.

</p>

<a name="40708-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>This improvement in co-operation with the ICTY was also the key factor in the decision by heads of state and government to declare Croatia an official candidate for EU membership. Of course, Croatia&#039;s obligation to co- operate fully with the ICTY remains. In particular, Carla del Ponti and the EU have made it clear that Croatia must take all necessary steps to locate and detain fugitive ICTY indictee Ante Gotovina. This obligation is also set out in a number of United Nations Security Council <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_990"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 990</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

resolutions. The Croatian Government have acknowledged that this obligation remains. Until the Gotovina issue has been resolved, Croatia cannot truly draw a line under her painful past.
</p>

<a name="40708-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>Lack of co-operation with the ICTY remains a fundamental obstacle to lasting stability, reconciliation and prosperity in the region, so we encourage other governments in the region, in particular Serbia, Montenegro and the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina to take all necessary steps to return outstanding ICTY indictees to the Hague. We hope that Croatia&#039;s achievements send a clear signal that difficult decisions really do pay off.
</p>

<a name="40708-24_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>More generally, Croatia&#039;s experience sends an important signal to the region about the EU&#039;s policy of conditionality. If a country meets the political, economic and technical criteria for further integration into the EU, the EU will indeed honour its part of the bargain. Those criteria are the same for every western Balkans country. There are no short cuts. Croatia&#039;s experience shows that this policy of conditionality works. The prospect of EU integration is a powerful stimulus for reform.
</p>

<a name="40708-24_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>In spite of Croatia&#039;s impressive achievements during the past 12 months, we should not underestimate what more remains to be done before Croatia&#039;s EU accession becomes a reality. I have already referred to the need to resolve the case of fugitive indictee Gotovina, but more also needs to be done to ensure the reality of life for returning refugees and for ethnic minorities, and that those match the legislative theory. Croatia&#039;s judiciary is also in need of further reform. The EU will continue to support Croatia in addressing these outstanding issues, but resolving them will ultimately depend on the continued political will of the Croatian Government.
</p>

<a name="40708-24_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>Croatia&#039;s progress towards the EU represents a success story for the western Balkans and for the European Union. It demonstrates that the European Union is right to continue to invest politically and financially in the stability of the region. The fact that I am able to come to the House today and commend this order to the House is a testament to the power of EU integration and the possibility of really encouraging reform. In ratifying Croatia&#039;s SAA, the United Kingdom will send an important signal about our support for reform throughout the region. My Lords, I commend the order and I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_210"></a>
<a name="40708-25_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Astor of Hever: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for explaining the draft order so clearly. As the Minister said, this is an important milestone for Croatia and we very much welcome it. The Minister mentioned General Ante Gotovina, the main Croatian suspect wanted by the ICTY, who is yet to be apprehended. Many observers are less sure of Croatian good faith on this issue. Arresting Gotovina was the condition for Croatia&#039;s EU accession talks to start. We are concerned at the message that is being sent out to other fugitives in the Balkans.

</p>

<a name="40708-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>I would like to ask the Minister three questions. First, what progress has been made in finding possible solutions to the settlement of the border issue between Slovenia and Croatia? Secondly, what progress has Croatia made in the preparation of an agreement between Croatia and Serbia on the protection of Serb minorities? Thirdly, what is the number of Croatian Serbs expelled from the Krajina area in 1995 who have since returned to their pre-war homes?
</p>




<p><a name="st_211"></a>
<a name="40708-25_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Russell-Johnston: </b>   My Lords, on behalf of the Liberal Democrats I welcome this order, which is a practical demonstration of the European Union&#039;s commitment to the eventual accession of all the countries of the former Yugoslavia and those of the   southern Balkans. I would be more modest than the noble Lord, Lord Astor&#151;I would like to ask only two questions. He has already asked some to which I would be very interested in hearing the answer&#151;particularly those about the position of the Serbs in Krajina, and the residual number of Serbs in Croatia.
</p>

<a name="40708-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>Much interest has been expressed in General Gotovina. As the Minister said, Carla del Ponti, who after all is not given to scattering compliments about loosely, has been very complimentary about Croatia&#039;s co-operation. Nevertheless he is still at large and one wonders where the protection is coming from. Noble   Lords will have observed that the UN High Representative in Bosnia, the week before last, removed 60 people in Republika Srpska from their positions on the grounds that they were actively involved in the concealment of at least Karadzic&#151;we are not so sure about Mladic. Does the Minister have any more information on that?
</p>

<a name="40708-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>I ask my second question despite the fact that it may well reveal that I am calamitously ignorant of procedure&#151;I must confess that I have never been terribly interested in it. I observe that the original stabilisation and association agreement was signed on 29 October 2001, which was some time ago. I gathered from the Minister that the reason that the United Kingdom has not ratified up until now&#151;during two and a half years&#151;was mainly because of the issue of co-operation with the Hague Tribunal. Is that correct, and have any other members of the European Union ratified already?
</p>

<a name="40708-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>Altogether, we very much welcome this order and are pleased, as the Minister announced, that Croatia is on its way towards the European Union.
</p>




<p><a name="st_212"></a>
<a name="40708-25_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Dundee: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest as chairman of the all-party parliamentary group for Croatia. As the Minister has implied, the passing of this draft order is a happy and important event. It supports the resolve of the European Council to begin with Croatia next year negotiations for European Union membership. Many of us will agree that this timing is sensible, and in so far as the United Kingdom has assisted in it, credit should thus be given both to the Minister and to the Government for the balanced approach which they have adopted towards relevant matters affecting Croatia.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_992"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 992</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40708-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>I would like to raise two issues: first, in the interests of efficiency, the usefulness of fixing a date in 2005; secondly, the effect of Croatia&#039;s example on other states in the former Yugoslavia. Once 2005 has been confirmed in general for the beginning of negotiations, which it now has, it becomes desirable to set an approximate date in that year. This will encourage an efficient response within Croatia, where further reforms have to be addressed, and also within the European Union, which monitors that process. Therefore reference to, and deployment of, a date within 2005 will enable the process to become more sharply focused at the outset for both the applicants and for the monitors. Does the Minister agree? Can the Government recommend to the European Council that an approximate date be soon indicated accordingly?

</p>

<a name="40708-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>Secondly, there is the effect of Croatia&#039;s EU entry on other states within the former Yugoslavia. Clearly, the better expedited the stages of Croatia&#039;s EU negotiations and entry are, and are seen to be, the more other states within the former Yugoslavia stand to benefit. Your Lordships will share that view. I know that the noble Baroness does. I thank her for her support and for introducing this draft order today.
</p>




<p><a name="st_213"></a>
<a name="40708-25_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Grenfell: </b>   My Lords, I rise to intervene not as the chairman of the European Union Select Committee but as the secretary of the All-Party Group on Croatia, a country for which I have considerable affection. I am very pleased indeed that the Minister is commending this order to the House. From my own knowledge of the new administration, my impression is that they are doing everything they can to take care of some of the priority issues that have already been mentioned, not least on co-operation with the ICTY, judicial reform, the return of refugees, minority rights and regional co-operation, to which the noble Earl, Lord Dundee, has already referred.
</p>

<a name="40708-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>Can the Minister confirm my understanding that at the end of last year the new government concluded an agreement with the Croatian Serb representatives in the Croatian Parliament that will make it far easier for Serbs who fled during the war to return to their homes and that some 250 million euros have been devoted to this? If this is a sign of the level of determination of the new authorities in Croatia to solve the remaining problems, then I think that they are probably on the right track.
</p>

<a name="40708-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>I endorse what the noble Earl, Lord Dundee, and the Minister said about the impact that Croatia&#039;s progress towards membership of the European Union will have on the region as a whole. The stability of the region depends on the eventual integration of its countries into the European Union. The steps that Croatia is taking to put itself on the road to membership bode well for the future stability of the region as a whole.
</p>




<p><a name="st_214"></a>
<a name="40708-25_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </b>   My Lords, I thank your Lordships for the warm welcome that this order has received. A number of specific points were raised but I am pleased to note that the Government&#039;s priority is embraced by your Lordships. That priority is to encourage all the countries of the western Balkans to implement the reforms necessary to make full integration into Euro-Atlantic structures a reality.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_993"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 993</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40708-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Dundee, said, Croatia is at the head of the pack and deserves praise for its achievements. Of course, it will be that balance of praise and frank advice to Croatia over the coming period that will be so very important. I agree very strongly with the point that he made about it providing encouragement to other countries that have aspirations to join the European Union. Where real effort is made to meet the criteria, the hand of friendship is extended even further and encouragement given to go through the important accession process.
</p>

<a name="40708-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Russell-Johnston and Lord   Astor, wanted to know more about the efforts to secure the indictee, Ante Gotovina. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Russell-Johnston, that the requirement is not to apprehend an indictee; it is to demonstrate full co-operation in efforts to do so. That is the point. The indictees do not have to be under lock and key but a country has to demonstrate that it is making every effort to do that. The ICTY chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte&#151;who is no slouch when it comes to these matters&#151;has said that she is satisfied that Croatia is co-operating fully with the tribunal and is doing all it can to apprehend Gotovina. The ICTY and the European Council have made it clear that the Croatian Government have to maintain that full co-operation. They cannot let up on their efforts to secure Gotovina and to take all necessary steps to ensure that he is arrested and transferred to The Hague.
</p>

<a name="40708-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>I think that the Croatian Government recognise that that is essential&#151;there is no sign that they are going to let up&#151;and that it is essential irrespective of the requirements of the European Union for accession. The early detention of Gotovina would send a very powerful signal about Croatia&#039;s continued commitment to EU values.

</p>

<a name="40708-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>The questions about Republika Srpska were, I hope, covered in my initial remarks. It is true that the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina has not demonstrated anything like that degree of co-operation with the ICTY. Carla del Ponte has not been able to say those things about it. That is why there is the difference. One country may be trying and not quite succeeding but others are not trying to anything like the same degree.
</p>

<a name="40708-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>The noble Lord also asked about ratification. I understand that all the European Union countries have ratified. The most recent was Italy, only two days ago. I hope that what we are doing now in your Lordships&#039; House will be part of the completion of the process.

</p>

<a name="40708-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, asked me three questions. The first was about the progress in resolving the difficult border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia. In the absence of an agreed demarcation of the border between them, a temporary agreement is in place providing, among other things, access for fishermen. The United Kingdom continues to encourage Croatia and Slovenia to resolve this dispute through bilateral channels.
</p>

<a name="40708-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>The noble Lord was also concerned about the progress being made in reaching a bilateral agreement between Serbia and Montenegro and Croatia on the protection of the Serb minorities in Croatia. There is no <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_994"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 994</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

bilateral agreement between the authorities in Serbia and Montenegro and in Croatia on the protection of Serb minorities in Croatia. However, the constitutional law on national minorities provides a comprehensive framework for the protection of minorities in Croatia, including Croatian Serbs. We have consistently encouraged the Croatian authorities to ensure full and proper implementation of the constitutional law.

</p>

<a name="40708-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>The noble Lord was also concerned about how many Croatian Serbs were expelled from the Krajina area during the conflict in the early 1990s, and about how many had been able to return to their pre-war homes. According to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe&#151;the OSCE&#151;approximately 320,000 Croatian Serbs left Croatia during the conflict. Of those, an estimated 110,000 have returned to their pre-war homes. Of the approximately 208,000 remaining outside the country, 189,000 are in Serbia and Montenegro, with 19,000 in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I hope that that gives him some reassurance on those points.
</p>

<a name="40708-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, for his support on the issues. He assured us that he was speaking as a particular friend of Croatia and not in his capacity as chair of his committee, which I was delighted to see was recognised yesterday evening in the parliamentary awards, as it justifiably should have been. I hope that I have been able to cover the points that he raised.
</p>

<a name="40708-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>The noble Earl was very anxious about the date. The European Union has said that bilateral discussions will start early in 2005. I cannot give him a precise date at the moment but, as we go through the next few weeks and months, I am sure that it will become much clearer. I shall convey to my honourable friend the Minister for Europe, Denis MacShane, his point about a date being important because it focuses attention and encourages people to proceed with all dispatch on the important negotiations.

</p>

<a name="40708-25_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>I thank noble Lords for the warm support that the measures have received. It has been very important that the United Kingdom Government have been able to add our voices on the important issues around the Croatian-Serb refugees. The noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, was particularly concerned on those points. We have assisted the Croatian Government in providing housing for the Serb returnees, as I am sure that noble Lords know. Between 2001 and 2003, we donated more than &#163;500,000 to the Catholic Relief Service, which has resulted in the renovation of more than 200 homes, to house more than 700 Serb returnees. We are not merely encouraging in the way in which I described to the noble Lord, Lord Astor, but putting our money where our mouth is and giving some very practical help.
</p>

<a name="40708-25_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>By making progress towards the EU condition on clear political, economic and technical criteria, we have been able to make real progress with our friends in Croatia. This is a success story, and one that I hope will encourage other western Balkan countries. I commend the order to the House.
</p>

<a name="40708-25_para20"></a>

<a name="time_18"></a>
<a name="40708-26_time0"></a><h5></h5>


<p><a name="st_215"></a>
<a name="40708-26_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester </b>   rose to ask Her Majesty&#039;s Government what steps they are taking to improve relations with Taiwan.
</p>




<p><a name="st_216"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I declare an interest as a vice-chairman of the All-Party Group on Taiwan, in which capacity I have twice visited Taiwan, most recently for the inauguration ceremony following the re-election of President Chen Shui-bian on 20 May.

</p>

<a name="40708-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>I start by acknowledging that there is little prospect, at present at least, of Her Majesty&#039;s Government breaking away from the collective decision taken in 1971 by the international community to grant recognition to the People&#039;s Republic of China at the expense of Taiwan. However, we do not need to debate the &quot;One China&quot; policy in discussing how we can improve relations with Taiwan.
</p>

<a name="40708-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>Let us be clear how important to United Kingdom interests Taiwan is. Taiwan is the UK&#039;s 20th-largest export market worldwide. Our exports were worth &#163;940 million in 2003, an increase of 6 per cent on 2002. Between January and April this year, our exports to Taiwan increased by 20.4 per cent from the same period in 2003. It is a hugely important target market for British trade internationally. Some 70 per cent of all Taiwanese manufacturing investments in Europe are in the UK, with 175 firms from Taiwan having a presence here. Between them, they maintain more than 10,000 jobs. There are now 14,000 Taiwanese students pursuing their studies in the United Kingdom, which is almost 30 per cent of the total Taiwanese overseas student market. They make a great difference to the financial viability of many educational courses, particularly in our newer universities.
</p>

<a name="40708-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>There is, I am pleased to say, strong British government support for all those links. When I was in Taipei, I heard nothing but praise for the efforts of our permanent mission&#151;the British Trade and Cultural Office there. Taiwan&#039;s annual GDP growth rate in the past 30 years has averaged 8 per cent. One example of its manufacturing success is that it makes 70 per cent the world&#039;s personal notebook computers, turning out 32 million of them this year.
</p>

<a name="40708-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>So if one is looking for tests of statehood, there is no doubt that Taiwan passes every economic test. However, another attribute of a sovereign state is a free and open democratic system of government. Taiwan does not do badly in that regard. The turnout in the recent presidential election was 80.28 per cent. Would that we could achieve a figure even approaching that in any sort of election here.
</p>

<a name="40708-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>How different from what is happening not too far away in Hong Kong, where the &quot;one-country, two-systems&quot; agreement for its transition from British to Chinese rule is being systematically torn up by the PRC and hundreds of thousands are taking to the streets to defend freedoms which are being eroded by the government in Beijing. A diplomatic masterstroke on the part of the Beijing Government is the decision to locate 500 missiles on the south-eastern coast of the Chinese mainland, all pointing directly at targets on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_996"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 996</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Taiwan. That is twice as many as there were just three years ago. That military threat would be a sufficient reason alone why Her Majesty&#039;s Government must not falter in the face of pressure from France and Germany and possibly other EU countries to lift the European Union embargo on the sale of arms to mainland China.

</p>

<a name="40708-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>How else can we do more to improve relations with Taiwan? We should, for example, review the way in which we treat Taiwanese visitors to the United Kingdom, particularly high-ranking Taiwanese officials from the President downwards, who have not been granted admission to the United Kingdom even on purely private or transit visits. We should also review how we treat official representatives of the Taiwan Government working in London compared with how our officials in Taipei and Taiwanese officials in other EU capital cities are treated. I know that a number elsewhere are accorded a much better diplomatic status than their counterparts are here.
</p>

<a name="40708-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>I turn to Taiwan&#039;s membership of international organisations. Its admittance to the World Trade Organisation in 2001 was a welcome and important step forward, and I congratulate the Government on supporting that. That makes it all the more disappointing that they did not support Taiwan&#039;s application for observer status at the World Health Assembly at the annual World Health Organisation meeting in Geneva in May this year.
</p>

<a name="40708-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>There are two compelling reasons why Taiwan should be admitted. The first is that Taiwan has made remarkable progress in improving standards of public health, to the point where it has one of the highest levels of life expectancy in Asia. It has shared these advances with many developing nations and has given generous help to countries suffering earthquakes and other natural disasters.
</p>

<a name="40708-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>The second reason is that Taiwan&#039;s exclusion from the WHO has meant that Taiwan has been denied help when it was really needed, such as when the SARS epidemic came across the Taiwan Strait and infected so many of its people last year. It reported the first SARS cases immediately, in March 2003, and begged the WHO for help. It took until 3 May before the WHO experts became involved, by which time more than 100   cases had been diagnosed and eight people had died.
</p>

<a name="40708-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>The response of the People&#039;s Republic of China was that it takes care of the lives of the 23 million Taiwanese people. That would be a joke if it did not have such deadly consequences. The WHO already has observers which are entities rather than states, such as the PLO and the Holy See, and even Liechtenstein has observer status. So why cannot our Government follow the lead set by the United States and Japan which backed Taiwan&#039;s observer status in the WHO in the World Health Assembly in May this year?
</p>

<a name="40708-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>Rather more encouraging was the Explanation of Vote by the EU in the WHA on 17 May, which stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a>&quot;We hope that the Secretariat, and others organising technical meetings and working groups under the WHO auspices, will show flexibility in finding mechanisms to allow Taiwanese medical and public health officials to participate in these activities&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_997"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 997</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40708-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>By contrast, the support given by the WHO director-general, Dr Jong-wook Lee, for the PRC&#039;s proposal that Taiwan join the Chinese delegation, was really very unhelpful and inappropriate.
</p>

<a name="40708-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>There are, I am afraid, many other examples of how the PRC and its agents attempt to block the legitimate involvement of Taiwan in important international forums. Only this Sunday, four days ago, I received a letter from Professor Barry Rider, the retiring director of the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies. For the past 21 years, Professor Rider has run a symposium on economic crime at Jesus College Cambridge, attended by 800 participants from around the world.

</p>

<a name="40708-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>One of the most important of those has been the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau in Taiwan&#151;it is their FBI&#151;which shares its knowledge of organised crime to the benefit of everyone who attends. This has covered economic crime, money laundering and murder investigations. It has also continued to welcome the involvement of the PRC in the symposia. In his letter to me, Professor Rider says,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74"></a>&quot;The Chinese Embassy has been very concerned about the symposium according any kind of recognition to Taiwan. Several years ago there was a great flurry of activity when the programme referred to the RoC and several senior officials from the Embassy demanded to meet with me in Cambridge and more or less threatened me. They indicated that pressure would be applied to ensure that the symposium did not remain in Cambridge and I would lose my job&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>Professor Rider goes on to describe how the PRC&#039;s attitude has worsened over the past three years, and that a large delegation of Chinese officials who had intended to participate in the symposium last year has been stopped, apparently at the behest of the PRC embassy in London.
</p>

<a name="40708-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>What this alarming story demonstrates, as does the PRC&#039;s resistance to Taiwan&#039;s participation in the WHO, is that political point scoring at Taiwan&#039;s expense seems to matter more to mainland China than the greater public good that comes from involving Taiwan and its experts in international organisations.

</p>

<a name="40708-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>Finally, I say to my noble friend that I hope the Government will take an understanding and sympathetic approach to the democratic reforms likely to be undertaken by President Chen&#039;s new administration in Taiwan. He has repeatedly made it clear&#151;most recently in an interview with the <i>Washington Post</i> on 29 March this year&#151;that he has no intention of changing the status quo as far as cross-strait relations are concerned. His aim in this regard is to achieve a permanent, peaceful settlement. He is, however, intending to conduct major constitutional reforms in the next fours years of his second term, which aim to make Taiwan&#039;s democracy more competitive in a globalised economy, and take the government closer to the people.
</p>

<a name="40708-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>It would be neither right nor appropriate for us in the West to get involved in this debate, which should involve the people of Taiwan and no one else. There is nothing in this approach which is even faintly threatening or challenging to mainland China. If the concept of an ethical foreign policy has any meaning at all, it requires <br>&nbsp;<br>

democracies such as ours to stand up for the rights of other democracies which are threatened and intimidated by their neighbours.

<a name="40708-27_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Russell-Johnston: </b>   My Lords, I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, for introducing and thereby enabling this short debate.
</p>

<a name="40708-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>As the noble Lord said, we were in Taipei together on 20 March. We observed the election earlier, and it was very close: a majority of 30,000 in 13 million votes cast. So there was a bit of rumbling going on, which you might expect. It would happen in this country if there were a very close election, and in the same way that we had recounts, they had recounts. The interesting thing for me was, although I have observed a lot of elections in the former area of Soviet influence, there were always suggestions, in advance, that the election would be rigged. In Taiwan, there was no such suggestion by anybody.

</p>

<a name="40708-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>I begin by relating a personal experience from some two and a half years ago which made me think intensely about Taiwan and our reaction in the democratic world&#151;which the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, has been talking about&#151;to its position. Every year, Liberal International&#151;which is the worldwide organisation of Liberal parties, just as Socialist International is for the socialist equivalent&#151;awards a prize for freedom. This is not at all confined to Liberals, and previous recipients have included, for example, Aung San Suu Kyi, who was mentioned in the House this week, and Mary Robinson and Vaclav Havel. In 2001, we awarded the prize to President Chen of Taiwan.

<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>So it came about that, on 14 November 2001, I found myself presenting this prize to his wife, Wu Shu Chen, who is confined to a wheelchair. At that time, I was president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, but I presented the award in my personal capacity as a Liberal. Pat Cox, who had already been nominated to become the next President of the European Parliament, was also present but as a leader of the Liberal group there.
</p>

<a name="40708-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>I hope that noble Lords will forgive my slight indulgence in quoting part of the speech that I made on that occasion. I said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75"></a>&quot;Each of those who have received our Liberal Prize for Freedom has made a very particular contribution to the advance of liberty and tolerance on our planet but the situation of Taiwan, the role of President Chen and the decision to make the award itself, make the ceremony, in which we are participating, unique.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76"></a>&quot;We are living through the aftermath of the brutal and cruel terrorist attacks on the United States&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>Noble Lords should remember that the speech was made on 14 November, 2001&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a>&quot;and everywhere there are calls to defend freedom and stand up for democracy. Yet President Chen, despite his long and courageous and ultimately triumphant battle for democracy in Taiwan&#151;which cannot be disputed!&#151;is prevented from coming here, to accept his award in person, by a decision of the European Union which I can only describe as cowardly and hypocritical. Their decision is to deny visas to the five most senior representatives of Taiwan&#151;President, Vice President, Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Defence Minister&#151;even for private visits. It is a decision which makes me ashamed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40708-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>Incidentally, that decision is not clearly available in writing anywhere. It was an informal decision taken behind closed doors with no microphones.

</p>

<a name="40708-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>In case it is thought that in saying this I am selectively attacking socialist or Conservative administrations, let me make it clear that that is not so. I am attacking the consensus of <i>realpolitik </i>against any perceptible democratic principle which seems to span the whole democratic political spectrum when dealing with Taiwan.
</p>

<a name="40708-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>Obviously, when deciding where the award would be presented, we considered those European governments where there were Liberals in coalition. We went off to see the Danes, our first choice. They said, &quot;It is very difficult, as we have a lot of trade with the People&#039;s Republic of China and there is this agreement of the European Union&quot;. So we went to the Netherlands and then to Belgium, from both of whom we got the same story. No European country would give a visa. Finally, we reached the Strasbourg compromise, with France giving Madame Chen a visa on the informal understanding that her visit would be &quot;low profile&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40708-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>The position of France, for which the Minister is not responsible, makes me particularly sad when I consider its contribution to democracy, which I greatly admire. It made me sick when, just before the recent election and referendum, President Chirac, in the presence of the Prime Minister of the People&#039;s Republic of China, said that the proposed referendum was &quot;a provocation&quot;. A referendum is a provocation? A consultation of the people is a provocation? There are certainly no referendums in the People&#039;s Republic of China.

</p>

<a name="40708-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, I welcome the support given by Her Majesty&#039;s Government to Taiwanese membership of the WTO. Like him, I do not understand why that is acceptable when membership of the WHO is not acceptable. The noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, set out the argument clearly, so I do not need to repeat it. I agree that it is a good thing that the United Kingdom resisted lifting the European Union ban on weapons sales that was introduced after the Tiananmen Square massacre, for which there has never really been an apology. Last November or December, in a remarkable vote in the European Parliament, there was cross-party opposition to lifting the ban.
</p>

<a name="40708-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>More fundamentally, it is offensive that democratic countries prefer to trade with a country that is guilty of huge human rights abuses, is not democratic and threatens Taiwan with missiles, than with 23 million people who have chosen a democratic path, often with great difficulty. That is especially true in light of my clear understanding that there has been no international resolution of Taiwan&#039;s status. China&#039;s historical claims to sovereignty therefore have far from legal acceptance, even before we begin to look at what is right in today&#039;s circumstances.
</p>

<a name="40708-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>I end with another quotation. I am glad to tell noble Lords that it is not my own, but one from Federica Sabbati, the Italian secretary-general of Liberal International. She put it so very clearly and I can do no better. In an article about the problems surrounding the prize about which I spoke, she wrote:
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1000"></a>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_78"></a>&quot;In all this, then, the question seems to be what value do we give to promoting freedom? How important is it for the democratic countries like the ones composing the European Union to promote the universality of those principles enshrined in their constitutions? On paper, it seems paramount.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_79"></a>&quot;However, there seem to be exceptions . . .  in particular when it is more convenient to us or when asserting our principles may seem to have embarrassing consequences. But what is a principle if we have no courage to fight for it? Why bother with principles in the first place&quot;?</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="st_218"></a>
<a name="40708-27_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Astor of Hever: </b>   My Lords, I also pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, for introducing this debate. The recent elections in Taiwan, at which both he and the noble Lord, Lord Russell-Johnston, were clearly observers, and Taiwan&#039;s growing stature on the global economic stage, make this a timely question and one which has brought forth excellent points from both noble Lords.
</p>

<a name="40708-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>I echo all sides of the House when I say that we on the Opposition Benches welcome the continuing growth of democracy in Taiwan. Although the March elections were sadly overshadowed by controversy over disputed votes and allegations of a rigged gun attack on President Chen Shui-bian, it is heartening to see Taiwan&#039;s success in encouraging democratic rule and participation.
</p>

<a name="40708-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>Having said that, I regret that the recent election results appear to be inconclusive and have therefore resulted in an atmosphere of uncertainty and confusion within the   government of Taiwan.      Coupled with that, the Government&#039;s inability to reach a definite resolution on <i>rapprochement</i> with Beijing has caused further disarray and done little to calm the situation.
</p>

<a name="40708-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>The potential conflict between China and Taiwan has been a serious threat to the stability of the Asia-Pacific region for some years. Although interaction between the two sides has increased, particularly in the aftermath of their accessions to the World Trade Organisation, the situation there remains volatile.

</p>

<a name="40708-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>Obviously, we echo the view of the Government in acknowledging that Taiwan is a province of China and that the future of Taiwan should be decided by people on both sides of the straits. However, a process of reconciliation between Taiwan and China should be carried out and we would encourage both governments to promote this. Even the most basic efforts could be built on, such as establishing direct flights between Taipei and mainland China. Would the Minister comment on that and whether this might in turn lead to more open communication and improved economic links?
</p>

<a name="40708-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>We would be extremely alarmed if either side was driven to military action and we hope that the situation will eventually be decided peacefully and calmly. Therefore, we would encourage Taiwan&#039;s leaders to approach their relations with China in such a way as to promote useful open dialogue and to avoid confusion and misinterpretation. In the past, the Chinese Government have been offended by speeches made by President Chen, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1001"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 1001</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which has undermined attempts at reconciliation. For example, the Chinese spokesman for Taiwan affairs, Zhang Mingqing, described President Chen&#039;s inaugural speech of 20 March 2004, as showing, he said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80"></a>&quot;no sincerity to improve relations&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>As far as concerns developing British relations with Taiwan, we would encourage the Government to do so, while also exercising caution. We believe that developing a strong commercial relationship with Taiwan is highly favourable for the UK. Taiwan&#039;s reputation as a significant member of the global economic community is long established and building close links with Taiwanese businesses can only be advantageous to the British market. The noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, pointed out that Taiwan is our 20th largest export market. Unofficial links with Taiwan through educational and cultural programmes have been developing in this country for some time and have obvious benefits for both sides. In that context, will the Minister say a word or two about the good work that the British Council is doing in Taiwan?
</p>

<a name="40708-27_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>The United Kingdom&#039;s relationship with Taiwan should be actively encouraged by the Government, providing it is cultivated within the boundaries set by our acknowledgement of Taiwan&#039;s status and its own relationship with China. We hope that our informal ties with Taiwan remain strong and, if possible, are a means through which to encourage a peaceful resolution in the Taiwan Straits.

<p><a name="st_219"></a>
<a name="40708-28_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Faulkner of Worcester for raising the important subject of UK relations with Taiwan. Our bilateral relations in areas such as commerce, education and culture are in excellent shape and we have had a useful and informative debate, although compact. I thank my noble friend and other noble Lords who are members of the all-party parliamentary group for the time and effort that they dedicate to strengthening bilateral relations. My noble friend said that his most recent visit to Taiwan was to lead a parliamentary delegation for Chen Shui-bian&#039;s inauguration. Her Majesty&#039;s Government continue to welcome the development of democracy in Taiwan.
</p>

<a name="40708-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>My noble friend touched on Taiwan&#039;s relationship with mainland China and the EU arms embargo. On the specific question of the arms embargo my noble friend will know that a review is ongoing. I have noted his comments, but it would be inappropriate to comment further before the end of that review.
</p>

<a name="40708-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>We consider that the future of Taiwan is a matter for the people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits to settle among themselves. We welcome any efforts by both sides to lower tensions and to find a mutually acceptable basis for a resumption of peaceful dialogue&#151;an issue that was raised by all noble Lords this afternoon. We would view with extreme concern any recourse to military action. We take every suitable opportunity to convey to the Chinese Government our <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1002"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 1002</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

strong opposition to the use of force. In the absence of diplomatic relations with Taiwan, representations to the Taiwanese authorities must be informal. We are confident that they are aware of our views.
</p>

<a name="40708-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>My noble friend raised the issue of the World Health Organisation and Taiwan, as did the noble Lord, Lord Russell-Johnston. This year, the World Health Assembly debated at length its relationship with Taiwan. Taiwan&#039;s healthcare is of a high calibre. However, in response to the noble Lord, Lord Russell-Johnston, there are practical difficulties of sharing that expertise in a UN forum where statehood is a pre-requisite for full membership. I assure the noble Lord that Her Majesty&#039;s Government fully endorse the views expressed in the European Union&#039;s <i>explication de vote</i> that he quoted.
</p>




<p><a name="st_220"></a>
<a name="40708-28_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, I do not think that anyone is arguing for full membership for Taiwan. The issue is observer status, of the sort that is granted to the PLO and the Holy See. Why is that so difficult?
</p>




<p><a name="st_221"></a>
<a name="40708-28_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, the reason that we endorsed that <i>explication de vote</i> at the World Health Assembly was that Ireland, in speaking on behalf of all the EU member states, having the EU presidency, expressed the EU&#039;s hope&#151;I hope that this will answer my noble friend to some extent&#151;that the WHO secretariat and others organising meetings and working groups under the WHO auspices would show flexibility in finding mechanisms to allow Taiwanese medical and public health officials to participate in the activities. Her Majesty&#039;s Government fully endorse any research into finding that flexibility.
</p>

<a name="40708-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>I now turn to the bilateral relationship that we have. Her Majesty&#039;s Government&#039;s position on Taiwan&#039;s status is well known. It remains our policy and forms the foundation of our dealings, but non-recognition should not inhibit the development of close relations in areas such as education and trade. The UK strongly supports Taiwan&#039;s membership of the World Trade Organisation. Taiwan has an important contribution to make in bringing about free and fair world trade. We welcome the progress that has been made so far in relation to Taiwan&#039;s WTO commitments, which was one of the key issues discussed at our recent annual trade policy talks.
</p>

<a name="40708-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>The UK remains the favoured destination for Taiwanese investment in Europe. There are about 150 Taiwanese companies in the UK. We are encouraging them to diversify their work from manufacturing into research and development. Recent manufacturing successes include the decisions by China Magnetics Corporation and Ritek, the world&#039;s two leading producers of digital storage media, to build and produce next generation products here in the UK. UK exports to Taiwan last year amounted to just over &#163;900 million. During his recent visit to Taiwan, my noble friend will no doubt have been impressed by the number of familiar names that he saw on the high street in Taipei: B&Q; MFI; Boots; Tesco, which all now have significant operations in Taiwan, with plans for further expansion.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40708-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>As the noble Lord noted, the British Trade and Cultural Office, the non-governmental office in Taiwan that represents UK economic and cultural interests, is active in boosting Britain&#039;s profile in Taiwan and improving our unofficial links. The British Trade and Cultural Office is supported in Taiwan by an active British Chamber of Commerce and by the Taiwan British Business Council. Formed in 1999, the TBBC is an industry-led, government-supported organisation, which aims to promote business and investment between Taiwan and the UK. I am particularly grateful to my noble friend for giving a keynote speech at the TBBC&#039;s sixth annual meeting this April.
</p>

<a name="40708-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>Our links in education, culture and science are also very strong. The noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, asked about the work of the British Council. I am happy to report that the British Council is very active in Taiwan. In early June, Sir David Green, director-general of the British Council, opened its new premises in Taipei. As well as beginning to teach English for the first time in Taiwan, the British Council and Taipei City have jointly developed a teachers&#039; resource pack that is used in all primary schools in Taipei.
</p>

<a name="40708-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>The British Council and BTCO are also working to promote British science. Last year, their exhibition on the discovery of DNA was seen by more than 500,000 people in three museums around Taiwan. They also organised a visit by Nobel laureate, Sir John Sulston, to promote public understanding of science.

</p>

<a name="40708-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>Artists&#039; exchanges and residencies continue to improve the links between British and Taiwanese artists, dancers and musicians. The Taipei Representative Office in London must also take a great deal of credit for the improving relations. It shares our aim of developing substantive links between the UK and Taiwan. The TRO is headed by the distinguished academic, Dr Tien Hung-mao.
</p>

<a name="40708-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>Our lack of diplomatic relations means that we cannot afford Dr Tien and his colleagues the privileges that go with diplomatic status. But we try to minimise the practical inconveniences that they may face. I have noted my noble friend&#039;s comments.
</p>




<p><a name="st_222"></a>
<a name="40708-28_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Slynn of Hadley: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. Before she finishes this aspect of her speech, perhaps I may ask whether she would include, together with art, culture and so forth, the very important role played by many Taiwanese lawyers in the development of international law.
</p>

<a name="40708-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>I raise that here because the headquarters of the International Law Association, of which I am chairman, is in London. The Government should know, if they do   not already know&#151;in fact, the Minister probably does   already know&#151;what a very great contribution <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1004"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column 1004</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

international law has received from Taiwanese lawyers and members of the government, and so forth. They always come to functions here. They always assist lawyers from other countries who may not have the means to go to international conferences. They have done a great deal to organise conferences, including conferences on the World Trade Organisation, to encourage international law. That has done a great deal to bond British and Taiwanese lawyers.
</p>




<p><a name="st_223"></a>
<a name="40708-28_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, I am very happy to welcome and acknowledge that most interesting contribution to our debate from the noble and learned Lord.

</p>

<a name="40708-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>I was saying to my noble friend that I have noted his comments that other EU capitals treat the Taiwanese better than we do. If he will write to me with explicit examples, I shall be very happy to review that situation.
</p>

<a name="40708-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>We have a substantial programme of unofficial visits by Ministers responsible for non-political areas. Taiwan&#039;s Minister with responsibility for education visited the UK in January 2004 with a programme to look at the UK&#039;s management of higher education and   secondary schools. Other recent visits include Ministers responsible for economics, health, finance, environment and science.
</p>

<a name="40708-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>Last year, Alan Johnson and Nigel Griffiths visited Taiwan to promote UK interests there. Sir David King visited Taiwan in February this year to boost our profile in major science infrastructure projects and to expand scientific and educational ties.
</p>

<a name="40708-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>In common with EU partners&#151;I have noted the strong views of the noble Lord, Lord Russell-Johnston on the subject of EU visas&#151;we see visits by the most senior political figures in Taiwan as inconsistent with our non-recognition policy. Such visits are looked at on a case-by-case basis.
</p>

<a name="40708-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, asked me about flights between Taipei and Shanghai. During the lunar new year in 2003 there were indirect charter flights between Taipei and Shanghai. Recently we have also seen the restoration of shipping links between the islands of Jinmen and Matsu and the mainland. Like the noble Lord, we believe that such practical measures are good ways to build confidence and help promote peaceful dialogue.
</p>

<a name="40708-28_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>In conclusion, I hope that your Lordships will agree that UK/Taiwan relations are in excellent shape. Non-recognition imposes real constraints on what we can and cannot do. However, overall we have a strong relationship. We shall continue to work with the Taiwanese to develop and build that relationship in areas such as commerce, culture and education.

<a name="40708-29_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   We now get to the nuts and bolts of the Determinations Panel which we discussed in brief on earlier clauses and on Schedule 1. I recall that my noble friend wanted to separate out Schedule 1, but we have dealt with that.
</p>

<a name="40708-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>I find the Determinations Panel a most peculiar animal. I searched my first port of call, the Explanatory Notes, for an explanation of why it was there, what the policy behind it was and so on, but failed to find one.

</p>

<a name="40708-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>I was saying that the Determinations Panel in Clause 10 is a most peculiar animal. It does not build on any experience that I can find of OPRA, which is replaced by the regulating authority in the Bill. So I looked at the Explanatory Notes, where I expected to find an explanation. Of course, I did not. The notes really reword the clauses in what one might call everyday layman&#039;s language but do not tell us much about the policy behind the nuts and bolts of the Bill, and certainly the nuts and bolts of the regulator.
</p>

<a name="40708-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>All I could find was&#151;unusually&#151;in <i>Hansard </i>for the Committee stage in another place. The Minister made a rather bald statement:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;The creation of the determinations panel will not only enable best use of the regulator&#039;s resources but ensure that the regulator remains efficient and accountable.

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>In another place, there was a suggestion that one of the reasons for this was that it would produce Chinese walls within the regulator, but I do not see how. The panel will be selected by the nominations or appointments committee&#151;whatever it is called&#151;of the regulator. I can find nothing in the Bill that says that a non-executive may or may not chair it. I rather suspect that it will be chaired by a non-executive. After all, the nominations panel is composed of non-executive members of the regulator. Perhaps we can clear up that matter straightaway. Can a member of the regulator chair the Determinations Panel?

From the notes that the noble Baroness kindly sent us, we know the kind of people who will comprise the panel and who will be eligible for appointment to it; but we do not know how often they are likely to work, what they are likely to be paid, whether there will be expenses only, and so on. There are still quite a few points on which the note did not provide answers. I would be grateful if, in due course, the noble Baroness could answer those points.

<a name="40708-29_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Clause 10 provides that the regulator must establish and maintain a committee known as the Determinations Panel. The panel&#039;s duty will be to exercise, on behalf of the regulator, the reserved regulatory functions that are set out in Schedule 2. Schedule 1 deals with the regulator&#039;s functions and Schedule 2 with the Determinations Panel. Of course, the Determinations Panel is part of, although at the same time distinct from, the regulator. I can understand the need to probe our thinking on that.

</p>

<a name="40708-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>The decision whether or not to exercise any of those regulatory functions would also be reserved to the panel. The Determinations Panel must consist of a chairman and at least six other members. The chairman of the panel will be chosen by a special committee convened for that purpose and chaired by a non-executive member of the regulator. The non-executive member of the regulator chairs the selection committee which determines the   independent chairman of the Determinations Committee. That may be where the misunderstanding occurred.
</p>

<a name="40708-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>The remaining panel members will be appointed by the panel&#039;s chairman. None of the panel&#039;s members may be a member of the board or the staff of either the regulator or the pension protection fund. Those provisions will further enhance the fact that the Determinations Panel is effectively independent of other parts of the regulator.

</p>

<a name="40708-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>From what the Minister has said, is one to assume that that includes non-executive directors?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="40708-29_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Yes. The push behind the question raised by the noble Lord, apart from actually understanding and appreciating the structure, would be why it is necessary. That is what I want to address.
</p>

<a name="40708-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>The push is that regulatory decision making will be kept, and needs to be kept, separate from the setting of strategy and other functions of the board. More importantly, it also separates the decision makers from the investigatory staff and, therefore, a degree of interdependence in the regulator&#039;s decision-making process.

</p>

<a name="40708-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>In part, this model is based on the structure of the FSA. Section 395 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 requires the FSA to separate its investigation and recommendation functions from the decision-making functions. To achieve that, the FSA has set up a regulatory decisions committee which effectively serves the same purpose as the Determinations Panel. When I met the FSA, I checked on that and it appears to be an entirely satisfactory way of working.
</p>

<a name="40708-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>However, because the panel forms part of the office of the regulator, it will not be an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which sets out the right to a fair trial. In other words, it goes part of the way to meeting human rights obligations, but it is not sufficient as it stands. That right will be secured by enabling directly affected parties to refer to the Pensions Regulator tribunal any of the regulator&#039;s determinations made by the regulator or the Determinations Panel.
</p>

<a name="40708-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>However, the panel&#039;s separation from the members and staff of the regulator enhances the impartiality of decision making. That is particularly important when it is decided that a regulatory function must be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC170"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC170</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

exercised immediately in order to protect members of a scam&#151;I mean, of a scheme, against a scam. I think that my Freudian slip was quite correct. In many cases, such actions may encroach upon individual rights, but the interference will be justified by the need to protect the interests and rights of others.
</p>

<a name="40708-29_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>An example of such a regulatory action is the issue of a freezing order under Clause 20. For a short time, the order may have the effect of reducing the benefits payable to particular members. That is acceptable because the action is intended to protect the interests of the generality of members. However, I hope, and believe, that the fact that only the Determinations Panel may issue a freezing order on the regulator&#039;s behalf improves the impartiality of that initial decision.

</p>

<a name="40708-29_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Therefore, the creation of the panel will not only enable best use of the regulator&#039;s resources but will ensure that the procedures remain fair and accountable. It will provide a degree of objectivity for those concerned.
</p>

<a name="40708-29_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>The noble Lord also asked me how significant we thought that responsibility would be. My best understanding is that, at present, that function is contained within the membership of OPRA, and the members exercising those functions take about 20 days a year. However, they are not full days; the members are paid allowances pro rata. Some of the problems that that causes have been pointed out to me. The chairman of OPRA goes into a huddle and then has to exclude herself from the decision making in order to try to invent Chinese walls, and everyone would be happier if they existed more effectively and publicly.
</p>

<a name="40708-29_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>Therefore, we are seeking to improve the level of confidence in the decision-making process by separating the Determinations Panel from the rest of the body of the regulator. That goes part of the way towards meeting our compliance with ECHR. However, it does not go all the way, and therefore appeals can obviously be made to the pensions tribunal both from the regulator and the Determinations Panel. Clearly, if any party is unhappy with any of the regulator&#039;s proposals, the Determinations Panel is in a position to enforce them. It may decide that it wishes to amend them or it may ask either party to think again.

<a name="40708-30_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Borrie:  </b>  Before the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, speaks, I must admit that I sympathise somewhat with the kind of questions that he put to the Minister. From what the Minister said, I now understand far more clearly than I did the clear separation, and the reasons for the separation, between the regulator and the Determinations Panel. But I still have a slight difficulty in understanding it from the wording in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40708-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Clause 10 begins with the words:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;The Regulator must establish and maintain a committee&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>It is only later that we learn that no member of the regulator or any member of the staff of the regulator is allowed to be on that committee. To those of us who are familiar with authorities, councils and committees, the committee is a committee of the council or of the authority. In this case, that is only so in a very technical <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC171"></a>

sense because, for perfectly good reasons which the Minister explained, there is not allowed to be any overlap whatever. I think that I have understood that correctly&#151;the Minister is nodding her head. But, from the point of view of explaining the adjudicatory set-up, whether in Explanatory Notes or in the desire to publicise this issue to those who want to know about it, the use of the word &quot;committee&quot; in line 16 on page 5 of the Bill seems to be somewhat unfortunate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="40708-30_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord   Skelmersdale, for raising questions in which I share an interest. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, is right: the inter-relationship is not clear in the Bill. I want to ask the Minister whether, in choosing to follow the model of the FSA as opposed to the existing OPRA model, any calculation has been made about how much additional time it would take for the Determinations Panel to conduct and conclude its business. I ask that because time is a critical issue for those involved.
</p>

<a name="40708-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>I assume that the Determinations Panel will have to get its information from the same sources as the regulator. How will all that be managed? Is the noble Baroness confident that those arrangements will be more efficient in terms of the panel&#039;s output?
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="40708-30_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Trenchard: </b>   I agree entirely with the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. I have been confused by these arrangements. Every time I read the Bill, it strikes me as strange that the regulator is a body corporate, a point the noble Lord drew attention to at Second Reading. Its board of directors are called members not of the board of the regulator, but of the regulator itself. That is confusing. A &quot;member of the regulator&quot; would exclude a member of the staff of the regulator since it refers to a member of the board of the regulator. I would much prefer words along the lines of &quot;regulatory authority&quot; rather than simply &quot;the regulator&quot;. I hope that the noble Baroness agrees that it would be clearer if the regulator had a board.

</p>

<a name="40708-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>Following on from the point introduced by my noble friend, which I strongly support, the Determinations Panel is a committee of, and maintained by, the regulator. How many members of staff will the panel have? Also, is it true that they will not be members of the staff of the regulator?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="40708-30_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I do not want to take up the time of noble Lords, but it may help if I trace what might happen to a case in these situations so that we have a record of it in <i>Hansard</i>. The example was included in the briefing pack.
</p>

<a name="40708-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>In a normal case, the regulator would have received information, either from a whistle blower or via the scheme return, of the failure on the part of the trustees to produce a copy of the scheme&#039;s annual accounts as required by the Pension Schemes Act 1993. The trustees&#039; failure could point to a number of other breaches. It may be that they have failed to appoint an auditor or, more seriously, because of a failure to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC172"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC172</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

produce accounts because there is no schedule of contributions, which is vital to ensure that a scheme is properly funded.
</p>

<a name="40708-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>The regulatory arm of the regulator would investigate the circumstances. It may consider whether its current information suggests that there are any other relevant risks. It could ask the trustees for an explanation or it could use its new information-gathering powers to acquire further data. If there appears to be no risk to scheme members and no reason to believe that the trustees are not in the process of complying, the trustees might be given a further period in which to comply. But if the work has not been started or if the trustees are not co-operative, the regulator might decide to issue an improvement notice to the trustees requiring a display of the accounts within a specified period. The regulator may also issue an associated third party notice if it appears that the trustees are being impeded by, for example, the scheme&#039;s auditors. I have been briefed on a case where exactly that happened.
</p>

<a name="40708-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>All that would be done by the regulator. Should the trustees fail without reasonable excuse to comply with the improvement notice, they are liable to a civil penalty under Section 10 of the Pensions Act 1995. If in this case, as in any case where a Section 10 penalty could be imposed, the regulator believed the circumstances were such as to warrant such a sanction, at that point it could present its evidence to the Determinations Panel. The regulatory arm of the regulator would then consider whether the case represented an immediate risk, which might produce special procedures. If no such risk arose, the regulator could issue a warning notice to the trustees.

</p>

<a name="40708-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Having been alerted to the case because the regulator is sufficiently concerned and is minded to impose a Section 10 penalty, the Determinations Panel would consider the case put before it by the regulatory arm alongside any representations from those affected, which would be made in person, and other evidence presented. The decision of the Determinations Panel could be that the Section 10 penalty is appropriate, and it would notify everyone concerned. If the trustees were unhappy, they could apply to the Pensions Regulator tribunal, at which point the decision to impose the penalty would be suspended for the period. The tribunal would then consider the case afresh and consider any further evidence. The tribunal could confirm the regulator&#039;s determination, could direct the regulator to vary or revoke it or could substitute a different determination. Any party may refer the tribunal&#039;s decision on a point of law only to the Court of Appeal or, in Scotland, the Court of Session.
</p>

<a name="40708-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>That is a fairly minor breach which may or may not conceal a major breach. The point at which you go beyond the powers available in Schedule 1 to the regulator and powers that would impose a sanction is when the case goes through to the Determinations Panel, which would hear the evidence from the regulator and any other evidence to decide whether it is appropriate. If that is not satisfactory, it then goes through to the pensions tribunal and, if necessary on a point of law, into the court system.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40708-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>That is the procedure. The evidence we have is that that happens very rarely. The evidence from OPRA shows that two to three people are needed for that function in the current OPRA proceedings. The time scale is 20 days part-time per member involved in that function. Obviously, that may expand&#151;I am not saying that that is where it will necessarily end&#151;but that gives us some indication of what is involved. Even now, with the relatively limited powers that OPRA has, the matter seldom gets into the heavy end. Given the more effective range of powers that the regulator now has, I would hope that fewer cases would end up in the determinations field. I would hope that the measure will be neither onerous nor oppressive.

<a name="40708-30_para11"></a>

We shall discuss that in a later clause. However, such a situation can arise. I refer to paragraph 20(6) of Schedule 1 on page 238 of the Bill&#151;that is another reason why my noble friend wanted to separate out from Schedule 1 the parts referring to the Determinations Panel&#151;which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;The Regulator may also authorise the Determinations Panel, in such circumstances as the Regulator may determine, to exercise on behalf of the Regulator such functions (other than those mentioned in sub-paragraph (2)(a) to (c)) as the Regulator considers necessary for the effective exercise by the Panel&quot;,</p>

&quot;(   )   section (Pension liberation: restraining orders)(10) (application to permit payments out of an account that is subject to a restraining order);&quot;


<p><a name="st_26"></a>The noble Baroness said: The main purpose of Amendments Nos. 37, 40, 41, 42, 49, 50, 51, 52 and 171 is to introduce new clauses that are, I believe, a welcome and useful addition to the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40708-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>Their purpose is to arm the Pensions Regulator with the necessary powers successfully to combat the illegal activities of those who establish and run pension liberation schemes. If we are talking about language, the one thing I object to is calling something that I regard as offensive and illegal &quot;liberation&quot;. It is not a word that I would choose.
</p>

<a name="40708-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>As these are new clauses on a new topic, I have sent letters to members of the Committee, and it may be worth spending a moment to say exactly what we mean by &quot;pension liberation&quot; and why it is a problem that has to be tackled.
</p>

<a name="40708-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>&quot;Liberation&quot; schemes&#151;the Committee will notice heavy, sarcastic quotation marks around &quot;liberation&quot; whenever the word is mentioned in this context&#151;are scams that offer to convert the accrued rights&#151;which has the normal everyday meaning of rights in occupational and personal stakeholder schemes&#151;of members of bona fide pension schemes into an immediate tax-free lump sum. The organisers of liberation schemes use adverts to attract people who urgently need cash. The adverts offer to turn pension benefits into a tax-free lump sum. However, the people offering the service usually charge high commissions, ranging from 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the individual&#039;s total fund.
</p>

<a name="40708-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>Transactions are often arranged using offshore companies and bank accounts. Typically, the individual&#039;s existing pension scheme will receive a request from the pensions liberator to transfer their pension money to a scheme in the name of a fictitious new employer created solely for the purpose of trust busting. The trustees of the ceding scheme will not be aware that the scheme to which it transfers the accrued rights is in fact a so-called liberation scheme. As well as paying up to 30 per cent of their pension rights in commission to the liberators, an individual could end up paying as much as 40 per cent tax on the total amount, making a total of 70 per cent.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC175"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC175</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40708-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>Pensions liberation poses a great risk to the security of pension scheme members&#039; benefits. It also serves to frustrate the purpose for which Parliament has granted generous tax relief to approved pension schemes. However, it is important to note that pension liberation is not the same as pension unlocking. It offers a legitimate, although potentially risky, way for people over the age of 50 to take early retirement and release their pension benefits from an occupational or personal pension. Pension liberation, on the other hand, poses a serious and ongoing threat to the financial security in retirement of many members of occupational and personal pension schemes.
</p>

<a name="40708-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>The question is how best to combat this threat. At present, OPRA is aware of a number pension liberation schemes. It believes that the money passing through those schemes is significant, possibly beyond the region of &#163;50 million. OPRA has taken action in respect of these cases. In February 2003, the Inland Revenue, based on information passed to it by OPRA, secured a conviction against two men at Oxford Crown Court for offences relating to pensions liberation. Between them, they received five and a half years in gaol. If anybody is interested in that case, I can write to them with details. It was a real scam, and the judge took it very seriously.
</p>

<a name="40708-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>The effectiveness of OPRA&#039;s action has been severely restricted by the inadequate powers it has to confront this type of abuse&#151;a form of abuse that was not recognised when the Pensions Act 1995 was drafted. I asked whether we could tackle the problem of laundering money through the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, but not even that Act can be relied on to recover moneys paid out of pension schemes in breach of trust. That is because not all actions in breach of trust are criminal offences. The Proceeds of Crime Act can be used only in cases where a criminal offence or something that would be a criminal offence if it happened in the UK has been committed. Sometimes it would be appropriate to use the Act to recover money, but not always.
</p>

<a name="40708-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>That is why we believe that we should equip the Pensions Regulator with the necessary powers to act swiftly and decisively against the perpetrators of a particularly damaging scam. That is why we have introduced these new clauses.
</p>

<a name="40708-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>I could go on to explain how the individual amendments will work, but I am aware that the Committee has a heavy agenda. However, I am entirely in its hands. I wonder whether I have given the Committee enough information about why we are doing this for it to accept the amendments. If not, I am very happy to continue to explain them in considerably more detail. I beg to move.

<a name="column_GC176"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC176</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

do that if they find that they have been deceived by the managers of the liberator&#151;supposing that they have been promised 100 per cent of their rights but got only 50 per cent? Why cannot an individual make that application?
</p>

<a name="40708-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>The other question is on Amendment No. 51. Is it justified or proportional that a restraining order can freeze all the assets in a bank account, even if only some of them consist of money liberated from a pension scheme?
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="40708-31_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I must admit that the same questions that the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, has just asked occurred to me. Pension liberation schemes, especially where charges are high&#151;the Minister&#039;s helpful explanation says that they can be as high as 20 or 30 per cent of the value of the money taken out, which seems to be astronomical&#151;are, in the words of <i>1066 And All That</i>, &quot;a Bad Thing&quot;; in fact, I would go further and say that they were a very bad thing. Therefore, I am pleased that the Government are taking action to deal with that.
</p>

<a name="40708-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>As the Minister points out, the tax allowances are given for a particular and peculiar purpose. They are   not quite as generous as they were, thanks to the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#039;s activities over the past six years&#151;but I will let that pass. The high-interest arrangements are of course happening in other walks of financial life, such as with store cards and credit cards. I should be interested to know whether the Government have plans for dealing with organisations that provide money for loan at a very high rate of interest.
</p>

<a name="40708-31_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>I am not sure whether my next question is applicable to clause stand part, but there is a distinct relationship between subsection (6) and Schedule 2. It is somewhat repetitive, and one wonders why the draftsman decided that it was necessary. Amendments Nos. 49 and 50 seem, at first blush, to be a sensible way of dealing with a very bad practice. However, if the court, as it assuredly will, sends the money back to the pension fund or to the individual, does the Minister anticipate that it will send the full amount, or will the &quot;liberator&quot; keep some of it? If the liberator keeps some of it, the practice of liberation will not be stamped out.
</p>

<a name="40708-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>I am surprised that the amendments do not refer to Clause 17 either instead or as well. After all, that is where we find the details&#151;scrappy as they are&#151;of restitution by the courts.

<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="40708-32_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I shall try to deal with all the questions that have been raised, but if I forget to answer one, perhaps noble Lords will come back to me.
</p>

<a name="40708-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, asked whether individuals could make personal representations. Yes, they can do so, if that is what they would prefer.
</p>

<a name="40708-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>I turn to the point about the moneys, and I shall explain what Clauses 8 and 18, along with Amendment No. 52, seek to do. Restitution of the moneys owed may not happen if part of the money has been spent. We have tried to ring-fence the pension money, but if it is less than is stolen it cannot be made good. That is part of the problem, but it is also the case that the person perpetrating the scam may very well have mixed their personal money with that of the pension scam money, and there is not as yet any way of disentangling those. The person we believe to be the scam perpetrator may apply to the courts to access some funds to use for living expenses. That is what would be done here until the whole affair could be unscrambled and, as far as possible, restoration made to the victim.
</p>

<a name="40708-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>This would also depend on how much money had been spent, how much had been laundered out of existence and so forth. However, the powers in these clauses would allow us to go after not only the money, but if it has been spent in bad faith on a property as opposed to a property further down the line in good faith, we could pursue that as well.
</p>

<a name="40708-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>The power to freeze the entire account and then to allow an application for reasonable living expenses to be paid to an individual is apparently the same as that applied when a court freezes an individual&#039;s bank account under court procedure rules. It is a common occurrence because, as I have said, there can be mixed moneys.
</p>

<a name="40708-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>Those are the reasons for these slightly elaborate provisions. I do not know whether my explanation answers the questions raised.

<a name="40708-32_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   I welcome the assurance given by the noble Baroness that an individual can apply for a restitution order, but is that what the Bill states? If not, will she amend it to give effect to what she has just said?
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="40708-32_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   My understanding is that this does not have to be in the Bill, it is a basic right that pre-exists this legislation and will continue after it. However, I am happy to ensure that such issues, which are absolutely appropriate, are covered in codes of guidance and so forth.

<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="40708-32_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for that full explanation and for answering the questions put both by myself and the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott. However, I have a sneaking suspicion that the noble Baroness has been a little gung-ho on this. In a few years&#039; time I think that we shall have to revisit it because I am not entirely sure that it is going to work. That is a personal view.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="40708-32_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   My only comment on all this is that we face a dilemma that no doubt we shall debate again on other clauses. Many of us were involved in the discussions on the 1995 Act, at which time we acted in good faith. However, we have found that ingenious people, like those involved in pension liberation schemes, sometimes got around it because the powers that we bestowed on OPRA were too carefully detailed and too tightly drawn.
</p>

<a name="40708-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>There is a real dilemma here. On the one hand, I share the view of noble Lords that they want to see provisions made specific in the Bill and do not like what I would call vague, prescribed powers. But the tighter something is drawn, the more it is possible for the ingenious and the extremely highly paid to get around it. We are trying to strike the right balance between being transparent and accountable in our intention, but leaving sufficient reserve power for the regulator or the Determinations Panel to address issues of scamming, cheating and fraud&#151;the noble Lord is quite right to say that they certainly will emerge. The bodies will have the powers to do so without having to come back and ask for another piece of legislation.
</p>

<a name="40708-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>As we go through this Committee stage, I shall repeatedly be asking noble Lords to bear in mind that need to maintain that balance because the more tightly drawn and explicit we are in the Bill, the more we run the risk of encountering the very problems that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has rightly identified.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="40708-32_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   I understood the Minister, in response to the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, to say that the court&#039;s power to order restitution could apply whether it is on the regulator&#039;s application or an individual&#039;s. Indeed, the words are generalised enough to suggest that. But subsection (4) of the new Clause 50, towards the top of page 5 in the Marshalled List, states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;The court, on the application of the Regulator, may make such order as the court thinks just and convenient&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>and so on, for ensuring that the proceeds are transferred towards a pension scheme or an annuity or to the liberated member. Unfortunately, I wonder whether the phrase,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;on the application of the Regulator&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>limits the court&#039;s powers if the regulator does not apply, but the individual does.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="40708-32_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I shall check that, but my understanding is that these powers are complimentary to the Crown Proceedings Act which gives those powers to the individual. These clauses give power to the regulator and that is why they specify <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC179"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC179</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

powers for the regulator. The individual powers run parallel and pre-exist by virtue of the Crown Proceedings Act.

<p><a name="st_41"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 38 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 39, 43, 44, 113 to 115 and 132 to 134. Clause 11 contains the functions of the regulator that are reserved to the Determinations Panel. Where the Bill grants a person a statutory right to make an application to the regulator&#151;for example, to appoint a trustee or to revoke a prohibition order&#151;the Determinations Panel will deal with the application.
</p>

<a name="40708-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>This trespasses on a territory which is more fully addressed under Clauses 35 onwards. I suggest that I do not go into that territory now as we do not want to have two debates on the matter. Currently, there are provisions contained in Clauses 38(6) and 45(6) to reduce any outstanding Section 75 debt due to the trustees or managers of an occupational pension scheme or to the board of the pension protection fund, as the case may be, when a contribution notice or a non-compliance contribution notice is issued and complied with. We are saying that when they pay some money it is docked off the debt. That seems to me to be entirely sensible and I hope that the Committee agrees. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="40708-32_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I do not object to the first substantive amendment.

</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>The noble Lord said: I did not want to burden the Marshalled List by tabling amendments every time the word &quot;education&quot; appeared throughout the Bill, and therefore I decided to put down an amendment to the title of Clause 13. The question is very simple. I can understand assistance being given to employers, to persons involved in advising employers and to persons upon whom duties are imposed by virtue of Clause 228. I can understand the need for information and assistance, but why is education included? What, over and above information and assistance, does education provide and why is it necessary? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="40708-33_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   I should be sorry if the word were to disappear. Any regulator&#151;I was one once&#151;rather likes to have one or two positive roles in addition to the harsh and negative ones. Perhaps what I am saying is similar to what I said at an earlier stage in our deliberations on the Bill when similar opposition was mounted to a provision in an earlier clause.
</p>

<a name="40708-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Surely, the more information, education and assistance there is from the regulator, the less likely it is that people will get into trouble and do the things that they should not do. An educational role is positive and helpful to those who run pension schemes. No doubt it would be carried out in an indirect form, with information being made available for those whose job it was to run the schemes. But if the word &quot;education&quot; were excluded, it might send out a message that the regulator was to have a purely negative &quot;policeman&quot; role.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="40708-33_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   As the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said, this is to some extent a reprise of the discussions that we had on the previous occasion. I support the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, on this <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC181"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC181</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

matter. I think that it is unnecessary to include the word &quot;education&quot; and, as we said previously, it is a question of focus. There are only so many hours in the day and only so much that the regulator can do, and he should be focusing on the main job of regulation. The more that is broadened out into more remote issues, the less time he will have for the real job. Therefore, I think that the word &quot;education&quot; is unnecessary.
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="40708-33_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Before joining the House, I spent my entire career trying to distinguish between information and education so far as concerned my students. I knew that what mattered was education because, with that, one could find one&#039;s way to the information. I am sorry to see that the Committee has such a low opinion of its value.

</p>

<a name="40708-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>It may be helpful if I give an example or two. Clause 13 would allow the regulator, where authorised, to help employers to understand, and comply with, any responsibilities they may have to provide their employees with access to pensions information and advice. As the Committee will know, where employers do not contribute to pension schemes, we are requiring them, should Parliament so agree, to make available pensions advice and assistance. We think that that will be a particular problem, or challenge, for small and medium-sized employers. They may find it extremely helpful to have some sense of what is expected of them in that role. I do not know whether that counts as information or education, but &quot;education&quot; is the process of achieving a culture of compliance and &quot;information&quot; is how one does it. I think that both aspects are needed in the Bill. We are considering e-modules and so on, but I hope that the Committee will accept the concept.
</p>

<a name="40708-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>We are trying to ensure that if, for example, the regulator produces guidance and so on which helps to create that culture of compliance, in the Bill it will not be held to be <i>ultra vires</i> on the grounds that it goes further than a narrow definition of &quot;information&quot;. I do not think that there is any doubt about the regulator&#039;s key job but, behind it all, he is trying to secure confidence in the pension structure of this country. Part of that is achieving a culture of compliance and understanding on the part of employers, employees and trustee managers.

Our presumption is that the regulator&#039;s primary responsibility is towards the scheme trustees who are asked and expected to represent the best interests of all scheme members and, where appropriate, also the employer with the assistance of their advisers, scheme managers and administrators.

</p>

<a name="40708-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 18 shall stand part of the Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="40708-34_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I have heard that that the regulator can use only the powers already in theory available to the trustees. If the trustees fail to extract the money, will not the regulator need extra powers? I am surprised that this clause, again unusually, is so mild in that respect.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="40708-34_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   This clause allows the regulator to stand in the shoes of the trustees in relation to occupational schemes and the members of personal pension schemes to enforce the debt due from the employer rather than just to punish him. The reason we need the power in this form is not so much to displace the trustees, although that may need to happen on occasion, but because at the moment OPRA lacks these powers.
</p>

<a name="40708-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>OPRA&#039;s experience has shown that, unfortunately, some employers deduct contributions from employees&#039; pay but do not forward them to the scheme. Even more commonly, employers do not forward their own contributions. This is a particular problem in personal pensions and defined contribution schemes where there has been no mechanism for ensuring that the employer pays what is owed unless individual employees are prepared to take their employer to court. Noble Lords will appreciate that individual employees are often reluctant to take legal action against their employers unless they are considering leaving their jobs.
</p>

<a name="40708-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>In the year 2002-03, OPRA received over 8,000 reports of late payments and penalties were imposed on 37 employers who had not paid contributions or had paid them very late. However, as was highlighted by the National Audit Office report in October 2002, OPRA has no power to ensure that the contributions due are paid. OPRA can punish the employer, but cannot make good the problem. That is why the clause is drafted in this way.
</p>

<a name="40708-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>The money is due to the scheme and in our view an employer should be required, if other methods have failed and the trustees have failed, to pay what is owed. This power helps to keep intact the pension promise which the employer makes to the employees. That is really very important. We are making good a problem that OPRA has recognised.
</p>

<a name="40708-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>The noble Lord is absolutely right to point out that the regulator will be standing in the shoes of the trustees but, where trustees have failed or have been unable to rectify the problem, the regulator will now have the powers to do so. I hope that, with my explanation, the noble Lord will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="40708-34_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I understand all that, but my real question was: are the powers sufficient? As I read the clause, the regulator can do only what the trustees can do and have already failed to do, which is why they need to bring in the regulator in the first place. Does <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC184</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the regulator need extra powers? Again, if the noble Baroness would like to consider the point, I shall be happy with that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="40708-34_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I shall make a final point, one that I meant to make in my original remarks. Obviously it is the case that where you have decent, law-abiding, upright trustees, there may be an issue whereby we need to look at what powers by regulation may be required by the regulator. But the problem we are addressing is one that often arises in smaller companies, where the trustee is the employer himself. You are trying to ask the person whose default you are seeking to remedy to act against their own interest. That is why we need this power.
</p>

<a name="40708-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>If we need to go beyond this point&#151;and the noble Lord may well be right&#151;after the Bill has received parliamentary consent, we shall discuss with industry the powers to be given by regulation. If the noble Lord is right and the powers here do need to be strengthened, I am sure that we shall take his point on board.

<br>
   &quot;PENSION LIBERATION: RESTRAINING ORDERS


<br>
(1)   The Regulator may make a restraining order in relation to an account with a deposit taker if&#151;


<br>
(a)   it is satisfied that the account contains money which has been liberated from a pension scheme,


<br>
(b)   it is satisfied that the account is held by or on behalf of&#151;


<br>
(i)   the liberator, or


<br>
(ii)   a person who has to, or in practice is likely to, ensure that the account is operated in accordance with the liberator&#039;s directions, and


<br>
(c)   the order is made pending consideration being given to the making of one or more repatriation orders in relation to the account under section (Pension liberation: repatriation orders).


<br>
(2)   A restraining order is an order directing that no credit or debit of any amount may be made to the account concerned (&quot;the restrained account&quot;) during the period for which the order has effect.


<br>
(3)   A restraining order must&#151;


<br>
(a)   specify the name of the deposit taker in respect of which it is made,


<br>
(b)   identify the account in respect of which it is made, and


<br>
(c)   contain such other information as may be prescribed.


<br>

<br>
(b)   (subject to subsection (7)) ceases to have effect through expiry of time at the end of the six months beginning with the day when it is made.


<br>
(5)   The Regulator may, at a time when a restraining order has effect, make an order extending (or further extending) the restraining order.


<br>
(6)   An order under subsection (5) (an &quot;extension order&quot;) takes effect&#151;


<br>
(a)   when the deposit taker concerned is notified by the Regulator of the making of the order, but


<br>
(b)   only if notification under paragraph (a) occurs at a time when the restraining order concerned has effect.


<br>
(7)   Where an extension order takes effect&#151;


<br>
(a)   the restraining order concerned does not cease to have effect through expiry of time until the end of the six months beginning with the time when it would have ceased to have effect through expiry of time had it not been extended, but


<br>
(b)   for so long as the extension order has effect, no further extension order can take effect before that time in relation to the restraining order.


<br>
(8)   A restraining order does not prevent the crediting to the restrained account of an amount representing interest payable by the deposit taker on any amount which is, or has been, in the account.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC187"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC187</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(9)   Where a restraining order has effect, the deposit taker must return to the payer any money credited to the restrained account in breach of the order.

<br>
(10)   Where a restraining order has effect, the Regulator may, on an application made by or with the consent of the person by whom the restrained account is held, by order permit a payment specified in the order to be made out of the account if the Regulator is satisfied&#151;


<br>
(a)   that the payment will be made for the purpose of enabling&#151;


<br>
(i)   any individual to meet his reasonable living expenses, or


<br>
(ii)   any person to carry on a trade, business, profession or occupation,


<br>
(b)   that the beneficial interest in the money out of which the payment will be made belongs&#151;


<br>
(i)   to the individual, or person, concerned, or


<br>
(ii)   to a person who consents to the making of the payment, and


<br>
(c)   that the money out of which the payment will be made is not money liberated from a pension scheme.


<br>
(11)   Section 10 of the Pensions Act 1995 (c. 26) (civil penalties) applies to a deposit taker who, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with any obligation imposed by a restraining order.&quot;


<br>
After Clause 18, insert the following new clause&#151;


<br>
   &quot;PENSION LIBERATION: REPATRIATION ORDERS


<br>
(1)   Subsections (2) and (3) apply where&#151;


<br>
(a)   a restraining order has effect, and


<br>
(b)   the Regulator is satisfied that the restrained account contains an amount of money liberated from a pension scheme.


<br>
(2)   The Regulator may by order&#151;


<br>
(a)   direct the deposit taker concerned to pay from the account a sum not exceeding that amount&#151;


<br>
(i)   towards a pension scheme,


<br>
(ii)   towards an annuity or insurance policy, or


<br>
(iii)   to the liberated member, and


<br>
(b)   where it makes an order under paragraph (a)(i), direct the trustees or managers of the scheme to apply the sum, in such manner as the Regulator may direct, for the purpose of providing benefits under the scheme to or in respect of the liberated member.


<br>
(3)   If it appears to the Regulator, on taking an overall view of transactions taking place before the restraining order was made, that there are two or more individuals each of whom is a person who is or may be the liberated member in relation to some of the money, the Regulator may determine the sums to be paid from the restrained account under subsection (2) on any basis that appears to the Regulator to be just and reasonable.


<br>
(4)   Regulations may modify any of the provisions of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 (c. 48) as it applies in relation to cases where an order is made under subsection (2)(b).


<br>
(5)   Section 10 of the Pensions Act 1995 (c. 26) (civil penalties) applies to a deposit taker who, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with a direction given to him under subsection (2)(a).


<br>
(6)   If the trustees or managers of a pension scheme fail to comply with a direction given to them under subsection (2)(b), that section applies to any trustee or manager who has failed to take all reasonable steps to secure compliance.


<br>
(7)   In this section &quot;restrained account&quot; has the meaning given by section (Pension liberation: restraining orders).&quot;</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>Page 12, line 10, leave out &quot;freezing&quot; and insert &quot;risk&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>The noble Lord said: This time I have done a personal naughty, which is to seek to leave out the word &quot;freezing&quot; from as many places as I could find in the next few clauses and to replace it with the word &quot;risk&quot;. I do so because I am not sure that these orders really are freezing; that is, locking the situation in ice. I say that because in Clause 21(2), we find that a freezing order does not, to use the draftsman&#039;s thinking, lock the scheme in ice at all because it states that a freezing order would not prevent any increase in a benefit from being accrued. The clause also appears to say elsewhere that benefits in payment may continue to be paid.
</p>

<a name="40708-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>The order is an emergency procedure, and I understand why the regulator needs it. However, I would rather it was called something else. I am not particularly stuck on the word &quot;risk&quot;; I could cope with &quot;emergency&quot; or anything else. I am not sure that we can describe it as a &quot;freezing&quot; order. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="40708-35_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   It is an odd series of amendments. The word &quot;risk&quot; is vital: it is the reason for the order. It is the risk to members&#039; interests that moves the regulator to make a freezing order.
</p>

<a name="40708-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>There is a certain simplification about using a single word. I think that the word &quot;freezing&quot; gives the gist of what the order does, even if it does not cover it entirely, as the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, rightly pointed out. There are one or two uses of &quot;may&quot;, rather than &quot;must&quot; and so on, but the term is as near to a convenient, short-form phrase as one could get. I certainly do not think that &quot;risk&quot; is better.

<a name="40708-35_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Are there any more offerings? I am sure that they will be gratefully received, reviewed and discarded.
</p>

<a name="40708-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>The clause provides for a power to freeze an occupational pension scheme. Basically, it is a pause button. At the moment, OPRA does not have such a power; all it has is the power to wind up a scheme, which is a draconian measure. Freezing a scheme is a less drastic option, and we hope that, as a result, we will be able to reduce the number of schemes that the regulator has to wind up. There is a power to freeze a scheme for up to six months.
</p>

<a name="40708-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>We think that the name &quot;freezing order&quot; is appropriate, as my noble friend Lord Borrie said. The name &quot;risk order&quot; is not helpful. It does not describe the effect of the order, merely the context in which the order is made. It may suggest that the scheme is at risk and that the order puts the scheme at risk, when the purpose of the order is merely to pause the scheme to ascertain whether it should continue or be wound up. That does not necessarily equate to risk.

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>There are no minimum requirements for a freezing order. The rest are, as the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, said, discretionary powers that the regulator can add as appropriate. There has been widespread support for the proposal as something that will provide a breather so that it can be decided whether it is possible to keep the scheme going without the company toppling over into insolvency or facing some of the dilemmas that go on behind the scenes. We think that the word is appropriate and that everybody will understand what a freeze is; we live in the video era. To use the word &quot;risk&quot; is to confuse&#151;I refer to the debate the day before yesterday&#151;the target with the objective.

(ii)   a direction under section 20(4)(d) or (e) does not prevent the payment becoming due.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_74"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 66, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 68.
</p>

<a name="40708-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>Clause 21 deals with the consequences of a freezing order on a scheme. Amendment No. 66 is required because pension-sharing orders and earmarking orders work in different ways. I shall explain the difference between a pension-earmarking and a pension-sharing order. With a pension-sharing order, we take the value of the asset. According to how someone decides to apportion that matrimonial property on divorce, it may offer a clean start sum. Earmarking tends to be an attachment at the point of retiring so that a portion of the income flows after retirement. Very broadly speaking, that is the situation.
</p>

<a name="40708-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>It is therefore necessary to make a distinction legally between these two because they come under different pieces of legislation. Indeed, many of my noble friends were involved when we tried to get pension sharing included in the family law legislation. When we could not achieve that, we got family law included in a Pensions Bill. Thanks to Lady Seear and Lady Young we actually succeeded. It was one of the triumphs of the women&#039;s network in the Lords against all-comers.

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>We need to make the relevant distinction for freezing purposes. The policy is that freezing orders should not interfere with the trustees&#039; or managers&#039; obligations under a pension-sharing order which has been made by the courts. This does not force the trustees or managers to make a transfer payment in respect of a pension-sharing order&#151;the trustees or managers still have the statutory right to apply to the regulator under the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act   1999 and subsequent legislation to ensure that there is an extension of time in which to pay the pension credit.
</p>

<a name="40708-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>The trustees could apply for such an extension where paying out the pension credit would adversely affect the benefits of the generality of the members. If, for example, there were only four members and two of them were the employer and his spouse and she had been acting as the company secretary and that took out a huge chunk, that might deleteriously affect the other two members of the scheme who might be siblings or whatever.
</p>

<a name="40708-35_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>Clause 21(5) merely confirms that the freezing order itself does not prevent the trustees complying with the court order. To have a blanket prohibition would be unnecessarily limiting. The money need not be paid out, but if the trustees think that it can be done we should respect the court order and the parallel activity of matrimonial proceedings. With that rather abbreviated explanation, I hope that the Committee will accept what we are seeking to do. I beg to move.

However, if in so doing the scheme is heavily top-sliced of its resources so that other members, perhaps of a small family company, would be deleteriously affected, it could come within the framework of a freezing order. One can make the decision that the court order proceeds in the usual way. However, if that has a deleterious effect on other members of the scheme, it is caught in the freezing activity.

<p><a name="st_79"></a>The noble Lord said: I beg to move Amendment No. 87. Why not?
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="40708-36_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   That is a charming way to move an amendment. Giving the noble Lord the benefit of the doubt, I assume that he must think that the measure is so overwhelmingly reasonable that no explanation is needed, in which case I am surprised that he did not seek to persuade me of his case. Alternatively, he is so convinced of the amendment&#039;s weakness that he thinks that further exposing it would not benefit his cause. I do not know which of those two it is.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="40708-36_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I did not wish to delay the Committee longer than it ought to be delayed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="40708-36_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The way to do that is not to move the amendment at all rather than moving it and sitting down. I would like to know what concerns the noble Lord. I presumed, in my most courteous style, that I would have a full speech directed at me, and I am happy to give a reply. It may answer the points, and, if not, perhaps we can continue the discussion more conversationally.
</p>

<a name="40708-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>Clause 28 introduces the mechanism whereby the employer, trustees and the members are informed about any order made under the freezing provisions imposed on the scheme. We propose that the regulator informs the trustees or managers of the scheme and the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC192"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC192</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

employer as soon as is reasonably practicable of the effect of any orders made under the freezing provisions.
</p>

<a name="40708-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>This requirement is in addition to the obligation on the regulator to inform all directly affected parties of any order it makes under Clauses 90 and 92, whereby the regulator must send out either a warning notice or a determination notice to all directly affected parties.
</p>

<a name="40708-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>The amendment proposes extending the regulator&#039;s duty so that it informs the scheme actuary and the scheme auditor of a freezing order, irrespective of whether the order has a direct effect on their work and duties in relation to the scheme. The general duty to keep all advisers, which includes a wider class than auditors and actuaries, such as lawyers and administrators, informed of the circumstances of the scheme, should clearly rest with the trustees of the scheme as they have stewardship and responsibility for the freezing order and the scheme.
</p>

<a name="40708-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>If the freezing order directly affected the work and duties of either the scheme actuary or the scheme auditor, the regulator would already be under an obligation to inform them under Clause 90(2)(a), if the freezing order was made under the standard procedure, or Clause 92(2)(a), if made under the special procedure. We think, therefore, under those circumstances, where it affects their work, they will already be notified under the Bill. We therefore think that it is unnecessary and inappropriate to put this additional duty on the regulator in a more general way. I could go on, but I hope, on that basis, that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="40708-36_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I thought that my noble friend was right in moving this amendment very briefly, since its intention seemed pretty obvious. I did not quite catch the reference which the noble Baroness made to an earlier clause. I think it was Clause 90(2)(a).
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="40708-36_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Yes, it was Clauses 90(2)(a) and 92(2)(a), on page 63 of Volume I of the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="40708-36_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I think I have it. We are, to some extent, dealing with schemes which are not being properly organised with regard to both the company concerned and the trustees. As the noble Baroness pointed out earlier, in some small schemes, the division between those two sets of responsibilities may be somewhat vague. I see that she is indicating assent. As the regulator has to make these notifications as soon as reasonably practicable, I should have thought that he should also inform the auditor and the actuary, since they both have very important roles to play in the operation of a scheme of the kind which I have just described.
</p>

<a name="40708-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>I should have thought it was advantageous for the auditor and the actuary to be informed by the regulator the moment this kind of thing was being done&#151;otherwise the company or the trustees might not inform them for some while, or not at all. However, as the other clause makes the same <br>&nbsp;<br>

provision, as the noble Baroness said, the amendment would not be necessary. That the auditors and the actuary should be informed as soon as practicable seems an admirably simple amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="40708-36_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Could I suggest that the noble Lords, Lord Higgins and Lord Lucas, look at Clauses 90 and 92, which deal with situations in which the actuary has a need to know and should have a right to know? In those circumstances the auditors and actuaries would be directly affected and therefore notified. The noble Lord&#039;s amendment would imply that where they are not directly affected they would still be notified. We simply believe that that is unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="40708-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>If Members opposite feel that on reflection Clause 90&#151;and not Clause 92&#151;does not cover all the circumstances and care to write to me, I shall look at the matter again.
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="40708-36_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   Methinks the noble Lady doth protest too much here. I cannot for the life of me see how it would be inappropriate&#151;her word&#151;to tell the scheme auditor and the scheme actuary that this order was being carried out. Anyone who knows how things work, knows that that is palpable nonsense. It may be unnecessary but why be so pedantic about it? It is a perfectly reasonable thing to ask, and I cannot see any reason not to include it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="40708-36_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The provision is already covered by Clauses 92(2)(a) and 90(2)(a).
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="40708-36_spnew10"></a><b> Noble Lords: </b>   No, it is not.
</p>




<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="40708-36_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   With great respect, Clause 90(2)(a) states that,

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>It may not be auditors at all. That is for the regulator&#039;s judgment. He might decide something entirely different. So the matter is not covered.
</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>

I invite the noble Lord to write to me with the circumstance where that may be the case. As I said, if there are cases where it is in my view appropriate that they should be informed, which are not covered by Clauses 90 and 92, I shall be very happy to look at the matter again.
</p>

<a name="40708-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>So far no one has produced a single example, despite the noise from the other side, of where that might be the case. There may be a case; I do not know.

words unless they have a weight that strengthens the Bill which would otherwise be missing. That, I would suggest to the Committee, has not yet been established.
</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="40708-36_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   There is no need to write to the noble Baroness; we are making the point now. It is even quicker than sending an e-mail.
</p>

</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="40708-36_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I sought to give an example. The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, made the point that in Clause 90(2)(a) and so on, the matter is left to the discretion of the regulator. Surely it should be absolutely clear to the regulator not that he should decide whether or not to tell the auditor and the actuary, but whether he should be obliged to do so. They need to know, and for the reasons I gave by way of example earlier, they may not know or may not know in time. That is why it is more appropriate in this clause because of the term &quot;as soon as reasonably practical&quot; than it is at Clause 90.
</p>

<a name="40708-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>I would hope that the noble Baroness would not need a letter if she would just say that she will look at the issue between now and Report.

<p><a name="st_98"></a>
<a name="40708-37_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   This applies to a freezing order. Do noble Lords propose that the same should apply to all other clauses exercising this power by the regulator?
</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="40708-37_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   Write to us on this one.
</p>




<p><a name="st_100"></a>
<a name="40708-37_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The point is that the freezing order contains an array of powers for the regulator to deal with the trustees. Third party notices, improvement notices and restitution notices were to be inserted into the freezing order. I do not know; is it proposed that the same thing should apply to all of them? In which case, perhaps the Committee will decide under what circumstances that should be proposed.
</p>

<a name="40708-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>At the moment noble Lords have singled out only one power to be exercised by the regulator in which he must notify the scheme auditor and actuary. In a situation of such gravity where the issue is likely to be involved with a freezing order, it seems to me the matter is covered by Clauses 90 and 92. One could even argue that there may be a strong case for exercising powers other than the freezing order where Clauses 90 and 92 may not come into effect. As I say, I invite noble Lords opposite to write to me, and I will be perfectly happy if there seems to be a good case to consider the matter further. I have to say that I have not heard one from the evidence today.

I have sat down with the Society of Turnaround Professionals, R3, which is the Association of Business Recovery Professionals, and with the CBI to talk through the practical effects of what we are debating. The freezing order is a particularly key moment. There is a need for what I would describe, and have had described to me, as key professionals who, particularly in the case of actuaries, are often closely involved in the affairs of a scheme on a regular basis.
</p>

<a name="40708-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>They have made the point to me that this is a practical amendment which they believe is necessary to ensure that those involved in the affairs of a scheme on a regular basis are directly notified in a timely way.

<a name="40708-37_para2"></a>

</p>

<a name="40708-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>We debated freezing orders a little earlier, but there seems no doubt that they will be considered by the regulator only if he is concerned that there is a risk to members&#039; interests. Clause 20 states that a freezing order can be made if the regulator is satisfied that,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;it is necessary to make the freezing order in order to protect the interests of the generality of the members of the scheme&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="40708-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>The idea of Amendment No. 91 is to ensure that there are arrangements in the Bill which specify that there must be consultation before the orders are made. Indeed, as we know from our debates on Second Reading, the Government have been quite happy to arrange for consultation in various parts of the Bill&#151;with organisations representing membership interests, and so on&#151;and we applaud that.
</p>

<a name="40708-37_para8"></a>

I am sure that it is not right to allow the regulator to issue the freezing order off his own bat without consulting anyone. I certainly agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Turner. Surely it would be far better for the administration of pensions regulation if the regulator came clean and told scheme managers to get their house in order otherwise he will use his emergency powers. It cannot be such an emergency in many cases. I accept that that will sometimes be the case, but surely not always.
</p>




<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="40708-37_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has put his finger on the point. To reach the stage of a freezing order, the regulatory system must believe that the scheme is seriously at risk. It is our experience&#151;noble Lords will be aware of this&#151;that when a scheme is at risk there is sometimes a quick winding-up sale by directors who try to extract as much as they can, thus reducing the assets available for other members. Despite what the noble Lord has just said, freezing orders&#151;in particular under the special procedure whereby they can be invoked at great speed; that is, in as little as 24 hours&#151;can be absolutely essential if resources are not be lost by being spirited away to, say, Luxembourg, Lichtenstein or another offshore account. That is why speed is crucial here.
</p>

<a name="40708-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>We believe that freezing orders are very likely to be made under the special procedure set out in Clause 92 because it is often imperative that they are made quickly and can take immediate effect. For the most part they would be needed at the end of a long process rather than something applied to a scheme out of the blue. By that point we would be trying to ensure that the money is not lost to the fund. Where the special procedure is used, the regulator will undertake a compulsory review of the decision to make the order as soon as practicable under Clause 93. All directly affected parties will be able to make representations at that review, and the regulator will be able to vary, amend or revoke any order it has made. Further reference could then be made to the Pensions Regulator Tribunal under Clause 97.
</p>

<a name="40708-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>The freezing order is put in place first because speed is of the essence. Consultation is then undertaken, through to a right to appeal to the Determinations Panel and so forth subsequent to the order. If it is not done that way, and if it concerned a large scheme in which many members had to be notified, key assets could be lost. That is the point of the provision. We are not trying to exclude consultation but to make sure <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC197"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC197</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that, I am afraid, in special, emergency situations, consultation should follow rather than precede the freezing order, otherwise the order would lose a lot of its effectiveness.
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>
<a name="40708-37_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde: </b>   I hear what my noble friend says and it sounds entirely reasonable. Although I have not tabled an amendment, I am somewhat concerned about subsection (3) which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;The Regulator may by order direct the trustees . . .  to notify&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>(a) all the members of the scheme, or</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>(b) the members of the scheme specified in the order&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>At the moment there is no specific requirement for the regulator to direct the trustees to tell the members of the scheme. A freezing order could be drawn up without some of the employees knowing what had happened to their own investment, their pension fund. I think that the intention behind Amendment No. 89 was to bridge that gap, although I do not know.
</p>

<a name="40708-37_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>I understand the point about speed because the instances mentioned by my noble friend are not just hypothetical examples or anecdotal evidence; they are factual. Personally, I accept what my noble friend has said. However, it may be necessary to look again at subsection (3), which we have not done today. Perhaps we can return to it at a later stage.
</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="40708-37_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   My noble friend is absolutely right. The question to ask is: what is the point of a freezing order? The order activates a pause button by which we hope to keep a scheme solvent and afloat. But it really is inconceivable that the regulator could turn such a scheme around without consultation with the members, employers and trustees.
</p>

<a name="40708-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>Although the word used is &quot;may&quot;&#151;whether it should be &quot;must&quot; is a point that could be argued&#151;the scenario envisaged by my noble friend seems quite inconceivable. Both she and my other noble friend Lady Turner have recognised that speed is of the essence. There is no attempt to exclude consultation here, but it should follow the freezing order, which could then be revoked or amended as necessary, or a way through found so that the scheme does not wind up and then end up applying to the pension protection fund, but can be refloated, perhaps by considering different accrual rates or whatever may be appropriate. However, none of that can be done without the consent of all parties. Consultation will click in as soon as the order is reviewed.
</p>

<a name="40708-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>I think that this will work well, but if noble Lords want to query the wording, I shall be perfectly happy to look at it again.

Of course, we understand that this is essentially an emergency procedure and that it may be necessary to move very quickly in order to safeguard the assets for members. That, we understand.

without the members knowing that it was happening. Because of that, we want to look at this matter again to see whether it would be a good idea to return with our own wording&#151;perhaps relating to a different part of Clause 28&#151;in order to cover what we see as a lacuna in the Bill. We are concerned to ensure that members know what is going on, particularly if it involves something such as a freezing order, which is desperately important.

</p>




<p><a name="st_111"></a>The noble Lord said: Again, I am not sure whether the amendment is correctly drafted, but the whole point is that the draftsman has decided&#151;presumably on the department&#039;s policy grounds&#151;that any enactment or rule of law can be ignored for these purposes. That is such a draconian power that I believe the Minister should justify it with examples, and I invite her to do just that. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_112"></a>

But that would not make much sense either because this is a fairly common piece of drafting that is meant to cover any enactment or statutory rules of law, and common law rules or any rule of the scheme. I am sure that the Minister will have examples of precedents in the field, but unfortunately the amendment is not properly drafted and must be rejected on that ground.
</p>




<p><a name="st_113"></a>
<a name="40708-38_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Skelmersdale: </b>   I accept that, and of course the amendment will be rejected, whether we all agree with it or not, because we are in Grand Committee and the Minister has rather more power over us than usual. What I intended is clear. I am sure that the noble Baroness got the point because she was poised to answer my question and justify paragraph (a). I might have moved an amendment to leave out paragraph (a) in its entirety, and therefore I do not think that there is a problem. What worries me is that any piece of legislation can be disapplied for these purposes and I want to know why.
</p>




<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="40708-38_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   That is a perfectly legitimate point. I assure noble Lords that we are not talking about habeas corpus or anything of that kind. As my noble friend Lord Borrie said, when one freezes a scheme and switches on the pause button, one is creating an unusual situation in which trustees or managers may be prevented from carrying out their normal functions and duties, such as paying for benefits, making transfers or accepting contributions in respect of benefit accrual. However, in that situation it is essential that the freezing order can override normal procedural rules and conflicting legislative requirements so that the regulator can act quickly and effectively to protect the scheme members and their benefits. It is an override clause relating to the normal functions of trustees, laid down by statute and case <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC200</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and the Society of Turnaround Practitioners have warned that the consequences of the clauses will be to reduce the number of company business rescues.
</p>

<a name="40708-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>Although I acknowledge and pay tribute to the Minister for the extent of the consultation that has taken place on most aspects of the Bill, I understand that the bodies I have mentioned, together with some others, have not yet had the opportunity to make their views known on the clauses&#151;hence the importance of the debate.
</p>

<a name="40708-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>The clauses are in direct conflict with the guiding principle behind the Enterprise Act 2002, which the Government enacted in order to promote and encourage business and company rescues. Several noble Lords present today participated in the debates on the Enterprise Bill. We welcomed the ability to try to turn round potentially successful businesses that were in a period of difficulty. My amendment, which is the first in a series, deals with the issue of potential personal liability for insolvency practitioners and turnaround professionals.
</p>

<a name="40708-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>The clauses dealing with contribution notices could, in the view of the professionals, impose large and uncertain liabilities on those who take on insolvency appointments or advise on turnarounds. That will almost certainly deter insolvency professionals from taking up appointments relating to troubled companies, thus depriving those companies of the opportunity to enter a formal rescue through the administration procedure or to undergo restructuring with a turnaround professional.
</p>

<a name="40708-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>The unfortunate and, I am sure, unintended consequence of the clause would be fewer rescues and more company liquidations. As I said, it would be particularly regrettable if the clauses dealing with contribution notices were to undermine the good atmosphere induced by the Enterprise Act 2002.
</p>

<a name="40708-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>This amendment seeks to exclude insolvency practitioners from being landed with a contribution notice. It is surely not right for insolvency practitioners and their associates to be potentially personally liable for actions taken in good faith, pursuant to the aims of the Enterprise Act 2002. I therefore seek to insert, on page 23, line 41, the words:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;A contribution notice may not be served on a person, or parties connected or associated with him who are not otherwise connected with the employer, who is acting as an insolvency practitioner in relation to a company or individual as defined in section 388 of the Insolvency Act 1986 . . .  (meaning of &#039;act as insolvency practitioner&#039;) without leave of the court&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>I should like to explain further. Effectively, an insolvency practitioner holding office such as that of administrator is comparable to a director. The insolvency practitioner will act in accordance with statute for the insolvency process being undergone. In the course of an administration, the insolvency practitioner&#039;s first purpose is to save the company or rescue the business.
</p>

<a name="40708-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>To achieve that goal, an insolvency practitioner may take a number of steps, including the following: selling surplus assets or income-generating assets; selling subsidiaries which may be income-generating; to effect a compromise with some or all creditors; and to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC201"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC201</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

request that any scheme be wound up. Each of these may prevent the recovery of the whole or any part of a deficit.
</p>

<a name="40708-38_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>The effect of this group of clauses on an administration will be to make the rescue of a company in financial difficulties much more difficult. Why do I say that? First, where the troubled company is to be sold, the bidders are likely to discount the sale price for the uncertainty surrounding the contingent liability associated with acquiring the pension scheme, or may simply not bid at all. This drives the insolvency process towards a fire sale of assets which surely conflicts with and undermines the primary purpose of the Enterprise Act.
</p>

<a name="40708-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>Secondly, where a company wishes to enter administration to achieve a restructuring, the insolvency practitioner will be a party to the act of entering administration as he is appointed and must consent to the appointment. However, entering administration will potentially prevent the recovery of part or all of the deficit. There is therefore a contingent risk that the administrator personally will become liable for the deficit. This cannot be the intention of the legislation. I look forward to hearing from the Minister on that point in particular. The effect will be that administration will become less favoured for companies with defined benefit schemes. The alternative will be liquidation, which would result in fewer companies being rescued.
</p>

<a name="40708-38_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>Turnaround professionals are not quite in the same position of personal liability as insolvency practitioners who take formal appointments as administrators. Nevertheless, they face unwelcome and surely unintended exposure under the Bill. The restructuring process is likely to be affected in the following way: first, the definition of &quot;connected&quot; and &quot;associated&quot; is so wide that the technique of debt-for-equity swaps will become more difficult to use as creditors seek to avoid being put in the position where they may become owners of more than one-third of voting equity, at which time they become connected for the purpose of these clauses.
</p>

<a name="40708-38_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>Secondly, disposal of assets and subsidiaries will become more difficult, as not only will buyers discount their price because of the uncertainty of a contingent pension liability, but also the disposal may be considered to be an act which reduces the recovery to the pension scheme. It is unlikely that this would be the primary purpose of the disposal, but it would be likely to be an inevitable outcome.
</p>

<a name="40708-38_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>Thirdly, the use of CVAs or Section 425 schemes outside an administration will be less easy because the pension protection fund will not be bound unless it consents, effectively giving it a &quot;super priority&quot; and an advantage over other creditors. It is common, so I am advised, that in restructuring and turnaround scenarios a restructuring practitioner will take appointment as a director in order to drive through the necessary corporate changes.
</p>

<a name="40708-38_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>As drafted, these clauses would expose turnaround directors to exactly the same likelihood and extent of liability as the pre-existing directors. Therefore, the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC202"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC202</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

likely effect of all these factors will be to reduce the desire of insolvency practitioners and restructuring turnaround professionals to serve. That will, in turn, surely discourage corporate rescue both inside and outside an insolvency process, the net result of which will be fewer rescues and more liquidations.
</p>

<a name="40708-38_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>The imposition, or even the possibility of the imposition, of a substantial liability on professionals who are endeavouring to rescue any company for the benefit of its stakeholders surely will not assist the Minister and her colleagues in government in achieving the stated aim for an entrepreneurial culture. I beg to move.

<a name="40708-39_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   We have a whole series of amendments. At some point, it may be appropriate to have the bigger debate about what we call the &quot;moral hazard&quot; issues. I may be able to give a very brief response to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. He may not consider it appropriate to have that debate on this amendment as it is towards the edge of some of the issues. I am in the Committee&#039;s hands on that matter.
</p>

<a name="40708-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>As the noble Lord surmised, it is, of course, not our intention to frustrate the purpose of the Enterprise Act. That is why we have worked with the Treasury, the DTI and the Insolvency Service. We have listened, and are continuing to listen, to groups such as R3, which the noble Lord mentioned. It has written to us and we have asked it to be part of the group working with us over the summer. As I say, the DTI and the Insolvency Service have been involved throughout.
</p>

<a name="40708-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>Of course, once an insolvency practitioner is involved, there is likely to be an assessment period for the scheme. That means that the scheme trustees are preparing the scheme for the possibility that the PPF board may be required to take responsibility for it. The board would have assumed the rights and powers of the scheme trustees to act as the creditor of the employer in relation to the debt.

</p>

<a name="40708-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>In the event that the action is by an insolvency practitioner appointed in relation to an associated or connected party to the employer&#151;we may debate that later&#151;the regulator would first have to consider whether the action had as one of its main purposes avoiding any pension liabilities rather than maximising the return for all creditors. The regulator would then have to consider whether it was reasonable to issue a contribution notice.

</p>

<a name="40708-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>I am sympathetic to the amendment. There is a point here with which we wish to engage. It is one of the many areas that we shall be looking at over the summer to see how we can allay the concerns of insolvency practitioners. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said, there was no intention to &quot;collar&quot; them under possible scenarios in the way that he feared. I hope that with that brief reply I can re-engage in the bigger debate on moral hazard on a subsequent amendment.

outside and, I think, inside the House that the provisions of Clauses 35 to 45 create very real problems.

However, the clauses that we are now debating raise very real problems. My noble friend Lord Hunt of Wirral dealt with a very specific point. The noble Baroness queried at what stage we should discuss more generally the points that were made at Second Reading about moral hazard.


</p>

<a name="40708-39_para5"></a>

<a name="40708-39_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde: </b>   Before we move on, I agree with much of what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. But as I listened I became somewhat concerned that, within all he has said, we are being asked to consider the possibility of ring-fencing the contributions that have not been handed over and not have them form part of the solvency of the company. If that were part of the intention, I would have difficulties with it.
</p>

<a name="40708-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>I understand the point about personal liability and therefore making the company more attractive in order to be moved on. That is all right, but if the full burden of the debt of pension contributions not handed over is not met, members are left with the pension protection fund. That would be wrong because other companies would be subsidising those which have not paid their contributions. I enter that caveat, but obviously I look forward to the wider debate.

<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="40708-39_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   I also agree and I look forward to the general debate that is to be held shortly. However, I have one question to put to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. I understand many of his points about personal responsibility for insolvency practitioners and so on, but the implication of his amendment is that it is always in the interests of stakeholders, as he puts it, that a company should not be wound up, but should be rescued. However, that is not always the case. I did not hear him mention the interests of the pensioners. Situations arise where very few members of the pension scheme are still actually working in the company, and they too must be taken into account.

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>I understand what the noble Lord means by the term &quot;insolvency practitioners&quot;, but the term &quot;turnaround directors&quot; is a little more vague. Some of these rescue situations can go on for many years.

<a name="40708-39_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   In briefly adding to this debate, I want to say three things. First, I shall not move my Amendment No. 95A because it has been covered by this debate. Secondly, one of the objectives of people undertaking restructurings is to avoid pension fund liabilities because they are likely to be very large. We shall have to face this matter head on and deal with the way that these liabilities are to be weighed against all the other liabilities of the company. The balance must be struck. To get that set out in a clear and understandable way has to be a key objective, although I agree that that will be a hard debate. Thirdly, will one of the sub-committees of the Institute of Chartered Accountants be part of the consultation to be held over the summer?
</p>




<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="40708-39_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   Yes, if it wants to participate, the institute certainly can be part of the consultation. We would be happy to take that on board.

<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="40708-39_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   First, I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay, that I was very careful in my use of words to refer to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;those professionals who are endeavouring to rescue any company for the benefit of its stakeholders&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>&quot;Stakeholders&quot; is a very good word, one that has been used on all sides. Everyone understands what it means. It is an inclusive term that includes the interests referred to by the noble Lord as well as the interests of a number of other key individuals.
</p>

<a name="40708-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>Perhaps I may say to the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, that while I take on board the point she made, we have to find some way around this, and I look forward to the debate as we explore it. My amendment seeks to ensure that a contribution notice should not be served,

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;without leave of the court&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>so that, through the whole process, someone, somewhere starts to think about ways in which the rescue can proceed without the liquidation.
</p>

<a name="40708-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>I look forward to the debate. I understand the concerns about ring-fencing. I think that my noble friend Lord Higgins slightly gerrymandered the prose. So, it is the road to heaven that is paved with good intentions. I am not too sure because I thought it was the other place.

<a name="40708-40_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Higgins </b>   moved Amendment No. 93:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>Page 24, line 1, after &quot;was&quot; insert &quot;during the five year period ending on the date when he issues the notice,&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>The noble Lord said: In the discussion a few moments ago I was not clear with the reference to hell or heaven whether the Committee was or was not purgatory; certainly we are being stewed rather than roasted. However, it is no doubt a great deal worse in the Moses Room, so we have that to be thankful for.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>The Minister has implied that perhaps a more general discussion might be appropriate, and especially so since this is one of the few amendments to attract support from all parts of the Committee.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>Clauses 35 to 45 raise very difficult questions. We are all agreed on the intention to protect pensioners&#039; assets and ensure that they are not deprived in their retirement of their reasonable expectations. We have been flooded with a great many representations about the effects of those clauses from highly reputable institutions&#151;the CBI, SBIs and almost every professional body one can think of.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>The list of possible unintended effects of these clauses is formidable. It includes their being likely to deter inward investment into the United Kingdom because overseas companies are not likely to undertake&#151;particularly if they are investing in a UK subsidiary&#151;the kind of dangers implied in some of the provisions of the Bill. As my noble friend Lord Hunt of Wirral has just pointed out, the provision will deter those normally involved in rescuing companies in trouble and enabling such companies to survive with all the implications for employment, economic growth and so on.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC206"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC206</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40708-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>Moreover, the provision will make some investors, as they currently stand in the Bill, liable in respect of companies over which they do not exert control. That is a real problem. It creates uncertainty about individual and commercial companies&#039; responsibilities; according to many outside, it undermines the concept of limited liability, which is the foundation of many of our business enterprises; and, more particularly, together with the operation of the levy, it deters companies from continuing, and certainly from setting up, defined benefit schemes when I think we would all agree that that is the best form of pension provision if it can be achieved. Therefore, we must try to address all those dangers, but that will not be easy to do while still achieving our own objective.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>Here in Grand Committee we are not going to vote on any of the issues. However, we, together with the outside interests, must all give very careful thought to the way in which we can improve the provisions of the Bill in order to avoid the kind of dangers to which I have referred.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>There are further problems as regards retrospection and human rights provision. That effectively brings me to the main point of the amendments that we are discussing. The basic issue throughout has been one of moral hazard. At Second Reading, we discussed whether, if the pension protection fund is levied on companies with final salary schemes generally, some companies may decide to put the burden of their pension liabilities on the fund rather than pay up themselves. Further problems also arise as to whether the company is solvent or not solvent, and so on&#151;a similar point to the one just made by my noble friend Lord Hunt of Wirral. Therefore, this will be a fairly difficult and challenging task, but I am sure that we all wish to work together to make it work.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>The amendments that we are discussing are basically concerned with retrospection. It is suggested in the amendments that retrospection should not go too far back&#151;that is, the regulator&#039;s power to investigate past actions should be limited to acts or failures to act that occurred no more than a stated period of time earlier.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>I understand that a similar concept already exists in relation to insolvency law and the law of limitation. It is suggested, for example, that we should have a maximum look-back period of three years. That would mean that anyone purchasing or investing in a company would be clear about the period over which he had to look back in order to ensure that he knew what he was taking on. He would also know that, after the period had elapsed, his company would be liable to receive a contribution notice only in respect of actions or inactions which occurred in that period as well as in the period during which he was in ownership.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>It has been put to me that the retrospective extent of Clause 35, which we are now debating, is probably in breach of Article 1 of the First Protocol of Part 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which concerns the protection of property. The noble Baroness has signed up to say that the Bill is in conformity with the convention. On previous occasions I have sought to establish who advises <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC207"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC207</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Ministers on whether legislation is or is not in conformity. Is it the Foreign Office or departmental lawyers or is it based on the Minister&#039;s own expertise? We have never really got to the bottom of that.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>The article was considered by the European Court of Human Rights in the case of <i>National and Provincial Building Society and Others</i> v <i>United Kingdom.</i> That case was concerned with the retrospective introduction of legislation to close a loophole. The court found that, on that basis, the applicants had been aware of the Government&#039;s intentions.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>The specific problem that then arises&#151;I am sorry that this is such a narrow debate but it is an important point&#151;is whether the Government can show that they have announced their intention to introduce legislation in the form of Clauses 35 to 38 at any time before 27 April 2004. I doubt that they can do so. On that date Mr Wicks suggested that a clear warning was given by Andrew Smith on 11 June 2003. I think that is a very doubtful proposition. In fact, the press release of June 2003 gave no such warning and did not specifically deal with the question of whether people were adequately informed.
<a name="time_5"></a>
<a name="40708-40_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="40708-40_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>Clearly, we shall need to take that aspect of the matter carefully into account in deciding how retrospective the legislation is going to be. The Minister herself has assured us that it will not contravene the human rights convention. I shall not go into greater detail. That is essentially the point that I wished to make regarding the leading case to which I referred.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>The Government ought to consider that if they insist upon retrospection to 11 June 2003&#151;I base that on Mr Andrew Smith&#039;s comments&#151;the courts may be forced to construe Clause 35 very narrowly even in relation to future Acts, so the effects of the clause would not be what the Government intend.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>This whole retrospection proposition is a difficult one. When I was a Treasury Minister I was given a brief by my department which stated,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;This is a drafting amendment&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>The following day I was besieged by lawyers who pointed out that I had criminalised a considerable number of people retrospectively. There is a distinction here between criminal and civil proceedings. I am not clear about that. Perhaps the noble Baroness will clarify whether the clauses with retrospective effect would bite in terms of criminal proceedings. I refer to fraud in that regard. I do not believe that Parliament has ever legislated to criminalise people retrospectively.
</p>




<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="40708-40_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   It is a civil matter.
</p>




<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="40708-40_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   It is purely civil. I am reassured by that. We need to be very careful where the line is drawn on this matter. The amendments that we have tabled seek to establish that. We shall be interested to hear the Minister&#039;s response regarding how retrospective the provision ought to be. One could simply say that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC208"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC208</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the retrospectivity applies from the date the Bill is enacted, but perhaps that is going too far. As I have said on previous occasions, the television does not show whether officials are nodding. However, we can see that they are not in favour of that proposition. One can almost see a ventriloquist effect appearing, if I can put it that way. However, I am sure that the noble Baroness understands these points extremely well and that their attitudes will be consistent.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>These are difficult issues. I say once again that if we are to implement this Bill and achieve the objectives we want, we shall need to deal with these specific issues very carefully indeed; otherwise, some of the dangers that I enumerated earlier will result in the game not being worth the candle. I am constantly using clich&#233;s this evening. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_142"></a>
<a name="40708-40_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   I shall start by discussing the specifics of this amendment and then give a little detail on our general approach to these clauses. First, we are happy to support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. Indeed, we both received the text from the National Association of Pension Funds and tabled the amendment independently. Clearly, we are very happy to co-operate on this topic. Without going into the details of retrospection on which the noble Lord is much more expert than I, it seems to us that a five-year period is a reasonable one in which the measure should apply. It is, as it happens, the period adopted in the United States as regards the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. We believe that a five-year period is fair enough.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>To speak more generally, this is one of the two most critical parts of the Bill. We understand all the concerns that are incorporated in the amendments standing in the   names of the noble Lords, Lord Higgins and Lord   Skelmersdale. Equally, we have been discussing with the City, the venture capital industry and other relevant people their concerns. We have to strike a fine balance. We believe that we understand these concerns but that the balance has to be a little more towards protecting the pension fund side and a little less towards making life as easy as possible for the venture capitalists in particular.

</p>

<a name="40708-40_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>The very act of taking quoted companies private has been a big part of the American scene for the past few years. It is also very important in this country, as we see in the current attempt by Mr Green&#151;or Mrs Green, because Mr Green lives in Monaco&#151;to take over Marks & Spencer. It clearly shows the big change in risk that you get for a pension fund if a substantial quoted company with a very strong balance sheet suddenly goes private and is heavily geared.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>There is not just the risk that the company may get into difficulties. By its nature, when a company structure changes and most of the equity is taken out of a big company, the pension fund trustees will automatically have to change their investment policy straightaway. Any normal trustee would have to move to a much more cautious policy. That means straightaway that there is an extra burden on the pension fund.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC209"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC209</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40708-40_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>That is why it is perfectly proper, in our view, that the trustees of WH Smith and Marks & Spencer are taking a very robust attitude on that. We need to be very conscious of such risks for pension funds. This is a pensions Bill; it is not simply a Bill to ensure that the City runs smoothly. Of course, as I said on Second Reading, it is vital that the market in small companies&#039; corporate recovery, and so on, does not seize up.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>We believe that it is not right to take directors as far away from liability and as far down the chain of liability as is suggested in the amendments to Clause 35, which we shall discuss in more detail later. We have seen in America and, to some extent, in this country, not asset strippers so much as liability strippers. If you look at the PBGC and the great bulk of the liabilities there, which would be the same in the PPF, they are from airline, steel and chemical companies. People have come in, completely changed the structure, sold off the profitable businesses and left the liabilities&#151;in some cases, the environmental liabilities&#151;in the pot. That is the danger that we would have here, and we are very conscious of it.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>Finally, the venture capital industry told me that because of its concerns, it had what it described as a very encouraging meeting with the Treasury about a fortnight ago. It came away from that meeting with the distinct impression that the Government would be tabling a number of amendments to these provisions, but we have seen no sign of them. That is a great disappointment to the venture capital industry. Wherever we think the balance should be struck, we all agree that it is vital that all the players&#151;the investors, and so on&#151;know exactly where they stand. I am bound to say that they certainly do not know where they stand on this.
</p>

<a name="40708-40_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>I do not know whether people from the DWP were at the meeting, but we would be very interested to know how that impression was given, and whether, and at what stage, further government amendments may be brought forward. We have tabled some amendments to this part of the Bill but have held off tabling more because we had reason to believe that the Government would be bringing forward their own amendments, which we would be very interested to see. Those are my questions for the Minister.

<a name="40708-41_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Turner of Camden: </b>   I listened with interest to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, moving the amendment. As we have said on numerous occasions, this is a matter of striking the right balance. One of the problems experienced by most people who have looked after the interests of scheme members is how often it is found that contributions have not been collected and have not been paid. This appears to be an attempt to make it very clear that the regulator will intervene in such situations.
</p>

<a name="40708-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>The clause is absolutely clear. The regulator will intervene only if he is,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;the employer in relation to the scheme . . .  a person connected with, or an associate of, the employer, and the Regulator is of the opinion that it is reasonable to impose liability on the person to pay the sum specified in the notice&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>That is extremely clear, and certainly more so than the wording used in the amendment before the Grand Committee. The issue of contributions to schemes is touchy and difficult and these are very important clauses in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="40708-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>I am still a member of the council of OPAS. We had people writing to us complaining that contributions had been collected from them, but they were never paid over. That is very important.

<a name="40708-41_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   I am very happy to pause for a moment, in the manner of a freezing order, to discuss some of the broader issues. But before we do so I want to respond to the very interesting speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, about what he referred to as the Treasury meeting with venture capitalists, much of which I agreed with. It was in fact a Department for Work and Pensions meeting chaired by one of the senior officials here today. She assures me that HMT was indeed present and that the department was pressed for amendments. No commitments were given on that front. But obviously, where it seems to me that a case has been well argued, we shall consider it sympathetically and see to what extent our legislation may need clarification to make our intentions clear. I   cite, for example, the point about insolvency practitioners. It is completely clear to us that they should not be caught by the provisions, but if it needs to be clarified, we shall be happy to do that.
</p>

<a name="40708-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>That is the context in which I shall respond. However, before I return to the specific amendment concerning the five-year point with which I should like to finish, it may be sensible to spend a moment covering the context in which we are operating here, to which noble Lords have already alluded.
</p>

<a name="40708-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>Clause 35 is the first of four clauses to introduce a power for the Pensions Regulator to issue contribution notices which, together with the power to issue financial support directions, are designed not only to protect scheme members, but also to protect against moral hazard. Over and above collecting contributions, the contribution notice will in fact seek to make good the deficit.
</p>

<a name="40708-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>We all know that &quot;moral hazard&quot; is the risk that because the Pensions Protection Fund will compensate scheme members if the employer has become insolvent and the scheme is underfunded, and because of the new full buy-out debt on wind-up provisions introduced by   this Government, employers could deliberately manipulate their affairs so as to slough off the responsibility for full wind-up and instead shift their pension scheme deficits to the PPF. That is the dilemma we all face, and I do not think that there is any dispute about that.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>The effect of employers avoiding their liabilities in this way would be that other, responsible employers may face higher levy contributions, because they are the companies that will fund the PPF. It also puts members&#039; benefits at risk because, as noble Lords know, under the scheme the PPF provides members with only a 90 per cent level of compensation, capped at &#163;25,000. If we strike the wrong balance, the losers here will be the members of the scheme along with members of other schemes that are well funded and meet their liabilities, but will have to pick up this bill.

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>So it is not just a two-way dialogue between a particular company, wanting for the sake of its entrepreneurial survival to merge with or to acquire another company; a wider stakeholder&#151;an overused word&#151;or a wider constituency is involved here that I am sure we all recognise.
</p>

<a name="40708-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>The protection of pension scheme members and employers who make occupational pension schemes possible has always been recognised by this Government as the nettle that has to be grasped, once the PPF is introduced. These clauses were introduced in Committee. I know that there has been debate about the detail, but the principle has been widely accepted. Mr Willetts again said on 18 May 2004:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;we do understand the need to protect the PPF from exploitation and abuse&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 18/5/04; col. 902.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>Noble Lords may have noted that some people do not believe that the clauses go far enough. Mr Webb considered that the clauses might not cover every eventuality and said in the same debate:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;ingenious employers, accountants and&#151;dare I say it?&#151;even actuaries&quot;&#151;</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>with respect to Members opposite&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;might think of new ways of circumventing the Government&#039;s intentions . . .  However, there should be a presumption that artificial activities, the principal or sole aim of which is to make an unnecessary claim on the PPF should be prohibited in general, rather than being prohibited individually, as there will always be   others that we have not thought of&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 18/5/04; cols. 903 and 904.]</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="40708-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>On 28 May, some of the consulting companies, for example Mercer, generally agreed that the moral hazard clauses are necessary if the PPF levy cost is to be kept anywhere near the Government&#039;s target of &#163;300 million. Without these clauses, sponsors of DB schemes could face far higher costs&#151;PriceWaterhouseCoopers and so on.
</p>

<a name="40708-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>There is broad consent that we have to protect the PPF from artificial manipulation by which companies, so to speak, dump the pension liabilities on the weakest company in a group that they may have acquired, in turn, to offload it to the PPF. The question is how we get the balance right and distinguish between the kind of acquisition and merger <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC212"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC212</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that takes place in good faith and legitimately so that a company, which may otherwise close, is kept going to everyone&#039;s benefit, from those devices that are artificial and seek merely to manipulate in order to dump liabilities while taking the assets on their merry way. That is the issue that we seek to address.
</p>

<a name="40708-41_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>Section 75 debt falls on the employer in relation to the scheme for the purposes of Section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995, particularly where that employer is part of a company group. There are a number of ways in which that route can ensure that before the scheme is wound up, the sponsoring employer becomes insolvent and a Section 75 debt is triggered. The company that is the employer in relation to the scheme is then put in a position where it cannot afford to pay the debt and eventually it ends up with the PPF. Even if the rest of the company group is fully solvent, the trustees cannot recover the debt from any other companies in the group, and scheme members will be left with what may be a very badly funded scheme.
</p>

<a name="40708-41_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>The actions that can be taken by company groups could include withdrawing funding for the employer company, selling off its assets, paying a large dividend to strip out any assets in the company, or transferring the employees to another company, such as a service company&#151;we shall come to a specific amendment later on that&#151;which then becomes the employer in relation to the scheme and which has never traded or had any assets to speak of and therefore any capacity to meet the liabilities. Such actions could occur just before the winding up of the scheme or the insolvency of the sponsoring employer, or well in advance, with a view to disguising the purpose of the action.
</p>

<a name="40708-41_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>I emphasise that we recognise that most company transactions and restructurings take place for perfectly legitimate business reasons, and may well be highly desirable; for example, company rescues. The Government introduced the Enterprise Act 2002 to support those rescues.

</p>

<a name="40708-41_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>Through the current pensions regulator, OPRA, we know that some company restructures or transactions have a main purpose of avoiding pension liabilities. We are determined to stop that. There are other means for employers to avoid their liabilities with or without the collusion of a scheme&#039;s trustees. The employer may take action artificially to increase the assets of the scheme at the time when the debt was to be calculated, so that the debt to be paid is lower. It could include persuading the trustees to buy an asset and place a higher value on it than it was really worth&#151;such as land&#151;or a derivative, designed to increase dramatically in value in the short term but which will fall later.
</p>

<a name="40708-41_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>These clauses, therefore, give the Pensions Regulator the power to require that a contribution is made into a pension scheme, where there is an act or a deliberate failure to act, the main purpose of which was to prevent the recovery of whole or part of the Section 75 debt that would keep the pension scheme viable. These clauses will be operated and enforced by the Pensions Regulator in the context of meeting his objectives.

<a name="40708-41_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>I can specify the reasonable nature of the regulator&#039;s powers. He can do so only if it is reasonable. It touches, for example, on good faith issues, which no doubt we shall discuss later. It includes the degree of involvement of that person in the act of failure. There is an emphasis on the relationship that the person has. I could go into all those points in much greater detail, and later it may be right to do so.
</p>

<a name="40708-41_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>That is the dilemma we face. It is clear that in some cases there is deliberate manipulation&#151;as OPRA reports, it has already started&#151;to avoid doing what we all hope will be respected in a merger and an acquisition, which is that best efforts are made to keep a good scheme afloat and to meet the liabilities consequential on it. How we get that balance will be covered in some of the things that we shall go on to discuss.
</p>

<a name="40708-41_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>Finally, I turn to the point about the five-year retrospection. As I say, later we shall come to some of the other detailed points about good faith and so on. The amendments to Clause 35 seek to restrict the period within which the regulator can look at actions or failures to act, one of the main purposes of which may have been to avoid pension liabilities and to remove the limited retrospection that the Bill proposes.
</p>

<a name="40708-41_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>Amendment No. 93 is a backstop to the period of time at which the regulator can look, which is one of the key points that BVCA, the CBI and others have raised with us in recent weeks. It is a point that we are considering carefully for those groups. I suggest to the Committee that we return to this matter on Report and when we can consider more fully whether a time limit&#151;and what time limit&#151;would be appropriately introduced to the clause. I accept that companies need some degree of certainty; I accept that we must also have an eye on the practicability of how far back one can dig.
</p>

<a name="40708-41_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>I am genuinely open-minded as to whether this is the right way forward. I am perfectly willing to be persuaded by this. As a result, I ask the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, to withdraw the amendment at this stage. Discussions will be ongoing over the summer with the organisations that we have mentioned. We all want to get the balance right. There is no dissent anywhere in this room. On whether we have it precisely right I am open to be persuaded that we may need to make adjustments. That may mean that compensating adjustments need to be made elsewhere to ensure that we protect the situation.
</p>

<a name="40708-41_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>Let us explore the matter further. We certainly have not come to the end of the discussions yet. In the context of being genuinely open to listening to the arguments and to being persuaded on this matter, I ask the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, to withdraw the amendment and to return to the matter, if appropriate, on Report.

<a name="40708-42_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I am grateful for that response. Of course, I agree with much of what the noble Baroness has said. I am rather doubtful about her proposition <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC214"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC214</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that actuaries come up with new ideas. In my experience, they are typically at least 20 years behind the times. I agree that when they do come up with ideas, it is often extremely dangerous, so we must be aware of that.
</p>

<a name="40708-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>The noble Baroness has been forthcoming. I entirely agree with her that there are real dangers, for example, with overseas companies. Indeed, a famous Japanese bank appears to have been in danger of reneging on its UK pension contributions. We need to take into account the international aspect of this matter.
</p>

<a name="40708-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>The noble Baroness did not reply&#151;I shall not now ask her to reply in detail&#151;to the point I made about the human rights clause. We do not want to legislate on Clause 35 as regards the retrospective effect, and then find that it is overturned by the courts in this country or by the European Court of Human Rights. It seems to be the case that for it not to be overturned, the terms of the statute would have to be clear at the time of the announcement. My understanding is that such clarity did not exist in this instance before 27 April 2004.
</p>

<a name="40708-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>At the moment, it does not matter enormously how far back one goes because eventually the matter shuffles forward and is covered anyway. I agree that there is a real danger of pre-emptive strikes by some companies that wish to renege. In particular, they will find that the provisions under Part 6, which the Government introduced in some panic, are not likely to be as favourable as those under the PPF. Therefore, despite Part 6, they will tend to try to get out now rather than delay and find that they are unable to renege on their responsibilities.
</p>

<a name="40708-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>Between now and Report stage, I hope that the noble Baroness will consider the retrospective angle, despite what I have just said, because we do not want the matter to be overturned by the courts. We are all working together on the broad point that she makes. I hope that before Report stage the Government will come forward on each of the matters that we are discussing with their own amendments. That is important. We shall try to take advice outside. However, the resources of the noble Baroness are rather greater than mine and probably even than those of the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, or even those of the noble Baroness, Lady Dean.
</p>

<a name="40708-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>It is appropriate that between now and Report stage the Government take some time&#151;we shall all be working in September, of course&#151;to come up with a clear answer. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment. The later amendments that we have degrouped will enable us to focus on particular points that I hope we can deal with relatively quickly.

&quot;(d)   the Regulator has not issued a clearance notice in relation to the act or deliberate failure to act&quot;

<p><a name="st_149"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 95 is grouped with Amendments Nos. 100 and 169. This is a fairly straightforward amendment compared with some of the others. It suggests that there is a case for the regulator to issue what is called a clearance notice so that a company can say through the regulator, &quot;I am proposing to do this, do you agree that it is okay?&quot; It is set out in very simple terms.
</p>

<a name="40708-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>In the course of earlier debates, the Government indicated that they will look favourably on an amendment to bring in a clearance procedure. At Second Reading, the noble Baroness, on behalf of the Government, said that the regulator would be able to issue a contribution notice under Clause 35 only where an act or failure to act was deliberate and designed to avoid pension liabilities and that the regulator would be able to issue financial support directions only in prescribed circumstances. I shall not burden the Committee with the exact quotation.
</p>

<a name="40708-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>It appears to achieve our objectives and does not undermine the principle of the Bill if the regulator is able to deal with matters in that way. Perhaps there is a clear need for such a clearance procedure in addition to a code of practice, to which reference is made. Taking the two together, I believe that they would ensure that the system worked more smoothly than otherwise. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="40708-42_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Wirral: </b>   I strongly support my noble friend Lord Higgins. When the Government first issued the moral hazard clauses, a considerable amount of concern was expressed by a range of organisations that the effect would be that corporate transactions would come to a standstill. There was widespread press comment.
</p>

<a name="40708-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>What worried me more was a comment by some very informed individuals, such as the chief actuary of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Trevor Llanwarne (I have pronounced that both with and without a Welsh accent). He drew attention to something on which my noble friend Lord Higgins may be better informed than me, although I have asked the Library to let me know the procedure that is adopted. Apparently, a green light procedure is undertaken in the United States. It is similar to that proposed by my noble friend. It enables those wishing to undertake transactions to receive some kind of certainty as to whether there will be any problem for them under the moral hazard clauses. It is a kind of green light procedure that ensures that proposed legitimate business transactions will not fall foul of these clauses.
</p>

<a name="40708-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>The chief actuary said that he had a four-point plan, which apparently has been put to the Minister and to her colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions. First, it is very much along the lines of the amendment moved by my noble friend that a clearance procedure should be introduced; and, secondly, that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC216"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC216</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

there should be some changes in the wording of some of the clauses to provide a clearer and more complete framework against which to judge potential abuse.

</p>

<a name="40708-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>I believe that there is agreement on all sides that we want to stop abuse. It is important to have laws that can be readily understood, although I am not sure that simplicity is something known to parliamentary draftsmen who have to operate against a background of complex, existing legislation. If there are some wording changes&#151;I understand that PricewaterhouseCoopers has suggested some&#151;I believe that they should be adopted.
</p>

<a name="40708-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>There is also a request that some examples should be given by the department about the intent of the clauses. That would be enormously helpful.

<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="40708-42_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   On the specifics, PricewaterhouseCoopers has been in contact with us after reading our debate in <i>Hansard</i> and we are indeed working with the company on the issues. The amendments seek to introduce a clearance system. I sympathise entirely with noble Lords&#039; desire to ensure that there is a clearance procedure. We discussed this on 10 June. Those involved in corporate restructuring and transactions will be able to seek clearance from the regulator in advance. In local authority terms, it is like a kind of planning permission. It gets one over the   problem of building control, but one still needs planning permission first. I guess, that is the role.
</p>

<a name="40708-42_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>I can also confirm that the regulator will publish guidance on how the scheme will work. That will ensure that responsible companies will be able to continue to trade and restructure as usual. I will also follow up the suggestion that the department may want to publish further clarification of the intent on this to allay fears. The only difference between us is probably whether it needs to be on the face of the Bill. We do not propose to legislate. By the time we end up with the words necessary for precision we may tie the regulator&#039;s hands and restrict the flexibility.
</p>

<a name="40708-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>Given the discussion today and the meetings that we are holding, there is no doubt that there will be a clearance procedure; how it will operate will be published in guidance by the regulator. We are happy to have not only further discussions but also further clarification over the summer. I hope we shall ensure that everyone feels comfortable with the way in which we propose to proceed.

(   )   the Regulator is of the opinion that the act or deliberate failure to act has increased the likelihood that the Board of the Pension Protection Fund will assume responsibility for the scheme in accordance with Chapter 3&quot;


<p><a name="st_156"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 98 stands in my name and that of my noble friend. The problem is that there are scenarios in which an employer may deliberately decide to take steps to reduce future Section 75 liability without adversely affecting the security&#151;I stress the word &quot;security&quot;&#151;of the members&#039; interests. An employer may decide, for example, subject to various legal requirements, to reduce benefits for future service or may increase contributions to a scheme to reduce future liability. An employer may decide to arrange for members&#039; benefits to be transferred to a new scheme. The old scheme would be wound up, but the Section 75 debt liability would not be triggered at that stage because of the transfer.
</p>

<a name="40708-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>All those scenarios should not be penalised. At the moment arrangements can be made. We have seen a huge deterioration in the general overall position of pension schemes and, in particular, of defined benefit schemes. If the kind of situation that I have just described were to be ruled out by the clauses of the Bill, the reaction of the company concerned may be, &quot;We had better stop the defined contribution scheme, either for future members or for existing members&quot;. That is the underlying dilemma that we face all the way along. We do not want to add to the pressures on companies to close down their schemes. This amendment achieves that.
</p>

<a name="40708-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>I believe that there are cases where particular trustees have given members a choice, either to pay more to maintain their existing benefits, or to reduce their benefits somewhat. &quot;Choice&quot; is the in word at the moment; choice in almost everything seems to be the catchword for all political parties. When such a choice is given, so that members of a scheme can make a decision, depending on their personal circumstances, whether they would prefer to pay more to keep their benefits or to have their benefits reduced, I have found, even in the case of trade unions, that that may be regarded as a better option than closing down the scheme. The amendment achieves that and I hope that the Government feel that it is appropriate. I beg to move.

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC218</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

introduced the full buy-out provisions on wind-up on 11 June 2003, so that members can be assured that a solvent employer will mean that their pensions will be met, regardless of whose decision it is to wind-up the pension scheme, we have introduced the PPF to compensate those workers whose employers become insolvent when the scheme is under funded.
</p>

<a name="40708-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>However, for deferred members, the compensation rate is 90 per cent with a cap of &#163;25,000. Therefore, workers who see their company restructured and their employer become insolvent, even though the parent company continues to make profits, would be rightly aggrieved&#151;that touches the bigger debate that we have just had&#151;towards a government who did nothing to stop that. The result for them would not only be the loss of employment, but a reduction in their pension, effectively, of 10 per cent for every year that they have worked. For a worker whose benefits accrued at one-sixtieth a year, that could mean a loss of nearly four-years&#039; worth of working and saving towards a pension.
</p>

<a name="40708-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>Sadly, we know that some employers take just that tack&#151;legitimate corporate restructuring, which results in the avoidance of pension liabilities. That is not acceptable and with the power to issue contribution notices, the regulator will ensure that when restructuring takes place, the pension liabilities are safeguarded. Introducing restrictions in these clauses would introduce room for employers and those controlling companies to continue to avoid their pension responsibilities.

person who knowingly assists in an act or a deliberate failure to act falls within the scope of those he may attack. That seems to be so obvious as to be redundant. To help the confusion, it would seem better to exclude those who at present may fall within the scope of his actions, and therefore have to rely on his unproven reasonableness by reference to the factors set out in Clause 35(6), but who would be reasonably excluded at an earlier stage because of lack of knowledge and so on.
</p>

<a name="40708-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>A specific example has been given to me. Suppose a director signs off an agreement, the aim of which would be to avoid a debt to the employer, and his secretary types up the agreement knowing the purpose of it. It seems that she would be liable to action being taken against her by the regulator because she is connected to the employer by virtue of her employment. I gather that a number of settled cases reinforce that view. Of course, she would have had no power to influence the events and it seems unfair that she should fall within the category of people whom the regulator may attack. I beg to move.

On balance, we do not support this amendment. I have written down &quot;whistleblower&quot; on my copy. To some extent I understand what the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is saying. If one takes it to the extreme, it does not mean that a notice has to be served on a secretary. However, there may be more substantial people who may not have the legal power to stop an act of failure, but none the less have some influence, or should have known and should have told. In that case I err more on the protective side and I do not support Amendment No. 99.

A person who does not assist cannot knowingly assist. So I believe we are all right on that.
</p>

<a name="40708-43_para9"></a>

</p>

<a name="40708-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>Frankly, typing a letter is hardly a degree of involvement in the act or failure to act. Then there is reference to the relationship. Paragraph (c) states,

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>I want to return to paragraph (a)(iii), which is a far more serious limitation as it affects those who have a legal power to prevent the act or failure to act.

standing or to the duty of those who have the power to stop the act or failure to act, as a statutory whistleblower under Clause 63, which provides for a new statutory obligation on the trustees and managers of pension schemes to report in writing any prescribed event in relation to the scheme to the regulator? These events must be reported as soon as reasonably practicable. The type of events that must be notified will be specified in regulations and will include, for example, corporate restructuring or a significant payment becoming due to an individual scheme member in certain circumstances.

</p>

<a name="40708-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>A code of practice will be issued by the regulator to assist those with duties under this section. More importantly in relation to the amendment, the regulator must take into account whether the act or failure to act was a notifiable event with which the party had a duty to notify that it had complied. Further, there may be those with no legal power but with an actual power to stop the act or failure to act&#151;for example, parent companies.
</p>

<a name="40708-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>For all those reasons, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, will feel able to withdraw the amendment. I am sure that subparagraph (iii) proposed in the amendment goes beyond the remit of what he originally intended.

<a name="40708-44_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I am grateful for the Minister&#039;s reply. Clause 35(6)(a) on page 24 of the Bill places on the regulator the decision as to the degree of involvement of the person concerned. In relation to the secretary, we can agree that he would perhaps reach a decision, but he goes into a continuum and matters are then not at all clear. The person in question may be the personal assistant or some junior person rather than the secretary. I think that a slight problem arises here in giving the regulator such a power.

</p>

<a name="40708-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>The PPF has an assessment period in order to consider whether the scheme goes into the PPF. The amendment would ensure that once an assessment period had started, a notice could not be issued without leave of the courts in respect of any acts or failures to act that had, as a main purpose, avoided pension liabilities, even if they had led to the assessment period. Not only would there be the cost of the court action but the question would arise as to why the court would be in a better position than the regulator, with all the information and duties under Clause 94, to consider all parties.
</p>

<a name="40708-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>There is a real issue about speed and effectiveness. I have already explained that the courts can take many months. In the process, one could lose a large quantity of the assets of the scheme which one was seeking to safeguard so that, even if the scheme went into the PPF, it would bring with it as many assets as possible, thus reducing the liability on other people paying the levy. The noble Lord&#039;s amendment would affect schemes which were on the point of toppling over into the PPF. For that to stick, one would have to go through a court procedure that would take many months and that could then expose the scheme to people stripping out the assets while leaving the <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="40708-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>Referring to the part of Clause 35 printed at the top of page 24, it seems that to be bitten by this provision a person has to be a &quot;party to an act&quot;. What will be the situation if a transaction results in a substantial sum of money going offshore to another subsidiary of the foreign company which is the holding company for the UK company, then wandering back and then, by deed of that foreign holding company, moving on to some other part of the group? That would seem to take it out of the orbit of those people who can be taxed to give the money back. But if there is another big UK subsidiary of this same overseas holding company, it seems not to come within the orbit of those people who can be got at unless we are looking at an arrangement in definitions in this clause which can reach overseas and declare that the liability will in some way flow through the overseas holding company because that company was a party to it.
</p>

<a name="40708-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>I want to be sure that we are looking at all members of the group and that nothing in the clause, because of the way it is drawn, would restrict the action to the bit of the overseas company which is the particular subsidiary that has done the wrong thing and we cannot go back through the overseas link to get at the other assets in the UK.

This is probably a question of balance between subsections (6)(a) and (6)(e), and how that is going to work out. Presumably a regulation or a form of guidance will be produced to provide for whether the first port of call is to be the man who actually signed the deed&#151;he is to be pursued for his last penny before the regulator moves on for someone else&#151;or whether, first, the most convenient corporate entity will be approached, thus only turning to the individual last.

<a name="40708-45_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   Perhaps I may intervene for a moment because this raises possible concepts which I had not taken into account.

Perhaps it is something to which we should give a little more thought.

As I have said, we are trying to build into this proposed legislation as much consensus and staying power as possible. I would ask noble Lords opposite whether they really want us to pursue this because I did not sense a very high degree of support for the amendment. None the less, I shall be perfectly happy to pursue it with industry if it does reflect the position of the Official Opposition.

<a name="40708-46_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Higgins </b>   moved Amendment No. 104:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>Page 25, line 1, leave out subsections (7) to (10) and insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_15"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   In the case of a contingent debt, the reference in subsection (4)(a)(ii) to preventing a debt becoming due is to be read as including a reference to preventing the occurrence of any of the events specified in section 75(4B)(a) or (b) of that Act upon which the debt is contingent.

<br>
(   )   For the purposes of subsection (4)(a)(ii), a person shall be treated as having acted in good faith if&#151;


<br>
(a)   he considered at the time of the act or failure to act that it was justifiable in terms of members&#039; interests, or


<br>
(b)   the circumstances were such that he could reasonably have formed that view,


<br>
but these are not the only instances where a person shall be treated as having acted in good faith.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_185"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment seeks to expand on the meaning of &quot;good faith&quot;. I am not sure that that is possible, but it raises a specific point which is important. An example of the kind of situation is where it is necessary for a company to keep the prospect of any <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC227"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC227</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

buy-out debt to a minimum in order to maintain financial support for its operations and so stay afloat. If the bank withdraws its support the company will be at risk of insolvency, which is likely to do more harm to the scheme&#039;s funding position than other actions that might be taken.
</p>

<a name="40708-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>What is suggested here is almost to define what is meant by &quot;good faith&quot;; that is, the individual or corporate body,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a>&quot;considered at the time of the act or failure to act that it was justifiable in terms of members&#039; interests, or the circumstances were such that he could reasonably have formed that view&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>The amendment is phrased in terms of good faith, but what it really seeks to say is that if the individual believes that it would be in the members&#039; interests or had come to the conclusion that it was in their interests, that should be something that the regulator can accept as reasonable. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="40708-46_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay: </b>   Is it acceptable if, in speaking to this amendment, I speak also to Amendment No. 105A tabled in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Barker, which is a broadly alternative version of the same thing?
</p>

<a name="40708-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>I am sympathetic to the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, which was proposed by the National Association of Pension Funds. The association says that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;the current reference to &#039;good faith&#039; on its own is far too vague to enable companies and their directors to feel able to take decisions of this sort with confidence&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="40708-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>We sought to go further in our amendment by setting out in greater detail the three main constituencies. Perhaps the noble Baroness can clarify what &quot;members&quot; means.
</p>

<a name="40708-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>When people take these decisions, acting in good faith, it is important to set out that one is talking about both existing employees who are members of the scheme, deferred members who have moved on and, indeed, people with pensions in payment. I give an example, one with which I have been quite closely involved; namely, the appalling situation that the pensioners of the Mayflower Group and, in particular, the Dennis group pension scheme in Guildford find themselves in. There is a very serious deficit. People not yet drawing their pensions will only receive 40 per cent of what they are entitled to. When looking at the figures in detail one sees that the number of people who are still employees is relatively small. It is important to state that the different interests of the three categories of members of the scheme should be taken into account in the definition of good faith.
</p>




<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="40708-46_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   If I have followed the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, correctly, the first part of his amendment is a technical question about Section 75 debt and contingent debts. I should like to write to him on it because we were not absolutely clear when we read the amendment where the push was going. He has now helpfully explained it. I think I should like to follow the matter up.
</p>

<a name="40708-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>I turn to the second part, which is what I call the &quot;good-faith&quot; issue. The amendment inserts a new subsection which seeks to ensure that a person will be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC228"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC228</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

considered to be acting in good faith if he considered the act or failure to act was justifiable in the members&#039; interests, employee&#039;s interest, or that he could have reasonably formed that view. I should say that we envisage scheme members to include all categories of pensioner&#151;existing, deferred and employees.
</p>

<a name="40708-46_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>The test of good faith is well known in law. I am advised that there are over 700 references to &quot;good faith&quot; in UK legislation. I have a couple from the Human Rights Act&#151;judicial rights and so on. There are many hundreds more examples in case law. I do not really want to try to define good faith here because it would encompass the belief that a person was acting in the best interests of members, whichever class of member they may be. Equally, it would encompass the belief that a person was acting in the best interests of employees. Of course, a person&#039;s belief&#151;what they consider to be the state of affairs&#151;will be relevant when the regulator or tribunal considers whether that person is acting in good faith.
</p>

<a name="40708-46_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>So I think that there is no difference between us. However, I wonder whether it would help the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, or the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, and meet any worries if we insert the phrase &quot;in good faith&quot;, which is currently at Clause 35(4)(a)(ii), into paragraph (a)(i). Perhaps the opposition would reflect on that. If it feels that that would be helpful, we might progress down that line. If it feels that that would still not address the issue, then obviously we must have a fuller debate on Report.
</p>

<a name="40708-46_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>The issue of good faith is pivotal. All we fail to do is to define the phrase conventionally on the face of the Bill. But guidance will be given. There will be a clearance procedure and anyone concerned about the act and whether someone is acting in good faith can contact the regulator for clearance on it. In other words, I would be surprised if this turns out to be the problem that noble Lords suspect it is. If my suggestion is helpful we will pursue it; if it is not, then obviously parliamentary draftsmen will no doubt be delighted.
</p>

</p>

<a name="40708-46_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>The amendments are really to establish matters with regard to making them more certain. There is no reason for the regulator to have the degree of discretion afforded in the Bill for these types of circumstances. The background to this is the Occupational Pension Schemes <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC229"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC229</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

(Winding Up and Deficiency on Winding Up etc.) (Amendment) Regulations 2004, which created the employers&#039; full buy-out debt on winding up.
</p>

<a name="40708-46_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>The Government announced on 11 June that the full buy-out calculation would apply only in cases where the employer had chosen to wind up, but unfortunately the 2004 regulations do not reflect that point and would cover every winding up, even if the trustees were to wind up against the employer&#039;s wishes, and the employer is keen to continue funding the scheme on an ongoing basis.
</p>

<a name="40708-46_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>There are real problems, sometimes, between trustees and companies with regard to particular matters, especially with regard to winding up. I can recall from practical experience that this is sometimes the case, particularly if there have been mergers at an earlier stage in the company&#039;s history and where the terms of winding up may favour one group rather than another. There would seem to be a case for clarifying the situation as far as this is concerned.
</p>

<a name="40708-46_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>I gather that there has been consultation on this and that there may be some confusion about exactly what the 2004 regulations do in practice, particularly with regard to full buy-out costs in cases where the employer has chosen to wind up. There are very real difficulties in full buy-out costs as against an operation being ongoing. We need to examine these issues further. More generally, we need to be clear on precisely what is meant by &quot;an ongoing basis&quot;.
</p>

<a name="40708-46_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>Finally&#151;because if I understand the Government Whip&#039;s views correctly, we are about to conclude our proceedings today&#151;I have a point about regulations in general. The noble Baroness has always been extremely helpful when dealing with previous legislation in providing draft regulations. Perhaps she could bring us up to date as far as the provision of those on this Bill is concerned. Are we likely to receive them before the end of the Committee stage, or not until later? I believe that she has expressed a view, but it would be helpful to have it on the record again. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_191"></a>
<a name="40708-47_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   We have some sympathy with what the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is trying to do in this group of amendments. It seems helpful to all concerned that there should be some guidance on the calculation of the sums in a contribution notice. I have one or two small questions. Who will determine where the onus of proof should lie? Would an individual have to prove that they   had not intended to fail&#151;that they had failed unintentionally? That is crucial. Is the failure to the detriment of the pensioner or the PPF? That is another relevant factor.
</p>

<a name="40708-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>Having raised those questions, I think that the noble Lord&#039;s attempt to shed some light on the matter is extremely helpful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_192"></a>
<a name="40708-47_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </b>   With regard to the points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, I promise that regulations will be introduced as soon as we are in a position to bring them before your Lordships. However, not only are they, in some cases, extremely technical; we have also given an undertaking <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC230"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC230</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to consult, even at the draft stage, all the players outside, and inevitably that elongates the procedure. I wish that I could give the commitments that the noble Lord seeks.
</p>

<a name="40708-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>Normally in relation to social security, but possibly with the exception of disability issues, almost no one is an outside player. Age Concern or disability organisations may be players, but mostly there are poor individuals out there who may or may not be receiving benefit and no consultation process is involved. There would be such a process in the Department of Health or the Department for Education and Skills, for example, in which there are doctors, teachers and so on. Unusually, in the Department for Work and Pensions, there is a vast number of players, many of whose views we have heard about today&#151;professional associations and organisations and some of the contributors whose points were raised in the debate on Clause 35.
</p>

<a name="40708-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>Secondly&#151;this takes us back to a previous point that I made&#151;we are seeking to use the general powers of regulations in order to ensure that we do not have to return to this issue shortly because everything is drawn too tightly. I think that we need a more extensive consultation procedure than we normally have. I appreciate that I sound defensive but I am trying to be helpful to your Lordships on this matter. We are having to go through extensive consultation and, if your Lordships agree, that consultation will continue after the Bill has gone through both Houses.

</p>

<a name="40708-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>I genuinely do not believe that I can foreshorten the process. For example, today I have already made commitments on behalf of the Government to consider ongoing discussions with relevant organisations on the problem of acquisition and mergers and the implications for pension liabilities. If, as a result, we need the regulations to be clarified or adapted, that can take place afterwards. That will not happen until the autumn. Therefore, we are dealing with a different timescale from that which usually applies to Bills. I shall do my best to be helpful, but I am not very optimistic.
</p>

<a name="40708-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>I turn to the amendment and I hope that I shall be able to cover the points raised by the noble Baroness as well. The sum in the contribution notice as a maximum can be the Section 75 debt which is or would be due and would remove the regulator&#039;s discretion in calculating such a sum. I shall deal, first, with the removal of the discretion in Section 36(2)(a)&#151;that is, the discretion to estimate the debt due. That discretion is there because it is possible that the act or failure to act has artificially increased the assets of the scheme or decreased the liabilities. Therefore, the Section 75 debt due would, in real terms, be incorrect, and the provision is necessary to allow for that.
</p>

<a name="40708-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>Turning to subsection (3), the discretion here allows the regulator to reduce the amount due in the contribution notice. The discretion is provided for by the very line that the noble Lord seeks to remove&#151;that is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a>&quot;by such amount as the Regulator considers appropriate&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC231"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column GC231</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="40708-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>That would allow him to reduce the amount and therefore, presumably, it would be welcomed by industry.
</p>

<a name="40708-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>The regulator will have to consider a number of factors when deciding the appropriate sum, including, as I said, the financial circumstances of the person concerned. He will have to take into account whether the scheme is in wind-up or in an assessment period. But it is irrelevant who decided to wind up the scheme. For it to be otherwise would be to penalise members.
</p>

<a name="40708-47_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>If the scheme is in wind-up, it is likely that the full Section 75 buy-out debt will be required, provided that it is reasonable to ask the person named to pay the sum. That would ensure that members obtained their benefits and that the PPF did not have to assume responsibility for the scheme unnecessarily. I am sure that your Lordships will agree that that is the case and that it is highly desirable.
</p>

<a name="40708-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>I could continue but I realise that we are pressed for time. However, turning to one or two specific points, the regulations cover every wind-up&#151;a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins&#151;otherwise, members would be worse off if the trustees or regulator wound up the scheme. The Government are clear that they want the pension promise to be met.
</p>

<a name="40708-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>On the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady   Barker, the onus of proof is on the regulator. I hope that that gives her the assurance that she seeks. I am mindful of the time and I realise that we want to reach the end of Clause 36, if we can, before the guillotine comes down.

I am in the Committee&#039;s hands regarding whether we call that a guillotine; I thought that it was the appropriate term.

<p><a name="st_197"></a>The noble Lord said: This is the last amendment that we need to deal with today other than the stand part debates, the substance of which I imagine has already largely been covered.
</p>

<a name="40708-47_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>Amendment No. 112 concerns an extremely important matter. There is concern outside the House about individual employers and directors being exposed to the possibility of liabilities of the kind suggested by the Government. The threat of such liability will make it extremely difficult for those involved to operate effectively or even perhaps in their members&#039; or the PPF&#039;s interests. In any event the individual concerned would probably rarely have sufficient resources to have a material impact on the scheme&#039;s funding position. The amendment seeks to limit this kind of liability to cases where there is clear culpability on the part of the individual concerned involving personal gain.
</p>

<a name="40708-47_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>In moving this amendment I am rather unsure where we ought to stand on this point. It is a difficult matter because there may be a vast difference between the assets of the individuals concerned, particularly if they are worker trustees, for example, and the assets held by the company. On the other hand, given what has been happening regarding some corporate salaries lately, certain individuals may be better able to finance the measure than the company concerned. I refer in particular to rescue situations where new directors are appointed on extremely favourable terms. They may fail to turn the business around but they get the money just the same.
</p>

<a name="40708-47_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>This is a difficult balance to strike <i>vis-&#224;-vis </i>the extent of the personal wealth of individuals and so on. In all events we need to be a little clearer than we are about the extent to which individuals should be held personally liable, particularly as they may be jointly and severally liable in some cases. I hope that the noble Baroness will indicate her thinking on that point. I beg to move.

up. Otherwise, the only way to get a contribution from those who have avoided a pension liability would be to wind up the scheme. We are surely agreed that an ongoing scheme is in the interests of members. Indeed, I believe that earlier the noble Lord sought to ensure that the debt due should be reduced if a scheme was ongoing.

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, thinks that the relevant subsection does not sufficiently cover or address his concerns, I am perfectly happy to look at it again. I am open to persuasion on this, and we can consider it further during the summer. But at the moment, he has not persuaded me that we should move. If he can, I am happy to do so.

<p><a name="st_200"></a>
<a name="40708-48_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I hope this is something we can look at in a spirit of co-operation over the summer. It will clearly be a difficult position, particularly for non-executive directors, to know whether an Act has this intent or not. The way in which this interfaces with the clearance procedure will be critical. If the clearance procedure is easy and complete and offers a cast-iron solution at the end of it, unlike the sort of clearance one gets from the Inland Revenue, we will find that most of the problems are solved. Any non-executive worth his salt will make sure that the clearance is obtained on anything that has anything to do with the pension fund.
</p>

<a name="40708-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>To go back to one of my noble friend&#039;s earlier amendments, a company I know found itself with a pension fund deficit and decided that it would deal with that partly by offering no increase at all on accrued rights pre-1997. They changed the practice of the scheme in a way which reduced the expectations, if not the actual rights, of the scheme members, and reduced the deficit by about &#163;15 million or &#163;20 million. That seems, to my mind, to fall within the sort of acts that come under the Bill. In such circumstances, directors will need to know pretty clearly where they stand. If we have a good clearance method, fine&#151;otherwise, we will need some way of protecting people who are non-executive directors and act in good faith, or the marketing director, for example, who does not understand these sorts of matters but is told what to do by the finance director, the chairman and the chief executive.

<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>We have to recognise that assets and liabilities do not necessarily go, and someone may just have some money without having played a crucial part in taking the decision.

<a name="40708-48_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   I had some hesitation on the implications of the amendment which are obviously shared by the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott. This will be one of the most difficult areas we have to face. It is certainly true for trustees as well as company directors. Very often the trustees of a company are responsible for vastly more money than the directors. We will need to return later to whether trustees should be paid far more than many are at present. Some, indeed, are not paid at all.

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="40708-48_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Ministerial Statement.

</p>

<a name="40708-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>The Government have received and welcomed the second report from the Justice Oversight Commissioner, Lord Clyde, on the progress achieved in implementing the recommendations of the review of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland. Consistent with his terms of reference, the report was submitted to the Attorney-General, Lord Filkin, the Minister for the Northern Ireland Court Service, and me in June.
</p>

<a name="40708-48_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>Lord Clyde concludes that in the period of this report good progress continues to be made in the implementation of the review&#039;s recommendations on a number of fronts. While a few delays in progress have   been noted, he believes that for the most part the momentum has been maintained and important initiatives have been pursued with vigour. He comments that there is now visible evidence which demonstrates the progress which is being made and provides promise of the eventual implementation of the changes recommended in the criminal justice review. The Government warmly endorse these conclusions.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>On 1 April I announced the establishment of three public inquiries, into the deaths of Robert Hamill, Billy Wright and Rosemary Nelson.

</p>

<a name="40708-49_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>These inquiries are being established because it is essential that all people in Northern Ireland can have   confidence in the integrity of the state and its institutions. Where there are serious allegations of wrongdoing, it is important that the facts are properly established. The Government will continue to press ahead with the detailed arrangements for the inquiries, including the appointment of chairmen, as quickly as possible.
</p>

<a name="40708-49_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>As I have said previously, it is also important that we find a way in Northern Ireland of dealing with the past in a way that recognises the pain associated with it without allowing it to destroy all hope of a better future. Throughout the summer, I will be considering the options for doing this, taking on board the views of a range of experts, with a view to wider consultation in the autumn.

<a name="40708-49_head2"></a><h3 align=center>Northern Ireland Regional Development Strategy 2025: Annual Report 2002&#150;03</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="40708-49_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Northern Ireland has made the following Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="40708-49_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>Earlier today I placed in the Libraries copies of the annual report on the implementation of the regional development strategy for Northern Ireland 2025 (RDS) covering the period 2002&#150;03.
</p>

<a name="40708-49_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>Annual reporting on the implementation of the RDS involves assessment of progress being made against a number of critical threshold indicators and   each of the strategic planning guidelines (SPGs) contained within the strategy. Measuring the relevant outcomes assesses progress against each of the SPGs. To measure these outcomes data are collected from government departments.

</p>

<a name="40708-49_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>The monitoring section of the annual report covering the period 2002&#150;03 deals with measured outcomes against each of the SPGs for that period. It is my intention however to publish a further report in November 2004 that will bring reporting up-to-date since September 2001. The November report (thereafter published biennially) will comment on measured outcomes up to March 2004, and will deal in more detail with any key trends which have emerged over the three-year period since September 2001. This will be important in the context of the work that the department has commenced on the 2005&#150;06 focussed assessment of the RDS.
</p>

<a name="40708-49_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>Earlier in the year I committed to a review of the regional housing allocations. A three-month consultation exercise commenced in May 2004. The work is in two stages. First, it will involve an assessment of household formation. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency on behalf of the department is taking this work forward. This may result in a revised regional housing figure. Consideration will also have to be given to factors such as vacancy, second homes and housing stock loss.
</p>

<a name="40708-49_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>The second stage will include an assessment of the appropriate level of housing allocation for district councils. This will take account of local factors that impact on housing need and any changed circumstances <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS41"></a>

<b>8 Jul 2004 : Column WS41</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

since the original figures were prepared. Given the complexity and sensitivity of projecting housing need, consideration will be given to how these figures are used. The outcome from the housing review process will be fed into the focused assessment. It is possible that this review of housing allocation figures will point to the need for a specific adjustment of the RDS rather than action by third parties. The focused assessment process will provide the opportunity for necessary publicity and consultation.

</p>

<a name="40708-49_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>The focused assessment will require consideration of all strategic guidance within the RDS using up-to-date data in the context of current government policy. However, the focused assessment is not a full review. Any adjustments will be considered in the context of the guiding principles and the strategic direction that is set out in the spatial development strategy. The focused assessment process will also include open and participative engagement with stakeholders and consultation as appropriate.
</p>

<a name="40708-49_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>The success of the RDS will be determined by the extent to which its policies and actions are implemented. Implementation is, however, a very complex process involving a wide variety of public and private organisations, businesses, voluntary and community organisations and individuals. Many of the policies can be implemented only through individual departments and their strategies. Chapter 13 of the RDS sets out the elements of the delivery mechanism.
</p>

<a name="40708-49_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>However the department has been heavily engaged in developing the participative approach to implementation by engaging a wide range of stakeholders in the public and private sectors and in the community. During the year 2003&#150;04 the department has facilitated a series of sub-regional seminars for the north-west, the south-east, the rural west and the north-west. Reports of proceedings in these events will be published as a record of the action agenda proposed for each sub-region. The department is now engaged with representatives of the organisations attending the seminars to agree a suitable structure for continuing engagement in tracking RDS progress and local strategic priorities.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>Honourable Members will recall the harrowing images broadcast by Al Jazeera television in March last year, which showed the bodies of two British soldiers&#151;Staff Sergeant Simon Cullingworth and Sapper Luke Allsopp. There were indications that one or both of the soldiers may not have died in combat, and as a result we launched a Special Investigation <br>&nbsp;<br>

Branch inquiry. Although it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on the evidence collected so far, it continues to point to the possibility that one or both soldiers may have been murdered.
</p>

<a name="40708-49_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>Honourable Members may also recall the tragic deaths of six RMP soldiers in Al Majarr Al Kabir last June. Against the backdrop of an extremely challenging environment, an SIB investigation into that incident has also been making progress.
</p>

<a name="40708-49_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>Last year, the Coalition Provisional Authority established the Central Criminal Court of Iraq (CCCI) to exercise jurisdiction over all criminal offences referred to it by the administration in Iraq, which were committed there since 19 March 2003. The CCCI follows the investigative model, prevalent in the rest of Europe, whereby an investigative court directs and oversees the investigation and, where appropriate, refers the matter to a trial court.
</p>

<a name="40708-49_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>If these cases are to be pursued through the CCCI, then it is important that the concluding phases of the investigations are conducted under the court&#039;s direction, to ensure compliance with the rules and procedures of the court. This will have particular impact in respect of the admissibility of evidence. I have therefore agreed that it would be appropriate for the CCCI to be invited to take on these cases. To that end, translations of the cases developed so far have been passed to the CCCI. If the CCCI adopts the cases, we will, of course, support it in any way we can in taking the investigations forward.
</p>

<a name="40708-49_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>The CCCI represents the best prospect of dealing with such cases in an expeditious and fair manner, as Iraqi law has a bar to extraditing its own nationals to a foreign state, including the UK.
</p>

<a name="40708-49_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>Whatever the outcome of these cases, I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of the SIB senior investigating officers and their teams for their hard work.
</p>

<a name="40708-49_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>The families of the eight soldiers are being kept informed of progress with the investigations. Our thoughts and sympathies remain with them.

This set out our proposals to reform civil registration in England and Wales using powers in the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. It remains our intention, as the Financial Secretary to the Treasury announced on 29 March this year, to bring forward two orders under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. One, planned for this Session of Parliament, will amend the current legislation on birth and death registration. The second, on marriage law, has been deferred to enable us to take into account Parliament&#039;s wishes on civil partnership legislation.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>Preliminary consideration of the responses to <i>Civil Registration: Delivering Vital Change</i> suggests that there is an issue regarding the proposals for marriage on which there should be further consultation. The issue concerns the absence of any proposal to change the legal requirement for marriage ceremonies to be either civil or religious. Policy in this area of marriage law is the responsibility of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. In the coming months and in consultation with others, we will be working with Treasury Ministers and the General Register Office for England and Wales to determine the scope of any revised proposals.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>The UK Government scheme to pay compensation to victims of Nazi persecution whose property was confiscated during the Second World War under the trading with the enemy legislation will close on 31 August 2004. Lord Archer of Sandwell, the chairman of the Enemy Property Claims Assessment Panel, has reported to me that the panel is nearing the end of its work and at my request advised on how the   scheme should be wound up. After consulting with the various interested parties, he has recommended that 31 August would be an appropriate date to wind up the scheme. He has also recommended that the panel should continue to advise on an ad hoc basis on any claims received after that date. I am pleased to accept all his recommendations, and I have placed a copy of his report in the Libraries of both Houses.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a>Under wartime legislation, the Government confiscated all assets in British territory owned by residents of enemy countries. The enemy countries included Nazi Germany and its allies, as well as countries occupied by them. After the war, the assets of the occupied countries were released from British Government control but the assets of the belligerent countries were distributed to British creditors whose assets had been confiscated by the enemy countries. An exception was made for victims of Nazi persecution, and soon after the war Nazi victims or their heirs could claim the return of their assets.
</p>

<a name="40708-50_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a>In Spring 1997, following public concern that there were still many assets belonging to victims that had not been returned, the British Government published research on the history of the administration of enemy   property and placed on the Internet at www.enemyproperty.gov.uk a database of the assets seized from residents of belligerent enemy countries. A major problem was that many of the individual files had been destroyed and it was not obvious which of the assets had been returned. However the Government believed that the injustice had to be addressed and asked Lord   Archer of Sandwell in June 1998 to advise on the <br>&nbsp;<br>

design of a compensation scheme. The Government subsequently accepted Lord Archer&#039;s recommendations and the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced in December 1998 a compensation scheme administered by an independent Enemy Property Compensation Advisory Panel (EPCAP).
</p>

<a name="40708-50_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a>EPCAP launched the Enemy Property Payments Scheme in April 1999 under the chairmanship of Lord   Archer of Sandwell, sitting with two teams of assessors expert in finance and ethnic minority issues. They have considered nearly 1,100 applications for compensation and 377 claims have been assessed as qualifying for payment and a total of &#163;16.2 million paid to claimants for assets that were confiscated. Claims have been submitted from all parts of the world and oral hearings were convened for those cases that proved difficult to resolve. A separate adjudicator, <br>&nbsp;<br>

Sir Christopher Staughton, was appointed to consider appeals against EPCAP&#039;s decisions. He considered 52 appeals, and found in favour of 15.
</p>

<a name="40708-50_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a>Some 220,000 assets were confiscated and either sold or returned to the original owners. The only material asset that remains is a gilt bracelet and diamond tie-pin. We know that these belonged to Marck Kellermann, a brush salesman from Bratislava in the former Czechoslovakia. Despite the best efforts of the panel, it remains unclaimed. I am pleased to announce that the Imperial War Museum is in discussions with my officials about the safekeeping of the jewellery until such time as Mr Kellermann&#039;s heirs come forward or are found.
</p>

<a name="40708-50_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a>I am very grateful to Lord Archer and his team of assessors and to the appeal adjudicator for their work in resolving a long-running difficult issue that has previously been neglected by successive governments.

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>Whether they will establish an independent civilian-led investigation into alleged unlawful killings by British Forces in Iraq; and whether they will compensate the families of persons unlawfully killed by members of Her Majesty&#039;s Armed Forces.  [HL2828]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="40708w01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Bach): </b>  An important role of the Service Police is to investigate alleged offences by members of the UK Armed Forces. Service Police investigations are competent, impartial and effective. Service Police work to Home Office standards, are advised by professional lawyers, and are required by statute to follow civilian police force procedures. It is very difficult to see what added value a civilian body would bring to these investigations. In addition, there would be practical difficulties associated with a civilian body working in a hostile environment. We have every confidence in existing arrangements.

<a name="40708w04_spnew0"></a><b> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Whitty):  </b>  Any hazardous waste can be burned in incinerators, subject to the incinerator&#039;s emissions and operation meeting the requirements of Directive 94/67/EC on the incineration of hazardous waste. This directive will be repealed and replaced by Directive 2000/76/EC on the incineration of waste from 28 December 2005, although the latter directive&#039;s requirements already apply to incinerators new or substantially changed since 28    December 2002. The requirements of these directives have been transposed into UK law through regulations and directions.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_25"></a>How many exotic birds from third countries not classified under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora agreements are quarantined in the United Kingdom each year.  [HL3549]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_20"></a>
<a name="40708w04_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Whitty:  </b>  Exotic birds must be imported in accordance with the animal health requirements laid down in Commission Decision 2000/666/EC. The decision requires that all exotic birds (birds other than poultry) imported into the United Kingdom are quarantined for at least 30 days.
</p>

<a name="40708w04_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_28"></a>According to our records the number of exotic captive birds from third countries that were quarantined in the United Kingdom from 2001 to date are as follows:

<a name="40708w04_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Whitty:  </b>  Defra&#039;s system for recording animal movements does not record the length of time that imported birds are resident in the United Kingdom before they are exported and therefore we are unable to provide you with any reliable data.

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_27"></a>What are the current guidelines concerning the importation of exotic birds from countries outside the European Union not covered under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora agreements.  [HL3547]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_22"></a>
<a name="40708w04_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Whitty:  </b>  All captive birds (birds other than poultry), regardless of whether they are covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, are subject to conditions and controls on animal health and welfare in transport laid down by Community law.
</p>

<a name="40708w04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_30"></a>Exotic captive birds must be imported from third countries in accordance with the animal health requirements and veterinary certification as laid down by the European Commission (Commission Decision 2000/666/EC).
</p>

<a name="40708w04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_31"></a>These import conditions ensure that only birds which are officially certified as being free from serious disease can be imported into the European Community. The birds must originate from a member country of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE&#151;World Organisation for Animal Health) and be accompanied by health certification issued by an official veterinarian of that country.
</p>

<a name="40708w04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_32"></a>Captive birds may only be imported into the European Community via an approved border inspection post where they undergo checks by an official veterinarian to ensure that the consignment complies with the import requirements.

<p><a name="wa_qn_22"></a>
<a name="40708w04_wqn4"></a><b> Baroness Byford  </b> asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_28"></a>How successful they have been in raising public awareness of the rules regarding the import of animal products for personal consumption; and how this success has been measured; and  [HL3568]

</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_29"></a>What range of activities was used to raise public awareness of the rules regarding the import of animal products for personal consumption; and what was the cost of these activities since the strategy was implemented.  [HL3569]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_23"></a>
<a name="40708w04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Whitty:  </b>  Two surveys, the last of which reported in May 2003, indicated that there had been a low level of public awareness of the rules regarding the import of animal products for personal consumption.
</p>

<a name="40708w04_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_33"></a>Since then, we have made a significant effort to raise public awareness of the rules. For example, there has been increased enforcement activity by Customs, more prominent posters being displayed at ports and airports and revised leaflets have been produced. Also, many airlines now publicise the rules at check in, by in-flight announcements and their on-board magazines, and 3&#188; million travel wallets now carry the &quot;if in doubt, leave it out&quot; message. Customs is producing a number of language and country-specific versions of the leaflets; and these will be made available internationally as well as being used by Customs detection staff at ports and airports. Defra has written again to universities, charities and volunteer organisations. The Central Office of Information has been commissioned to undertake research in the UK about attitudes and sensitivities surrounding the importation of food. The results of this research will be used to inform future publicity campaigns.
</p>

<a name="40708w04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_34"></a>We will undertake further periodic surveys to monitor the success of the various campaigns.
</p>

<a name="40708w04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_35"></a>In addition, we have committed &#163;25 million over the three financial years from 2003&#150;04 to tackle illegal imports of products of animal origin. Detail of the costs of the publicity campaigns is not available as central departmental funds are used for this purpose in addition to the specifically allocated budget.
