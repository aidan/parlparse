<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is the annual cost to public funds of implementing the decision of the European Court of Human Rights concerning the entitlement of men aged 60 to drugs and other items.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Baroness Cumberlege): </B>  My Lords, we estimate that the cost of giving free prescriptions to men between the ages of 60 and 65 is about &#163;40 million a year.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply, but does it not amend considerably the Answer that she gave to an earlier Question when she suggested that the cost was only &#163;2 million? Secondly, does my noble friend agree that for &#163;40 million of expenditure to be incurred without parliamentary assent in either House is an alarming precedent?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend asked an identical Question on 15th January this year. My reply was:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"My Lords, we estimate that the cost of giving free prescriptions to men between the ages of 60 and 65 is about &#163;40 million a year".--[Official Report, 15/1/96; col. 357.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-01_para0"></a>With regard to the second part of my noble friend's question, it is not a matter of the European Court deciding that we should tax our citizens in order to find <P>


<a name="column_2"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 2</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this money. The European Court decided that the principle of equality between men and women in matters of social security applies in the age of exemption from prescription charges.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that the confusion over whether the sum is &#163;2 million a year or &#163;40 million a year arises from the fact that the judgment about prescription charges was made by the European Court of Justice, which is the court which decides matters relating to the European Union, and not the European Court of Human Rights as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter? However, does the noble Baroness agree that the noble Lord is absolutely right to complain that that foreign court can impose charges on Parliament for which the Government then have to raise taxation? Would it not be in the interests of this country to amend Section 2 of the European Communities Act to give us back control over all taxation?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is correct in saying that it was the European Court of Justice which made the ruling and not the European Court of Human Rights. In this case the European Court of Justice left the United Kingdom free to decide how to implement the principle it had established. We decided to equalise the age of exemption at 60 for both men and women. That was our decision. We took that decision to protect the rights of those women currently receiving free prescriptions.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, in view of the Minister's remark that we decided that the age should be 60 for everyone, whereas I gather that we could have made women wait until 65, and it was only a question of equality, does she agree that it is time we reviewed the blanket entitlement to free prescriptions at either age? There are many people over 60 who could well afford to pay for their prescriptions. The figure of more than 80 per cent. of people receiving free prescriptions seems very high.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, a review was carried out in 1993 into the very areas that my noble <P>


<a name="column_3"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 3</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>friend mentioned. At that time it was decided to stick with the present policy and, after the European Court of Justice decision, that the exemption should apply at 60.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that many men and women in this country will greatly welcome the judgment of the European Court of Justice that men and women are equally entitled to social security benefits--in this case free prescriptions--at the same age without discrimination? Does she agree that they will welcome the Government's decision not to equalise upwards by requiring everyone to wait until 65 but allowing simple justice at the age of 60 for both sexes?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, many men will rejoice and welcome the European Court's ruling. Many women will be delighted that the exemption was equalised at 60.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister confirm that the Government have accepted that men over 60 can claim back prescription charges for three months? How will it be possible to prove whether those prescriptions have been paid for and used in the previous period?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, we use the prescription claims processing unit. Indeed, it has already authorised payments totalling &#163;2.6 million to 83,000 men.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend deal with the question as to whether expenditure of this sort should be incurred without the assent of either House of Parliament?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I believe that I made it plain to my noble friend and to your Lordships that it was our decision to incur this additional cost.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew12"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, following on from the question by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, do the Government have any intention of further reviewing the distribution of free prescriptions? It seems to me to be eminently sensible that people who can afford to pay for their prescriptions should do so, but that those who cannot need not do so.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, we do not have any intentions at this moment to undertake another formal review.

<P>

<A NAME = "60304-01_time0"></A><H5>2.43 p.m. </H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Elles: </B>   My Lords, on behalf of my noble friend Lady Macleod of Borve, and at her request, I beg leave to ask the Government the following Question:
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-01_para1"></a>Whether overseas aid from the United Kingdom was used to fund prosecution costs in the recent trial in Malawi of six defendants who were acquitted of the accusation of murder.
<P>


<a name="column_4"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 4</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey): </B>   My Lords, neither overseas aid nor other public funds from the United Kingdom were used to fund prosecution or defence costs in the trial.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Elles: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House perhaps I may transmit my noble friend's apologies to the House for not being here; she broke her leg over the weekend. I should like now to put a supplementary question.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-01_para2"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. Is she aware that strong verbal attacks which seem to be politically motivated have been addressed to the judge who acquitted the defendants in that case? The Government are lodging an appeal against the judgment. That will cost several thousands of pounds by way of expenditure from a country which is already extremely poor. Will the Minister take those factors into account when considering what legal reforms should be advised to Malawi and the kind of aid that is given to that country?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that the whole House will join us in wishing my noble friend a very speedy recovery from her injuries.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew18"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Hear, hear!
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, as regards my noble friend's supplementary question, the whole issue of a trial within Malawi is a matter for the Malawi judicial authorities. We believe that events should be allowed to run their course. Whatever happens there, it is an independent country and it must take the decisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-01_para3"></a>However, my noble friend is absolutely right in saying that Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world. That is why we have been helping it to reform its systems--not only its legal sector but its economic reform, health and eduction sectors, its renewable natural resources, and good government. So far as concerns the legal sector, we have a task force on legal reforms under the chairmanship of a Malawi judge, whose report was finalised last month. It is being considered both by the Government of Malawi and our own Government. I hope that this will lead to new help for the Malawian legal sector as well as all the other matters that I have mentioned.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-01_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, we join in the general expressions of sympathy to the noble Baroness, Lady Macleod, and send our very best wishes for a speedy recovery.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-01_para4"></a>Perhaps I may ask the Minister whether she appreciates that yesterday was Martyrs Day in Malawi, when dissidents, such as Mkwapatira Mhango the journalist, who were murdered by agents of the former regime are commemorated? Does she agree that, despite the fact that the defendants in this trial were lucky enough to be acquitted, we should join with the people of Malawi in giving thanks for their deliverance from 30 years of one-party dictatorship?<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo960304/text/60304-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I was aware that yesterday was Martyrs Day in Malawi, but <P>


<a name="column_5"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 5</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I realise that the noble Lord's question is what one might call a little loaded. However, we were very pleased to support the elections which took place in Malawi. We believe that they were free and fair. While there are bound to be criticisms in the settling down of a new government, I have to say to the House that there has been an improvement in human rights since those elections. There is now freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and genuine political dialogue in Parliament. Those are good things.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-02_para0"></a>As regards individuals, I do not think that that aspect comes into this Question.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I, too, may express my commiseration to the noble Baroness, Lady Macleod, and send wishes for a speedy recovery.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-02_para1"></a>Is the noble Baroness aware that she has the full support of these Benches in giving assistance to developing countries to achieve good governance? Does she not agree that a state prosecution service, properly constituted and conforming to internationally agreed principles, forms part of good governance? Although the Minister says that there was no actual assistance given in this trial, the assistance that Britain gives to Malawi to upgrade and bring up to international standards its legal service is a thoroughly good thing?
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-02_para2"></a>Would she not also congratulate the current Malawi Government on at least initially agreeing to the verdict which went against them, thus accepting the rule of law, even though they are now considering appealing?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, first, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Rea, about the importance of a sound state prosecution service. That was why just over a year ago we approved &#163;100,000 for the Malawian legal sector to improve the skills of court interpreters, to make sure that there were law books in its High Court library, and to give training to lawyers and High Court judges.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-02_para3"></a>As regards the noble Lord's comment about the Government of Malawi accepting the legal outcome of the Mwanza trial, of course that is right. The government are seeking to improve all their systems, but they have a great deal of work to do. They therefore not only need our help but deserve our support. We constantly make the government aware of their need to practise good government in all its aspects in Malawi. It is not good enough merely to have freedom of speech, of the press and political dialogue; they must also be a transparent accountable government to all their people.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, has the Minister made it clear to the Government of Malawi and other recipients of British aid that the Minister's situation is made much easier in winning the case for aid where human rights and independence of the judiciary are expected?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   Yes, my Lords.

<FONT SIZE=3>Asylum Seekers: Help to Local Authorities
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-02_time0"></A><H5>2.50 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Russell </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "60304-02_para4"></a>When they expect to make an announcement about the nature and extent of the help promised to local authorities with their responsibilities to asylum seekers arising under the Children Act 1989.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="60304-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, the Department of Health jointly with the Department of the Environment have had discussions with representatives from the local authority associations regarding the implications for local authorities resulting from the changes in social security benefits for asylum seekers.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. She is no doubt aware that we have been given categorical assurances on the subject, but it deals with an emergency that came into effect a month ago tomorrow. While honour in government assurances is taken for granted, punctuality is also to be desired.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   Yes, my Lords, I appreciate the sentiments expressed by the noble Earl. The grant that will be forthcoming for local authorities will be paid in arrears, so that their costs will be covered.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the children of asylum seekers will lose their entitlement to free school meals which are predicated on income support? What do the Government intend to do to ensure that such children receive the necessary free school meals in the interests of their health?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, the position will be as before. If asylum seekers or their children qualify for benefits, those benefits will still be supplied. Up to 80 per cent. of the unavoidable additional expenditure will be paid to local authorities. The noble Baroness shakes her head. I am not sure whether she appreciates the distinction between asylum seekers who are appealing after their case has been reviewed and those who have not appealed. Where such people are appealing, I understand that the benefits will not be forthcoming as they have been in the past but that, nevertheless, under the Children Act there is a duty on the Social Services Department to ensure that the children are looked after.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the Social Security Advisory Committee, the Government's own independent committee, spoke about the withdrawal of benefits to asylum seekers in the following terms:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Health professionals have warned that, given the vulnerability of many asylum seekers due to already precarious health, some will die"? <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_7"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 7</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Is not the Minister worried that, given the delay in announcing the new provisions, problems will particularly affect the children? Unless the benefit is at a high level and permanent, the problems may come to fruition.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, officials are discussing the details with colleagues from the Department of the Environment and local authority associations. That fully meets the most pressing concerns put to the Government by the Social Security Advisory Committee and local authorities.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, is it not true that local authorities have been supplying the services? That is why they have been asking the Government for extra help. It is not that people have not been looked after. The burden has fallen unevenly on different boroughs in different areas, particularly in London, and in different years. Therefore, local authorities are pleased with what is happening in asylum funding.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   Yes, my Lords, I believe that my noble friend is right. The local authority associations are continuing discussions with the Government and are now well aware that 80 per cent. of their unavoidable additional expenditure above a certain threshold will be met, as will the housing benefit subsidy forgone.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, has the Minister received any estimates from local authority organisations as to the financial level of help that will be required as a result of the policy?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I understand that we are awaiting that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that she said that, under the Children Act, it is open to local authorities to ignore the criteria for the provision of free school meals in any case where they consider it to be in the interests of children?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that I can better the answer that I gave to the noble Baroness. If the family would have been eligible, I understand that, subject to the time period of the appeal, the ruling is the same.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew19"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Baroness agree that her replies so far could be described as more sympathetic than specific? Can she tell us when the next meeting with local authority negotiators is scheduled?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-02_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, it is up to them to decide when they wish to speak to the department. After all, it is they who are collecting the information to present to the department.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-02_para11"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 1, I wish also to speak to Amendments Nos. 2 and 3. All the amendments to this consolidation Bill appearing on the Marshalled List in my name arise from the making of the Leicestershire (City of Leicester and District of Rutland) (Structural Change) Order 1996 which was approved by your Lordships' House a few days ago, on 28th February.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-02_para12"></a>The order makes provision for the reorganisation of local government in Leicestershire. One consequence of the changes made by the order is that the names of the local government areas which make up the Leicestershire Police Area will change from 1st April 1997, although the geographical extent of the police area will remain the same. Article 5 of the 1996 order amends Schedule 1A to the Police Act 1964 which sets out the descriptions of the police areas. The purpose of Amendment No. 1 is to make equivalent provision in relation to Schedule 1 to the Bill which is derived from Schedule 1A to the 1964 Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-02_para13"></a>As I indicated, the changes in the names of the local government areas making up the Leicestershire Police Area will not take place until 1st April 1997.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-02_para14"></a>Amendment No. 2 makes the appropriate transitional provision to ensure that until that date the Leicestershire Police Area is described by reference to the existing local government area. Amendment No. 3 revokes Article 5 of the 1996 order which is no longer required in the light of the repeal of the Police Act 1964 by the Bill. When the Bill was considered by the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills, the committee was made aware of the possible need to bring forward the amendments. The amendments have since been approved by the chairman of the joint committee, my noble and learned friend Lord Lloyd of Berwick, for whose assistance I am most grateful. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-03_spmin5"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor</B>  moved Amendment No. 30:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 4, line 5, at end insert ("the fourteenth day after").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para15"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 32 and 71.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para16"></a>I have tabled these amendments in order to address the concerns expressed in Committee with regard to the commencement date of the period of reflection and consideration, where it is necessary for notice of the statement of marital breakdown to be served on the other party to a marriage. My noble friend Lord Coleraine moved an amendment in Committee to provide that where the statement of marital breakdown is made by only one party, the period of reflection and consideration should not commence until the statement has been served on the other party. There must, however, be absolute certainty as to the date of the period's commencement, as the divorce or separation process depends upon the passing of a prescribed period of time in order to establish irretrievable breakdown. There is no certain way of recording the date on which notice of the statement has been received by the other party, and in fact that party could go on denying receipt indefinitely. Not only therefore would there be uncertainty in this method, but it could give rise to deliberate obstruction on the part of the other party.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para17"></a>The date on which a statement is received by the court is a recorded fact and it is for this reason that the commencement of the period should depend upon this date. However, I have decided to extend the commencement date to 14 days from the date on which the statement is received by the court to allow for service of the statement on the other party. Rules which the Lord Chancellor is empowered to make under Clause 10 can then provide for the statement to be served on the other party within 14 days from the time it is received by the court.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para18"></a>Amendment No. 32 then takes the matter further by providing that where a statement of marital breakdown has been made by one party and rules require the court to serve a copy of the statement on the other party, the court may, on the application of that other party, extend the period for reflection and consideration where failure to comply with the rules of service has caused inordinate delay in the service of the statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para19"></a>Amendment No. 71 is necessary in order to enable rules made by the Lord Chancellor to provide for service of the statement and the circumstances in which such service can be dispensed with or substituted. It is obviously necessary for the purposes of the provisions contained in Amendments Nos. 30 and 32 that rules <P>


<a name="column_11"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 11</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>clearly set out the requirements as to service. It is more helpful for this to be done along with other rules relating directly to the statement and which are made under Clause 10, rather than generally in rules of court.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para20"></a>I think that these amendments adequately address the concerns expressed in Committee. They allow for additional time to be granted to parties where there has been inordinate delay, but place the responsibility for proving why there is good cause for extending the period on the party who alleges delay in service of the statement. This should protect against delaying tactics and deliberate obstruction on the part of the other party. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Coleraine: </B>   My Lords, I am glad to hear from my noble and learned friend that the period for reflection and consideration will start 14 days after the court receives the statement. I quite understand that there are very good reasons why the amendment that I proposed in Committee could not be accepted in substance. I only hope that my noble and learned friend can assure the House that no difficulties will arise in a number of possible situations that can be envisaged. One is the absence on holiday abroad of the spouse who is being served with a statement. The other is possibly the spouse who served the statement interfering and seeing that the other spouse does not receive the statement. I am sure that rules of court cover these matters, but they are of concern.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-03_spmin6"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend. The purpose of the power to extend given to the court is to cope with any difficulties of the sort to which he referred. It is a fairly general power to deal with matters of that kind and I expect it to be able to be capable of dealing with the sort of circumstances that he mentioned.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para21"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness David </B>   moved Amendment No. 31:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 4, line 6, at end insert ("except where subsection (8) applies.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para22"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in the absence of my noble friend Lord Irvine, I am moving these amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para23"></a>Amendments Nos. 31 and 43 are in my noble friend's name. Amendment No. 43 is the substantive one which inserts a new subsection at page 4, line 21 which would read:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The court shall have the power to abridge the period for reflection and consideration if (but only if) the requirements of section 2(1) are satisfied and the court is satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of the parties or of any relevant children to dissolve the marriage before such period has elapsed". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
My Amendment No. 35 has the same purpose, which is, in very special cases, for the court to abridge the period for reflection and consideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para24"></a>The point is that it would be a great pity if the vast improvement which the Bill makes--a mandatory year for reflection and consideration--were made excessively restrictive by robbing the judges of any discretion to do justice in the rare cases where a divorce <P>


<a name="column_12"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 12</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be granted before the expiry of the 12-month period. Just as there are special cases where a year may be too short, so also the law should be flexible enough to allow for special cases where one year is too long.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para25"></a>I repeat the telling example given by my noble friend Lord Irvine in Committee on 23rd January:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A man who was separated from his wife more than 10 years ago was diagnosed in February of last year as dying from cancer. He and his wife had not divorced; neither of them had seen any need to do so. He was living with his new partner. She became pregnant. He wanted, so far as he could, to provide for her and their child after his death. His lawful wife was entirely supportive. She too was living with a new partner. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The lawful husband had substantial pension policies. Within a few months he was able to obtain a divorce from his wife with her full agreement and of course the co-operation of the courts. The divorce was finalised in June of that year; he died in September. His new wife now has the benefit of a widow's pension under his occupational scheme, to the great benefit of not only herself, but also of their child. Happily, the child was born last summer".--[Official Report, 23/1/96; col. 961.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I think that is a really telling example. No doubt it could be said that the couple should have divorced earlier, and in a sense therefore they were the authors of their own misfortune. I suppose that is true, but they did not. It would be extraordinarily harsh to say that they have only themselves to blame. I believe that no court should be prevented from doing justice in such an exceptional situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para26"></a>Presumably, the noble and learned Lord will argue, as he did in Committee, that a year for reflection and consideration is the minimum period necessary to demonstrate that the marriage has irreparably broken down. I accept that in the generality of cases. The question is whether that is necessary in every case. I suggest that the example I gave illustrates that it is not necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para27"></a>Noble Lords will observe how narrow is the exception proposed under Amendment No. 43. The court has to be satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of the parties or any relevant children to dissolve the marriage before the year has elapsed. The word "necessary" signifies the highest conceivable threshold that would have to be surmounted before the subsection could be invoked. Necessary means that which is indispensable; that which cannot be done without. It is in sharp contradistinction to the word "reasonable", which would signify much broader discretion in the courts.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para28"></a>The noble and learned Lord also argued in Committee that there should be no circumstances in which the one-year period should be shortened--I quote him--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"because it is necessary to send out a clear signal that marriage is an important relationship and that a year is required before it can be dissolved once one or both of the parties has initiated the necessary procedure". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I do not believe that the clear signal is diminished by so narrow an exception as proposed by the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para29"></a>I observed from my reading of the discussions at Committee stage that the noble and learned Lord did not respond directly to the example given in Committee by my noble friend Lord Irvine. I invite him to do so. Does not he agree that justice obviously requires that a divorce be granted in less than a year in that case, and that the Bill should not be so rigid as to deny it?
<P>


<a name="column_13"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 13</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para30"></a>As I said, Amendment No. 35 has the same aim but the application would be made by,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a person authorised by order of the Lord Chancellor". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
That I hope will make the amendment more acceptable to him. Originally, the idea was that the application would be made by local authority social services; but, arguably, it might be more appropriate to empower court welfare officers or perhaps a guardian ad litem.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para31"></a>The point of having an authorised person rather than enabling the parties to make such an application is that we understand that the noble and learned Lord is determined not to permit a breach of the compulsory year because his main argument against the current fault-based divorce and his main defence of the Bill's reforms are that the new legislation prevents a "quickie" divorce. If he allows the parties to apply for the year to be abridged, he loses that line of defence.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para32"></a>The amendment is, therefore, framed to allow for the extreme circumstance, when neutral third parties are concerned that children are suffering because of the delay in obtaining a divorce. For example, social services might become involved because of concerns raised by the child's school or doctor. Alternatively, the court welfare officer might become aware of the situation because of Children Act private hearings during the year.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para33"></a>What kind of cases would be likely to trigger such an application? First, it must be accepted that the cases would not be about children needing to be protected from one of the parents. Children Act Section 8 contact orders (access), residence orders (custody) and prohibited steps or specific issue orders (about schooling or religion) can all be obtained during or before the compulsory year of reflection. Similarly, occupation orders under the Bill can be obtained during the year in cases of domestic violence.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para34"></a>So the kind of cases where a social worker or court welfare officer might want to apply for the final divorce to be speeded up would be relatively rare and would be about issues not directly about the child's upbringing or protection. For example, a speedy divorce might be needed for reasons of terminal illness, as in the case mentioned earlier by my noble friend; or where there were questions of nationality or immigration which would crucially affect the children--for example, where the children have British nationality but the mother does not and will be deported if she does not remarry, or where a new partner has a job opportunity in Britain but cannot enter without the citizenship obtained through remarriage. Some states will not allow cohabiting couples to enter and that can cause particular problems where an individual wishes to enter one of those states to fulfil an employment contract, and so on, and the couple wish to go abroad with the children of the family, as a family. A speedy divorce may be needed where the children are in poverty, which is affecting their welfare because the financial arrangements cannot be finalised until after the divorce; or where the children are suffering extreme psychological and emotional distress from the delay in finalising the proceedings--for example, if one of their parents has committed a grave offence, perhaps killed one of their siblings, but is still <P>


<a name="column_14"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 14</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>lawfully married to the other parent and is damaging the family through delaying tactics in the divorce proceedings; or in order to clarify the child's paternity, for example, where the new partner is in fact the child's father.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para35"></a>This amendment was not discussed at Committee stage. It has the support of a very wide range of organisations. Although sympathetic to the noble and learned Lord's determination to hold firm, everyone believes that there must be some machinery to allow the 12-month period to be shortened, albeit with great difficulty and in very exceptional circumstances, if the welfare of children is threatened. As my noble friend said in Committee, why may the year be lengthened under Clause 9 but, if these amendments are to be opposed, never abridged in special and unusual cases? There should be flexibility both ways. Judges should be trusted to identify those unusual and special cases in which one year is either too long or too short. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-03_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendments and in particular Amendment No. 43, to which I put my name. This is a "free vote" Bill but I trust that I shall not infringe that principle if I observe that Procrustes was not a great liberal. I understand very well the pressures that the noble and learned Lord is under to keep down any exemptions to the one-year period. Nevertheless, in terms of realism and common humanity, we must allow that there are limits to the extent to which one single legal principle may fit every individual case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para36"></a>These amendments are only concerned with exceptional cases. They are concerned with cases where significant physical or mental harm is likely to result to the parents or to the children from a delay in the divorce. They cover a number of possible situations--for example, cases of mental health. I personally have known cases in which it was essential to the mental health of one of the parties that the marriage should be dissolved; that the parties should feel free of it and be able within their own minds to start again. In the cases that I have known, happily, recovery was in the end complete.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para37"></a>That is not the only case. There are cases in which it is vitally in the interests of the children for the marriage to be dissolved and they should know that they will not need to deal with the person again. The case in my mind was referred to the local women's refuge. I apologise to the House for mentioning the details but we must deal with reality. The father was in the habit of buggering the children with a carefully sharpened pencil. In a case like that, divorce within less than a year was very much in the interests of the children, the mother and everybody else, including social services, which would otherwise have had to pick up the pieces.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para38"></a>That is the kind of case that I have in mind when I speak of Procrustes. We do not want to be precluded from showing mercy in such a case for the sake of a formula or an abstract principle, however good that principle may be. There are also straightforward cases <P>


<a name="column_15"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 15</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of domestic violence. One can very easily underrate the determination and indeed the cunning of a man of property who approaches his wife in that spirit after divorce.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para39"></a>I appreciate that the recent tragic events in Birmingham and Bristol are sub judice. Nevertheless, I hope I may say that I have received representations in relation to these particular amendments from a close neighbour of the dead woman in that case. I believe that the relevance is clear enough.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para40"></a>There is also a case which was reported in the Independent on 1st February concerning a woman who refused to allow a contact order with her children and is facing the threat of gaol. The man had raped her and threatened her with guns. He appeared to have no willingness to cease to do so. In those circumstances she believed that contact was not in the interests of the children. I am inclined to take her point.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-03_para41"></a>As long as there are dealings through lawyers it is perfectly easy to discover addresses. I have known cases of men of this type impersonating police officers in order to get information. As I said, determination cannot be underrated. Not everybody involved in this type of case, especially if they are accidentally involved, appreciates the risks involved. The risk of unauthorised disclosure of an address is considerable, when every such unauthorised disclosure may risk a life. These risks are not to be multiplied beyond necessity. So I believe that there are cases where it is conducive to the safety, and possibly even the life, of some of the parties that it should be possible to conclude a divorce quickly and to put the whole issue behind us. I am happy to support these amendments.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Elles: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl, Lord Russell, has put forward cogent reasons why there must be exceptional cases where exemption must be granted. I am a little concerned that Amendments Nos. 35 and 43 are not parallel.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-04_para0"></a>Amendment No. 35 mentions an,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"application by a person authorised by order of the Lord Chancellor", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
which means that the cases are clearly limited. Amendment No. 43 states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it is necessary in the interests of the parties or of any relevant children". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Amendment No. 35 refers only to the,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"best interests of any child of the marriage". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Therefore, if my noble and learned friend is going to consider having this specific principle of exemption in very dire cases, it should be under the authority of somebody nominated by the Lord Chancellor himself or herself. It should also cover both the parties as well as any children of the marriage.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   My Lords, I support the point that my noble friend Lady Elles has made. It will not surprise the House to recognise that I am very concerned about shortening the period of a year, which I would prefer to see extended. I can just see that there may be very limited cases where that might be necessary.
<P>


<a name="column_16"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 16</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-04_para1"></a>I listened to the noble Baroness, Lady David, whose sincerity in all this I greatly respect. I felt that the longer she spoke the more cases she adduced that might be covered by this amendment. Therefore, one has to recognise that once one widens the number of cases which can be shortened, one is going to get into a similar position to that which occurred under the 1969 Act when everything was speeded up by the special procedure a few years later. Once again, I believe that we have to be very careful about the signal we are sending out.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-04_para2"></a>The same applies to the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Russell. I believe he said at the beginning of his remarks that he wanted the amendment to cover "significant physical and mental harm", which was undefined. That was a very sweeping statement. There may be very exceptional cases--the noble Earl quoted one--which I can just see. I shall be very unhappy if this measure is widened and we find that the year is being shortened--it could easily be shortened--by an increasing number of, as yet, undefined specific cases.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, if my noble and learned friend is disposed to look kindly on this amendment, which I rather doubt, I hope that, following the remarks of my noble friend Lady Young, he will look at it only under the most straitened circumstances. It could easily be the beginning of the opening of the floodgate which removes the one-year minimum which is an essential feature of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-04_para3"></a>As the amendment addresses the question of changing the minimum time, I hope that in replying to the debate the noble Baroness will explain why she is considering changing it in one direction only. There must be cases where an extension is appropriate, as, for instance, when one of the parties is on a foreign posting and the spouse cannot accompany. In that case, no prospect of reconciliation will exist until the spouse returns to this country, which might be, let us say, in nine months' time.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-04_para4"></a>As regards the compellingly unpleasant case quoted by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, I would have thought--I am not a lawyer and I realise that I may be mistaken--that the protection required may be that of a court order and not necessarily the acceleration of the separation of the parties by divorce proceedings. That said, I believe that we should go very carefully indeed before we reduce what many of us regard as an already irreducible minimum.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Habgood: </B>   My Lords, it gives me great pleasure to agree with what the noble Baroness, Lady Young, has said on this occasion. Like her, I listened with growing alarm to the number of cases adduced by those putting forward these amendments, particularly when one bears in mind the report from the family mediators. I believe that in about one-third of the cases that come for mediation, some element of violence is discerned within the marriage. If that is the kind of proportion that we are talking about, it seems to me that we are opening a very wide door indeed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, the principle on which this Bill rests is that the irretrievable breakdown <P>


<a name="column_17"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 17</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of a marriage shall be arrived at in the situation where the relationship has broken down and has remained so for at least a year, notwithstanding any efforts that the parties could put forward to heal the relationship. That appears to me to be a general principle. Therefore I am extremely slow to make any exception to it at all, because the kinds of hardships which have been mentioned in the examples given by the noble Baroness and the noble Earl are examples which can be dealt with, at least for the most part, by the protection which is available under the provisions dealing with domestic violence. As regards the case to which the noble Earl, Lord Russell, referred, I would certainly think that that was possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-04_para5"></a>The noble Earl said that as long as lawyers are in contact there is always the chance of a leak about the address of the other party. I expect that is true, but there are other sources of leaks as well as lawyers' offices. It does not appear to me that that is a good reason for allowing a divorce to take place more quickly. It seems to me that the dissolution of the marriage is distinct from the protection of parties and children during the marriage. The purpose of Part III is to ensure that there are effective means of protection of parties and children from violence during the marriage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-04_para6"></a>The case which the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, mentioned previously, and which the noble Baroness mentioned today, is a very special circumstance. However, that occurred under the existing law. The fact is that, if the law is changed, in the future people will have to take account of what that new law is. There is an adage which suggests that bad law can arise from too much consideration of particularly hard cases. We need a principle in this matter which emphasises the importance of the year as the test of whether a ground for divorce exists. I cannot see that the mere existence of circumstances such as have been mentioned in any way shows that that was not so. Of course, I agree that, where there is cruelty and the like, the prospects for reconciliation are not good. On the other hand, even in that situation there are the elements of protection to which I have referred. For my part, therefore, I am not at all anxious to make any exceptions in this area. That is one reason why I think that it is equally difficult to extend the period. One wants a definite period which is clear, about which everyone knows, and in respect of which there are no exceptions. That is the way in which I invite your Lordships to deal with the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-04_para7"></a>This appears to me to be an important matter of principle in the Bill and I suggest that your Lordships deal with it in that way. I had assumed that the principle of the Bill was so strong that a free vote would not be required on this matter, which is more incidental than other matters relating to the grounds for divorce.

<A NAME="60304-04_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, this has been a useful discussion and I am grateful to all who have taken part in it. I appreciate, of course, that my noble friend's amendment and mine are slightly different. Points have been made about that. Obviously, that needs to be discussed, but I have been impressed that there has been a certain amount of support for the fact that there could be the exceptional case which needs exceptional treatment. I am glad to have the powerful support of the noble Earl, Lord Russell. Both the noble Baronesses, Lady Elles and Lady Young, agreed that there could possibly be special cases. I am heartened by that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-04_para8"></a>I realise that the amendments have probably been drawn too wide and need to be tightened up. I must admit that the noble and learned Lord's response was rather as I had expected, but I am surprised that he does not see that there could be some special case which needs a special provision. I should like to take the two amendments away and to discuss them with my noble friend in the light of the discussions that we have had today. I think that it is pretty well inevitable that we shall come forward with one amendment at the next stage of the Bill, but for today I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-05_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment was debated very late on Thursday when many of your Lordships were not able to be in your places. It is an important amendment which needs to be fully discussed. It proposes an extension of the 12-month period for reflection to 18 months in cases where there are children under 16 in the family and where only one parent has lodged a statement of breakdown. It also contains a provision for the court to reduce that period to 12 months, but not less, where to do so would be in the best interests of the child.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-05_para1"></a>The amendment would give more time for more couples to achieve reconciliation. That means that fewer children would suffer the trauma of permanent breakdown and divorce. I believe that the amendment deserves to be fully debated and, if necessary, voted upon at Third Reading. Therefore, I do not propose to move it today.

<BR>
("( ) Subsection (6) applies if, at any time during the period for reflection and consideration, the parties give joint notice to the court that they are attempting a reconciliation but require additional time.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-05_para3"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, this is a drafting amendment which is intended to clarify the position where people attempt reconciliation during a period of reflection and consideration. It arises from our consideration of this part of the Bill in Committee. I should like to speak also to Amendment No. 38, which is an amendment to this amendment, but I assume from what my noble and learned friend has already said that he will not seek to move it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-05_para4"></a>Clause 6(6) provides for the period of reflection and consideration to be suspended where a couple jointly give notice that they require time to attempt reconciliation. The noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, expressed concern in Committee about the situation of couples wishing to attempt reconciliation but who do not want to stop the running of the one-year period. The noble Lord thought that, because there was no specific mention of reconciliation without notification to the court, parties might think that it was not an option open to them and that consequently attempts at reconciliation would be discouraged. That is the last thing that I want to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-05_para5"></a>I indicated in Committee that I would consider whether that provision could be further clarified. The amendment that I have proposed is directed at emphasising that the time that the parties ask for in giving notice to the court of an attempt at reconciliation is additional to the one-year period for reflection and consideration. The parties can attempt reconciliation at any time during the period without affecting the running of the period for reflection and consideration but, if they want more time, they can suspend the running of the <P>


<a name="column_20"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>period by jointly giving notice. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent couples from privately attempting reconciliation or to prejudice them if they do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-05_para6"></a>I have already spoken about similar amendments relating to reconciliation and I do not think that I need to elaborate on them at this stage, except to say that, as far as I am concerned, the whole purpose of that period is to encourage the possibility of reconciliation.

<A NAME = "60304-06_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, on behalf of my noble friend Lord Archer of Sandwell I should like to move Amendment No. 63 as an amendment to Clause 8. The amendment inserts at the end of the clause subsection (6), which reads:

<a name="column_23"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where a divorce order is granted on the basis that the provisions of subsection (2) or Schedule 1 are satisfied and it is subsequently shown that those provisions were not in fact satisfied this shall not operate to invalidate the divorce order concerned". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-06_para8"></a>This is a probing amendment which I believe raises a new point. It is unclear from the Bill what the effect on a divorce order will be if someone falsely declares that arrangements have been made for the future, or falsely states that he or she comes within the exceptions provided for in Schedule 1. The amendment is designed to clarify whether the Government intend that false declarations will make any subsequent divorce bogus or will have no effect upon a subsequent divorce order. I hope that the noble and learned Lord will be able to enlighten us on the point. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-06_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, it is a fundamental procedural requirement of the Bill that evidence of arrangements must be produced to the court in order to satisfy the requirements of Clause 8, unless one of the exemptions in Schedule 1 applies. If a divorce order is made and it is subsequently found that the requirements of Clause 8 have not been met, that is to say, evidence of arrangements has not been put before the court, that order should be void.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-06_para9"></a>I have carefully considered this amendment. Although I believe that if faced with a case where Clause 8 has not been complied with it is likely that a court will declare an order void, nevertheless I believe that this should be made clear on the face of the Bill. I will bring forward a Government amendment to reflect the intention that a divorce or separation order that is obtained without the provisions of Clause 8 and Schedule 1 having been complied with shall be void, but no person shall be entitled to challenge the validity of the order on the ground that the information contained in the declarations mentioned in Clause 8(2)(c) and (d) is incorrect. The courts would still be able to pronounce an order void or voidable in other circumstances according to general principles, for example complete lack of service. I hope that I have explained what I have it in mind to do in answer to Amendment No. 63. We may be able to deal with that by Third Reading.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the noble and learned Lord for his response. I feel that putting down the amendment has been worthwhile.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-06_para11"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, it may be that the last response will carry some weight also in relation to Amendment No. 64. However, I believe that I should move this amendment in order to find out the response of the noble and learned Lord. Clause 8 provides, in conjunction with Schedule 1, that arrangements for the future must be made during the period for consideration and reflection, subject to limited exceptions. This clause <P>


<a name="column_24"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 24</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>represents a change from the Law Commission's original proposals and should be removed for the following reasons. First, it will place a considerable bargaining chip in the hands of a recalcitrant or spiteful spouse. He or she will be able to insist that certain arrangements are made as the price of granting the other party a divorce.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-06_para12"></a>Secondly, a number of problems exist with the exceptions to the rules as currently drafted as they are unclear and incomplete. The net effect is that uncertainty will be increased. That is likely to lead to increased litigation. Examples of possible difficulties are that the provisions in Clause 8(2)(c) and (d), which relate to the financial arrangements, as supplemented by Schedule 1, may lead to fraud. Thirdly, these proposals are untested. The proposed provisions are not duplicated in other common law jurisdictions where a system of no fault exists. In Australia, for instance, arrangements for finance and children are dealt with entirely separate from the divorce itself. I should say that I am speaking also to Amendment No. 117 which is consequential upon the removal of Clause 8. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-06_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, the provisions of Clause 8 and the schedule are essential to what is in contemplation here. It is vital that before a divorce is granted the parties should face up to the responsibilities that have arisen in their marriage in such a way as to make all the necessary provisions for the future. That does not happen at the moment. So far as I know, it has not been provided for in other jurisdictions at present, as the noble Baroness said. I cannot think of a more practical way of facing up to the responsibilities of marriage than this way.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-06_para13"></a>To have the divorce first and to leave over these matters is to leave over the essential dealing with the responsibilities of the marriage, which are fundamental. For example, it is clear that if someone is going to undertake new relationships and new responsibilities, it is important that, so far as possible, before that is done that person should know the nature of the commitments they have arising out of the earlier marriage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-06_para14"></a>It is sometimes said against me by those who are not minded to accept the approach of the Bill that I am seeking in some way to depart from forcing people so far as possible to face up to their responsibilities before a marriage is dissolved. This is the provision that does that. It is an important and practical one.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-06_para15"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell, referred on the last occasion to Professor Cretney. Professor Cretney has indicated to me that he regards this as an important improvement and modification to what the Law Commission proposed. It is sometimes said that all of these proposals are the Law Commission's proposals. Of course they are not. In this respect there is a most important departure from them. It is necessary to have this. It will require a different approach to divorce from that which is available under the present system.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-06_para16"></a>I am of course always willing to consider whether improvements to the drafting of these provisions can be made, but on the principle of the provisions, as challenged in Amendments Nos. 64 and 67, I hope that <P>


<a name="column_25"></a>

<A NAME="60304-06_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, before the noble and learned Lord sits down, I wonder whether he can clarify a point raised by the noble Baroness about what happens if a party wilfully refuses to agree to any financial arrangement.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-06_spmin3"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, that point is dealt with in the schedule of exceptions. The court is pretty astute and can deal with such a situation. Schedule 1 deals with it. That is why I said that drafting matters are different, but in cases where that has happened and the court thinks that that is what is happening, the court has power to deal with the matter. There is always a difficulty about such problems. The only way to deal with them is to leave them to the court to handle in the light of all the circumstances that obtain.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60304-07_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor</B>  moved Amendment No. 65:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 5, line 35, leave out ("grave") and insert ("substantial").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-07_para2"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, I should like to speak also to Amendments Nos. 66, 67, 68, 69 and 70. As your Lordships will appreciate, in Committee there was a full and valuable debate about the provisions and workings of the hardship bar on divorce. I intimated in Committee that I wished to consider in more detail the points made and I have now tabled these amendments to address some of the concerns which were raised.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-07_para3"></a>One of the main concerns which was expressed in Committee centred around the rarity with which the hardship bar is invoked. The view was expressed, in particular by the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, and my noble and learned friend Lord Simon of Glaisdale, that the bar was currently something of a "dead letter", and amendments were tabled to test whether the language of the clause could be amended to make its application less rigid.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-07_para4"></a>Your Lordships will recall that the bar provisions at the moment apply to five-year separation divorces only, which form a small proportion of the total number, the vast bulk presently being based on fault grounds with no bar applicable to them. The Bill extends the bar provisions to all divorces. I share the concerns that the hardship bar should be a meaningful provision. I have <P>


<a name="column_26"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 26</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>therefore decided to amend the clause in the direction suggested in Committee by replacing the word "grave" in relation to the hardship experienced on dissolution of the marriage with the word "substantial", which is a less strict test.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-07_para5"></a>In terms of the relevance of the hardship bar, I have mentioned that it is intended to apply to all divorces. Your Lordships will be aware that it is not just financial hardship that is in question but other hardships as well. People have sometimes not understood that fully. It is a bar that applies to substantial financial or other hardship.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-07_para6"></a>The other amendments which I propose to make relate to children. This again arises out of the Committee stage. The welfare of children in divorce was referred to in Committee in the context of the hardship bar, in particular by my noble friends Lady Young and Lady Elles and the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg. Although they mentioned it in particular, I am sure that they are concerns which we all share. In the light of those considerations and the remark of my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter when the question of children was being discussed, I have decided to propose these amendments to extend the provisions of the bar on divorce to encompass the children of the family as well as the parties to the marriage. In that context, I would emphasise that in all cases in order for the hardship to be applied the court must be satisfied that the actual dissolution of the marriage will cause substantial financial or other hardship to a child or children.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-07_para7"></a>I should also emphasise that an application for an order preventing divorce can be applied for only by a party to the marriage, even if this application is asserting that the dissolution will result in hardship to children. In my view, it would place an intolerable burden on children to provide that they themselves might be involved in making such an application, as we discussed earlier. They could easily be put under pressure by one or other parent to apply for such an order--indeed, by other well-meaning persons--without any regard to the enormous responsibility that that would place on such a child. We cannot have a situation in which we pitch child against parent in a battle about whether the marriage should be legally dissolved.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-07_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 67 and 70 are intended simply to emphasise that where there are children in the family their interests must be taken into account when the court is considering all the circumstances of the case in order to determine whether it is wrong to dissolve the marriage. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="60304-07_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor for the amendments that he has tabled to Clause 9. They are in response to points raised in Committee and I am glad to see them. I am sure that he was completely misinterpreted in his comments relating to Amendments Nos. 67 and 70 concerning children and that there was never a suggestion that children should appear in court. I support the noble and learned Lord in what he said.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-07_para9"></a>However, I should be grateful if he would clarify a major issue of principle. He said that one of the criticisms in respect of what was originally Clause 10, <P>


<a name="column_27"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 27</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>but is now Clause 9, was that the hardship bar had never been used or, as I understand it, had been used on only one occasion. I also understood him to say that it applied only to five-year separations and that under the Bill it would apply to all divorces. I do not understand how the same principle can be seen to work in respect of all divorces when it failed to work in respect of five-year divorces. I understand that the issue was not a question of time but the interpretation of the law.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-07_para10"></a>The noble and learned Lord mentioned Dr. Cretney from whom I have received a letter on this matter. As there is a legal point which I am not sure I fully understand I hope that the noble and learned Lord will explain it to me and that he will forgive me if I quote from the letter. Dr. Cretney refers to the fact that the hardship bar is designed to help in grave financial or other hardship and I take the point that that has been amended. He states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"These words appear in the existing law; but are rarely invoked--largely because the courts have consistently held that hardship must result from divorce (i.e. the ending of the legal status of marriage) rather than from the breakdown of the relationship and the circumstances which led to it. There is no reported case in which a defence based on hardship other than financial hardship has been successful". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Dr. Cretney goes on to state:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The 1969 concordat between the Law Commission and the Archbishop of Canterbury's group (which led to the enactment of the present divorce law)"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
that is, the 1969 law--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"envisaged that the court would be required to refuse divorce if satisfied that, having regard to the conduct and interests of the parties and the interests of the children, it would be wrong to end the marriage; but the terms of the legislation are much narrower. The court has no power under the existing law to refuse a divorce merely because the applicant has been guilty of outrageous behaviour; and it will have no such power under the Bill currently before the House of Lords". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-07_para11"></a>I see that there is a distinction between hardship which must result from divorce and hardship resulting from the breakdown of the relationship. However, as someone who is not a lawyer that seems a narrow point of law. If that is the point of law on which it has not been possible to operate the hardship bar--and it is a most serious point--I would be grateful if my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor could explain the difficulty and assure me and the House that Clause 9 will not suffer from the defects from which a similar clause suffered in the preceding Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, as I am sure is every Member of your Lordships' House and the organisations concerned with the welfare of children, for the introduction of the amendments, which serve an important purpose in improving the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   My Lords, when the 1969 Act was before your Lordships strong objections were voiced to the requirement that in order to halt a divorce after five years' separation a wife against whom nothing substantial could be alleged had to show grave hardship before she was cast off to her detriment. That anxiety was voiced by Lord Hodson, the foremost matrimonial <P>


<a name="column_28"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 28</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>judge of the time, and by Lady Summerskill, who was ever vigilant of the interests of married women. They asked: why should it be grave hardship? Indeed, they asked: why should she be required to show any hardship, but in any case why grave hardship?
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-07_para12"></a>As my noble and learned friend has explained, that bar in the 1969 Act, which was consolidated in 1973, was relevant only to divorce after five years' separation; the divorce by repudiation. The issue became much more serious when one found that the requirement to show grave hardship appeared in this Bill; in other words, where there could be repudiation of a spouse against whom nothing substantial could be alleged after one year's notice. Those voices, those considerations and those concerns were raised in Committee and my noble and learned friend has gone a long way towards meeting them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-07_para13"></a>I have only one question about the substitution of the word "substantial" for the word "grave". That is on the ground that the law does not generally take any account of insubstantial consideration. It is always expressed in a Latin tag, which I shall not repeat because I know that lawyers' pronunciation of Latin is highly offensive to your Lordships. The fact remains that the law does not regard taking any account of insubstantial consideration. It seems to me that the court might be alerted, therefore, that something more is required by the use of the word "substantial". Why cannot one simply leave it out and provide for only hardship? That argument relates to Amendments Nos. 65 and 68.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-07_para14"></a>As regards Amendments Nos. 66, 67, 69 and 70, it remains only to express appreciation for the way in which my noble and learned friend has met our views.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Elles: </B>   My Lords, if I may continue for a moment with what I was going to say earlier, I understand what my noble and learned friend has said about the interests of the children, but I would like to ask him a couple of questions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-08_para0"></a>When we were discussing Amendment No. 9 which brought in criteria from the Children Act, it was mentioned that this might have been considered within the terms of Clause 9. Whether that aspect is covered by the interests of the children I am not sure. What criteria are the court to use when assessing the interests of the child? Will Section 1 of the Children Act automatically apply? As I understand it, the Children Act works only where there are disputes between the parents or where, as set out in Section 1:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a court determines any question with respect to ... the upbringing of a child; ... or the administration of a child's property or the application of any income arising from it". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Would the interests of the child, therefore, under Clause 9 be confined to those aspects or would there be a general view taken of the interests of the child? If so, what criteria would be used? Could my Amendment No. 9, discussed in Committee, be taken into consideration?
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-08_para1"></a>Obviously my noble and learned friend cannot give me an answer straightaway but I would be grateful if he would consider this. At the moment there is no definition of what the interests of the child are.
<P>


<a name="column_29"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 29</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-08_para2"></a>Secondly, could we have some slight explanation of what my noble and learned friend considers would cover hardship? There will probably be quite a lot of variation in what a court or a judge might decide would include hardship. Would it include where a child had to be removed from the home in which he or she was living and the mother and the child had to apply for a council flat after having lived in a rather luxurious house? Would that change of style and general quality of life be considered as hardship? Would that be a ground for preventing a divorce being granted; or does my noble and learned friend intend to leave a great deal of latitude to the court in defining both the interests of the child and the hardship? At the moment, although there are very good intentions, I wonder how in fact it will work out.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Phillimore: </B>   My Lords, would the noble and learned Lord indicate how he proposes that hardship to a child of a family be established to the satisfaction of any court? The noble Baroness, Lady Young, referred to the fact that it is undesirable--and I am sure we all agree--that a child should attend court and give evidence. But even the intervention of a third party such as a welfare officer could cause considerable distress to a child. Children are quick to perceive that they may be being asked to decide matters. That occurs, of course, in residence and contact matters where a welfare officer intervenes. I suggest that that is to be avoided, and I would welcome some indication as to how this will be avoided.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Habgood:  </B>   My Lords, I would welcome a little clarification from the noble and learned Lord about Clause 9(2)(b):
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>""that it would be wrong, in all the circumstances (including the conduct of the parties), for the marriage to be dissolved". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
In our earlier discussions we said that this was the area of the Bill in which the concept of fault might come back into the arrangements for divorce. It is a little curious to discuss this entirely under the heading of hardship. There are two issues here--hardship and justice--and Subsection (2)(b) is basically about justice. Is it envisaged that a court might decide that arrangements made under Clause 8 of the Bill, although agreed by the parties, seem manifestly unfair in the light of the conduct of the parties, and that one could build into the Bill at this point some safeguard against the manipulation of one of the parties by the other?
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-08_time0"></A><H5>4.15 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-08_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, let me take these matters in order. My noble friend Lady Young asked about the reason for the previous bar not working. Of course, it did work to some extent and it was used in a few cases--for example, when there was a loss of a pension which was considered a grave financial hardship. It was also used in practice as affecting the course of negotiations. Some would call it a bargaining factor. Your Lordships will remember that the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, in Committee spoke of the existence of a bar as something that could influence <P>


<a name="column_30"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 30</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>parties even though they had not got to the stage of invoking the bar in connection with the settlement arrangements between the parties.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-08_para3"></a>This is a convenient point to answer the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Habgood. The question of conduct is relevant to the settlement of financial matters between the parties under the rules which presently exist and which, so far as this is concerned, I am not proposing to change; namely, that where there is conduct which it would be inequitable to leave out of account, that should be taken into account in considering the nature of the financial arrangements between the parties following a divorce. So that is fully taken account of in the present arrangements, in my submission.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-08_para4"></a>My next point, in amplification and answer to my noble friend Lady Young, is this: the court has no power to prevent parties separating. If people decide to live apart there is nothing the court can do about it, and therefore hardship arising from that is not something that the court can be expected to control. The hardship that the court can deal with is hardship resulting from something that is within the court's power; namely, the power to make an order dissolving the marriage. I have sought to make that as ample as it can be. The word "hardship" is a very general word which would cover a variety of circumstances; and I have put in the word "substantial" for the reason that my noble and learned friend Lord Simon of Glaisdale gave--that this is a Bill which I expect, when it becomes an Act, to be read by ordinary people, and we have tried to couch it in ordinary language.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-08_para5"></a>My noble and learned friend was kind enough to say at an earlier stage that the Bill was well drafted. This is one of the objectives--that it should be capable of being read and easily understood by those who are not familiar with the law. It may well be that an intelligent lay person may not be aware of the rule to which my noble and learned friend referred, and therefore I felt it right to put in the word "substantial" to indicate to a lay person that he or she would have to be able to identify something on which the court could find as occasioning hardship.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-08_para6"></a>The reason that this is a more ample provision than the previous one is that the word "grave" indicates a higher standard of hardship. I propose to reduce it to as low a standard as it can go to consistent with the point of principle that my noble and learned friend Lord Simon of Glaisdale has mentioned.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-08_para7"></a>My noble friend Lord Phillimore asked about the involvement of children. The hardship that this provision refers to is objective hardship of some kind. It is not just what the children feel about it but is something in the nature of objective hardship. There is a case in the books which illustrates in one particular example how this might arise. There was a case of a child in the books, but that child was older than would be classified as a child under this Bill. However, I take the example of a child who had a particular disability. The family home in which he lived was adapted in order that that disability could be catered for. When the husband and wife split up, they could not afford to keep <P>


<a name="column_31"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 31</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that home. As very often happens, the total available to the family was less than was available for the house. Therefore, they had to sell the house as a consequence of the break-up of the marriage. It would take some time to adapt another house for the purposes of the child's disability.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-08_para8"></a>That is an example of an objective type of hardship to a child of the marriage occasioned by the granting of a divorce at a particular time. Therefore, under this amendment, the divorce may well be postponed until new arrangements have been made, if it is possible at all to make them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-08_para9"></a>Of course, it is important that all the hardship which that provision deals with must be hardship occasioned by the order which the court may or may not make. Sadly, no one--courts nor anyone else--can remove the hardship which is caused by the breakdown of a marriage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-08_para10"></a>Those are the main matters which were raised. I believe strongly that the proper approach to this matter is the objective approach in relation to the hardship criterion. The hardship criterion is a necessary condition for this clause to be involved. Once that criterion is satisfied, the court takes account of all the factors mentioned in the later subsection.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-08_para11"></a>I take account of what my noble friend Lady Elles says and I think that it would be advisable to leave this matter very much in the hands of the courts--and it is very difficult for us to envisage all circumstances--as to what they consider to be the interests of the child affected. As my noble friend said, the Children Act is designed specifically to deal with matters affecting children; for example, where they should stay, with whom they should have contact, to which schools they should go, and so on. The Children Act is an elaborate and satisfactory framework for dealing with that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-08_para12"></a>In this regard, I believe that the word "interests" is a good word to describe that to which the court should have regard in relation to children. I feel fairly strongly that it would be inadvisable for us to try to define it further. It leaves the matter open to the courts to do justice in the particular circumstances which may come before them. Therefore, I hope that your Lordships will feel that this is a good step forward and that it would be wise to leave the matter as open as possible.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60304-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, before my noble and learned friend sits down, perhaps I may mention the fact that he has drawn attention to a very important drafting principle which we too often neglect. He has said, and rightly said, that this matter should be stated in terms of the principle to be applied by the courts. The alternative is to spell out in detail all the kinds of hypothetical circumstances which lengthen and ruin much of our legislation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   My Lords, before my noble and learned friend sits down, perhaps he will clarify still further the very important point about how the clause would be interpreted so that we can be quite sure that it would operate.
<P>


<a name="column_32"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 32</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-09_para0"></a>If I recall it correctly, he said that it had been used in a number of cases in the past and, if a couple had decided to separate, the court could not make a judgment on that because that is something which is freely entered into. However, I have reread Dr. Cretney's letter and that is not the point which he is making. I do not wish to take up the time of the House but I would find it extremely helpful if my noble and learned friend could write to me on this matter. I am extremely concerned. I believe that this amendment is a great improvement to the Bill but I wish to make quite sure that it will be operative when the Bill becomes law.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-09_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, assuming that the Bill becomes law with this amendment in it, as I certainly hope it will, it will become operative in the sense that the courts will have to apply it if the jurisdiction of the court is invoked in any particular case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-09_para1"></a>As I understood the letter from Dr. Cretney which my noble friend read, he makes the point that the hardship must be related to the order dissolving the marriage. That is a factor which limits the application of its jurisdiction. But that is an inevitable limitation on the jurisdiction. I have lowered the standard of hardship required from "grave" to "substantial", which, in the circumstances, is as low as it can go. It is then left to the courts to decide whether there is hardship in any particular case and whether or not an order should be made in the light of the circumstances referred to in the later part of the clause.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-09_para2"></a>I believe that that is all that I can say in dealing with the letter from Dr. Cretney and that I have dealt with the point he makes, which I understand entirely.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-09_para3"></a>I am extremely grateful to my noble friend Lord Renton, who is such an authority on the matter of statutory construction, for the comfort of his support. I agree that it is wise not to attempt to have too much detailed definition of such phrases. Apart from cluttering the statute book, it may well prevent the courts from doing justice in a particular case where otherwise they may be able to do so.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Faithfull: </B>   My Lords, before my noble and learned friend sits down, on several occasions he has made cross-references to the Children Act 1989. It may be helpful to those who must administer the Act to have those cross references to that Act in this Bill. That Act is extremely clear in relation to some of the points that have been raised this afternoon.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-09_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, it is extremely important that it is recognised generally that the Children Act is a comprehensive framework which deals with matters concerning the upbringing of children. That applies where the parents are divorced or whatever is the situation. To my mind, it is extremely important that that is preserved.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-09_para4"></a>Of course, there is a link with the Children Act in the provisions of the modified Clause 41 with which we shall deal later. Earlier today, I was looking with my colleagues who are helping me at the possibility of <P>


<a name="column_33"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 33</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>having a much earlier reference to the Children Act in this Bill. This Bill is not intended to deal exhaustively with the interests of children. On the contrary, I wish to point to the fact that the Children Act is a very useful and practical framework which deals with that. I am grateful to my noble friend for that suggestion and I shall try to pursue it. I cannot say for certain that I shall be successful, but I hope that I shall be.

They relate to Clause 10(2) which deals with rules that may be made by the Lord Chancellor requiring a legal representative to discuss certain matters with,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a party to a marriage", <P>

or to make various pieces of information available to that party.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-09_para16"></a>Paragraph (c) of the clause refers to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"whether he has given that party names and addresses of persons qualified to help...to effect a reconciliation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
My question is quite a simple one: namely, what kind of people are qualified to effect a reconciliation? Of course, along with other noble Lords, I very much hope that we can reconcile as many people as possible. But those who are actually qualified to help bring about a reconciliation--that is, if a reconciliation is at all possible--are marriage counsellors. I can certainly see the need for people to be given the names and addresses of qualified marriage counsellors and also of qualified mediators. I shall be glad to hear from the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor what he has in mind when he refers to people who might be "qualified to help" in such a reconciliation. That is the purpose of Amendment No. 76.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-09_para17"></a>Amendments Nos. 73 and 78 refer to Clause 10(2). At present, paragraph (a)(iii) refers to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the availability to the parties of any counselling facilities". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Amendment No. 73 proposes the insertion of the word "marriage" before "counselling". Similarly, Amendment No. 78 which refers to paragraph (c)(iii) also requires the insertion of the word "marriage" before "counselling".
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-09_para18"></a>There is an important matter of principle involved. It is, quite simply, whether people should be told about the availability of counsellors in general, or whether they should be told about the availability of people who are trained and qualified to offer marriage counselling. I yield to no one in my respect for, and realisation of, the need for counsellors of all kinds; but this Bill deals with divorce and trained and qualified marriage counsellors, as well as trained and qualified mediators, have a special role to play.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-09_para19"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor gave a very substantial address recently to Relate in which he expressed his difficulty in accepting the amendments. For example, he put forward the possible case where the friend of a husband dies and the husband goes through a very deep depression as a result of his bereavement. That might drastically affect the marriage and may lead to a lack of communication, and so on. In such a situation, what a person really needs is a bereavement counsellor rather than a marriage counsellor. However, perhaps I may quote from the letter that Dr. Jack Dominian wrote to the noble and learned Lord. Dr. Dominian is a psychiatrist and the country's leading specialist on marriage and on how marriages can be kept together, enriched and saved. He thought that the example of the noble and learned Lord was especially good. In the letter he says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"One of the classic triggering factors in marital breakdown is bereavement and so this example is highly relevant. You suggest that bereavement counselling may be what this man needs, 'by being able to tackle the source of a depression, the ability to communicate can be restored to the couple'. I would say that the chances of reconciling such a couple would be far higher if they saw a marriage counsellor than a bereavement councillor. A trained marriage counsellor should be able to tackle the husband's depression and his <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_35"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 35</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>wife's response to it; in such situations, while the individual spouse has a specific problem the marriage clearly needs some attention too. The bereavement counsellor would be focusing on the individual's needs alone and not those of the couple. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>For me this is the central concern when a marriage is in trouble--what is the most appropriate help for the marriage? A marriage counsellor focuses on the marital relationship and attempts to find the minimum needs of both partners, to make them conscious, to remove obstacles to their realisation and to help the couple to fulfil those needs. A counsellor will focus on the individual's needs which of course to some extent are compromised in a marital partnership. Some individual counselling may actually reduce the opportunities for reconciliation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
There is a very specific need for marriage counsellors at that point. I believe that we will take away from the distinctive contribution which marriage counsellors can make if they are, so to speak, simply subsumed within the general category of counsellors. I ask the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, to reconsider that point. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60304-10_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Faithfull: </B>   My Lords, I have one comment to make. The British Association for Counselling has an accreditation programme for counsellors covering different areas. Perhaps we should discuss the matter with the association.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I should like to follow the point made by the right reverend Prelate. He referred to "trained and qualified mediators". I should like to know exactly who those people will be. We had a meeting in this place with the Law Society during which we asked that same question. We were told about a college of mediators. When we asked who had set up the college, where it was and what were the necessary qualifications, the answers we received were all extremely vague. We were told that there were about 700 people involved in the work at present; indeed, it seems to be a great growth industry. However, no one really knew what qualifications were required. I wonder whether any part of the Bill sets out what a mediator is, in particular a "trained and qualified mediator".
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-10_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, I had intended to say a few words, but I believe the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, is about to cover what I would have said.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-10_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Faithfull: </B>   My Lords, I should point out to the House that Amendment No. 96A deals with the whole question of accreditation as regards training, as will Amendment No. 94 tabled in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Habgood.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-10_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I should say, first, that I am most grateful to the right reverend Prelate for having paid some attention to my address to Relate. It is always a thrill when something one has said is read by someone who was not there, especially if that person quotes accurately. I am also grateful to Dr. Jack Dominian for his contribution in which he, as it were, puts me right on the matter. I would certainly wish to try to give effect to his suggestion.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-10_para0"></a>I wish to try to ensure that marriage counsellors are available, but I believe that there should not be too much restriction in that respect. Indeed, the variety of services <P>


<a name="column_36"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 36</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is something that I would not wish to restrict at present. I hope that the Bill will regulate the law for a considerable time to come. I cannot envisage--and I doubt whether your Lordships can--every possible development and innovation that there may be in improving services. Dr. Jack Dominian is a leading exponent of the need to innovate and develop services to help.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-10_para1"></a>I certainly wish to take account of those considerations in developing the current draft of the rules. One way to do so is, I believe, to include a statement in the nature of the information that must be available that would at least be exemplary of what might be available. Of course, that might not include all that is available, but the information would at least reflect those considerations. I believe that I will probably be able to do that without too much difficulty.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-10_para2"></a>One of the purposes behind Amendments Nos. 72, 74, 77 and 79 is to respond to the concerns expressed by the right reverend Prelate in Committee. The amendments reorder the provisions of Clause 10(2) to give greater priority to the references to "counselling" within the clause. I believe that I can make it possible to accommodate the concerns expressed by the right reverend Prelate and also those expressed by Dr. Dominian in this letter by reordering the wording without damaging what I want to keep; namely, considerable flexibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-10_para3"></a>My noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes wishes to know about mediators. There are a number of trained mediators who have come together to bring forward the standards of the profession and it may be that we will have a better opportunity of discussing that under one of the later amendments which my noble friend Lady Faithfull has proposed. My noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes would have learned from the Law Society that there are a number of trained mediators who are members of the Law Society and I am sure that at the meeting she attended she would have been assured of just what high quality they are. I have no doubt that others will seek to emulate them, perhaps from a slightly different professional base. In the light of the assurance that I have given to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford I hope he will feel that he need not press his amendment.

<A NAME = "60304-10_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I move this amendment on behalf of my noble friend Lord Archer of Sandwell. This is a long amendment, but it can be a very short explanation. It will extend the Lord Chancellor's power to make regulations specifying the type of requirements, as appears in subsection (2) of Clause 10. It places a requirement upon solicitors concerning information to be given to clients, so that the requirements will also apply to marriage guidance counsellors and mediators. It is important that all service providers should be under similar obligations to provide their clients with information. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-10_spmin4"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I am very appreciative of the principle behind Amendment No. 80 which seeks to apply both to marriage guidance counsellors and mediators the Lord Chancellor's power to make rules in relation to information which legal representatives may be required to give to the court.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-10_para16"></a>I am not sure that this is a wise provision for marriage counsellors. I believe that it suggests that marriage counsellors might stray more into the area of information on divorce, separation, and so called divorce counselling, than I believe the House might wish to see on the face of the Bill which has, as one of its stated general principles, the wish to support the institution of marriage. Your Lordships may have heard the suggestion that some organisations which are concerned principally with marriage guidance counselling fall all too easily into the idea of divorce counselling. I am not saying for one single moment that these allegations are justified, but I certainly would not wish to do anything to encourage them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-10_para17"></a>I believe that when somebody goes for guidance and help in relation to their marriage, on the whole it is not right for the initiative of suggesting divorce to be taken by the marriage guidance counsellor. It is quite right that marriage counsellors should discuss the possibility of reconciliation with the parties. I do not, however, see that their role involves discussing the possibility of legal representation or mediation with couples. If marriage counselling is not successful and one or both of the parties decides to proceed with divorce, they will be able to get information on all the services available to help them at the information meeting.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-10_para18"></a>I am also concerned especially that the low take up of marriage support services could suggest that couples may be put off counselling if they feel that their counsellor is somehow involved in reporting their discussions to the court. I know that is not the principle behind this amendment, but it is one of the <P>


<a name="column_39"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 39</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>risks that one must take into account in making such a provision. This might make marriage support services seem more like agents of the divorce court rather than organisations whose focus will be on looking at how the marriage can be sustained.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-10_para19"></a>In relation to mediation, it is of course important that mediators, too, have in place arrangements to ensure that important matters such as reconciliation are kept under review during the course of mediation. It is to this end that I have tabled Amendment No. 99A, which is intended to ensure that mediators are in a position to practise in accordance with the principles of the Bill. Your Lordships see that that provides that the Legal Aid Board may not contract with mediators unless they have arrangements in place to ensure that reconciliation is kept under review throughout mediation and that parents are encouraged to consider the welfare, wishes and feelings of the children. I believe that is a good way to indicate the sort of principles we expect mediators to follow.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-10_para20"></a>I should like to consider whether it might be appropriate to add a further provision to Amendment No. 99A to provide that mediators should have in place arrangements designed to ensure that parties are informed about the availability of independent legal advice. I am minded to bring forward an amendment to that effect at Third Reading. That is, mediators should be able to tell the parties that if they want independent legal advice on any matter, then, of course, they can consider that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-10_para21"></a>On reflection, it does not seem right that mediators are to be required to ensure that arrangements are in place with regard to matters such as reconciliation, children and the availability of legal advice whereas legal representatives merely need to self-certify whether or not they have discussed reconciliation and mediation with parties. I am minded, therefore, to bring forward a government amendment at Third Reading which would strengthen the provisions in Clause 10 by requiring legal representatives to inform not only about marriage counselling and mediation but also about the need for parents to consider the welfare, wishes and feelings of their children when they are deciding arrangements for the future. I referred to that earlier.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-10_para22"></a>I would not seek to place any such requirements on counsellors. The primary objective of counsellors is to help people with marriage difficulties. They are not involved in advising on legal process or negotiating financial settlements, nor in disputes relating to children, and should not be required to certify that they have discussed these matters. Both lawyers and mediators, on the other hand, must have regard to the primary principles of this Bill, one of which is that the parties to a marriage which may have broken down are to be encouraged to take all practical steps to save it. I therefore have no hesitation in making amendments which will more strictly enforce the role of lawyers and mediators in that respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-10_para23"></a>In the light of that explanation and that I accept the principle of the amendment, insofar as I have described it as acceptable, I hope the noble Baroness may feel able to withdraw it.

<P>

<A NAME = "60304-11_para3"></a>The amendments are intended to clarify the provisions with regard to meetings. I have tabled the amendments to make it clear that where parties are directed to attend meetings with a mediator for an explanation of mediation under Clause 11 they can attend those meetings separately, either at their own request or at the direction of the court. Concern was expressed at Committee stage by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell, on the possibility of intimidation where parties are required to attend together. I agree that that is something we should take all practical steps to avoid.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-11_para4"></a>In addition, Amendment No. 82 makes it clear that each party should be given the opportunity to express his or her own view as to whether he or she wishes to pursue mediation at or after that meeting.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-11_para5"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell, also sought to make amendments to this part of the Bill, which makes special provision where there has been domestic violence. However, I am wary of imposing too many conditions in these matters. Mediation is not always inappropriate in cases of domestic violence; for example, where the violence occurred a long time in the past. In any case, people can be intimidated by their partners in many more ways than simply by physical violence. I therefore think it more valuable to make these broad amendments which allow parties to attend meetings separately in all cases if they wish to do so or the court considers it appropriate, and allow them to express their individual views as to whether or not they wish to proceed with mediation, having heard about and, better still one hopes, having understood what mediation is about.

<P>

<A NAME = "60304-11_para14"></a>The unquestioned general principle, which the Government assert time and time again, is that participation in mediation must be voluntary and not compulsory. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that there are no restrictions--direct or indirect--on the generality of the proposition that mediation must be voluntary.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-11_para15"></a>We know that the parties are to be informed about mediation facilities. They are also to be given an opportunity to avail themselves of those facilities. However, let us suppose that a party declines because, if a woman, she is intimidated by her husband, she fears that she will be unable to give a good account of herself, unrepresented, in front of the mediator, and perhaps not be able to speak up for herself as she would wish, both for herself and for the children. Let us suppose that she would prefer to be legally represented in court.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-11_para16"></a>As I mentioned in Committee, the distinguished family lawyer, Ruth Deech, who is also the Principal of St. Anne's College, Oxford, has called attention to the dangers that mediation may hold for women. There are many who agree with her. The proposition that mediation, however hard the mediator tries, is always even-handed between the parties does not win universal acceptance from those who know about mediation in practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-11_para17"></a>I come to the amendment. I understand only too well that, in the ordinary way, a court can adjourn any proceedings if it believes that that will facilitate a private agreement between the parties. Courts do say in practice to parties that there may not be much sense in going on with the battle and suggest that the parties go off to see if they can settle the matter between themselves. That often happens. However, I am <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>assuming a state of affairs in which there has been a prior refusal to participate in mediation--a position which a party is entitled to adopt if mediation is truly voluntary. It is critical that a court should never be entitled to adjourn court proceedings with a view to inducing a party whom the court thinks should be mediating to participate in mediation when that party has already decided not to do so. The point of the amendment is that it should be made plain that no court pressure of any kind may be brought on individuals to induce them to participate in mediation after they have decided not to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-11_para18"></a>In Committee the noble and learned Lord said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if the court feels that the parties, notwithstanding our efforts to inform them, do not really appreciate or have understood the efforts that have been made or realise how mediation could help them in the circumstances of their particular case, the court should invite them to attend a meeting at which that would be clearly explained to them--[Official Report, 23/1/96; col. 1023.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
I may have misunderstood the noble and learned Lord, but to me that sounds uncomfortably as if he were approving of the court granting adjournments to pressure people into mediation when they have taken a principled decision not to take part in mediation--a process which we are constantly assured is voluntary. The principle of voluntariness is undermined if the court is empowered to adjourn court proceedings for the purpose of enabling a dispute to be resolved through mediation when mediation has been refused by one party. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-11_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, this is not the right time to go into detail about the research on mediation. However, the general findings with regard to mediation are that men and women both describe the process as fair, and women have reported a sense of empowerment and feel that their interests are articulated and treated with respect during the mediation process.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-11_para19"></a>I agree entirely that mediation should be voluntary. That is the basis on which I have put all this forward. Coercive mediation such as, for example, some of the programmes one sees in the United States, may result in women feeling under pressure to reach unsatisfactory settlements. Much of the criticism of mediation that has been voiced from some quarters is based on mandatory, settlement-orientated programmes, in the United States, which are quite different from those which are in operation here.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-11_para20"></a>I do not accept that the amendment is necessary. I feel sure that the court would not seek to impose mediation on people who did not want it. I think it inappropriate that we should, in a sense, limit the powers of the court in a way that I do not think anyone suggests the court would be likely to act. A court "inducing" someone to do something strikes me as perhaps not as appreciative of the fairness and impartiality of the court as some other form of words might be. I believe that our judges who deal with these matters are very sensitive to the attitudes of parties.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-11_para21"></a>Therefore, while I entirely subscribe to the view that if mediation is to be successful it must be entirely voluntary, I do not agree that it is necessary that we put <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the amendment into the Bill. So far as I know, there is no suggestion whatever in the Bill that the court may adjourn for any purpose analogous to this.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-11_para22"></a>I wish to correct something. It has been drawn to my attention that, a few moments ago when speaking to an earlier amendment, I referred to Amendment No. 99A as my amendment. The propriety in that amendment belongs to the noble Lord, Lord Stallard. The Marshalled List has changed slightly since what I said was put together. I should have referred to Amendment No. 99B. Delighted as I am to refer to the noble Lord's amendment, on this occasion I had in mind to refer to my own.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-11_para23"></a>I hope that, in the light of the explanation, the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, may feel it appropriate not to press his amendment.

<A NAME="60304-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Irvine of Lairg: </B>   My Lords, I confess that I am somewhat disappointed. I believe that it is important that mediation be voluntary. The sole purpose of the amendment is to ensure that it is. If "inducing" is a hard word to use of a court seeking to persuade an individual into a course of action which the court thinks more appropriate, I should be happy to soften the provision by using "encouraging" rather than "inducing" if that removes the offence.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Before Clause 15, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>Duties of Court Welfare Officer </B></center><BR>
(" . Where any proceedings under this Part are before the court and there are children of the marriage, it shall be an obligation on the Court Welfare Officer in compiling any reports in relation to the residence of the children or contact with the children to use his best endeavours to interview the children in the presence of each of the parents and, where this is not done, in coming to any decision based upon such a report the court shall adjust the weight that it shall give to that report accordingly.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-12_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 88 provides for the duties of the court welfare officer in regard to reporting the feelings and interests of the child. Having had considerable debate about children being asked to give their views, particularly in front of the parents, in this amendment, I should be happy for the principle of the duty of the court welfare officer to be considered, but not necessarily to provide that he interviews the children in the presence of each of the parents.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-12_para4"></a>Amendment No. 25, introduced extremely ably by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, provides that the interests of the children are represented by the Official Solicitor in certain cases.

<P>

<A NAME = "60304-12_para5"></a>I have never been quite satisfied or clear as to who my noble and learned friend considered the appropriate person to speak to the court at the appropriate time on behalf of the children. As I understand it, under the present divorce law it is for the court welfare officer to write a report on behalf of the children to represent their views, feelings and interests to the court. I also understand that because of the pace at which things move through the courts--many undefended divorces do not come before the court; the process is in writing--the interests of the children, if I may so say, are shoved under the carpet and not fully considered.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-12_para6"></a>I put forward the amendment in order to find out from my noble and learned friend, or from those who practise in the divorce courts, how the interests of the child are represented to the court before divorce is granted. What is considered? What weight is given to the report of the welfare officer? Is that officer the right person to undertake that duty at the different stages at which the question of representation has been raised?
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-12_para7"></a>Amendment No. 137 is grouped with Amendment No. 88. I have no doubt that my noble and learned friend will speak to that himself. Perhaps I may say how grateful I am to him for having put the provisions of my Amendment No. 87 into the amended Section 41 of the 1973 Act.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Moran: </B>   My Lords, like the noble Baroness, I, too, would like clarification as to what the noble and learned Lord considers most appropriate for the representation of the children's interests in court.

<A NAME = "60304-12_para8"></a>Like the noble Baroness, perhaps I may again express my gratitude to the noble and learned Lord for Amendment No. 137 as regards reintroducing the factor of fault in the part of the Bill where the noble and learned Lord considers it belongs.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-12_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mishcon: </B>   My Lords, I am quite sure that it is good that the noble and learned Lord will tell us about the conduct of the welfare officer as regards the welfare of the children. However, unless I have misunderstood the wording of the amendment, I am a little worried. It seems as though the welfare officer would be prevented by this wording from seeing the child on his or her own. I should have thought that it was fundamental that the welfare officer should see the child on his own. I entirely agree that, if the welfare officer is to prepare a proper report, it would be advisable for the welfare officer to see the child in the presence of each of the parents separately. I am quite aware of that fact. But I would hate the idea that the welfare officer is told, "You are expected to interview in the presence of a parent but not to interview the child on his own".
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-12_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Elles: </B>   My Lords, with the permission of the House, perhaps I may explain the position to the noble Lord. In introducing the amendment, I suggested that I should delete the words:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in the presence of each of the parents", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-12_para9"></a>or of the parents together. I hope that that answers the noble Lord's point.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-12_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   My Lords, as I ventured to suggest last week, I do not believe that we have <P>


<a name="column_46"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 46</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>achieved a consensus on two separate questions: how the children's views should be ascertained, and how the children's interests should be represented. I respectfully agree with the noble Baroness that the welfare officer has an important part to play. He is a probation officer seconded from the probation service for specialist duties: family mediation and conciliation, particularly as regards the children. I do not believe that he is the proper person to represent the children's interests when they are required to be presented to the court, although he may well be the best person to represent the children's views.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-12_para10"></a>I suggested last week that the Official Solicitor was the proper person to represent the interests of the children. I was convinced by my noble and learned friend that the Official Solicitor would not be an appropriate person to carry out that task in all circumstances and in respect of every child whose interests came before the court. However, he has a supervisory role, particularly to instruct counsel in the odd cases where the interests of the child should be represented by counsel.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-12_para11"></a>I suggest that, since the Bill must go to another place, my noble and learned friend may canvass opinion more widely on the basis of the several views that have been expressed in your Lordships' House as to how the two separate functions are best performed and in what degree and what number in each case.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-12_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Meston: </B>   My Lords, as I understand Amendment No. 88, it presupposes that there is before the court the question of either the residence of the children or contact with them. That would normally arise under the Children Act rather than under the provisions of the Bill. In any event, it is dangerous to think of the court welfare officer as somehow expected to represent the interests of the child in any formal sense. There are cases in which a child is represented in a formal sense either by the Official Solicitor--although resources of the Official Solicitor's office would not allow that to happen in many cases--or by a guardian ad litem from the panel of guardians ad litem.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-12_para12"></a>In such situations, the court welfare officer does not formally represent the child but performs the functions of the eyes and ears of the court, to report back to the court the various material considerations under Section 1 of the Children Act. I can see that there may be cases in which a welfare officer's assistance would be valuable under the provisions of the hardship bar, as it has now been amended this afternoon.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-12_para13"></a>As to the provisions of the rest of the amendment, I bear in mind the qualification as to the noble Baroness's wording, but it is normally good practice for a welfare officer in an appropriate case to speak to the child or children in the presence of each parent, if that is possible. It is normal practice that if, for some reason, the welfare officer has been unable to speak to the child in the presence of one or other parent or has somehow failed to do so, the court would give that defect weight in reaching its decision. Equally, it must be within the discretion of a welfare officer whether he or she should interview the child in the presence of a parent or alone, or whether the child should be interviewed in the <P>


<a name="column_47"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 47</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>presence of siblings or a combination of those possibilities. Therefore, with respect to the noble Baroness, I question the circumstances in which she sees the amendment as being useful. Perhaps it is simply designed to add emphasis to existing good practice.

<A NAME="60304-12_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, I wish to ask a question for information in relation to this amendment and some earlier ones which have referred to the real need for someone to befriend and support the child. My recollection is that Section 17 of the Children Act provides for local authorities to consider the problem of children in need in their area and to make provision for them. I should have thought that children whose parents are undergoing divorce would fall into the category of children in need and that the local authority should make provision for befriending and supporting them.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo960304/text/60304-13.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-13_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, there are two sets of provisions which we must bear in mind. The first provisions are from the Children Act, to which the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, has just referred. As he rightly said, the Act contains provisions for a local authority to consider what should be done in relation to children in need. The second set of provisions, those in this Bill, are concerned primarily with divorce. There is a link between them which is elaborated in Section 41 which I seek to amend later.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para0"></a>In the normal case, it would be a complete waste of resources for a court to inquire into the detail of arrangements which are entirely satisfactory, made by parents about their children, where sadly their own relationship has broken down. One of the prime purposes of the Bill is to do our best to avoid any unnecessary trauma to the children in that respect. However, there will be some cases where the intervention of the court is desirable. The powers that the court has to intervene will depend on the Children Act arrangements and what should be done under that Act. We need to link the two and I have provided for that in my later amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para1"></a>We have had discussions with children's organisations about how that can be done most effectively. We need to have information before the court about the children which will highlight the situation in which further concern is properly taken in the matters by the court. That depends on the detail of the statements required from the parties about the children. That is what I propose. I believe that that is the most effective and practical way to bring the proposals forward. It should be done by reference to rules rather than putting it on the face of the Bill. I should not be at all surprised if experience were to show that what one did first could subsequently be further improved with judicial experience of the way in which matters work.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para2"></a>In regard to this amendment, on the last occasion I read out the standards of practice for welfare officers as contained in the national standards. I believe they deal adequately with the problem raised in this amendment.
<P>


<a name="column_48"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 48</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para3"></a>With this amendment are grouped Amendments Nos. 134 to 137 in my name, and Amendment No. 144 in the name of my noble friend Lady Elles. Perhaps I might just explain how Amendments Nos. 134 to 137 are supposed to play a part. They were inspired by the amendment tabled in Committee by my noble friend Lady Elles and supported by my noble and learned friend Lord Wilberforce. I recollect his suggestion that it was highly probable that these sentiments would in any event guide the court in its consideration of these matters, but no harm would be done--and indeed some good might be done--by putting them on the face of the Bill. I paraphrase rather inelegantly the words spoken much more eloquently by my noble and learned friend.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para4"></a>In my view it is wise to try to take this idea forward. I considered that the amendment proposed by my noble friend identified those areas which are most likely to indicate to a court that the circumstances of a case are such as to require it to take further action. These are: how the parents have conducted themselves in bringing up the child--for example, if the child has been very well brought up and looked after in every possible way by both parents, that must be a pretty good indication that the interest in the children is likely to continue; the principle that, unless there is evidence to the contrary, it will be in a child's best interest to have regular and reasonable contact with both parents--that will be shown on the statement about what the arrangements are; if it is seen, for example, that the arrangements are that the father will have no further contact with a child, that would raise the court's interest and cause it to look into the matter further; and the risk a child may be at, either because of where a parent with residence has chosen to live or because of the person with whom that parent has chosen to live. The amendment identifies very clearly circumstances which might give rise to concern.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para5"></a>I suggest therefore that the most appropriate time for the court to consider these matters is when it has before it the proposed arrangements for the child's future. That will not interfere with the responsibility of parents to decide the arrangements for their children, and arrangements reached by agreement are less likely to break down than arrangements that are imposed. All noble Lords who have the experience of trying to impose arrangements on unwilling parents will have a good idea of how difficult it is to enforce such arrangements. Agreement is by far the best way forward where it is possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para6"></a>By including these factors on the face of the statute, the court will have in its mind what are the issues which, prima facie, might suggest that the circumstances are such that the arrangements should be further examined. If necessary, it will then be able to ask for welfare reports and any other information that is considered necessary in assisting the court to decide whether or not an order under the Children Act is required. That would be a supplement to what is in the statements before the court.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para7"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 144, grouped with this one. The suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, may well be the right answer. In due course I shall move Amendments Nos. 134 to 137. <P>


<a name="column_49"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 49</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I have sought to explain them in a little detail at this stage because they are grouped with this amendment, and also because this gives the background to a proper relationship between the divorce provisions of this Bill and the provisions in the Children Act which are designed to secure the welfare of the children in all possible circumstances in so far as the state can do so.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-13_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Elles: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble and learned friend for his remarks, and particularly for his introduction to Amendment No. 137. There has been concern on the part of quite a lot of Members of this House as to the direct legal connection between the Children Act and this Bill, and how the interests of the child in particular will be protected by the provisions of the Children Act in relation to divorce proceedings. I am very grateful for that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para8"></a>I quite understand that there will be problems over Amendment No. 88. However, I hope that my noble and learned friend heard the remarks of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale in relation to considering in the next period who are the best people to look after the interests of the child, to speak on behalf of the child or to be available to look after the interests of the child at any particular point during the course of the proceedings. We are already grateful for the amendment to Clause 9. I think we can say happily that the position of the child in relation to the position of the parties--i.e. the parents--in this Bill has been very much strengthened by the provisions introduced by my noble and learned friend.

I tried to table an amendment to assimilate our law more to the law of Scotland, but it was held by the Public Bill Office to fall outside the ambit of the Bill. So we have to deal only with the English law, which discriminates in favour of marriage where a deceased has died without making a will.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para20"></a>Where there is a divorce, there is no surviving spouse who is relevant, although there may be a new one. But where there is a separation order, the marriage subsists and (except for the intervention of Clause 17, which reproduces the law as it existed, was laid down in 1965 and re-enacted) where there is an intestacy, Clause 17 provides that the surviving spouse shall not enjoy any benefit. The property is to devolve as if she had died.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para21"></a>At the very outset of the Committee stage of the Bill, my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor assured noble Lords that there was provision for a separation order, among other circumstances to accommodate a spouse who objected on conscientious grounds to divorce. However, that clause penalises a spouse who on conscientious grounds prefers a separation order to a divorce order. It states that she will not enjoy the benefit that normally accrues to a surviving spouse.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para22"></a>The amendment seeks to eliminate that provision because it takes away one of the advantages which perfectly properly accrue to a spouse who has a conscientious objection to divorce or who may even quite legitimately have an idea on the property advantages. When the matter was raised in Committee, it seemed that my noble and learned friend was reasonably susceptible to the arguments that had been put forward. However, I have since had a letter from him, as has also the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, in which he shows himself adamant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para23"></a>The amendment is very much a matter of the impression that the Bill gives to the public. It is always open to a spouse who is the subject of a separation order to make a will cutting out the other spouse who has <P>


<a name="column_51"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 51</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>obtained the order, or indeed the spouse who would benefit if this clause were eliminated may still get benefit under the inheritance, family provision legislation, although there to some extent it is discretionary. But it is a matter partly of the impression that the Bill will give to the public. It is discriminatory in favour of divorce and against separation, where there is always a chance of reconstituting the marriage. It is discriminatory against the separation order. This is one of the most blatant examples.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para24"></a>I said that I had a letter from my noble and learned friend. None of us has had any doubt of my noble and learned friend's genuine adherence to the concept of marriage as a lifelong institution: a lifelong relationship divinely instituted. But I confess that I cannot feel the same confidence as to everyone whose hand has been in the Bill. By their fruits shall ye know them and one bad apple can contaminate a whole barrel. In the light of that, I read what my noble and learned friend wrote:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Separation does not have the finality of divorce". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para25"></a>So far, so good!
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It does, nevertheless, seem that spouses who are judicially separated are generally unlikely to wish the other spouse to benefit from the will". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para26"></a>That is an utter misconception. There is no question of a will at all. We are dealing with intestacy and not testacy. The letter continues:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It therefore appears to be inappropriate to remove Clause 17, when to do so could result in an estranged spouse benefiting from the estate against a testator's wishes". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para27"></a>That merely reiterates the error. There is no question of a testator at all. This is a matter of intestacy. It is just a matter of saying that the normal law of intestacy shall prevail and that there shall not be discrimination against somebody who has chosen to have a separation order rather than a divorce order. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="60304-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Meston: </B>   My Lords, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon, raised this important matter at Committee stage. He suggested that this provision, which in fact originated in the legislation of 1965, was somehow the product of the "Swinging Sixties", although it is perhaps not the most obvious manifestation of that particular decade of which most of us would have thought.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para28"></a>I suspect that the rationale for the provision that is now to be re-enacted in Clause 17, unless your Lordships agree to the amendment, was that it is supposed that by the time the death has occurred, the estranged spouse has taken advantage of the financial powers of the court in the existing legislation and under the Bill to have claimed and received whatever his or her entitlement might be to a suitable financial settlement. In those circumstances, presumably it is taken into consideration that, in awarding him or her the entitlement, he or she will no longer benefit on the intestacy of the estranged spouse.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para29"></a>The other factor which the court can take into consideration is that a spouse in that situation--one is now talking about a wife--by virtue of electing separation rather than divorce, will probably have <P>


<a name="column_52"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 52</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>preserved her entitlement to a widow's pension. Furthermore, if that creates some hardship, despite the provision already awarded by the court under its existing powers, as the noble and learned Lord said, following the death, the spouse concerned has the benefit of the inheritance provision for family and dependants legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-13_para30"></a>I question whether it is appropriate to equate a long estranged legally separated spouse, who may well have received her entitlement under the matrimonial, property and financial legislation, with a wife who is party to a truly subsisting marriage. Having thought about it, I can see the rationale for Clause 17. I suspect that it was the rationale for the original legislation in 1965.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60304-14_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, the case for this amendment was presented in a most interesting way. In replying, I ask my noble and learned friend to clarify a point for me. As I understand the law, if one has made a will and then marries, the will is no longer valid after the marriage. If one has a will and divorce takes place, does that affect an existing will which might have been made a long time ago? If I knew the answer to that I would be better able to consider this amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-14_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, perhaps I may address myself in the first instance to this amendment. It is just worth pointing out at the start that the basic provision does not originate in the 1960s, but in the 1850s, as Section 25 of the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act 1857. There must be a fairly obvious point to made about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-14_para0"></a>The original provision was intended to protect the property of separated women from their husbands. Section 25, which was consolidated into Section 194 of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act 1925, and therefore into Section 20(3) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1965, provided, on the one hand, for a married woman, after judicial separation, to be treated as not a married woman in respect of all after-acquired property; and for her after-acquired property, and any property which at the date of the decree of separation she had an interest in reversion or remainder, to pass on her intestacy as if her husband had predeceased her.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-14_para1"></a>On the other hand, separated women, noble Lords will be glad to know, retained the right of inheritance on the husband's intestacy. So that was a somewhat one-sided provision designed to protect the property of separated women, while not giving the same protection to separated men. By 1969 the main justification for the provision had gone and the provision was criticised by the Law Commission in its Working Paper No. 9 and its report No. 29, as being half-hearted, arbitrary in its operation and a source of difficulty in administering estates.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-14_para2"></a>The commission recommended that the provision should be extended so that it covered all property of the intestate, and so that it applied to property of both spouses. That was implemented by Clause 30 of the draft Bill annexed to Law Commission report No. 29, which became Section 40(1) of the Matrimonial <P>


<a name="column_53"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 53</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Proceedings and Property Act 1970. So the point is that this matter was very thoroughly considered when it was reformed in the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-14_para3"></a>The situation, so far as I am concerned, is that this particular provision is one which has been in the law. It is in this Bill only because, for reasons of convenience, we have repealed a number of provisions to which this measure corresponds. It was thought better, in the interests of clarity, to re-enact this measure. But if the Bill is sending out the message that there is a problem, it would not be very difficult to reinstate the existing law and alter the appeal schedule. It would be a little less convenient, but it would not make very much difference.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-14_para4"></a>My noble and learned friend Lord Simon of Glaisdale referred to my letter to him and quoted from it. I do not know anything about "bad apples", but I take responsibility for all that is done. The letter is signed by me and therefore I am not speaking for anybody but myself. The point I was trying to make, rather inelegantly, was that, on the whole, experience seems to be that when parties become separated the husband, for example, does not intend or wish for his separated wife, if the separation has lasted until death, to benefit from his estate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-14_para5"></a>One can achieve that, I suppose, in a number of ways. One can make the intestacy provision go one way and then there will be a whole lot of wills going the other; or one can make the intestacy provision go the other way, in which case one does not require so many wills. I can see that it is in the interests of some that there should be a lot of wills. The point I was trying to make in the letter was that, as far as experience goes, it does not look as though there are many wills trying to alter the effect of the current law on this matter. I have not expressed it anything like as well in the letter. If I had to write the letter again I am sure that I would be able to improve on it. Your Lordships will appreciate that I have written one or two letters during the Committee stage of this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-14_para6"></a>However, the most important thing I said in the letter was that I had had an opportunity of consulting, since Committee stage, with my Ancillary Relief Advisory Group, which is headed by Lord Justice Thorpe. It consists of representatives of the judiciary, the Family Law Bar Association, the Law Society, the Solicitors Family Law Association and two academic lawyers. Their view was that we should stick with the existing law. It is for that reason that I decided that the existing law should be left in. But if, as I said, there is a problem about the message of the Bill because it happens to be re-enacting existing law, I believe that I can deal with that by an amendment which takes this measure out all together and keeps the existing law in its present form.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-14_para7"></a>I believe that what we have is probably more convenient for practitioners, but that of course is not certain. It has nothing at all to do with the legal effect of divorce on wills, which is a separate matter altogether, and where the only problem is separation. The law has been like this to some extent from as long ago as the 1850s although, as I have explained, it was modified considerably in 1970.

<A NAME="60304-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   My Lords, I need not deal at any length with the letter which has been referred to. My noble and learned friend has not disputed that it shows complete confusion between testacy and intestacy, which invalidates the whole objection to this amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-14_para8"></a>My noble and learned friend was inclined to quarrel with my statement that this provision goes back to 1965 although that was supported by the noble Lord, Lord Meston. He said that it goes back to the middle of the last century. That is at best only half-valid.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-14_para9"></a>There was a provision to which he referred and which arose out of the union of two very raffish figures; I am sorry to say that one of them was a predecessor of my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack, Lord Lyndhurst. I am very surprised that my noble and learned friend should take him in any way as a model. The other was Mrs. Caroline Norton, whose husband brought an action for adultery (criminal conversation) naming Lord Melbourne, the Home Secretary--or he may have been Prime Minister by that time--as her lover. That is the origin of what happened in the middle of the last century. It was partly a precursor of the Married Women's Property Act, which was designed to protect the property of married women who were living separately from their husbands under a separation order, as it is now called. That is only half of what is now proposed, which was fully expounded in 1965.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-14_para10"></a>One comes back to this: although lipservice is paid to the right of anybody on conscientious objection to prefer a separation order to a divorce order, although that is conceded, the normal law of intestacy which would benefit only such a person making such a choice is altered to that person's disadvantage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-14_para11"></a>I said at the beginning that this is mainly a question of impression rather than of substance because the separated spouse can always make a will and the person who might benefit from intestacy has some rights under family provision legislation. As a question of appearance, this once again shows how divorce-minded the Bill is and how at every turn it is in favour of divorce as against separation (where there is still some hope for the marriage because there is no right to remarry). However, in view of the fact that this is largely a matter of presentation and not of substance, I ask your Lordships' leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "60304-14_para14"></a>The right reverend Prelate said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 93, I am seeking to insert the word "shall" instead of "may" in the first line of Clause 18. The amendment seeks, as far as any legislation can, to make grants mandatory rather than discretionary. I shall not speak of the value of marriage support services because the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor is firmly committed to them, as are a good number of other noble Lords. I hesitate also to put forward a case <P>


<a name="column_55"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 55</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of financial hardship because so many charitable bodies today are doing that, but it is important to place certain financial facts and figures on the record in view of the key role which marriage support services will be asked to play.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-14_para15"></a>Over the past 10 years, the contribution of central government funding to each hour of counselling undertaken by Relate, for example, has dropped from 24 per cent. to under 10 per cent. of the unit cost. That means that currently Relate has to find &#163;10 for every hour of counselling delivered to supplement the funding obtained from clients and government. The sum which Relate has to raise amounted to &#163;4 million last year and is becoming increasingly difficult to find. Exactly the same story could be told in relation to the Jewish Marriage Council, the Tavistock Institute of Marital Studies, One Plus One, and Marriage Care, the Catholic agency.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-14_para16"></a>We are all conscious of the huge cost of divorce to the country as a whole. At present the Government spend something like &#163;3 billion on picking up the pieces of broken marriages, but less than 0.1 per cent. of that sum is invested in marriage support services. A simple way of putting that is to say that for every &#163;3,000 spent on divorce, less than &#163;3 is spent on supporting marriage. However, as I have said, the marriage support services will be asked to play an increasingly important role in that area in terms of marriage preparation, marriage research and marital counselling, all of which we believe in. It is important that they are funded adequately. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="60304-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   My Lords, before my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor replies to the points made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford, perhaps I may ask about the general funds which are given to such organisations. What proportion of the money that is given actually ends up helping married couples, either in terms of counselling or subsequently?
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-15_para0"></a>It is often said--some of the material that I have read from such organisations indicates this--that those organisations counsel quite a number of other people, such as unmarried couples, homosexual couples and lesbian couples. As I have said before, if public money is going into something, it should go to those parts of an organisation which the Bill is designed to support and which I think that all Members of your Lordships' House wish to support. I hope that I shall be given an answer to that question because I have received letters which indicate that there would not be such a long wait for marriage guidance counselling if such organisations concentrated their efforts exclusively on marriage guidance counselling and not on other activities.

<A NAME="60304-15_spnew1"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, I should like to speak on behalf of those who have in principle supported the Bill from the start as being a Bill which has support for marriage and the family at its centre . That is why so many of us have supported the Bill through thick and thin.

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 56</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-15_para1"></a>It is important that the services which support and bolster marriage should be funded because, if we fail on that, I believe that the last state will be worse than the first. We shall be left with a Bill which seeks to support marriage and the family but which is not able to do so. It sometimes happens that splendid legislation passes both your Lordships' House and the other place, but in the end there are not the funds to implement that which has been proposed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-15_para2"></a>If I may attempt to respond to the noble Baroness, Lady Young, it is possible for there to be pro-rata funding. That happens in a minor way in my own diocese. When I have to ask for the help of, say, marriage guidance counsellors, I can pay for that which they do without necessarily having to subscribe vaguely to their whole enterprise. So, we could deal with that problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-15_para3"></a>The cost of divorce to this country is massive, but by comparison what we spend on services to assist marriage is minimal. I hope that we can be as good as our word and have the courage of our convictions. It is good that this Bill has been brought forward by the Government because it shows that they are concerned about the state of the nation. I hope that they will back it with the necessary funds.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, I think that there is a consensus that there shall be marriage support services and that they shall be financed with the assistance of public funds. I suggest that there is also a consensus in favour of the proposition advanced by my noble friend Lady Young that that money should be directed to the purposes of the Bill specifically and not elsewhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-15_para4"></a>I rise only to ask my noble and learned friend-- I regret that I have not given him notice of this--whether he has thought further about the point that I raised in Committee when I drew attention to the need for some form of preparation during education for the responsibilities of marriage now that it comes so early in life. Indeed, parenthood often comes before the end of a school career.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-15_para5"></a>I suggested that Clause 18(1)(c) should embrace research into the effects of education on marital breakdown. My noble friend did not say that that activity would fall within the definition of this subsection, nor did he go so far as to say that the money would be spent in that way. I hope that he will be able to reassure me on the definition, either now or later in writing. Amendment No. 94 appears to be grouped with Amendment No. 93. One wonders whether the noble Lord, Lord Habgood, will speak to that or whether it will be debated separately.

We are grateful for the noble and learned Lord who introduced the clause. It was introduced specifically to help with the problem of marriage counselling. But I feel that the word "may" does not truly represent the feeling of the House and that what is required is "shall". Although it will still be qualified by the words "with the approval of the <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-15_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I should like to speak to Amendment No. 93. However, I would have liked to speak also to Amendment No. 94. I see that Amendment No. 94 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Habgood, is grouped with Amendment No. 93, but he has not moved it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-15_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Habgood: </B>   My Lords, I thought that it might be appropriate to take Amendment No. 94 separately. However, I have been persuaded that it should be grouped with Amendment No. 93, because essentially it is a probing amendment. It does not cover the same ground as Clause 18. I do not believe that mediation is included under support services, nor does the particular issue that I wish to raise come under Part II of the measure which deals with the financing of the mediation services.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-15_para6"></a>The point of the amendment is the immediate concern about interim finance if the mediation services are to expand and provide effective central control of standards. When the Act has been running for some time and money comes in through legal aid there may be some other arrangements, as opposed to direct funding, to enable the mediation services to be financed through legal aid. But the particular problem is immediate. We are well aware that mediation is crucial to this Bill, but the fact is that without more resources the present mediation services may not be able to cope with the demands which will be made upon them. They are very small. The central organisation is very small. There is a danger that all kinds of enthusiastic would-be mediators will rush forward to fill the vacuum, unless the central administration of the various mediation bodies can be strengthened.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-15_para7"></a>It is all the more important because the noble and learned Lord has made clear that he does not himself wish to monitor and supervise the standards of the mediation services. Therefore, it is essential to have strong central bodies to ensure that this is done and are sufficiently widespread in the nation as a whole so that they will be the obvious people to turn to, not just those who set up a badge as a mediator, which it is perfectly possible for anybody to do at the moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-15_para8"></a>The expansion, consolidation and piloting of the experiments, which the noble and learned Lord has said he wishes to undertake over a period of about two years following the passage of the Bill, will take place at a time when presumably money will not be coming in via the legal aid channel. One looks for a guarantee of interim payments to allow the mediation services to do what must be done if the Bill is to be effective.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-15_para9"></a>It may assist your Lordships if I say a word about how National Family Mediation is financed. I declare an interest because I am one of the patrons of that body. There are 60 local services to which approximately 650 trained mediators are attached. All of these local services are separate charities, and most are <P>


<a name="column_58"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 58</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>self-sustaining. They are funded from a variety of sources. They get some money from legal aid; some comes from the probation services; some charge client fees; some receive support from local authorities; and they also seek charitable funds. These are held together in National Family Mediation by the central services which consist of three paid employees to cover the whole nation. Those central services are concerned with such matters as: general policy, professional standards, the education of mediators, public relations, monitoring local services, appropriate literature and keeping in touch with mediation bodies on an international basis. All of that is done by three full-time members on a budget of less than a quarter of a million pounds. There is no core funding from the Government for that service. Unless there is core funding this tiny organisation will simply collapse.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-15_para10"></a>There are pressures to bring together the three main mediation services in the country to form a so-called college of mediators which will provide training and assure standards. That cannot be done as long as the mediation services are dependent upon finance from trusts, charities and, as to a small amount, affiliation fees. For a variety of reasons (which I need not go into) trust money is drying up, not least in anticipation that if the Government put through this legislation they will pay something for it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-15_para11"></a>I fully recognise the problems faced by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor in trying to secure finance from the Treasury. I deeply sympathise with him. But there is a question of credibility here. The sums required are extremely modest but are crucial to the successful implementation of the procedures. Therefore, although I do not press the amendment, I very much hope that he can give an assurance that, first, he understands the problems and, secondly, that help will be forthcoming.

<A NAME="60304-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Coleraine: </B>   My Lords, as a patron of National Family Mediation--which we know is the larger of the two organisations that look after mediation at the moment--is the noble Lord telling us that unless substantially more funding is available it will not be possible to get mediation off the ground and properly piloted during the two-year period presently anticipated by my noble and learned friend?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Habgood: </B>   My Lords, what I am saying is that the operation of the Bill is put at risk unless there is substantial funding, because at the moment mediation services deal with about 15 per cent.--I am quoting off the top of my head--of divorce cases. If that is going to expand to what we hope for under the Bill, it must entail an expansion of central services. One is talking about a whole different scale of operation which will need the funding if it is not to collapse under its own weight.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-16_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Seear: </B>   My Lords, I should like briefly to return to Amendment No. 93 which presses that there "shall" be funds available for conciliation.

I should of course declare an interest in that I have a longstanding connection with the Tavistock Institute for Marital Studies.

<A NAME = "60304-16_para0"></a>Without conciliation, the purposes behind the Bill cannot be achieved. Conciliation is not cheap for the individuals concerned. It is carried out usually on a one-to-one basis. It is time-consuming, and it has to be done by properly trained, skilled people who cannot come cheaply. Unless there is a requirement in the Bill that money should be available for conciliation, the purposes of the Bill will be undermined.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para1"></a>Mediation in the sense that the term is used in the Bill is extremely important. It is part of the Bill. We understand that there will be money for mediation in this sense, but mediation without the availability of conciliation, which will not cost money to the people who need conciliation, will not achieve the Bill's purposes. I press the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor to recognise that this is at the very heart of what he is trying to do if he is trying to save marriages. On a purely financial basis, we have all heard this evening--we knew before--how much divorce costs. Conciliation, properly done, saves us money. That, if for no other reason, should commend the amendment to the Government.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-16_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Faithfull: </B>   My Lords, I support the noble Lord, Lord Habgood. One of the problems is that the mediation service--I say this as a fellow patron--has grown and is being used far more than previously. The staff have not only to deal with all the extra cases; they have to raise the money. People who would be good mediators are at the moment having to raise money in the local offices. One of the difficulties is that the mediation service is becoming well known and well used, and therefore needs the money to run the service.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-16_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I am worried by both amendments. I oppose Amendment No. 93 because I believe that it is better to retain the word "may" rather than to use "shall". Although in principle I am very much in favour of marriage counselling, I should like to know how anyone judges its success to determine whether the money is being well spent. We have no idea whether many of these counselling services benefit people and in what sort of numbers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para2"></a>We do not know what standards are expected of marriage counselling. In the health service we are all obliged to fit in with the Patient's Charter and achieve certain results. Will people be expected to achieve certain results with mediation and marriage counselling? I shall be interested to know.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para3"></a>When I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Habgood, I was worried, as I was when I attended the Law Society meeting when mediation was talked about. He confirmed what I said earlier this afternoon, that it is a huge growth industry. Anyone can set himself up--he confirmed this--as a mediator. After I left the Law Society meeting I spoke to several people who had no jobs whom I thought might well qualify as mediators. I said, "There you are, there's an opening for you. Look into that. Find out how you get into this College of Mediators, because it will be something for the future. It might be a job for you".
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para4"></a>There must be some standards. The Law Society told us that it has no fixed standards and that anyone can set up as a mediator. The noble Lord, Lord Habgood, has just said that. If these proposals are to be effective, there will have to be proper standards. He said--this has been confirmed by my noble and learned friend--that he will not supervise. It sounded as if no one will supervise. That worries me. We will be building up a huge counselling and mediation industry. We must be sure that it will be run in the right way and to the advantage of people and in support of marriage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para5"></a>My noble friend Lady Young raised a good point. She said that many of the resources are not being spent on marriage. That is another relevant point. All voluntary organisations are having trouble surviving in terms of funding. At one point we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Habgood, that the mediators were self-sustaining--that was the phrase he used--whereas a few minutes later we heard that they needed all this extra money. There was even a suggestion that legal aid would pay for the mediators. My experience of most things that receive legal aid is that they grow faster than anything that does not receive legal aid. Again, I have reservations.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para6"></a>My greatest concern is to ensure that these people are suitably qualified. I should like to know what standards of qualification are being set up. I should also like an assurance that money given to them will be money well spent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-16_spnew4"></A><B> The Duke of Norfolk: </B>   My Lords, when the noble and learned Lord replies, I hope that he will clarify a position which I thought was definite. In earlier definitions in the Bill, "mediation" has meant looking after the break-up of the marriage, counselling the two parties who are to divorce and making arrangements for the sad distribution of assets and for the future of the children.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para7"></a>I, too, attended the Law Society meeting in the Moses Room where it was categorically said that most of the mediators will be lawyers or solicitors who know what they are doing. It was almost a closed-shop debate. I see my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes nodding her head. It was said that only lawyers and solicitors could be mediators and that they would all be rewarded through legal aid.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para8"></a>The right reverend Prelate used the word "mediator" to cover that and in relation to marriage support agencies. As I understand it there are two things: one is mediators dealing with divorces, which is very sad, who are paid for out of legal aid; and then there is this new proposal of marriage support agencies, about which the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford has spoken, which we are introducing in the Bill. We hope that they will be rewarded by the Treasury through Votes to the Lord Chancellor who will control them with his watchful eye.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para9"></a>I urge that these services are supported strongly and funded properly. The kernel of the Bill is that these agencies will be able to prevent marriages ever reaching divorce. They will succour the needy who are worrying <P>


<a name="column_61"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 61</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about their marriages. The Lord Chancellor will see that those agencies give money to heal the marriages which are going wrong.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, I think that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor will agree that the Bill will just not work unless there is adequate provision for mediation and for the reconciliation services. While I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, that there is a need to control the quality of the services available, I support the idea underlying the amendments but question whether they go far enough. I am not so worried about the word "may" as about the words "with the approval of the Treasury". Can the noble and learned Lord convince the House that the Treasury is likely to support mediation and conciliation services to the tune that is required if the Bill is to work? If not, should we not be introducing an amendment to "lay upon the Lord Chancellor the duty of ensuring the provision of adequate services for reconciliation and mediation"? Is it not the case that in Australia the obligation is laid upon government to provide adequate services for mediation?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-16_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, two distinct matters are raised in Amendments Nos. 93 and 94 and it is important to distinguish between them. First, the amendment moved by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford changes "may" into "shall". I understand what is behind the proposal but it is obvious that it would not do very well to have "shall" in that position immediately preceding the phrase,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"with the approval of the Treasury, make grants in connection with", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para10"></a>followed by a list of projects. Obviously, "shall" in that situation is worth while only if it is enforceable and no enforceability is easily associated with a clause such as that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para11"></a>However, we must not lose the perspective to the operation. It is the first time that there has appeared in any statute the authority to give grants for these particular services. I hope that your Lordships will feel that it is a step forward to get such a recognition into a Bill. Obviously, it is not done without a degree of persuasion of others because many people have ideas about how they would like to spend such money and they are in competition with us.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para12"></a>The second point that I wish to make bears exactly on the matter raised by my noble friend Lady Young. The grants referred to under Clause 18 are in connection with the provision of marriage support services, which I would take to mean services being in support of marriage and not in connection with other types of relationships such as those she mentioned.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para13"></a>Secondly, I believe that research into the causes of marital breakdown is extremely important. It includes the issue to which my noble friend Lord Elton referred. If one of the causes of marital breakdown is that people get married young without adequate preparation for marriage, which is a defect which could be replaced or repaired, that would be covered by the proposal. I am not saying which project we would wish to support. As I have explained, we have already studied fully the types <P>


<a name="column_62"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 62</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of service which are presently available. We have arranged for a seminar for people in that area to take place on 3rd April, when we will consider how the matter should be taken forward. Research into ways of preventing marital breakdown is closely related to the second project. Having found the causes the question is, what cures can be applied?
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para14"></a>I explained during the course of the Bill that many people associate large costs with marriage breakdown. I have no doubt whatever that there are such large costs. Therefore, it is obvious that, if one can demonstrate that &#163;1 spent in this area prevents large costs in other areas, the case for securing Treasury approval would be strong because the Treasury is no more anxious than any of your Lordships to pay out taxpayers' money consequential on marital breakdown if that can be prevented.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para15"></a>Therefore, one of the matters which must be attended to in any funding of projects under this clause is the arrangement made by those seeking the funding to demonstrate the effectiveness of their work. Some who have already been funded have given some demonstrations of the extent to which their work is effective. I believe that something of that kind is essential in this type of progress. Therefore, I strongly take the view that adequate support for these headings is required. The level of support which from year to year these services will receive will depend crucially on the extent to which they can demonstrate success in the objectives to which I have referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para16"></a>I have noticed that one of the objections sometimes made to the Bill is that it will produce a great army of people hitherto out of work who will suddenly find employment in this area. Your Lordships may take it that I have no intention whatever of moving down that road. I believe that such work is skilled work and that it is capable of being tested in a way that is not easy as regards much other work. My noble friend Lady Gardner referred to the health service. Your Lordships know that it is not always easy to be absolutely clear about the effectiveness of a particular treatment. Indeed, to some degree medical negligence litigation is concerned with that very problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para17"></a>I believe that this particular type of work in aggregate is capable of being tested quite profoundly. Therefore, I say to the right reverend Prelate that, first, an amendment of this kind would not be textually suitable and, secondly, that it is important that any arrangements made in this area involve a test of their success. I strongly support that type of service and I believe that it has much to offer. As the right reverend Prelate said, the importance of this Bill is that it emphasises how central to our nation are the institution of marriage and support for that institution.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para18"></a>Your Lordships may take it that on the basis that I have explained I shall certainly give my commitment to do everything possible to produce as good a service as one can. However, that must depend on the service demonstrating its success in avoiding the development of marriage breakdown. Standards and so forth will be reflected in the degree to which the services are successful. I hope that the right reverend Prelate will feel that that is appropriate in this connection.
<P>


<a name="column_63"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 63</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para19"></a>As regards Amendment No. 94, I have already made a grant towards developing standards for the mediation profession. However, as regards legal aid, I am expecting that mediation will prove to be a useful and more appropriate alternative to legal aid in many of the disputes that will be covered in the subject matter of this Bill. That too requires skill and my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes may rest assured that there is no question of my authorising the payment out of legal aid money to anyone who is not appropriately qualified to act as a mediator. I believe that during the course of the remarks I heard it said that the Law Society was saying that there would be a good number of lawyer mediators. I believe that it is a good profession for lawyers to follow. It has a most distinguished ancestry.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para20"></a>There are also people other than lawyers who may have these skills. Again, it is right that they should be developed. This process is capable of being tested because mediated agreements will be the result in these situations, and the question will be how effective they are and how well they last. So all of this is capable of being tested in a very realistic way.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para21"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Habgood, said that the mediation services would like more money if they can get it. I have not come across many services that are not in that position. On the other hand, these matters are being developed. They have been supported and--subject to the sort of help I have already given in respect of developing the standards to be expected in mediation when this Bill comes into effect--it is right that we should leave matters on that basis. The ultimate funding of mediation, under this Bill, will arise through the legal aid fund, by arrangements properly made under the terms of the legal aid statute as amended by the later provisions of this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para22"></a>I hope I have answered your Lordships' questions, particularly the point raised by my noble friend Lady Young. It is quite clear that the power in this Bill to make grants is expressly defined as relating to the support of marriage and marital breakdown and the causes and cures of that.

<P>
<A NAME="60304-16_spnew6"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor for his reply. I know that we are all grateful that Clause 18 is there at all. We recognise that it is a considerable achievement.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para23"></a>As to the questions of the noble Baroness, Lady Young, I am quite clear that the main focus of all the agencies whose names I quoted earlier--education or research or marriage counsellors--is marriage in one form or another. Of course, those agencies will probably have slightly different philosophies because, as I mentioned before, they include the Jewish Marriage Council, the Tavistock Institute for Marital Studies, One Plus One and the Catholic agency, Marriage Care. As the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor said, the focus of the Bill is clearly on marriage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para24"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, quite properly raised questions about standards and results. I have been pressing for only properly approved <P>


<a name="column_64"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 64</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>organisations to be mentioned in the Bill, and if there is a roster of properly approved organisations that will be one way of monitoring standards and results. I am sure these organisations, being reputable organisations, would not fear in any way a proper critique of their achievements or lack of them. They are professional bodies and open to scrutiny.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para25"></a>I do not have a full set of figures but there are two points which relate to the questions raised. A recent Relate study shows that 25 per cent. of couples who were living apart at the start of counselling were living together six months after the completion of counselling. Secondly, 10 per cent. of couples who thought that their marriages had ended said that as a result of attending counselling with Marriage Care they had discovered the energy to start again. Those figures are by no means definitive, but I am sure their work would be open to any scrutiny. However, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-16_para26"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<A NAME="60304-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale </B>   moved Amendment No. 95:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 18, insert the following new clause--

(".--(1) The "special procedure" (whereby petitions for divorce based on section 1(2)(a), (b) or (c) of the 1973 Act have accelerated and informal consideration) is hereby abolished.
<BR>
(2) No decree of divorce shall be pronounced in respect of any petition based on section 1(2)(a), (b) or (c) of the 1973 Act until a period of twelve months for reconciliation, reflection and consideration has elapsed since the date on which the court received the petition.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para0"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, this, I venture to say, is an important amendment. It gets rid of the roundly denounced, universally denounced, so-called quickie divorce.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para1"></a>Subsection (1) of the new clause gets rid of it procedurally, and subsection (2) of the substance. I am speaking also to Amendment No. 116, which is the effective implementation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para2"></a>The necessity for this new clause rose late on the last day in Committee, in fact after eleven o'clock. The noble Lord, Lord Coleraine, told me when this legislation would be brought into effect, and my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor said he thought it would be two years after Royal Assent. I do not quarrel with that. It is eminently sensible to make sure that the administrative substructure is in place first. We have the care that was taken over the Children Act on the one hand, which has been a success, and, on the other hand, the disaster that followed the Child Support Act. The necessity, therefore, is to make sure that the quickie divorce disappears as rapidly as possible and does not have to wait two years until my noble and learned friend is ready to bring the rest of the measure into effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para3"></a>I do not need to expatiate on the disadvantages of the so-called quickie divorce. They were in the forefront of the propaganda in favour of this Bill, which was heavily promoted by the Lord Chancellor's Department. The noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, gave a description of how it worked procedurally, and it certainly reflected no <P>


<a name="column_65"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 65</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>credit on the law. It was a patent step towards what has always been the ultimate aim of the extreme permissive divorce reformers; namely, the simple registration of a divorce--as simple as the registration of a marriage, or even simpler.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para4"></a>One has to go back, as subsection (2) shows, to the 1969 Act, although I have cited it in its re-enactment in 1973. As your Lordships now well know, the Divorce Reform Act pretended to be based on irretrievable breakdown of marriage but in fact depended on the so-called five facts which, together, were the exclusive grounds of breakdown that could be alleged, and any one of them was a conclusive ground.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para5"></a>The first, as your Lordships know well, and is referred to in Section 2, is on the ground of adultery. But it was divorce in a new form. It was divorce stripped of anything which might impede it; for example, an agreement to produce the evidence of a divorce or even plotting that a divorce should take place--even one party plotting that the other should commit adultery because connivance and collusion disappeared.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para6"></a>The second ground was unreasonable behaviour. The third ground was desertion for two years, reduced from three years. The third introduced into our law for the first time divorce by consent after two years' separation. Both Church and state stood against divorce by consent over the centuries because the Church said that it is inconsistent with the vows that have been made, not just privately but in the face of the congregation. The state said that the institution of marriage was more than the concern of the spouses themselves; it was a fundamental institution of society.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para7"></a>The last ground was unilateral separation after five years. In fact, that was the only ground that was before the Royal Commission because irretrievable breakdown was very much an afterthought. But the ground of unilateral repudiation was rejected by Archbishop Fisher giving evidence on behalf of the Church of England to the Royal Commission on marriage and divorce. Notwithstanding that, that measure was handed over by the Lord Chancellor's Department and negotiated by the Law Commission with a Private Member. It was supported by the Bishop of Exeter in your Lordships' House who volunteered to act as a Teller.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para8"></a>As early as February 1970, before that measure had ever come into force, it was pointed out in a lecture to the Institute of Legal Executives at the annual Riddell lecture that the earlier provision could be used for divorce by consent. The promoters of the Bill in both Houses had assured Parliament that although the measure introduced divorce by consent, it was only after two years separation. But it was pointed out that adultery, without the bars of collusion or connivance, could be used to achieve an immediate divorce.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para9"></a>Nevertheless, the Law Commission and the Lord Chancellor's Department proceeded to consolidate the 1969 Act into the 1973 Act where we now have it. But they did not stop there because they brought in subsequently the procedural provision of the quickie divorce. One could immediately obtain a divorce by consent with a put-up case of adultery. That could then <P>


<a name="column_66"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 66</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be rushed through the courts informally, rapidly and disgracefully, in the way that was described by the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para10"></a>That is the position that we have--a thoroughly discreditable provision of the law which is relied on as the principal ground for this measure. It is abrogation strongly relied upon. Talking to Members of your Lordships' House, I have found that even those who are deeply disturbed about the thrust of the Bill before us say that at present one can obtain a divorce in an average of six months and at least this Bill stipulates a 12-month lapse. Therefore, is it not plain after that which the noble Lord, Lord Coleraine, ascertained, that there is urgent need not to wait for two years and possibly more but to get rid of that disgraceful provision immediately? That deals with that subsection.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para11"></a>Amendment No. 116 amends the Bill to the effect that the provisions can be brought into force, and stipulates that this particular provision shall come into force on the passing of the Act. I beg to move.

<A NAME="60304-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Moran: </B>   My Lords, I have put my name to this amendment and I strongly support it. It seems to me to be very important that we should remove the special procedure at the earliest possible moment. I too listened to the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, at an earlier stage when he described this procedure. What he said was quite new to me and I did not realise that such a high proportion of today's divorces go through simply by post. They arrive at the court and are dealt with, so to speak, on the nod with minimum consideration. That seems to me to be profoundly unsatisfactory and I am quite sure that we should try to remove that procedure, as my noble and learned friend Lord Simon of Glaisdale has suggested, at the earliest possible moment and not wait for two years.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Coleraine: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment moved by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, because I believe that it is necessary to provide some form of interim law to cover the period of at least two years before this Bill is brought into effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para12"></a>I should like to add that it seems to me that one should go further than is proposed by the noble and learned Lord's amendment because the effects of a quickie divorce are as much ill thought out in the ground that must be proved as in the speed at which the divorce can be achieved. I am talking about the behaviour ground.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para13"></a>It is well known and referred to at paragraph 2.5 of the White Paper that it is almost impossible to defend the behaviour ground in a divorce. The White Paper states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The details pleaded in divorce petitions in support of, for example, the fact of intolerable behaviour, do not need to be corroborated and are irrebutable. Such allegations are therefore easy to make and easy to establish". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para14"></a>Experience shows that they are almost impossible to defend.

<A NAME = "60304-17_para15"></a>In our debate on Thursday last on the debate on Amendments Nos. 11, 12 and 13 in the name of my noble friend Lady Young, which would have <P>


<a name="column_67"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 67</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>re-introduced fault into the divorce law, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford described the case of a friend of his who had written to him to explain what had happened in his divorce. The letter read:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The solicitor advised her," </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para16"></a>that is the wife,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that she could get a quick divorce if she went for unreasonable behaviour. This did not include adultery or violence. It did include her view of my failings vastly exaggerated by the solicitor for the purpose of proving that the marriage had irretrievably broken down". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para17"></a>The letter went on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The 'faults' did not seem legally serious enough for divorce". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para18"></a>The right reverend Prelate observed correctly:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The present law is very flawed, as we have heard from that moving testimony".--[Official Report, 29/2/96; col. 1652.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para19"></a>Had I been able to speak in that debate, I would have drawn the attention of the House to the fact that the amendment moved by my noble friend was drafted in terms to improve the fault ground of behaviour. Under Section 1(2)(b) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, what has to be shown is,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para20"></a>On a true construction of those words, I understand that "petitioner" means the particular petitioner in the case under consideration and not the ordinary,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"reasonable spouse considered as petitioner." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para21"></a>Therefore, the test of behaviour is subjective, not objective. It means that, in determining whether a particular petitioner can or cannot reasonably be expected to live with a particular respondent, the court has to take into account the character and personality, disposition and behaviour of the petitioner as well as the behaviour of the respondent as alleged.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para22"></a>The amendment to which my noble friend spoke last week, Amendment No. 12, would have changed the grounds so that it would have to be proved that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the respondent has behaved in such a way that a reasonable spouse, considered as petitioner, could not be expected to live with the respondent". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para23"></a>If that had been appreciated, I believe that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford would have realised that it will not be so easy in the future to get away with a behaviour ground merely by saying, for example, "My husband was very messy in the bathroom, he would leave his pyjamas on the floor. I, being the person that I am, found it intolerable to live with him". In fact, an objective ground for divorce would have been introduced. That was one of the points which the noble Lord, Lord Meston, addressed when he dealt with and commented upon the points raised by the right reverend Prelate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-17_para24"></a>If the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, wishes to produce an amendment which would really get rid of all the bad effects of the quickie divorce, I believe that he ought also to look at the behaviour grounds in the 1973 Act, and incorporate the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>words proposed by my noble friend Lady Young, or other words. That way he would ensure the introduction of an objective definition of the behaviour ground.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Meston: </B>   My Lords, I should, first, declare an interest in that no one present in the Chamber would be more pleased than myself--with the possible exception of the noble Lord, Lord Phillimore--if the so-called "special procedure" were abolished. Its introduction was a fairly serious financial blow to the junior Bar and was undoubtedly intended to effect a considerable saving to the legal aid fund. Indeed, I am quite sure that it had that effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-18_para0"></a>At the time, I remember we all grumbled that one still needed a hearing in open court to wind-up a company but not to wind-up a marriage. Before the introduction of the special procedure, the petitioner had to go to court with his or her lawyers and give oral evidence to a judge of the breakdown of the marriage and evidence of the supporting facts which were relied upon. The procedure introduced in the 1970s converted that into a largely paper exercise.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-18_para1"></a>However, I question the phraseology in the amendment. In particular, I question whether the "special procedure" can now be described as an "accelerated" procedure. The special procedure involves a number of stages. The petitioner has to apply for the petition to be considered by the court and swear an affidavit, or make an affirmation in support. The district judge has to certify that he is satisfied that the petitioner has made good his or her case and is entitled to a decree. He then has to fix a date for the announcement of that decree.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-18_para2"></a>I seriously question whether that practice is any quicker than the machinery which existed before the introduction of the special procedure, whereby the petitioner simply applied for a hearing date and the petition, if undefended, was set down in a list of cases for hearing by the court on a particular day. If the process was any slower before the introduction of the special procedure, it can only have made a difference of weeks and certainly not of months. Therefore, I invite noble Lords to consider whether they are in fact, by way of the amendment, doing away with the so-called "quickie divorce".
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-18_para3"></a>I also question the use of the word "informal". It is certainly true that under the special procedure, the petitioner does not have to give evidence in open court, but he or she still has to swear an affidavit or make an affirmation in support of the matters set out in the petition. That is treated sufficiently seriously in that, if a false affidavit is sworn and discovered, the Queen's Proctor can intervene in the normal way.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-18_para4"></a>With respect, I should point out that the noble Lord, Lord Coleraine, made a separate point about defended divorces. We are in fact talking about the special procedure, which applies only to undefended divorces. However, the noble Lord is perfectly right to say that it is not altogether easy under the present regime to defend a divorce, especially if behaviour is alleged. But the Legal Aid Board takes the view that it is common ground that the marriage has irretrievably broken down. There are certainly considerable procedural pressures <P>


<a name="column_69"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 69</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>within the machinery of the court to persuade people to compromise divorce suits so that they do not take up substantial time in the courts with arguments over allegations of behaviour which, if necessary, can be watered down. The question of defending divorces is not the same as the issue regarding the special procedure. I wonder whether the abolition of that procedure would really make any impact on the speed with which an undefended divorce could be obtained.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-18_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Elles: </B>   My Lords, I should like to express my support for the principle set out in the amendment proposed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale. The noble Lord, Lord Meston, pointed out that there may be technical difficulties in so far as we are talking about undefended divorces. He also wondered whether the amendment would have the desired effect which lies behind the noble and learned Lord's proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-18_para5"></a>As I understand it, those proposals entirely support what my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor has been saying right through the proceedings on the Bill; namely, that one of the main purposes of the legislation is to abolish quickie divorces. He could not see why someone who was at fault should be able to get a quick divorce and be able to remarry, whereas in other cases, if one had to wait for consent for two years or five years, the innocent party may be prevented from remarrying. I understand that to be one of the principles involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-18_para6"></a>The other principle stressed by my noble and learned friend this afternoon is in sticking firmly to his view that, under the Bill, the minimum time from the date of the statement should be a year. That will give couples time for reconciliation, reflection and consideration. Regardless of the actual wording of the amendment, it is quite clear that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon, has the objective of introducing a system whereby the quickie divorce is stopped and no divorce granted until after one year from the time when the petition is presented to the court.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-18_para7"></a>I suggest that the principle underlying Amendment No. 95 and the implementing amendment, Amendment No. 116, should be looked at again and, possibly, retabled on Third Reading. I hope that my noble and learned friend will agree that the principle is one that he can support. That redrafting should also take into account one problem not addressed by the current amendment; namely, the question of those divorces which are, so to speak, on track at present.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-18_para8"></a>I think it would be very difficult to introduce with this Bill at Royal Assent that this particular amendment or principle should be adopted straight away but then only start the new system as from the date of the Act coming into force which would not be made retrospective.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, since I have signed the amendment I would like briefly to support what has already been said by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon, and others. I believe that the case that has been put is entirely logical and one which I hope the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor <P>


<a name="column_70"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 70</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will accept. The only thing that strikes me is that all the way through this Bill we have been talking about the necessity to end quickie divorces. It seems to me that we need not have had this Bill at all. All we need to have done was to repeal the 1973 Act and we would have achieved what the noble and learned Lord wanted to achieve and what everybody else apparently wants to achieve.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-18_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   My Lords, I want to support everything the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, has said on this. This is entirely in line with what the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor wishes: that is, to get rid of the so-called quickie divorce and to keep, as my noble friend Lady Elles said, the month. As I understand it, the special procedure fixes the time between the decree nisi and the decree absolute at six weeks at least, which by any measure is a very short time. The original statute suggested six months. What we would be doing by this would be having a year. This is a very important principle. If we believe in it we should stand by it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-18_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, the principle of the quickie divorce is that you get divorced more quickly if you allege fault than if you do not. That is my understanding of the principle behind it and that is enshrined in the present law. This amendment is not intended to take effect to change that while the matter is in transition. I am certainly very much in favour of doing away with that principle because I think that it is inimical to any kind of signal that fault is something of which Parliament disapproves and to which a stigma is attached.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-18_para9"></a>This amendment does not attempt to do that. What it seeks to do is to produce on the existing law some part of what we are proposing: the one-year period of reflection and consideration. As I understand it, this transition will allow--indeed, require--allegations of fault to be made in the petition. The amendment refers, as your Lordships have it, to grounds 1(2)(a), (b) or (c) of the 1973 Act; that is to say, grounds which require the allegations there referred to to be made. If I thought that that was a reasonable way forward I would certainly have considered that for the main provisions, but the point is that that destroys the idea of reconciliation. If you have to start off your petition by making allegations of fault you destroy the whole basis--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   No, my Lords. What it does is to accept what my noble and learned friend proposes, namely, that for the next two years there will be a petition based on adultery or on unreasonable behaviour. It does no more than accept what he proposes.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-18_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, it does a good deal more than that because it seeks to impress upon that a period of reconciliation, reflection and consideration. What is more inimical to reconciliation and reflection with the purpose of restoring the marriage than to require that the process starts with allegations of fault? I would have thought, with great respect to your <P>


<a name="column_71"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 71</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lordships, that this would be introducing the concept of the period for reflection and consideration in the worst possible atmosphere where it has very little chance of success.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-18_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Coleraine: </B>   My Lords, is the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon, saying that the period for reflection and conciliation is going to come into effect from the beginning of the Bill, from when the Bill receives Royal Assent, or shortly afterwards, because it seems to me that what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon, is saying is that this amendment is to take place before the provisions of the Bill come into effect, which would introduce this period of reflection and consideration.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo960304/text/60304-19.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-19_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, my noble friend has read the amendment and, as far as I can understand, the amendment in subsection (2) of it does just that. It says,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"No decree of divorce shall be pronounced in respect of any petition based on section 1(2)(a), (b) or (c) of the 1973 Act until a period of twelve months for reconciliation, reflection and consideration has elapsed since the date on which the court received the petition". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Can your Lordships imagine a better way to destroy the idea of reconciliation than to start off by making allegations of fault on the basis of adultery that has destroyed the marriage or conduct that has destroyed the marriage? It is impossible to put these two together and have a workable system.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-19_para0"></a>I would love to go down this road; I would love to stop quickie divorces tomorrow, but the problem is that you have to substitute something better. You have to substitute something which has a chance of working. What I want to substitute is a period for reconciliation, reflection and consideration, and the best way to destroy that is to require the people to make these allegations to begin with. If we do go down this road your Lordships will be seriously damaging the period of reconciliation, reflection and consideration before it gets a proper chance to operate. I am anxious to introduce this new machinery as quickly as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-19_para1"></a>In answer to my noble friend, Lord Coleraine, I said that we need to do it deliberately because I want it to work, but the last thing I want to do is to introduce it against a background which is calculated to destroy it before it starts. I am as keen as anybody to stop these types of divorce but I do not believe you can do it by this means in a way that is likely to be effective.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-19_para2"></a>The second point I want to make is this. As the noble Lord, Lord Meston, has pointed out, all you would be doing is elaborating a procedure which has very little effect. I explained to your Lordships the other day, the previous day on Report, that in my early days it was all fault-based and the idea, for anyone who actually experienced it, that that helped and made marriage more successful and helped to produce reconciliation is just nonsense.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-19_para3"></a>Much as I would like to support getting rid of these divorces quickly, the only way to do it is by introducing a constructive, properly thought out new system asthis Bill seeks to introduce. I believe it will do that if your <P>


<a name="column_72"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 72</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lordships pass this Bill in something like its present form. However, I believe that the system in the amendment will not do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-19_para4"></a>If your Lordships look at subsections (1) and (2) of the amendment, what is the point of subsection (1) unless you wish to give, as the noble Lord, Lord Meston, said, more legal aid money to lawyers? If your Lordships wish that as an aim in itself then you will pass this amendment. But if, on the other hand, you wish me to use the money to help set up something better, then you will refuse this amendment. I cannot see for the life of me what the benefit is of subsection (1) of this amendment. I can see some sense in subsection (2) but for the insuperable problem to which I have drawn attention, namely, that you do not have much of a chance of reconciliation if you have to start off by alleging that the marriage has broken down by one of the named features. I hope that your Lordships who share my view that the sooner we get rid of the present system the better will not support this amendment on the grounds that it does so.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to all those who supported the amendment. I am particularly grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Young, who put it as a point of principle, which it is. So your Lordships are free to vote on the amendment as conscience directs.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-19_para5"></a>My noble and learned friend said over and over again that the amendment requires the person seeking a divorce to allege a fault. It does no such thing. It requires nobody to do anything. It proceeds on the basis that for the next two years that is how divorces will be obtained. I do not accept for a moment that because a fault has been alleged in a petition there is no opportunity, no suitable need, for consideration, reflection and, if possible, reconciliation. There are many petitions where the parties can be helped in that way by being delayed for a year and being given assistance with counsellors.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-19_para6"></a>The quickie divorce is such a disgrace to the law and such an affront to the institution of marriage that I must ask your Lordships to support me in the Division Lobby.

<A NAME="60304-19_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, I should like to say that I was quite wrong, and I have already apologised in writing to the noble Lord, Lord Clifford, in preventing him from speaking when it was his right to do so. It is, of course, open to any noble Lord to speak to any amendment at the point when the Question is put.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-19_para10"></a>I beg to move that consideration of the Report stage of the Bill be adjourned until twenty-past eight.

<FONT SIZE=3>Contracting Out (Management Functions in relation to certain Community Homes) Order 1996
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the draft Contracting Out (Management Functions in relation to certain Community Homes) Order 1996, laid before the House on 16th January, be approved.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-19_para12"></a>Your Lordships will recollect that the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 included powers of demonopolisation of the provision of secure accommodation in residential children's homes. That measure was brought forward after full consultation with local government and the voluntary and private sectors. The power was implemented in May last year. Also included in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act was a power to enable local authorities to contract out the management of existing secure accommodation in community homes and, with the consent of managers, in controlled community homes.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-19_para13"></a>That power will be implemented shortly. The statutory instrument before us today relates to an order-making power included in the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 and will enable local authorities to contract out the management of open (non-secure) accommodation in community homes. We have consulted on this measure with interested parties, including local government organisations.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-19_para14"></a>All the powers that I have mentioned are interrelated. They support the Government's policy towards the child care system, which is to encourage a wide and diverse range of providers as in other aspects of social services. We believe that local authorities should be able to bring the philosophy and experience of the voluntary sector or the particular skills of the private sector to bear on the management of children's homes. Local authorities should also be able to choose from a range of options in their search for the most efficient and effective ways of providing accommodation for "looked after" children.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-19_para15"></a>Residential care remains an important element in the options open to local authorities in placing looked after children. It represents a positive choice, not a last resort, and the quality of care should be of the highest order. This measure offers local authorities greater flexibility in making arrangements for such care.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-19_para16"></a>I should like to reassure your Lordships that local authorities will continue to be responsible for decisions about the placement of children in their care and they will continue to have proper regard for the rights and welfare of young people.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-19_para17"></a>I should also like to make it clear that, as soon as a legislative opportunity presents itself, the Government will bring in a power to enable local authorities to contract out open accommodation in controlled community homes. The lack of such provisions presents an anomaly which, because of parliamentary time constraints, we were unable to rectify when the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 passed through this House.

<P>
<A NAME="60304-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, the House will be grateful to the Minister for her very clear explanation of the order. I did not entirely understand one point. Paragraph 2(2) leaves out of the order the contracting out--or the privatisation--of secure homes. When the Minister replies, perhaps she will amplify the last point that she made about the new order which the Government intend to bring in. She referred to,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"open accommodation in controlled community homes". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para0"></a>I presume that those are not homes which are secure homes. Perhaps she will clarify that point, because those are specifically left out of this order for reasons that I fully understand. If she will explain that, I shall be grateful.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para1"></a>From these Benches we are pleased to support the order. I have a few questions on clarification. What are the cost implications, if any, for the local authorities? Are they related to costs or efficiency? How will emergency referrals be handled? Will the contracts let be based on the number of places provided with some spare capacity allowed, or will the contracts be let on some other basis? I imagine that there are occasions when those homes are used for temporary accommodation while children are awaiting fostering. Presumably there will have to be some leeway in the contract to allow either for temporary use or for emergency referrals.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para2"></a>Will the Minister also tell the House what arrangements will be made for the education of the children where the management is contracted out? Will the contract have specific educational provisions or are those to be the responsibility of the relevant education authority? If there is an overlap between the two, how will it be handled?
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para3"></a>Finally, and most crucially, what are the inspection and supervision arrangements for these contracts? Who will be finally responsible for ensuring that the requirements are met which we all accept? We have had some unfortunate episodes in children's homes in recent years. I am sure that the Minister is satisfied, but we should like it on the record that contracting out will not lead to a greater risk of such unfortunate incidents.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para4"></a>The children in these homes have come from disturbed and disadvantaged backgrounds. We should not add to the burdens on them. I am sure that that is not the intention of the order. If the Minister will explain those points, and, in particular, the open and controlled environment, I shall be grateful.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-20_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Carter, for his thoughtful contribution, and the questions that he posed. I shall do my best to deal with those anxieties. I shall leave his first concern until the end.

<A NAME = "60304-20_para5"></a>The first question that the noble Lord asked me was how local authorities will meet the cost of placing children. There should not be any costs. The revenue costs of running children's homes already fall on the local authorities, which may charge other authorities placing children. Central government also pays local authorities in respect of certain types of placement. That will continue. However, if there are cost implications regarding the management, those will be offset by savings in not having directly to manage the homes.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para6"></a>The noble Lord was concerned about emergency referrals and spare capacity. If the judgment of the local authority is such that some spare capacity is needed, there is no difference between allowing for spare capacity in local authority-run homes and those subject to contracted out management. They may all be part of the contract and one would expect it to be covered by the contracting out services within the home.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para7"></a>One would expect the education and question of where the authorities place the children to be arranged through the contracts. We are certainly not trying to change the regime in any way.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para8"></a>The noble Lord is right to bring attention to the importance of inspection. I am pleased to tell him that inspection arrangements for children's residential care are being considered as part of the 1995 review, which deals with all inspection and regulation arrangements. But in the meantime, as the purchasers, local authorities will wish to satisfy themselves about the level and quality of care service which is provided. The contract, in effect, will be a powerful tool that the local authority can exercise.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para9"></a>Section 70 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act does not allow secure homes to be contracted out but the Government intend to enable contracting out of secure and controlled community homes when the legislative time allows. As I understand it, the controlled homes are a historical anomaly; they were the old approved homes. They are not covered by the secure homes legislation to which I referred at the beginning of my speech.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para10"></a>I am sure that noble Lords will agree with me that the measure before the House today will allow local authorities greater flexibility in the delivery of an important service. Residential care remains a significant element in looking after those children who, for one reason or another, are in the public care. For, while the number of young people placed in residential care has reduced in recent years, those who are placed are often the most difficult and disturbed. We owe a duty to them to ensure that high quality services are available and that those services represent value for the taxpayers' money. The contracting out order achieves this by ensuring that all the safeguards currently in place will remain, added to which the wealth of experience of the voluntary and private sector can be brought to bear on this area of provision. I hope that I have managed to reassure the noble Lord on the matters that concerned him. I commend the order to the House.

<BR>
(" "mediation" means family mediation conducted by a person accredited as a mediator in family mediation to an organisation which is concerned with such mediation and which is approved for the purposes of this Part by the Lord Chancellor.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I seek to speak on the National Family Mediation Service. There has been so much misunderstanding concerning both the service and those who work in it that I hope noble Lords will forgive me if I give a full explanation, including a definition of the family mediation service.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para19"></a>Family mediation is a process in which an impartial third person--the mediator--assists couples considering separation or divorce to make arrangements to communicate better, to reduce conflict between them and to reach their own agreed decisions. The issues to be decided may concern separation; the divorce; children; finance; and property. The mediator has no stake in any dispute, is not identified with any of the competing interests and has no power to impose a settlement on the participants, who retain authority to make their own decisions. Couples enter mediation voluntarily to work together on the practical consequences of family breakdown and to reach proposals for settlement which may then be endorsed by their legal representatives--that is important--and the court, wherever appropriate. Mediation offers an alternative to negotiation by solicitors and to adjudication through the courts, but is not a substitute for legal advice.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para20"></a>There are three routes to the mediation service: one, as a result of an information session; two, referral from a solicitor; and three, a direction from the court.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para21"></a>Those working in the mediation service are carefully chosen and, if accepted, are trained. Having trained, they work; and for the first few months their work is supervised. Many mediators are professionals: probation <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>officers, solicitors, and in some cases doctors; and there are lay people who are interested in the work and suited to it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para22"></a>It is with sadness and regret that I hear some people talk about mediators as "the do-gooders". I remind such people that, for instance, members of the Magistrates' Association are not necessarily professionals; they are not necessarily trained in the first instance, and all are volunteers, drawing only their expenses. I suggest that mediators fall into the same band.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para23"></a>Mediators receive training. A college for mediation has been set up under the guidance of Dame Margaret Booth, a former judge. The role of the college is to make recommendations as to the content of the courses, their standard, and a high structure of accreditation. Other professions have a college: there is the Royal College of Nursing, the BMA, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, and many others. As with other colleges, this amendment seeks approval for a body which aims to raise standards, produce a programme of training and provide accreditation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-20_para24"></a>I fully appreciate and well understand the noble and learned Lord's desire not to regulate professions such as mediation. I shall, however, be interested to learn what it is that persuades him that granting approval--quite a different matter--to a body concerned with mediation for the purposes of Part I would require him to act as a regulator for that body. I ask the noble and learned Lord whether he does not consider it right that the mediation service is approved--not regulated, approved--as is the case with other professions.

<A NAME="60304-21_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Faithfull: </B>   No.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-21_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, notwithstanding that very short answer, I think my noble friend's remarks in respect of Amendment No. 96A probably cover Amendment No. 98AA as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-21_para0"></a>Mediation primarily arises in this matter from the provisions of Part II in relation to legal aid. There are concerns about protecting a client against the risk of incompetent mediators. It is clearly important that at a stressful time of life, during the breakdown of a marriage, couples consult professionals who can be trusted to perform a good job.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-21_para1"></a>However, I do not see this as an area in which the Government should be subjecting the mediation profession to unnecessary regulation. I am not persuaded that the consumer is at significant risk. National Family Mediation and the Family Mediators Association have in place procedures to ensure adequate selection, training, supervision and accreditation of family mediators and powers to remove individuals or mediation services from the registers if they do not reach minimum standards.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-21_para2"></a>In addition, I understand that a United Kingdom college of family mediators has been formed which has agreed common standards and will have the same power to remove from the registers services that do not reach those standards. The United Kingdom college is <P>


<a name="column_79"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 79</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>planning to work out consistent standards with the Law Society in respect of family solicitors offering mediation. The Law Society intends to regulate solicitor mediators. That indicates quality of standards in an area that the profession is taking seriously and is dealing with adequately without the need for government intervention. After all, those bodies are all in existence as voluntary organisations at present. It must also be remembered that standards in mediation in this country have been built up over the past 15 years, and neither mediation nor high standards are new.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-21_para3"></a>In relation to legal aid I have tabled Amendment No. 99B, which provides that mediators must have in place,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"arrangements designed to ensure ... that the possibility of reconciliation is kept under review throughout mediation; and ... that the parties are encouraged to consider the welfare, wishes and feelings of the children".
<P>
<BR>
It also provides that the Lord Chancellor may direct the Legal Aid Board to include in the contract such other provisions relating to the provision of mediation for the purposes of legal aid as he may require. The Legal Aid Board will require mediation services with which it contracts to meet the terms of a mediation franchise specification. That specification is to be developed during the pilot study. But one option is to require that mediators and their supervisors are accredited by a relevant professional body. The board will audit compliance with the specification and non-compliance in key areas will result in suspension or termination of the contract. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-21_para4"></a>These arrangements would appear to me to meet the concerns indicated by the amendment in relation to accreditation. I should not consider the Legal Aid Board entitled to contract with any service that did not comply with those standards. I do not believe that anyone could object to the information meetings giving information to those attending about the possible risks of attending mediation with a service that has not been accredited and approved for state funding purposes. It would be perfectly possible, for example, at the information meeting to declare which are the state accredited systems. Anyone who went to anyone else would do so at his own expense and accept the consequences.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-21_para5"></a>I envisage the standards set by the Legal Aid Board becoming a kite mark for quality across the profession. That would give the client the information necessary for him or her to make an appropriate judgment regarding which mediation services to use without the Government needing directly to approve the mediation services as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-21_para6"></a>In those circumstances, I feel that it would be unwise to develop a system which goes beyond that. The approval will flow from the fact that the Legal Aid Board is entitled to contract for state funded services with the particular type of services envisaged. I regard that as giving a very reliable indication to clients as to whom they might use reasonably safely for that purpose.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-21_para7"></a>In the light of that explanation, I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment. The same principles also apply to the later amendment to which I referred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-21_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, the point is that I would be able to specify with whom the Legal Aid Board could enter into contracts. Those contracts would specify the standards of service to be provided, including the professional standards to which I referred. That is the most effective way to secure such regulation as is necessary in that area. My noble friend would be the first to agree that over-regulation in mediation--the Lord Chancellor knows best--would not be a very wise policy for me to adopt (apart altogether from my inherent humility). I think that that method of accreditation, which is not more than saying that this is who the state would use, is right in principle and sufficient.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-21_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Faithfull: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord for that reply. I understand that it would not be proper for the Lord Chancellor to undertake that. I only wanted a body to be accredited, not to include training or having anything to do with individuals. After all, the National Health Service is paid for by the Government. The Royal College of Nursing is a body on its own but it is acknowledged by the Department of Health. I thought that possibly it would be the same in this case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-21_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Faithfull </B>   moved Amendment No. 97:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Before Clause 21, insert the following new clause--
<BR>
(".--(1) Where a marriage or relationship has broken down or is in danger of breaking down and a contact order (as defined in section 8 of the Children Act 1989) in respect of a child of the family has been granted by the court to one party to the marriage or relationship and has not been complied with, the Legal Aid Board may grant representation under Part IV of the Legal Aid Act 1988 to that party to assist him in seeking enforcement of the order.
<BR>
(2) Where a party to whom subsection (1) applies is not eligible for legal aid, the court may appoint a court welfare officer to assist in seeking enforcement of the order.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-21_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment concerns the position of men or women--not only men--who do not conform to the access arrangements laid down by the court. I recognise that this is a very difficult area. The situation refers in the main to men.
<P>


<a name="column_81"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 81</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-21_para10"></a>In this country at the moment, as in the past, it is mostly women who are given the custody of children. But sad to say, some women find it very difficult to allow their children to visit their father. They make excuses, which, on the face of it, appear to be valid--excuses such as the child is ill, or the child has a sports day, etc. As time goes by, the children begin to lose contact with their father.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-21_para11"></a>That is not the wish of the children. I regret that it is the wish of some mothers, though not all. If the father is given custody, which is not very often, a similar situation might arise. At the moment, if people do not comply with the contact arrangements there seems to be no way to enforce them. Therefore, the first part of the amendment seeks to ensure that if a man does not have access to his children he can obtain legal aid and go to court to ask for enforcement of the access arrangements. However, many men are just above the legal aid level but cannot afford to go to court. Therefore, the recommendation is that they could go to the court welfare officer.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-21_para12"></a>I realise the weakness of my amendment. What does the court do? What are the sanctions? I have not made any reference to sanctions. I should prefer first to hear the debate. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-21_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, I do not want to protract the proceedings this evening but I should like to utter a few words of welcome to the second part of the amendment, simply because it is a gesture toward that rather large section of the population which is too rich to receive legal aid and too poor to afford the law. It is nice to see something being done for them.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-21_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may add one or two comments. The noble Baroness said that it is the general practice of the courts to award custody of the children to the mother. My experience is now many years away and I should welcome hearing what my noble and learned friend has to say about that. But in my time, the practice was rather different. If there were very young children, almost always the custody was given to the mother. But by the time that a boy was seven or eight years old, it was generally considered that he needed a father's influence and that was reflected in the custody or access order.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-21_para13"></a>Secondly, the reference by the noble Baroness to access calls to mind a point that has been frequently canvassed in the course of the Bill; namely, whether it is the divorce which does the damage to the child or whether it is the preceding acrimony or even the separation. That question has been repeatedly canvassed. We may have lost sight of two matters which perhaps make the divorce the decisive element. There are remarkably few men in this country who can afford more than one wife. So one of the results of divorce is that one, or generally both families, go down to income support level. That poverty has its effect, as well as any emotional disturbance, on the child.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-21_para14"></a>The noble Baroness referred to the difficulty of enforcing access and contact. That is a very real difficulty. That is the second stage which makes me feel that divorce can be decisive. My noble and learned <P>


<a name="column_82"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 82</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>friend referred to it in Committee as the indoctrination of a child. So often, after a divorce, quite naturally one finds a surrogate parent substituted for the natural one. That is again a source of great strain as it almost invariably involves, sometimes unconsciously, indoctrination of a child.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-21_para15"></a>Now that we have come almost to the end of our deliberations, is it not quite plain that the only way we can save children from the trauma of divorce is by putting children first, not merely with our lips but in our legislative acts, and say that there shall be no divorce when there is a child of the family under 16 years of age?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clifford of Chudleigh: </B>   My Lords, I echo the words of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale. I also support the noble Baroness. Contact is absolutely essential to the father; contact and custody to the mother is the norm. I am not going to repeat what the noble and learned Lord has just said but, very sadly, it is absolute fact. One of the most damaging things to a child is indoctrination. It is one of the hardest things to eradicate and one of the most difficult to get into a form of equanimity when it comes to both parents. I totally agree with what the noble Baroness has said.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Meston: </B>   My Lords, the norm nowadays is governed by the Children Act which includes the presumption that there is no order, either for residence or contact, unless an order is specifically necessary. The question of enforcing contact involves the court in what can often be a delicate and difficult task requiring, from the point of view of the judge, a combination of tact and firmness which is not always easy to achieve.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-22_para0"></a>Certainly, the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, is absolutely right in suggesting that fathers--and typically it is fathers who wish to enforce contact, either by achieving an order or by enforcing an existing one--should have proper representation. But I am by no means sure that legal aid is somehow excluded in cases in which an application has merit and the applicant has passed the appropriate means test. Therefore, I question the necessity for the first part of this amendment unless there is evidence that somehow legal aid is being withheld in appropriate cases.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-22_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, civil legal aid is already available for proceedings in the county court and High Court, not only in relation to applying to the court for a contact order, but also for a further application should the order not be complied with. In the magistrates' court assistance by way of representation is available. In appropriate circumstances emergency legal aid is also available. So the first part of this amendment is already fully covered.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-22_para1"></a>Under Section 7(1) of the Children Act the court may ask for a court welfare report regardless of whether or not legal aid has been granted to the parties. The court also has the power under Section 16 of the Children Act to make a family assistance order. That requires a court welfare officer or local authority officer to be made available,

There are thus already arrangements in place to ensure the kind of aid and assistance which my noble friend would regard as desirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-22_para3"></a>It would be wrong to try to impose a new and separate system on the one presently in existence. But I would like to say one thing about the background to this matter. As has been said by my noble and learned friend Lord Simon of Glaisdale--I believe it was taken up also by the noble Lord, Lord Clifford of Chudleigh--one of the great difficulties is indoctrination. In the experience I have, that usually takes place at the earlier stage when the parties are getting into conflict. One of my most fundamental objectives in making it unnecessary to make allegations against the other party to the marriage where that is not necessary is just precisely to limit that because there is nothing more harmful to the relationship between a parent and child than to have that parent denigrated by allegations which the child comes to know about.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-22_para4"></a>Therefore, I believe that it is part of the background to all of this to try to relieve the situation of the kind of material which leads to indoctrination because once one has it, as the noble Lord, Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, said, it is mighty difficult to eradicate. Once it is there it is very difficult to remove.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-22_para5"></a>It is very difficult for the court to know what to do in that situation. I am sure that my noble and learned friend has faced this as a judge, as I have, where the mother has all sorts of reasons why the father should not see the child. It is very difficult to get behind them. It is mighty difficult for the court to really have effective means of enforcing the measure without harming the child. I believe that the kind of arrangements which are in place are the best that are available. I say to my noble friend that one of the important things is to some extent to try to attack the root of the problem. I do not claim that all the problems will be solved. I believe that what is proposed, and the atmosphere sought after in this Bill, at least goes some way towards meeting the problem.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-22_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Faithfull: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord for his reply. Perhaps I may make two points. First, I am most grateful to him for having laid down and made public from your Lordships' House that there is a system which can be adhered to for the time being. I have to say, unkindly, that there are some--perhaps court welfare officers--who have not helped the men when they have been in trouble. Secondly, while I agree that there is indoctrination, there is the other side of the coin. I have come across children who have run away from home because the mother will not let them see the father. That has caused great problems. Therefore, there is another side to the matter which has to be tackled. Perhaps that may be done on a social work basis rather than through the law. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-22_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is designed to do two things. It provides funding for reconciliation on the same basis as it is provided for mediation. It provides that where a person's financial circumstances qualify him or her for legal aid, they will automatically qualify that person for legal aid for reconciliation also. I stress "a person's financial circumstances" because I am not referring to organisations. Funding for such organisations has already been well covered today. I have great admiration and respect for those Members of your Lordships' House who have declared themselves to be closely involved with such organisations, particularly in relation to mediation, and I am happy to declare my interest: I am not connected to any organisation at all. I am more concerned now with individuals than with organisations.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-22_para9"></a>I believe that it was the noble Baroness, Lady Young, who touched on what is a real fear among many people. I refer to the growth of the mediation industry. There is a fear that mediation will take over and that we shall see a huge organisation, with state funds and God knows what else, such as colleges offering diplomas for mediators. It has already been said that people are queuing up to get on to mediation courses. However, that is not what the whole thing is about.

<A NAME = "60304-22_para10"></a>I thought that we had laid to rest the argument about mediation versus reconciliation--at least, I had hoped that we had done so. However, many noble Lords appear to use the phrases indiscriminately, making a mistake that the Law Society did not make in its briefing on the facts of mediation, which clearly states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The purpose of mediation is not reconciliation. Instead, it is intended to help divorcing couples reach decisions for themselves about future arrangements for the home, the children, finances etc. Mediation can help resolve disputes about these issues. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Mediators have a clearly defined role. The mediator's job is to help couples reach agreed solutions. They assist negotiations as a neutral third party. They do not: </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Advise the parties independently". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
For me, that is an essential definition of a "mediator".
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-22_para11"></a>However, I am arguing that before a mediator becomes involved in future arrangements for the unfortunate marriage, there have to be attempts to reconcile the couple. I believe that reconciliation is the stage before mediation. I have suggested that nothing should happen in terms of mediation until at least six months have expired for reconciliation. I still hold to that point of view. The amendment is designed to promote that possibility of reconciliation right up to the <P>


<a name="column_85"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 85</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>time of divorce and to provide for reconciliation to be funded from legal aid funds in just the same way as it is funded for those who qualify for mediation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-22_para12"></a>I believe that it was the Lord Chancellor who reminded us about the first amendment which was designed to save marriages. We should do all that we can to save marriages. I have taken the view right from the beginning of our deliberations on this Bill that, without reconciliation, we have hardly any chance of saving any marriages. If we are sincere about saving marriages, we must be sincere about reconciliation. Reconciliation must be the first step. I believe that some form of reconciliation might have helped to save the marriage breakdowns that we read about every day.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-22_para13"></a>We have voiced our concern about the effect of divorce on children. There is enough evidence to prove that the children of divorced parents are significantly more likely to under-achieve at school, to be unemployed, to turn to crime and to repeat the whole cycle by becoming divorced themselves. There have been many studies into, and reports on, that. There is also robust evidence to show that experiencing divorce as a child can have adverse effects on one's health, behaviour and economic circumstances 30 years later. We have heard evidence to that effect in this debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-22_para14"></a>We also know that divorced men and women have significantly worse health problems than those who are married. Evidence on that is contained in a book called Marital Breakdown and the Health of the Nation (second edition) 1995. Furthermore, 50 per cent. of divorced men regret being divorced. I understand that between 20,000 and 30,000 people every year petition for divorce but turn back from going through with it. We need to get as many couples as we can to try reconciliation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-22_para15"></a>The Lord Chancellor's own MORI poll was quoted by the noble Baroness, Lady Young, who reported that it showed that 60 per cent. of people support the present two-year separation period where both parties consent. Indeed, those who supported the period for reflection and consideration favoured a period of 20 months. There is a feeling outside--among the fellows on the Clapham omnibus--that there should be more time for consideration. Divorce should not be rushed into. It should not be something that is hurried, with only 12 months' notice being given and "bang bang" and that is the end of it--divorce with no holds barred.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-22_para16"></a>I believe that it was the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor who said that there is no proof that money could be saved as a result of this process. However, the state spends over &#163;3 billion every year on the consequences of divorce and we know that reconciliation is possible because we know that every year there are between 20,000 and 30,000 fewer divorces than there are petitions. We know that a substantial proportion of couples turn back from divorce. That saves money. Every time a couple turn back from divorce and are reconciled we save money <P>

<A NAME="60304-23_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I do not know to which of my numerous speeches the noble Lord is referring, but I have no recollection of saying what he has just recounted.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Stallard: </B>   My Lords, if I am wrong, I hope that I shall be forgiven. I had thought that that was what the noble and learned Lord said earlier although I did not take down his words verbatim. I believe that the noble and learned Lord challenged us by saying that there is no proof that money could be saved. We shall have to look this up in Hansard tomorrow. If I am wrong, I certainly apologise, but I have a clear recollection of the noble and learned Lord referring in some way to the saving of money in relation to marriages.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-23_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, perhaps the noble Lord will allow me. What I said--we are all subject to Hansard and to the vagaries of my memory--was that I thought that if it could be shown that particular services prevented marital breakdown and saved the consequent costs, it would be much easier to get the necessary funding for those services. That is the theory of what I advanced.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Stallard: </B>   My Lords, I accept the correction because I certainly recall the first part of the statement which the noble and learned Lord has just repeated. However, that makes no difference to what I am saying, which is that it has been shown that if marriages can be saved, money can be saved. That is the point to which I am replying. I think that we can readily agree on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-23_para0"></a>Amendment No. 97A, and those grouped with it, would have the effect of doing what we set out to do at the beginning of the Bill, which is to save marriages, by taking the obvious first step of trying to get the couples to think again. We should give them at least six months to think about whether divorce is the right thing or whether they could be reconciled and become one of the thousands of couples who have already decided that they prefer to stay married. Divorcing couples should remember the many more who regret having gone through the divorce process and who would happily go back to their marriages. I believe that that is all that I need to say because most of these points have already been made. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-23_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   My Lords, I support the noble Lord, Lord Stallard, in these amendments. If one thread has run through all the proceedings of this Bill it is the importance of reconciliation. I believe I am right in recalling that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine, made this very point at the start of the Committee proceedings.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-23_para1"></a>These amendments promote two things: the possibility of reconciliation right up to the time of divorce and for reconciliation to be funded out of legal aid. They provide for the funding of reconciliation on the same basis as for mediation. If a person's <P>


<a name="column_87"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 87</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>circumstances qualify them for legal aid for mediation they will automatically qualify for legal aid for reconciliation. They make it quite clear that reconciliation is voluntary, and both parties and the counsellor must consent before legal aid funding can be used. I believe that the purpose is quite clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-23_para2"></a>I like these amendments because they are specific to the individuals involved. They deal with those matters to which individual people are entitled. Earlier in our proceedings today I supported the general funding of marriage organisations, but I consistently made the point that in my view funding should be only for marriage and not for all of the ancillary work that these organisations conducted. Although I welcome general funding, there can be no guarantee that the public money that is given will find its way to the people who really require it for reconciliation. We have recently passed the amendment moved by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor about supporting services, research into marriage breakdown and general funding for marriage organisations. But none of these gives a guarantee to individuals that they will be assisted in the process of reconciliation. At the end of the day, that is what it is about.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-23_para3"></a>These amendments may not be properly drafted; they may be too general. I would entirely understand, as I am sure would the noble Lord, Lord Stallard, if they had to be taken back and looked at again. But I believe that everybody would be tremendously reassured to know that reconciliation, to which all of us attach importance, including the noble and learned Lord himself, was made much more specific to the couples who required it and some funding came out of the money which went generally to organisations and was specifically directed to the people whom all of us would like to help.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, I have been pleased to put my name to these amendments and I very much support them. I should like to emphasise the points that have been made by my noble friend. Reconciliation is not only about saving marriage, although that must be the prime concern. It can also be about saving the taxpayer's money. Therefore, it is worth taking these amendments and the whole question of reconciliation very seriously. One merely has to give an instance of what has to be done when a marriage breaks down. Whereas one family has been housed in a single house, as soon as a breakdown occurs another house is required. Very often that is supported by public funds. Additional costs will arise. The cost to the taxpayer of marriage breakdown can be very high. It is worth while spending time and money on reconciliation services.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-23_para4"></a>I also agree with my noble friend that those involved in reconciliation do not necessarily need long college training. Reconciliation requires understanding, common sense, experience and, above all, a sense of humanity. I am sure that when my noble friend puts forward these amendments he is talking about proper reconciliation. That is why I support the amendments. Not only will we save money on social services and what have you. If we can save marriages from divorce <P>


<a name="column_88"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 88</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we will save a lot on lawyers' fees. I understand that the cost of a five-hour counselling session is &#163;47. Solicitors charge the Legal Aid Fund &#163;160 per hour for their services in divorces. I would have thought that that alone underlined the need for these amendments. Therefore, I ask noble Lords for their support.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Habgood: </B>   My Lords, it would be unfortunate if the impression got about that there were two rival organisations, one concerned with reconciliation and one with mediation. What we are concerned with are people we are trying to help in desperately difficult situations, with appropriate techniques for various stages of the process. It seems to me that mediation as it is referred to here comes after the stage when couples have decided that reconciliation is no longer possible and they have to go forward to a divorce. Even so, within the process of mediation the way to reconciliation is not closed. I hope that I shall help the House by reading a short passage from what National Family Mediation says about this subject:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is the current practice of family mediators to establish with the couple at the outset of mediation whether they each believe that the marriage has broken down. If there is any indication that they are not agreed, or that they are not certain, then the mediator will explore this and refer them if they are willing for marriage counselling. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Throughout the mediation process the possibility of reconciliation is kept under review by the mediator and if any uncertainty emerges about whether the marriage is over or not, he or she will explore this with the couple". There is no real conflict here; we do not need the amendments. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-23_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Elles: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may intervene, because the more we discuss this, the more difficult I find it to understand. The noble Lords, Lord Stallard and Lord Stoddart of Swindon, made clear the role of the mediator, as opposed to that of the person who is, so to speak, responsible for reconciliation. I understood when we discussed this in Committee that the mediator has a role to play which is set up specifically in the Bill as originally presented by my noble and learned friend. It is to deal with financial matters, property and children--making arrangements for the application for divorce. Those arrangements have to be made before an applicant can go to the court to ask for a divorce.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-23_para5"></a>What I do not understand, and I should be most grateful if my noble and learned friend would explain it, is what is the reconciliator's role? Is it the same person as the mediator or is it someone else? I had understood it to be someone else, and that the reconciliator, for instance, would have started, as I hoped if my amendment had been accepted, between the information meeting and the statement being made, so that there would be a chance to fit in the reconciliator at that early stage to avoid going to the next stage of the process. I should be most grateful if I could have a clarification of this matter, and specifically on the mediator's role. Who will pay the mediator? Who will be responsible for initiating the process of reconciliation and providing the help needed to save the marriage?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-23_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, perhaps I may start by trying to answer the question that has just been asked by my noble friend Lady Elles. The matters in dispute <P>


<a name="column_89"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 89</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>between parties who are going forward to divorce will normally include property and children, if they have children, and the arrangements connected with those matters. If the arrangements about property and children can be agreed, there is no need for court intervention. That is one of the principles of the Children Act so far as concerns the children. The court needs to be told about that matter for the divorce process, as your Lordships know, but there is no need for court intervention if that can be agreed. On the other hand, if it cannot be agreed, the court can settle the matter on a decision as between the parties.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-23_para6"></a>The process of mediation is a process by which, instead of having adversarial litigation, there is a mediator, who is independent of the parties, as the noble Lord, Lord Habgood, and my noble friend Lady Faithfull said earlier, who helps them to come to an agreement, and who draws their attention to advice that may be available to them, the nature of the problem, and so on.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-23_para7"></a>I read into the proceedings on the previous occasion a statement from the mediation bodies as to how they address matters of fault and conduct as between the parties, because in order to go forward we need to look at that. That is what mediation is. It is a process which, in default of success, will issue in a legal process. Therefore it is appropriate that legal aid in the ordinary form might be available or extended to cover mediation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-23_para8"></a>Reconciliation is different. First, reconciliation is a result; it is not a process. If people have been at variance--they cannot get on--and there is a discussion with someone who helps, it may be that they are reconciled. If that happens, the marriage is repaired and the costs that would follow on marriage breakdown are saved. Your Lordships will not find anything I have said inconsistent with that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-23_para9"></a>Marriage breakdown in this country is costly. I have said, and I say again, that, in so far as services that are provided are proved to be effective in preventing marital breakdown that otherwise would occur, thus saving the financial consequences of marital breakdown, there must be a strong Treasury motive, apart from anything else, in putting the money into the process that leads to reconciliation rather than towards the other costs which follow from marital breakdown. That is my position and always has been.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-23_para10"></a>The next point is that reconciliation is of course, as I say, a result, and it is a result which we would greatly like to achieve, but in looking at this one has to look at the process. What is the mechanism by which it may be assisted? If anything is clear to me as a result of a study of this problem, it is that, where a marriage enters on problems, the sooner it receives help the more likely it is that help will be effective. The more the marriage has got into trouble, the more it is on the rocks, the more difficult it is to get it refloated. Therefore, the earlier something is done the better. That is why I believe it is wrong to attach the provision to a legal process and to think of reconciliation, conciliation or advice services as associated primarily with the ultimate stage of a divorce process. In my submission, the correct way to fund the service is the way I am proposing in the Bill; namely, by grants to those who provide the service.
<P>


<a name="column_90"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 90</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-23_para11"></a>Of course, there may be a question of how often one can receive such help. In the ordinary course, before one can obtain legal aid one must undertake a test to show that one has some kind of case. Such a test would be difficult to apply to this provision. I understand that we need a recognised marriage counselling service to which people can go when it might be helpful to them. That is the structure that I propose in the Bill; namely, grant aid as regards those services. I have indicated that the level of grant aid is likely to be very much affected by the ability to establish that the aid given by this means is effective in preventing marital breakdown. I submit that the right method to be used in funding help for couples seeking reconciliation is that which I have proposed; namely, by grants to those who can provide an effective service.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-23_para12"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford mentioned some figures which Relate has given to test its abilities in this connection. That would be a proper footing on which to give grants. That is the best and most effective way of getting money to people in the form of service which may be of utility to them. My noble friend Lady Young asked whether it would be certain that the money would go to those services. That is precisely why I have defined the services very closely in the grant aid provisions in Clause 18.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-23_para13"></a>I believe that this is the best way of securing the kind of service which the noble Lords, Lord Stallard and Lord Stoddart of Swindon, wish. I hope that your Lordships will support this method of funding, which is not related solely to the end of the process but is likely to provide funding for services at a time when they are more likely to be effective in the structure of the Bill. I hope that in the light of that explanation the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="60304-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Stallard: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords who have contributed to this short debate and for the noble and learned Lord's positive response. I am still a little doubtful about the matter and I wish to study the noble and learned Lord's reply. The noble Lord, Lord Habgood, appears to have misunderstood a point. I said that if the waiting period were extended to 18 months the legal aid funding for reconciliation would be available during the whole period. Noble Lords should think about that suggestion before condemning it totally out of hand.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-23_para14"></a>I am disappointed that on the face of the Bill there is not the same recognition of reconciliation as there is of mediation. I would have thought that we could have been a little more positive about reconciliation for people who qualify for legal aid. I am not so much concerned with the organisations and the grants as I am about the ordinary people involved. If they qualify for legal aid for mediation they should qualify for legal aid for reconciliation. That is the difficulty, and I wish to take time to read the noble and learned Lord's reply. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "60304-24_para5"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, to avoid repetition and for the convenience of the House I speak also to Amendment No. 107.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para6"></a>Amendment No. 99 is simply a matter of clarification; to make clear that mediation should only be used where mediator and both parties think it is appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para7"></a>The noble and learned Lord gave us some assurance about this in Committee--that mediation should not be used where it appears to the parties to be inappropriate--but, of course, we do not know which party. It is possible that one party may think mediation is appropriate, another party may think it is not appropriate. We need some mechanism to resolve such cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para8"></a>More generally, we have in the clause a presumption in favour of mediation from which there will be exceptions, contained in regulations which we have not yet seen. The noble and learned Lord conceded that if the parties at the outset do not want mediation then there will not be a presumption in favour of it. But the question which still concerns me is whether there may be other cases, not foreseen at the time of the drafting of the regulations, when mediation may nevertheless not be appropriate and it would be suitable to allow parties who have refused or withdrawn from mediation to have access to legal aid. If the answer is no, then we have the risk of a rather bureaucratic system and perhaps the risk of imposing a code of values.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para9"></a>Assume, for example--and I hope your Lordships will not say this is impossible--a divorce involving two Jehovah's Witnesses. I know they are not supposed to divorce, but not everybody in the world confines themselves to doing what they are supposed to do. Their code of values may not be exactly identical to those employed by the mediators. They may find themselves in a situation where they could perfectly well have reached an agreement by themselves, perhaps with the aid of a couple of solicitors, but having a series of values held by the mediators imposed upon them which they find that they cannot accept. To say that a party in such a situation cannot have access to legal aid is likely to produce a certain amount of injustice.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para10"></a>There is a risk here--which does not apply to my hypothetical Jehovah's Witnesses but might apply to others--of people going round the fences instead of over <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>them. A couple of days ago a newspaper reported a most remarkable story of a horse race in which objections were lodged, as a result of which the horse which finished tenth was declared the winner because all the others had been round a fence instead of over it. If we make divorce too difficult there is a risk that people will simply go round the fences; they will separate and form irregular unions with other parties because the bureaucratic procedure of divorce is too uncongenial to them. So, unless we allow some safety valve for ordinary human feelings, we may be in worse trouble than when we started. I beg to move.

<A NAME="60304-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Irvine of Lairg: </B>   My Lords, I speak to Amendment No. 106 and will make a few observations on Amendment No. 106A in the name of the noble and learned Lord, although he has not yet addressed that amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para11"></a>Clause 24 adds this provision to the Legal Aid Act:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For the purposes of determining whether to grant representation for the purpose of any proceedings, recourse to mediation is to be considered, to the extent that the proceedings relate to family matters, as more appropriate than taking proceedings except--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) in relation to prescribed descriptions of proceedings; or </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) in prescribed circumstances". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para12"></a>I emphasise the words "is to be considered" as more appropriate than "taking proceedings".
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para13"></a>The effect of the provision is to place upon the Legal Aid Board in the generality of divorce cases a duty to refuse legal aid representation in favour of mediation. The clause means that the Legal Aid Board must, not may, refuse legal aid representation in family proceedings on the ground that mediation is to be considered as more appropriate than taking proceedings.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para14"></a>In practice, Clause 24 bites on cases where parties under the existing rules would be eligible for legal aid for representation in proceedings relating to family matters--for example, disputes about periodical payments, division of family assets or, perhaps even more important, children. But the Legal Aid Board is required to say, "We know that you do not agree to mediation. We know that mediation is supposed to be voluntary and the Government have always said that. But nevertheless, under the statute, we are required to regard mediation as more appropriate, whatever you may think, so there will be no legal aid for court representation but we will represent you in mediation". That is the reality.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para15"></a>If that is the position which the Legal Aid Board must adopt at the same time as it continues to assert that mediation is voluntary, I have no doubt that most people would think that that assertion of voluntariness is a hollow sham.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para16"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 106 is to qualify the direction to the Legal Aid Board which is contained in Clause 24 by a provision that mediation is not to be considered as more appropriate than taking proceedings where either party to the proceedings does not agree, under Clause 12, to take part in any mediation. Unless that amendment is agreed to, mediation will not be truly voluntary because the Legal Aid Board will have to say <P>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an assurance that he will state, as one of the prescribed circumstances constituting an exception in the regulations, where a party does not wish from the outset to participate in mediation".--[Official Report, 25/1/96; col. 1216.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para18"></a>However, having read carefully the debate on that amendment in Committee, I am now less clear than I was at the time that the noble and learned Lord was giving as explicit an assurance as I thought that he was giving. Therefore, it will assist me in deciding the position that we should adopt, even at this late hour this evening and certainly on Third Reading, if the noble and learned Lord will be kind enough to confirm precisely the assurance that he was giving in relation to the content of the regulations on this subject.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para19"></a>However, as a matter of principle, I believe that it is not right to leave such a central point in relation to voluntariness of mediation to regulations which are to come in the great hereafter. The critical point, affecting as it does access to legal aid for court representation where mediation said to be voluntary has been declined, must be on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para20"></a>For the convenience of the House, in the interests of brevity and because the noble and learned Lord has not yet moved his Amendment No. 106A, I desire to make a few observations. I do not regard that amendment as beginning to meet the point which either the noble Earl, Lord Russell, or myself have made and are seeking to make. First, on a point of detail, I rather think--although the noble and learned Lord will correct me if I am wrong--that his amendment is inaccurately expressed on the Marshalled List. I believe that the amendment should read:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Page 14, line 12", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para21"></a>and not "line 13". It should then continue to say,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"leave out from ('except') to end of line 14". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para22"></a>The provision would then read:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For the purposes of determining whether to grant representation for the purpose of any proceedings, recourse to mediation is to be considered, to the extent that the proceedings relate to family matters, as more appropriate than taking proceedings except--" </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para23"></a>and then we would include the words of the amendment--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"where a mediator has certified for the purposes of section 13B(3) above that mediation does not appear to be suitable; or </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in such other circumstances as may be prescribed". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para24"></a>A mediator may well think that mediation is suitable and would therefore obviously decline to certify that mediation does not appear to him to be suitable. It seems to me that that does not begin to meet the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and myself; namely, <P>


<a name="column_94"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 94</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that a party may not want to participate in mediation in reliance on the off-repeated assurance that mediation is voluntary.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para25"></a>In that circumstance, the purpose of my amendment (Amendment No. 106) is that the Legal Aid Board should not be required to regard mediation as more appropriate and, therefore, refuse to provide legal aid for representation where a party chooses not to participate in mediation which that party has been assured is voluntary.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para26"></a>It is no comfort to be told, as Amendment No. 106 implies, that the mediator thinks that mediation is suitable--I suppose I could say cynically, "Well, he would, wouldn't he?"--if a party does not agree and if the Legal Aid Board says "No" to representation on the basis that, under Clause 24, mediation is to be regarded as more appropriate than taking proceedings. That is why, in my submission, Amendment No. 106 is the provision that is required. It makes clear that mediation will not be regarded as more appropriate by the board when a party declines to take part in mediation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para27"></a>I hope that I have made my position on the matter plain. I hope also that, if the noble and learned Lord has an assurance to give in relation to the anticipated content of regulations on the subject, he will say precisely what he has in mind. For my own part, I have to say that I take the view that this is something which is so important and so central to the assurance that mediation is a voluntary process that it should be dealt with on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-24_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I shall deal first with the situation regarding Amendment No. 99 moved by the noble Earl, Lord Russell. Under the current provisions of the Bill, a person shall not be granted mediation unless it appears to the mediator that mediation is,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"suitable to the dispute ... the parties and all the circumstances". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para28"></a>The amendment would provide that mediation should not be granted unless it appears suitable to both the mediator and the parties. The decision would therefore become one to be taken jointly by the mediator and the parties according to the suitability of the case. There would no longer be a requirement to take into account the suitability of the parties themselves for mediation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para29"></a>The Government believe that it is mediators themselves who will be in the best position to assess suitability of persons and cases for mediation. Of course it is very important that this is done very much in consultation with the relevant party or parties and taking into account their attitude, willingness and other circumstances. Parties may not fully understand the mediation process and will thus be unable to give a fully informed view of suitability in all the circumstances of their case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para30"></a>As the clause currently stands, mediators will be required to take into account the suitability of the parties for mediation as well as the appropriateness of the case itself. The Legal Aid Board will be concerned to ensure that proper quality assurance criteria are in place to ensure that mediators fulfill this role responsibly. This <P>


<a name="column_95"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 95</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>clause will, however, prevent mediators from granting mediation, and so state funding, where a case or person is not suitable for such assistance. If certification as to suitability for mediation is by both mediator and parties, this may give rise to disputes between parties as to their suitability and, without some sort of objective assessment by a third party, may also lead a strong party to coerce a weak one into concurring against the weaker party's best interest with a decision either to mediate or to refuse to mediate. In other words, should that sort of situation arise, the protection of the weaker party is in the mediator. I should add that, as this clause links in closely with Clause 24, it is a mediator who will have to certify suitability and so the responsibility must be entirely that of the mediator, as the grant of state funding for representation may be dependent in part on such certification.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para31"></a>That is not to say that the client will have no part to play in that decision-making process. When assessing the suitability of parties for mediation, the mediator cannot ignore the views of the client. However, consulting with and listening to the client are not the same thing as the client self-certifying suitability. In my submission, Amendment No. 99 is not an appropriate amendment for that reason.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para32"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 106 of the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, to which he has spoken, and my own amendment, No. 106A. These amendments are both concerned with Clause 24. Amendment No. 106, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell, would have the effect of disapplying the presumption in favour of mediation if either party does not agree to take part in mediation. My Amendment No. 106A has at its heart the same wish as this amendment--to make sure that mediation will not be compulsory for those on legal aid. However, my amendment differs from this one in that it requires that parties applying for legal aid who are not involved in a dispute which comes under one of the proceedings to be prescribed in Clause 24 shall have to attend an assessment interview with a mediator in order better to understand mediation and its benefits.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para33"></a>I should say that my Amendment No. 106A is in the Marshalled List in the place where I intended it to be because I wished to keep in place the power to prescribe some types of proceedings in respect of which mediation might not be suitable at all. During the debate in Committee, some concern was expressed that the presumption would lead to people being forced into compulsory mediation. I hope that my amendment, which is designed to make clear the connection between the rebuttal of presumption in favour of mediation in Clause 24 and a mediator's assessment of suitability for mediation under Section 13B(3) of the Legal Aid Act 1988 introduced by Clause 22, will assure those who have expressed this concern that that will not be the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para34"></a>Let me try to explain how I see this operating in practice, because I think it is extremely important that in this area any refusal is an informed refusal. I do not want people just to say, "I do not like the sound of mediation". We want them to understand precisely what <P>


<a name="column_96"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 96</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is involved because I think there is a public interest, apart altogether from questions about money and so on, in trying, if we can manage it, to get the process that generates least heat in this area. It may help to set out how I intend that the presumption should operate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para35"></a>In short, it is assumed that a party requiring legal representation might first approach a solicitor. The solicitor would establish whether the case fell into one of the prescribed categories of proceedings which automatically rebutted the presumption. As I indicated earlier, such cases might be public law Children Act cases or applications for protection measures against domestic violence. Those are two examples which occurred to me as falling into the regulations under head (a). If the case fell into a prescribed category the solicitor could then make an application to the Legal Aid Board for a certificate for representation. If the case did not fall into a prescribed category the presumption could only be rebutted in prescribed circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para36"></a>The amendment makes clear that one of those circumstances will be that a mediator has certified that the parties were unsuitable and/or the case was inappropriate. The solicitor would therefore need to refer the client to a mediator for an assessment of suitability for mediation. An important criterion of any such assessment will be the attitude of the parties. Any unwillingness to mediate which is persisted in despite assurances and explanations given by a mediator indicates that mediation will not succeed, and so a party or parties who are unwilling are likely to be deemed unsuitable for mediation. There would, in any event, be little point in forcing such persons into mediation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para37"></a>On the other hand, it seems from experience that in practice it is not uncommon for parties to say no to mediation if asked in very general terms, particularly by a solicitor and particularly one in whom the client has confidence. However, once parties have met with a mediator and had the opportunity to discuss what is involved and its benefits, they often change their minds and become willing at least to try one or two sessions, assuming their partner is also willing. If, despite such a meeting, parties remain unconvinced, they will have been made fully aware of mediation and at least will be making an informed decision not to attempt mediation. It is important that parties are put in a position of fully understanding mediation and how it might help them. Therefore, the object of a suitability assessment is to enable clients, in consultation with a mediator, to make an informed decision about what is the right course of action for them and not to force them into mediation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para38"></a>That is why I have put my amendment in this way. There is also the point that I believe that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, would affect matters only at the outset. It is at least possible that in the course of mediation a disagreement might arise which would lead to circumstances in which it might be appropriate for representation to be substituted. I hope that that would not happen often, but it could happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para39"></a>That is my approach to these matters. It is my submission that the relationship between Clause 22 and the mediator's approach to it and Clause 24 is of such a character that an informed decision not to mediate <P>


<a name="column_97"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 97</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would mean that the presumption would not apply. I have kept the flexibility of powers to designate circumstances in which the Clause 24 presumption would not apply. That is an answer to the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, that it is impossible to say now that we know everything. Circumstances could arise that we are not aware of at this stage, and the regulation-making power is the best way of handling that kind of problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-24_para40"></a>I hope that in the light of that explanation the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="60304-25_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Elles: </B>   My Lords, before my noble and learned friend sits down perhaps I may ask him a question with regard to mediation in relation to Amendment No. 106A, which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where a mediator has certified for the purposes of section 13B(3)...that mediation does not appear to be suitable". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para0"></a>What right would a party have or what procedure is available to appeal against the mediator's decision? It could be that one of the parties wanted mediation and would regret that such a decision should be taken by a mediator.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para1"></a>My noble and learned friend will be aware that anybody who has had to deal with divorce cases knows of many instances where the woman, particularly after going through the process for six months, becomes quite neurotic and is almost impossible to deal with, either through mediation or a legal representative. As the noble Lord, Lord Stallard, rightly points out, we are dealing with people rather than with law. One could have a mediator saying, "I cannot deal with this person" for whatever reasons--neurotic or psychological. What right would that party have to appeal against such a decision by a mediator? I shall be grateful if my noble and learned friend will advise me.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_time0"></A><H5>9.45 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-25_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, it is difficult to deal with every possible situation. This is a matter of co-operation. The mediator in question would be intended as the person who would undertake the mediation. Obviously the relationship has to be one in which the three parties can work together. If the mediator says, "I am sorry, I cannot do anything for you"--I assume that he would not mention the factors that my noble friend referred to--the party might then say, "In that case I shall just go for representation". But if not, it would always be possible to try a different mediator. In order to have mediation, one must have a mediator who is willing to undertake it. That is where ultimately the court is the last resort because the court cannot refuse to undertake decision making even where parties are not particularly reasonable.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para2"></a>The answer is that one would have to try another mediator to see whether he or she would be willing to step in where his colleague had feared to tread.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Habgood: </B>   My Lords, before the noble and learned Lord sits down, I wonder whether it might be helpful if I were to quote from the mediators' code of <P>


<a name="column_98"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 98</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>practice. Much of the discussion that we have had has been theoretical. This is what mediators are advised to do:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Participation in mediation is always voluntary and any participant or mediator is free to withdraw at any time. If a mediator believes that any participant is unable or unwilling to participate fully and freely in the process, the mediator may suspend or terminate the mediation and may suggest that the participants obtain such other professional services as may be appropriate. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Mediation aims to assist participants to work out the arrangements which they consider appropriate to their own particular circumstances. In mediation decision-making always rests with the participants". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-25_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, in so far as that is addressed to me as a question at this stage, I accept it entirely as being a correct account of how mediators will proceed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para3"></a>I think that it is rather theoretical to suggest that mediation can proceed without the parties agreeing to continue with it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Irvine of Lairg: </B>   My Lords, before the noble and learned Lord sits down, will he clarify this point on Amendment No. 106A? I refer specifically to the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"where a mediator has certified for the purposes of section 13B(3) above that mediation does not appear to be suitable". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para4"></a>Does the noble and learned Lord advise us that if one party on consideration intimated the decision that he or she did not wish either to participate or to continue to participate in mediation then the mediator would be under a duty to certify that mediation did not appear to be suitable?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-25_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, yes, that is my understanding. I believe that that is a more flexible provision than one which determined the issue only at the beginning. This would open the way for a mediator, having had perhaps two meetings and having got on to a subject which the party was not prepared to discuss, or something of that kind, to state that the certification was possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para5"></a>I take the view that that is what the amendment means and that it has the effect of producing an informed decision rather than a decision which might be taken in the absence of proper information about what is involved.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-25_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I hope that the noble and learned Lord has been able finally to sit down. Nevertheless, I believe that those were three extremely helpful interventions which have got us quite a long way forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para6"></a>I was most grateful to the noble and reverend Lord, Lord Habgood--and I hope I am right and that is his correct style--for his stress on the mediator's code that mediation must be voluntary. What has worried the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, and myself is that in some cases mediation may be more voluntary than in others. For someone of considerable means being without legal aid, which they probably would not get anyway, is not particularly distressing. But if someone who can only employ a solicitor with the help of legal <P>


<a name="column_99"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 99</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>aid does not get it then the degree of voluntariness in going to mediation may be much smaller than in some other cases. That is the situation that concerns us.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para7"></a>It is just possible, before the next stage of the Bill, that if we could put together what the noble and reverend Lord, Lord Habgood, said, what the noble and learned Lord said about the position of the mediator being in effect required to certify mediation as not suitable if the parties do not want it and the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, we might be in a position to get a new form of words that would satisfy all parties. If not, then Amendment No. 106 would be the proper answer to the situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para8"></a>I am still worried about it. As the noble Lord, Lord Irvine, predicted, I am not in the least happy with Amendment No. 106A. The House knows that I am somewhat allergic to the phrase:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in such ... circumstances as may be prescribed". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para9"></a>I take the noble and learned Lord's point that it allows for dealing with future circumstances. But the point is that the procedure only allows us to deal with categories. Here we are dealing with individuals. In cases where mediation is unsuitable, it may be unsuitable for reasons which have nothing to do with any category whatever. The intervention of the noble Baroness, Lady Elles, was much to that point. So I cannot be entirely happy about that idea. I do not believe that that amendment is the way forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para10"></a>The noble and learned Lord was confident that the mediators themselves are ultimately always the best judges of whether mediation is suitable. There is a distinct Platonist streak in the thought of the noble and learned Lord. We have here guardians taking decisions for the rest of us through the benefit of their wisdom. They do not always feel comfortable. I am reminded of the occasion--apocryphal no doubt--when the infant future Kaiser was being smacked by his nurse. The nurse said: "Believe me, this hurts me as much as it hurts you". "Oh", said the Kaiser, "and in the same place?" Assumptions taken by wise and benevolent superiors may be taken with the greatest care and benevolence in the world, but they may still not fit the person. In the end, especially in family law, it is the person for whom we are legislating. If the procedure is not acceptable to the person, they will go round the fences and circumnavigate the whole procedure.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para11"></a>Amendment No. 99 is not the answer to the problem. I beg leave to withdraw it without prejudice to what the noble Lord, Lord Irvine, may see fit to do with Amendment No. 106.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para14"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, during the debate at the Committee stage of the Bill, I indicated that I felt that there might be some merit in having a code of practice dealing with mediation in order to ensure that public funds are directed towards those mediators who are providing a good quality service in the areas which we feel are most important. I have been considering such an amendment since the Committee stage. After discussion with the mediation profession and the Legal Aid Board, I have come to the conclusion that what is required is the amendment which I have put forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para15"></a>It is difficult for the Government statutorily to promulgate and support a code of practice without falling into the trap of regulating the profession itself, and that too rigorously. That is particularly so in relation to mediation, which needs freedom to develop and innovate in order to provide the best quality service as quickly as possible as the years go on. That said, it is clearly important that public funds are not spent on providers who do not provide a good quality service.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para16"></a>The Government are concerned to ensure that mediators are in a position to provide assistance in accordance with the aims of this Bill, in particular to keep the possibility of reconciliation under review, and to remind parents to consider at all times the welfare, wishes and feelings of their children. It is my view that in order to ensure that where public money is at issue in the provision of mediation, those ideals should be assured. I therefore tabled this amendment to provide that the Legal Aid Board may not contract for mediation unless it has in place arrangements to ensure that reconciliation and the welfare of children are given appropriate consideration during mediation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para17"></a>These matters are currently dealt with in the code of practice issued by National Family Mediation. Other important matters are also covered. I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Habgood, who gave a very clear statement about the details of that code when the House last deliberated on the Bill. The Legal Aid Board will of course not be restricted by this amendment as to what other provisions it can, and cannot, include in its contract. I should expect the contracts issued by the board to include provision relating to many other arrangements envisaged by the code of practice, together with more general provisions concerned with provision and delivery of mediation services, such as price, quality assurance, criteria and output.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-25_para18"></a>I remind the House that the Lord Chancellor has power to direct the board as to particular provisions which the Lord Chancellor requires to be included in contracts.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-26_para4"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, with this amendment I also speak to Amendment No. 104. These concern the statutory charge. That is like a charge on a house in the case of a mortgage. It is a machinery to ensure that there is something for paying legal aid. The object of these amendments is to introduce the same procedure as is used in standard matrimonial cases at present.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-26_para5"></a>If the statutory charge is not imposed, there is some anxiety that it may lead to pressure to use mediation, which may put unjustifiable pressure on those who are subject to it. There is a difficulty if legal aid cannot see any way of recovering its costs. In effect, it provides the procedure that we have at present. If there is any reason why we should not apply this provision, I shall listen with a great deal of care. In the meantime, I beg to move.

<a name="column_102"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 102</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>application of the statutory charge for mediation. As the noble Earl and other noble Lords know, there is a good deal of mechanism required in the imposition of the statutory charge. One wants to be sure that it would all be appropriate in respect of the sums involved. Application of the statutory charge is extremely complicated. The Government and the Legal Aid Board will wish to monitor how mediation works in practice before deciding how best to implement the statutory charge in respect of mediation costs.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-26_para6"></a>I speak against Amendment No. 104 at present but not against the intention behind it. I have always intended that when the statutory charge is applied through regulations to mediation in family matters there should be some replication of the statutory disregard which applies in matrimonial matters for advice, assistance and representation. I do not think it appropriate to place that on the face of the Bill as does the noble Earl's amendment. The figure of &#163;2,500 has been in place for some time. At some point it may become appropriate to change it and I do not for one moment imagine that the noble Earl would wish to prevent that, particularly if it were changed upwards. Additionally, I have already indicated the problems which I foresee in introducing the statutory charge in respect of mediation costs. I should like to see the results of the pilot study into mediation before deciding exactly how the statutory charge should apply in that context and before any decision is taken as to the level of disregard.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-26_para7"></a>I have been advised that, through an oversight, the current draft of the Bill does not give the Lord Chancellor the necessary regulation-making power to apply the disregard to the statutory charge in respect of mediation. I therefore intend to bring forward an amendment at Third Reading to rectify that situation. I am obliged to the noble Earl. It was by directing our attention closely to that matter that he brought the point to my notice.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-26_para8"></a>Some flexibility is required. Your Lordships may feel fairly satisfied that if it is feasible there will be some pressure to do it in the machinery of government. To impose an obligation to have that charge in respect of mediation would, I think, be unwise at this stage. One must have regard to many circumstances in deciding whether or not it should be done, and, if so, exactly how it should be done in relation to mediation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-26_para9"></a>In the light of that explanation, I hope that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<A NAME = "60304-26_para10"></a>I understand entirely his concern about piloting and why he is concerned about discretion to allow things to develop. I had hoped for a few more indications of how that discretion was likely to be used. I believe that we may now legitimately expect that at Third Reading.

<A NAME = "60304-26_para11"></a> I take the noble and learned Lord's point about uprating. It is a point well taken. But one of the very few cases in which I accept the legitimacy and propriety of the Henry VIII clause is for uprating. In fact, it was what King Henry VIII himself introduced it for. So, in my amendment that is a drafting defect which needs correcting. I have no doubt that the noble and learned Lord will do it. I shall be very interested to see what comes forward at Third Reading. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

In the debate that we had last Thursday my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor acknowledged that conduct is relevant. He said,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I recognise ... that there are situations in which the conduct of married people has relevance. This is particularly so in relation to the consequences of breakdown. The two principle areas where these matters are relevant are in relation to the distribution of property and the arrangements for children".--[Official Report, 29/2/96; col.1663.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-26_para26"></a>This amendment is related to conduct because Clauses 28, 30 and 31 omit any reference to conduct in the list of matters which the court should take into account. In this respect, they amount to a reform of the Matrimonial Homes Act 1983, where conduct was a factor and where some degree of blameworthy behaviour had to be shown before a man or a woman could be excluded from his or her own home.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-26_para27"></a>In connection with this clause we must bear in mind that Clause 40 empowers the court to make an occupation order ex parte wherever it is "just and convenient" to do so. Thus, under the Bill, a man may be turned out of his house with no advance warning, with no opportunity to defend himself and for no cause associated with his own behaviour. That is not only turning the clock back to where it stood before the landmark decision of your Lordships' House in Richards v. Richards 1984. It is going further even than the courts were prepared to go in those days by offering ouster orders on an ex parte  basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-26_para28"></a>Amendment No. 108 in fact re-establishes contact in the list of matters to be taken into account under Clause 28(6). In fact, it does no more than restate existing law to curb arbitrary and capricious behaviour by some custodial spouses who are prepared, for example, to use the children in a war over occupation. It is the, "I don't want him under my roof any more" syndrome.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-26_para29"></a>Amendment No. 109 addresses an important issue which is related to the one that I have just stated. Under Clause 28(7), the court "shall", not "may", make the order excluding Party B where it appears that Party A, or any relevant child, "is likely to suffer significant harm" if the order is not made, subject only to the balancing considerations in Clause 28(7)(a) and (b).
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-26_para30"></a>What is "significant harm"? The term is not defined save that Clause 57 defines "harm" as,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"ill-treatment or the impairment of health", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
or, in the case of a child, "health or development".
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-26_para31"></a>No one wishes to see a prolongation of physical ill-treatment or mental cruelty. But it is all too easy to obtain a doctor's certificate saying, "This patient of mine is in a depressed condition and will improve only if his or her partner leaves the matrimonial home". Understandably, doctors pay no attention to the interests of the other occupants of the household because really they are attending to their particular patient.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-26_para32"></a>I believe that subsection (7) is in fact unnecessary. All matters relevant to the court's decision are comprised in subsection (6), which, with minor exceptions, and subject to the addition of paragraph (d) on conduct, mirror the existing law.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-26_para33"></a>There is no pressure for change from members of the public on this matter, but I believe that there is a real risk of running ahead of public opinion if Clause 28 as it stands becomes law. To exclude someone from his or <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>her home for other than strong reasons is a gross violation of civil liberties. The two amendments raise a very important issue and I hope that my noble and learned friend will consider them carefully.

Indeed, the Bill is weakening it, because it does not include the conduct of the parties. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-27_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Simon of Glaisdale: </B>   My Lords, I venture to second this amendment although I shall not repeat the reasons that have been given by the noble Baroness, Lady Young. Having been retabled, Part III is completely wide open to amendment. On Second Reading and again in Committee, I ventured to deprecate any attempt to rewrite it or even to do anything far short of that. On the other hand, I also ventured to approve the slight adjustments that my noble and learned friend had made in the Bill as it emerged from the Jellicoe Committee last Session. I deprecated attempts at wide amendment partly because that might adversely affect the Jellicoe procedure and partly because that Bill had been closely examined by the Jellicoe Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-27_para0"></a>However, in my submission, this amendment is justified--indeed, it is called for. In invoking conduct, it brings this provision into line with Clause 9, where conduct is especially mentioned as relevant in the case of orders precluding divorce. Conduct is also statutorily relevant when one comes to such matters as financial provision orders or property orders. Including conduct here brings this provision into line with those others.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-27_para1"></a>There is also a technical reason which I hope your Lordships will allow me to put forward. It is a technical rule of statutory construction which is called the ejusdem generis rule. It is a rule of common sense. It says that, where there is a general provision and particular instances associated with it, the general provision will be construed in the light of the particulars. If there were an Act of Parliament dealing with, for example, the transport of animals and it referred to, "cows, sheep and other animals", the phrase "other animals" is wide enough to include menagerie animals, but the court, applying common sense, would say that Parliament could not have intended that and that "other animals" must be construed in the light of the cows and the sheep and might, for example, include domesticated goats. That is the question here. One sees the words "shall have regard to all the circumstances". If it stopped there it would certainly be broad enough to include conduct. However, it goes on to particularise (a), (b) and (c). Those matters would not necessarily be cognate with conduct. If one wanted conduct to be considered in all the circumstances, having particularised three one must add the fourth. Therefore, I support the amendment.

<A NAME="60304-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clifford of Chudleigh: </B>   My Lords, I repeat my support of the noble Baroness in both amendments. I do not mind reiterating the Richards case, because what the judge has to say about that is worth noting. He felt that, <P>


<a name="column_106"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 106</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>having granted Mrs. Richards' application, he had to make what he described as a thoroughly unjust order. The judge expressed disgust by saying:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Justice no longer seemed to play any part in this branch of the law". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-27_para2"></a>We are discussing the same branch. The matter would have remained there had not the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone, introduced the need for a degree of blameworthy behaviour when the decision was appealed. I am grateful to Dr. Stephen Cretney of All Souls College Oxford for bringing this matter to my attention. I know that he has advised others in this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-27_para3"></a>Part III of the Bill removes the requirement for the court to have regard to the conduct of the parties before making an order. Instead, it adds an entirely new balance of harm test which will dictate when an order should or should not be made. There is no mention of justice or reasonableness in the proposed balance of harm criterion. One wonders if there is any valid reason for leaving it out. After all, justice and reasonableness are now given prominence in Schedule 2. Your Lordships will note that from Amendments Nos. 120A and 126D.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-27_para4"></a>The courts have made it clear that an ouster order is a draconian measure. That seems to me to be plain commonsense. Do we not need more than a mere balance of harm test? Do we not need to have some misbehaviour before we require a court to eject a party? We should be most grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor for his Amendment No. 112F which goes some way to meet this point. One wonders whether it may go a little further. If it is asserted that a child is being considered, the mere presence of the respondent may be enough to have him ejected. The definition of "harm" in the case of a child extends to the impairment of development, which is very different from domestic violence.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-27_para5"></a>The noble Baroness has already mentioned medical opinions. In practice, it would not be difficult to secure a medical opinion that the presence of one party in a home damaged the health of a child. At the very least, the harm test should go. If conduct is restored, the harm test adds nothing and can be removed. Part III, and particularly these clauses, is not chiefly about domestic violence. In my reading of this part of the Bill I am unable to find the word "violence". It may be there and I should be grateful if someone would point it out to me. In any event, I support the noble Baroness.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Meston: </B>   My Lords, this important question was considered extensively during the Jellicoe Committee stage of the Family Homes and Domestic Violence Bill, as it was, now substantially restated in this part of the Bill. The arguments were finely balanced, but my recollection is that in the end the decision was to remove express reference to conduct and to prefer to focus on the effects of conduct or misconduct, hence the reference to "health, safety or well-being" in subsection (6)(c).
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-27_para6"></a>The thinking was that under the existing system-- I can confirm this to some extent from personal experience in practice--references to conduct in the <P>


<a name="column_107"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 107</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Matrimonial Homes Act 1983 tend to encourage sometimes exaggerated allegations of misconduct, typically by the applicant to persuade the court to grant an ouster order. The intention, as I have already said, of the Committee in agreeing the formulation which is reproduced in the Bill was that rather than look at conduct itself, it was more appropriate and realistic to focus upon the effect of misconduct.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-27_para7"></a>I have no doubt that, as under the existing law, ouster orders will continue to be regarded as drastic orders of last resort. It will undoubtedly continue to be the position that ex parte ouster orders will be extremely rare.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-27_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, Amendment No. 108 seeks to include conduct as one of the specific criteria the courts must consider when deciding whether to make an order regulating the occupation of the home under Clause 28(3). Under Clause 28(6) the court is instructed to have regard to all the circumstances. It will thus be able to take conduct into account whenever it considers it right to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-27_para8"></a>There are also three specific factors to which the court is to have regard. These are the relative housing needs and resources of each of the parties, their financial resources and the effect of any decision by the court to make an order or not on the health, safety and well-being of the parties or any relevant children.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-27_para9"></a>The reason for that focus is to concentrate the mind of the court on the effect that any order it may make will have on the parties, and the effect it will have if they continue to live in the current situation. That does not mean that conduct is not relevant. It often will be. Clause 28 recognises that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-27_para10"></a>In addition to the three factors that I have mentioned, where it appears to the court that the applicant for the occupation order, or any relevant child, is likely to suffer any significant harm if an order containing one or more of the provisions in Clause 28(3) is not made, the court has to apply the balance of harm test.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-27_para11"></a>When the test is satisfied the court has a duty to make an order under Clause 28(3). Amendment No. 112F, which I have tabled and to which the noble Lord, Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, referred, changes the definition of "harm", taking account also of the amendment which was tabled in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, so that harm to the applicant must be attributable to the conduct of the respondent, (although not necessarily deliberately) so conduct in those cases is clearly important and taken into account. However, for the reasons I have given, that does not fit well into the subsection proposed by my noble friend Lady Young.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-27_para12"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 109, which I assume my noble friend intended us to have regard to at this time also, would be to remove the balance of harm test where the applicant, whatever the marital status or relationship to the respondent, was entitled to occupy the property. The balance of harm test requires the court to consider whether there will be significant harm to an applicant or child if no order is made. If the court <P>


<a name="column_108"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 108</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concludes that there will be such significant harm then it considers what significant harm there may be to the respondent or the child if the order is made.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-27_para13"></a>The court is then required to balance the two and if the harm to the applicant or child is greater than the harm to the respondent or child the court must make the order. The purpose of this test is clearly to focus the court on the effects both of its actions and on the domestic situation of the parties. By removing the test the court's emphasis would be on different areas, and without the addition of the balance of harm test Clause 28(6) could operate to give undue weight to the economically weaker party, which would be the opposite of what my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Clifford, have in mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-27_para14"></a>Additionally, the test or questions of a similar nature are part of each of the clauses dealing with occupation orders. This amendment removes the test only from that clause which deals with an applicant who is entitled to occupy the home by virtue of having some property interest in it. It would therefore create the anomaly that a court would sometimes be under a duty to make an occupation order for a former spouse who had no interest in the property, but would have no such duty to make an order for a former spouse or spouse who had such an interest. Taken together, the two amendments would have the effect of requiring the court to consider conduct before any order was made under Clause 28, but not under any of the other clauses dealing with occupation orders. That would be a clear anomaly.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-27_para15"></a>For the substantial reasons that I have outlined, I suggest that the amendments are not appropriate in the circumstances of this case and, if given effect to, would create considerable anomaly. The matter was examined carefully in the committee chaired by my noble and learned friend Lord Brightman. The report of its proceedings is available. Amendments Nos. 108 and 109 have the effect which I have sought to describe.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

Under Clause 28(7), the test for making an ouster order in favour of the partner with the right of occupation against the partner without any such right--for example, against a partner with no legal interest in the property--is to make the order if the order will protect the applicant or a child from significant harm, but not to make that order if as great or greater harm will be caused to the other party or a child from the making of the order. That is what is called the balance of harm test. What is required is for the court to make a detailed appraisal of the consequences of making or abstaining from making an order.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para10"></a>Neither the Law Commission nor your Lordships' House in its previous deliberations suggested that there was anything wrong with the balance of harm test in both classes of case. Our previous Jellicoe Committee was chaired, with great success, by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, whom I am pleased to see in his place even at this late hour. I hope that he will stand up for the decisions of his Committee on that occasion. Neither the Law Commission nor your Lordships' House before suggested that there was anything wrong with the balance of harm test or that it should not be equally applicable in cases where the victims of violence had no strict legal right to occupy the property.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para11"></a>The new provisions distinguish between orders made in favour of those with an entitlement to occupy and orders made in favour of those with no such entitlement. So the balance of harm test, if satisfied, must result in <P>


<a name="column_110"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 110</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>orders in favour of those with rights in the property. But, even if the balance of harm test is satisfied in favour of those without any legal rights in the property, the matter is purely within the discretion of the court.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para12"></a>Under the proposals of the Law Commission, if the court is of the view that the balance of harm test is satisfied--that is, that more harm would be caused to that applicant or any child than would be caused by not making the order--the court must make an order in favour of the non-entitled applicant.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para13"></a>The fact is that the test for non-entitled applicants is being deliberately changed to their disadvantage. The courts will be bound to give effect to the different test in their cases and to hold that they have a discretion to withhold protection from non-entitled partners even though the balance of harm test is satisfied in their cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para14"></a>That severely weakens protection for the abused because it consigns to a second-class protection those already vulnerable because they lack property rights. It cannot be said--and I ask the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack to say if he disagrees--that the two different tests will make no difference in practice. If that is what is to be said, why make the difference? The purpose of these amendments is to give equality of court protection to all victims of domestic violence; and that must be right in principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para15"></a>Amendment No. 112 deals with a related but distinct subject. It is aimed at restoring the previous provisions in the Bill in the form in which they left your Lordships' House which hereto have been altered as a sop to a minority of objectors. But the way in which they have been altered here opens up a dangerous gap in the protection which the court may confer on victims of domestic violence.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para16"></a>The previous provisions gave the flexibility of renewing protection for as long as was necessary. Of course, the court would need to be satisfied that the continuance of the ouster order was necessary to protect the victim and any children. Typically, the court might make an ouster order for, perhaps, three months. The reasoning would be that in a domestic crisis the parties need time to reflect on and to take steps to deal with their situation. But if for good reason the three months did not prove to be sufficient, under the old provisions--the provisions which first appealed to the noble and learned Lord--the court had the flexibility to continue its protection for as long as was needed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para17"></a>Ouster orders in favour of non-owners may now be for six months only with the possibility of one further extension of six months but no further extension whatever the circumstances. I recognise that it may be that in many cases twelve months will, in practice, be adequate. But in the circumstances of such cases in a very sensitive jurisdiction, where the facts of every case vary so infinitely, it is unhelpful to tie the court's hands to arbitrary time limits. The judges should be trusted.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para18"></a>I have little doubt that some cases will arise in which acute difficulty will be found in rehousing the abused party or where the couples may be elderly, ill or even terminally ill. If alternative accommodation does not become available to the abused party within 12 months, <P>


<a name="column_111"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 111</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>under the Bill in its present form the courts are literally powerless to prevent that individual being turned out in the street. That must be wrong in principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para19"></a>I daresay that there may be sops to the uninformed which may not matter much in practice. Although he did not express himself in that language on Second Reading, that was the general sense of what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, said on that occasion. But I must submit, with respect, that this is one sop too far. It is repugnant to justice. Those who are in favour of the changes to the previous provisions--the previous provisions in which the noble and learned Lord believed--really have a duty to explain how their object can conceivably be arrived at by insisting on this gap in the courts' protective powers. How can the removal of the discretion to provide protection over an unlimited period of time conceivably strengthen the family or family life?
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para20"></a>I suggest that this gap leaves the abused and the uniquely vulnerable at risk of homelessness. I have some difficulty in accepting that the noble and learned Lord really believes that the alterations to the provisions in the previous Bill, now incorporated into this Bill, are genuine improvements. If he thought that the new provisions which he has brought forward are right, why did he not bring them forward in the first place? I have difficulty in accepting the proposition that he is truly persuaded by the arguments of the uninformed minority to which he has acceded. Therefore, I commend these amendments with a greater sense of confidence. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Brightman: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendments. I begin by emphasising that the Family Homes and Domestic Violence Bill of the last Session, upon which this part of the Family Law Bill is based, was not directed towards saving the institution of marriage; it was directed towards regulating matters after the marriage had broken down and after a family home has ceased to be a family home. It was directed towards the avoidance of violence between a couple who had set up home together and then split up. Above all, it was directed towards the protection of any child living in the family home. The purposes of Part III of this Bill are precisely the same.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para21"></a>One way of regulating matters introduced by the earlier Bill, and repeated in this Bill, is the making of an occupation order, or ouster order as it is so often called; that is to say, a temporary order regulating the occupation of the family home after the breakup of the relationship between the parties. For those purposes there is no logical reason for differentiating between an unmarried couple who set up home together and a married couple who set up home together. The earlier Bill, therefore, rightly equated an unmarried couple with a married couple for the purposes of that Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para22"></a>That was surely correct. If a couple are living together and the relationship comes to an end, exactly the same problems will arise whether the family home has been set up after a marriage in church, a marriage in a registry office or no marriage at all. Any children that the couple may have will need exactly the same protection in the <P>


<a name="column_112"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 112</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>one case as in the other. Therefore, it seems to me that the court ought to have jurisdiction to make the same orders on the same basis whatever the origin of the family home.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para23"></a>Under the Bill that we are now considering there is to be a built-in bias against an unmarried couple who set up home together which did not exist under the earlier legislation. The question before your Lordships is: is it right to introduce that bias? To spell out the bias in broad terms, an occupation order is to have a maximum life of 12 months in the case of an unmarried applicant who does not have property rights in the family home. No such ceiling exists in the case of a married applicant. Further, what I will call the "balance of hardship" is to be weighed differently if the family home was based on a marriage than if it was based on cohabitation without marriage. That does not seem to me to be logical because this part of the Bill is not concerned with marriage or divorce; it is concerned with a family home and the children who live in it. Therefore, I ask myself why different rules should apply to the jurisdiction of the court according to whether the family home was based on a marriage or on cohabitation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para24"></a>In approaching this part of the Bill and the amendments proposed to be made to it, five factors have weighed with me. First, the distinction between a family home set up by a married couple and a family home set up by an unmarried couple is not one which was recommended by the Special Public Bill Committee which examined the predecessor of this part of the Bill over many days and in great depth. Secondly, it is not a distinction which your Lordships sought to introduce into the earlier Bill which was passed by your Lordships. Thirdly, it is not a distinction which applies to non-molestation orders under the later clauses of the Bill, Fourthly, it is not a distinction which is supported by the Law Society. The Law Society has written to me to say that it supports the provisions of the earlier Bill in preference to Part III of this Bill. Fifthly, it is not a distinction supported by the Family Law Committee of Justice. That committee is chaired by Dame Margaret Booth. Before her retirement, Dame Margaret had immense experience in this field. She was a judge of the Family Division of the High Court for 15 years, from 1979 to 1994.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para25"></a>As a result of those considerations, I have no doubt that I ought to support this group of amendments, which are designed to restore the provisions of the Family Homes and Domestic Violence Bill of the last Session.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para26"></a>I am bound to speak on this matter objectively. I must therefore address one further question which concerns me and on which I may differ from the noble Lord, Lord Irvine. How important are these amendments to the general scheme of the Bill? I am not convinced that in practice it will make a great deal of difference whether the amendments are accepted or rejected. Twelve months--which, as your Lordships have been told, is the maximum currency of an occupation order in the case of a non-property owning cohabitant--should be adequate for sorting out the situation. As regards the balance of hardship, as I said at Second Reading, I feel sure that a judge will always seek to promulgate an <P>


<a name="column_113"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 113</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>order that is fair and just and suited to all the circumstances of the case without adopting too legalistic an approach.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-28_para27"></a>In the result, although I certainly support the amendments, I do not think that it will be catastrophic if your Lordships reject the amendments. Above all, I want to see Part III of the Bill placed on the statute book as soon as possible, either with or without the amendments that are proposed.

<A NAME="60304-28_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I agree with every word that the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, have said, and I do not propose to repeat it.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-29_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Darcy (de Knayth): </B>   My Lords, as very much a lay member of the committee so skilfully chaired by my noble and learned friend Lord Brightman, I should like warmly to support the amendments. Surely when dealing with cases of domestic violence what matters is the level of protection that you give to those involved, not whether they have been married or cohabiting. As my noble and learned friend said, the children of all parties need equal protection. Therefore, if the noble Lord, Lord Irvine, decides to divide the House, I shall go through the Lobby after him, because I feel that the committee got it right.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para0"></a>I should like also to associate myself strongly with the sentiments of my noble and learned friend, Lord Brightman. I have the utmost respect for the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, and I see that it is very important to get the Bill through.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-29_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, my noble and learned friend Lord Brightman summarised the situation in a way that, like the noble Earl, Lord Russell, I cannot improve on. However, I should point out, as I did in Committee, that the amendment appears to refer to subsection (4) rather than subsection (5). Perhaps that is a correction that the noble Lord, Lord Irvine, would wish to make at some stage, if by any chance this amendment were to survive.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para1"></a>The noble Lord took to me to task, in a rather gentle way, for having come forward with a Bill which is not exactly the same as the one that left this House in the previous Session. But, fortunately for the country, I am not a dictator and I require to get Bills through Parliament. Strong views were expressed in the other place about aspects of this matter, views of which, as a responsible Minister, I have to take some account.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para2"></a>My noble and learned friend Lord Brightman said that there was a bias against the unmarried--I paraphrase, of course--which there ought not to be. There is a distinction between the married and the unmarried in respect of rights in the matrimonial home, in that the married person has a right in the matrimonial home whereas the unmarried person does not. That distinction is in this Bill, just as it was in the law before.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para3"></a>It is not for me to articulate the worries of my friends in another place about this Bill. However, I think that they were concerned that the Bill might give the impression that we were seeking in all respects relevant <P>


<a name="column_114"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 114</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to the measure to equate the unmarried with the married. The Bill does not do that, and never has. But I was obliged to address those concerns. The Bill has always recognised a clear distinction between the unmarried and the married in that the married have rights in the matrimonial home which the unmarried do not.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para4"></a>This series of amendments deals with the unentitled cohabitant--that is, one who has no property right in the home in question. Looking at the matter in the light of the examples in case law, it seemed to me that the distinction between the two classes could be reasonably reflected in the way that I have done by giving effect in this way to the amendment which these amendments are designed to retract, without damaging the real protection that the Bill affords.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para5"></a>I suggest that providing for a maximum period is consistent with the fact that the unmarried do not have rights in the matrimonial home in this specific situation. I think it also right that the courts should have a discretion in the matter which they do not have in the case where the person in question has a right in the matrimonial home. After all, you would expect rights to have some effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para6"></a>I am not saying that the courts should be told precisely what to do by reason of the absence of right. What I am saying is that, where there is an absence of rights, the court should have complete discretion. I have no doubt that the court will do justice taking account of all the circumstances. In my submission, it is right to take some account of the distinction which exists between the married and the unmarried. I have sought to do so in a way which I am glad to think is considered by my noble and learned friend, who knows this Bill well, as one which will not have a very significant effect in practice in diminution of protection.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para7"></a>On any view, orders under this jurisdiction are draconian in character, and, where the person has no right whatsoever apart from the order in the matrimonial home, it seems right that there should be a limit on the extent to which the court can take such a serious step as to remove someone who would otherwise be entitled to occupy the home for the benefit of someone who had no such entitlement.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para8"></a>I therefore believe that it is appropriate, having regard to the progress of the provisions through Parliament, that such orders should be finite and subject to the restrictions which the amendments are designed to remove. Discretion in relation to the balance of harm test appears to me to be appropriate. A reasonable limit on the orders that may be made where there is no other entitlement seems to me also to be appropriate. I therefore do not feel able to accept the amendments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Irvine of Lairg: </B>   My Lords, it is a truism that no one is entitled to be a dictator in a democracy. I can think of no one less qualified by character and attitude of mind for that position than the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. However, the irony is that it is the uninformed minority whom the noble and learned Lord has permitted to be the dictators in the matter. I shall return to the amendments on Third Reading with some confidence on the basis that the noble and learned Lord truly--if I may put it this way--continues to agree with <P>

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para12"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, it would not be right for me to challenge anything in Part III of the Bill without first paying tribute to the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack for the amount of care, thought, effort and sheer intelligence that he has devoted to what is now Part III of the Bill, both in this Session and in the last. Anything I say is not meant to cast the least doubt on the proposition that he has done a good job of work.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para13"></a>I also wish to say how much we owe to the Special Public Bills Committee, under the Jellicoe procedure, chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman. I have looked at the minutes of the committee and it gave a far more exhaustive consideration to the Bill than any we have managed in the Whole House. I believe the procedure to be a good one. As regards these Benches, this is a free vote Bill. As I understand it, this is an issue of conscience and I hope that the point is taken all round.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para14"></a>In the debate on the humble Address, the noble and learned Lord said that the changes were a matter of achieving consensus. I understand the need to achieve consensus. The question is whether the changes have achieved it. They have conciliated some people, at the price of causing--to use language in the euphemistic way appropriate to this Chamber--extreme distaste to a large number of other people. If I am asked whether the changes have achieved consensus, the words which come to mind and which I shall not repeat are those of Eliza Doolittle.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para15"></a>I am not aware of a single person of my acquaintance who does not regard the changes, especially Clause 36 which I now address, with extreme distaste, to put it no higher. If the noble and learned Lord wishes to get a flavour of the way many outside this Chamber feel about the changes, he might look at the discussion on the Rory Bremner show after the Bill was abandoned in the last Session. I should not like to be on the receiving end of such comments.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para16"></a>The clause to which our attention is directed here is Clause 36 which instructs the court, in deciding whether to make an occupation order,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to have regard to the fact that the parties have not given each other the commitment involved in marriage". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para17"></a>That clause is on a fork with which we in this Chamber are perhaps familiar: either it is useless or it is pernicious. The question is: does the clause actually diminish the physical safety of people in cohabiting couples who have been subjected to assault? If it does, it is pernicious. It lowers the duty to preserve the Queen's peace below a series of abstract principles <P>


<a name="column_116"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 116</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which, in any country that puts the Queen's peace first, have to come second. But if the clause does not have immense practical effect, what is the point of putting it there?
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para18"></a>At present, 20 per cent. of live births are to cohabiting couples. Assuming that they have roughly average fertility, that means that approximately 20 per cent. of couples are cohabiting. That is one in every five couples we might meet at a party. So, if we start holding forth to five couples about the evil of cohabiting, it is very likely that one of those couples will be among the people we are denouncing. Those are the sort of circumstances in which it is wise to mind one's manners. Speaking in this way of large bodies of one's fellow citizens is neither good politics nor good form.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para19"></a>You can, now, if you are filling in an entry for Who's Who, appear in the volume along with your partner instead of your spouse. Invitations to presidential receptions in the British Academy--which is not an entirely unreflectable body--say that you may bring your spouse or your partner. It is in fact a recognised status. Those who hold that status, and those who, like me, have many close relatives and friends in that position, are liable to take offence at any suggestion that they should be treated as second-class citizens.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para20"></a>Why should they be so treated? One could argue a perfectly logical case on grounds of the religious sanctity of marriage. One must respect the view of those who think that only marriage in the sight of God is legitimate. I make no argument with that. But the Bill has already abandoned that ground by extending its protection to those who, like myself, are married in the sight of the state but not in the sight of God. So I do not see how this distinction can possibly rest on that view of the sanctity of marriage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para21"></a>The next possible ground is that which was advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Habgood, at Second Reading: the ground that marriage is a public status and cohabiting is not. That would be a sound ground in principle on which to make this distinction. But I believe it to be unsound in fact.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para22"></a>Since the National Assistance Act 1948, the law has increasingly come to recognise cohabiting as a status. The jobseekers' regulations that we passed last month referred, without any apparent second thought, to "a married or unmarried couple". I was most grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, for conceding in Committee that the view that cohabiting is a public status in law is a valid one. That recognition, made against his own inclination, is an outstanding example of the courtesy and integrity which make the noble and learned Lord one of the most valued Members of this House. I am deeply grateful to him for it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para23"></a>Cohabitants are clearly identifiable. So, if they in fact hold public status--and I will listen to what the noble and learned Lord says about that--that is not a reason for discriminating against them.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para24"></a>The reason given in the Bill is that they have not given each other the commitment involved in marriage. That, also, I believe to be false in fact. What I take to be the commitment involved in marriage is that sheer gritty determination which makes you, when things go <P>


<a name="column_117"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 117</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wrong, buckle down and decide that you are going to make it work, come hell or high water. Among those people I know well who set out to cohabit some 30 years ago, perhaps believing that they were bringing in a new order, that commitment has been as present and as absent as among the married couples that I know. In fact, there has been no difference. That is one of the things that amuse me most about the whole debate. They simply behave like any married couples that I know.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para25"></a>The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, and indeed the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, argued that the law may, in certain circumstances, discriminate between the married and the cohabiting. That I grant, but there must be certain conditions precedent. First, the discrimination must be relevant to the purpose of the enactment; and secondly, the discrimination must not override something of greater importance. I believe that this clause fails both those tests. The preservation of physical safety is, I believe, more important than plain sentiment. I do not see why the test of cohabiting is relevant to the purpose of this Bill, which is physical safety.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-29_para26"></a>A moment ago, the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack tried to rest a distinction on the ground of rights in the home. But that point, however sound it may be in general, is not here material. We are dealing with couples, whether married or cohabiting, where the spouse does not have a secure right to occupation in the home. One couple married is treated differently from another couple cohabiting, who in all other legal particulars are identical. That gives offence to 20 per cent. of couples for no good reason that I can see. Either it is a folly or it is a gratuitous offence. Either way, I do not see what useful purpose this clause serves. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Habgood: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl, Lord Russell, was kind enough to refer to my comments in the Second Reading debate. I speak in this matter as one of the unenlightened minority. Despite his very winning speech, I feel that there is an important distinction between marriage and cohabitation. Perhaps I did not express that extremely well when I referred to marriage as a public status. I should have said that it is a public and legal status.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-30_para0"></a>Surely, the simple difference between marriage and cohabitation lies simply there; that one is a legal status and the other is not. One knows who is married; and being married carries certain rights and responsibilities. One may know who is cohabiting--I certainly grant that there are many for whom in practice cohabitation works out in the same way as marriage--but a cohabitee can equally well be somebody who has simply shacked up with somebody else for the past six months.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-30_para1"></a>Unless one can draw some distinction between the permanent commitment and the kind of casual association which is sometimes what cohabitation is, then one is on a very slippery slope indeed. It seems to me that the place at which that distinction is drawn is where a relationship is legally recognised, and that is what marriage is about.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clifford of Chudleigh: </B>   My Lords, I totally agree with the noble Lord, Lord Habgood. I feel that the noble <P>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 118</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Earl should possibly consider that he may have been slightly misleading the House when he spoke of 20 per cent. Noble Lords know very well that there are people who, to coin a phrase, shack up. Let us be honest. If cohabitants produce children--let us say that one cohabitant is called Smith and the other is called Jones--are the children to be called "alias Smith and Jones"?
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-30_para2"></a>As regards the other point that the noble Earl mentioned, about invitations to parties as man and wife or a man and partner, that does not necessarily mean to say that the partner happens to be equivalent to the wife. I believe that the statistics that were brought up are totally misleading.

<A NAME="60304-30_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, in considering the question of what to do in relation to the powers referred to in Clause 31 of the Bill, which, as your Lordships know, is the clause which deals with a co-habitant or former co-habitant with no existing rights to occupy, it provides, and did provide when it left this House on the last occasion, that among the things which the court were to consider, in all the circumstances of the case, were the nature of the parties' relationship. I should have thought that it was quite obvious that parties who have co-habited for an extremely short time would be in rather a different position in an order under this kind of provision, from those who had been living together for, say, 20 or 30 years.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-30_para3"></a>There are a number of aspects of the parties' relationship which are relevant. I would have thought, faced with this problem, that it was perfectly reasonable to bring out the fact that, among the differences in relationships, was this particular difference. In my submission to your Lordships, this is a difference that is perfectly defensible; namely, that the parties have not given each other the commitment involved in marriage. That does not mean to say that they may not have given each other some other kind of commitment, but whatever it is, however like the one in marriage, it is not actually the commitment involved in marriage. They may even decide to stick it out through thick and thin and to have the grit and determination to go on all their lives. But they have not done so in the commitment involved in marriage. That is the way I see it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-30_para4"></a>They do not take vows in public which lead to legal obligations on both of them. Even following divorce, in the married situation the parties may have financial obligations to one another. By contrast, co-habitation can involve many different degrees of commitment, and so much so that I would go so far as to say that the only thing which is certain is that it is not the same as marriage. That is why I have focused particularly on that fact. This difference is all that Clause 36 is drawing to the attention of the court.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-30_para5"></a>I fully accept that a co-habitant has the same right to be protected from violence as a married person. I do not accept that Clause 36 in any way prevents that. It is right that the court should take account of all the circumstances, including whether or not the parties are married, when deciding whether an occupation order is appropriate and what its terms should be. That is not making any distinction of a class type, whether second-class or first-class or anything, but making a <P>


<a name="column_119"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 119</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>distinction which in fact exists; namely the distinction between a co-habitant and a married person. What effect that will have on the court's consideration in any particular case is a matter for the court, just as I said earlier, in relation to Clause 31, when the court has to consider the nature of the parties' relationship. The precise effect of that, in the particular circumstances, is left to the court.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-30_para6"></a>This clause was put in in answer to concerns expressed to me by colleagues in another place. It is legitimate to meet their concerns in this way which in no way damages the structure of the Bill and draws out in effect a particular aspect of a relationship which, in any event, will be implied. Certainly there is nothing to suggest that we are doing other than acknowledging an existing and realistic state of affairs, leaving the court without any further direction to take such account of it as it thinks proper in all the circumstances.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Irvine of Lairg: </B>   My Lords, of course there is a distinction between those who have given to each other the commitment involved in marriage and those who merely cohabit, but can the noble and learned Lord give a practical illustration of how that distinction is a relevant distinction for the purpose of the exercise by the court of its power to make an occupation order?
<P>

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-30_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, yes. The married couple have financial obligations to one another which the unmarried do not have, and that might well be relevant. For example, if a cohabitant is thrown out of the matrimonial home, that cohabitant may have no redress whatever against the owner of the home, whereas a former spouse who is thrown out may well have a financial entitlement to, for example, a periodical allowance or something of that kind. In such circumstances, the relevance of the relationship may well be important.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-30_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, it may surprise the noble Lord, Lord Habgood, that I agree with practically everything that he said. I think we all agree that we cannot extend protection except to people who have a public and legal status. If we do anything beyond that, we are doing something which is in danger of being void for its uncertainty. It is my understanding--the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon, supported this point in Committee--that cohabitation is now a public and legal status. It was never my intention in moving this amendment to defend those who have shacked up together for a short time. That is far too vague to be proper to bring within the law.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-30_para7"></a>The status of cohabitation is so well recognised in social security law (where it is part of the foundation of the basic principles of the law on the subject) that I think that it is clear enough. There are tests by which it can be recognised; such as where there are shared households and shared finances. When the noble and learned Lord said that a former cohabitant will not have any financial entitlement in the property, he is in fact mistaken. A good many cases are known to me <P>


<a name="column_120"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 120</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>personally of where a cohabitating couple have had a shared mortgage. If that is not a financial entitlement, I do not know what is. In such cases, we are dealing with something which is not void for uncertainty. Had I believed otherwise I would not have moved the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-30_para8"></a>I say briefly to the noble Lord, Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, that the test I used in arriving at my 20 per cent. figure is the test used by Social Trends of a birth registered by both parents. I think that that is a sufficiently precise step to be taken seriously, and that the editors of Social Trends are right to rely on it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-30_para9"></a>I listened with great care to the reply of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, but I simply do not understand why the difference which he rightly perceives is relevant to the force of this Bill. He talks about not making the commitment involved in marriage, but it seems that you could equally well say that I have not made the commitment involved in marriage because I did not do it in church. I respect that view, but it seems to me that for practical purposes I belong as to a married couple--and my cohabiting friends see it just the same way as I do. Those two cases are a lot more in parallel than most people have readily admitted.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-30_para10"></a>The noble and learned Lord said that the cohabiting couple had the same right to protection and that he did not think that Clause 36 prevented that; but the noble and learned Lord is on a fork here: either occupation orders are part of protection or they are not. If they are, the cohabitor clearly comes off worse; if they are not, what are they doing in the Bill? I simply do not understand why this distinction is relevant to a Bill which is concerned with physical safety. I would willingly withdraw the amendment. However, one cannot move that a clause do not stand part at Third Reading. This is the last chance that I have to ask for the opinion of the House. Regretfully, I must do so.

<A NAME="60304-31_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor</B>  moved Amendment No. 112B:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-31_para1"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, with this amendment I should like to take Amendments Nos. 112C, ll2D, ll3A and l30A.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-31_para2"></a>My purpose in tabling Amendments Nos. 112B and 112C is to remove a possible anomaly regarding ex parte orders which has been drawn to my attention. In certain circumstances where the need for an order is very urgent it is possible for the court to make an order even when the respondent is not present. When that is done it will be usual for a full hearing, of which all the parties have had notice, to be held shortly afterwards.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-31_para3"></a>If that initial hearing was considered to have made the first occupation order, the six-month time limit on first orders would be taken up by the first order. In addition, if that initial hearing was considered to have made the first order and the full hearing the second order, then applicants under Clauses 31 and 33 could have been limited to occupation orders for a maximum of just over six months instead of just over a year. That was never my intention. By treating the ex parte order and any order made at a subsequent full hearing as one order, it will ensure that the orders taken together will last for a maximum of six months in cases where Clauses 31 and 33 apply and it will be possible for the court to grant one more order also for a maximum of six months at a later date. In this way, applicants will be treated the same whether or not their first application is made ex parte.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-31_para4"></a>Amendments Nos. 112D, 113A and 130A are intended to ensure that individuals can take advantage of the protection offered against domestic violence, even if they live in an unusual home and one which would not come within the legal definition of land. I am thinking in particular about such things as caravans and house-boats but there may be other homes which should also be included. Therefore, I have also included the broad term "structure".
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-31_para5"></a>Amendment No. 130A applies this new definition to the Children Act sections introduced by Schedule 6 which allow the abusing adult to be excluded from the home rather than the abused child where an emergency protection or interim care order is made. There are some clauses which use the term "dwelling house" which properly applies to land. For example, Clause 27 deals <P>


<a name="column_122"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>with matrimonial home rights becoming a charge on the property. In these clauses I have not changed the definition of dwelling house. I beg to move.

(4) If, at a full hearing, the court makes an occupation order ("the full order"), then--

<BR>
(b) the provisions of section 31(10) or 33(6) as to the extension of orders are to apply as if the full order and the initial order were a single order.
<BR>
(5) In this section--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-31_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   My Lords, in this amendment the noble and learned Lord gives the definition of a dwelling house. There appears to be a new concept in law about what constitutes a house. I am thinking, for instance, of the protesters at the Newbury bypass who seem to have made themselves a house in a tree. As a matter of interest, might that be included in the definition, or am I quite wrong? We need to clarify this point.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-31_spmin3"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I do not believe that the tree itself would be a structure. Of course, one has seen elaborate structures that may be based on trees but I do not think that living in a tree would qualify. It is a caravan, house-boat or structure--my noble and learned friend earlier spoke about the just and generous principle and that would apply here--

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 35, line 20, leave out ("a person") and insert ("an applicant").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-31_para12"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 112F and Amendment No. 113 which is tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Irvine of Lairg. The amendments deal with two different but related issues to do with the definition of harm. Amendment No. 113ZA changes the definition of ill treatment so that it expressly includes forms of ill treatment other than physical ill treatment for both adults and children. Sexual abuse is limited to children.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-31_para13"></a>Your Lordships may remember that the matter was discussed a little in Committee. We had brought in from the Children Act the definition of "harm" in relation to children which includes sexual abuse and other non-physical harm. The noble Lord asked me whether non-physical would apply to the adults too. There was a difficulty, therefore. Sexual abuse is limited to children and I do not intend to change that. The term is widely understood in terms of children and can include any form of sexual contact. I do not think it would be appropriately applied in the case of an adult.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-31_para14"></a>The only difference between Amendment No. 113ZA and Amendment No. 113 is that Amendment No. 113 would extend the definition of harm for adults to include sexual abuse. As I said, I do not believe that that is necessary or appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-31_para15"></a>Amendments Nos. 112E and 112F change the definition of harm in respect of an adult applicant. They provide that the harm in question will have to be the result of the conduct of the respondent, although the respondent need not be acting in a way deliberately intended to harm the applicant. "Harm" is used in the balance of harm test and in the question relating to the balance of harm. I believe that, in balancing the harm to the respondent if an order is made against the harm to the applicant if no order is made, it is reasonable that the respondent should be the cause of the harm to the applicant. "Harm" is also used by the court when considering the need to make an ex parte order or attach a power of arrest to an ex parte order. Again, I believe that it is reasonable to link the harm to the actions of the respondents since it is they who will potentially be disadvantaged if the initial order is made in their absence or if they become subject to the power of arrest in such circumstances. I beg to move.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: I speak to Amendment No. 118, which stands in the names of my noble friend Lady Young and myself, and also to some of the amendments in a group which seems to amount to nearly fifty amendments. The amendments I shall speak to are Nos. 119, 120, 126 and 129. I understand that my noble and learned friend will be speaking to Amendments Nos. 120A and 126D, which deal with the same subject in this sub-group.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para11"></a>We have now reached Schedule 2, which deals with property matters on divorce, and the broad intention of these amendments is to alter the Bill in order to promote reconciliation and to give mediation and property settlements by agreement a chance to work out.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para12"></a>Under the Bill, once a statement has been made, a party may apply for and obtain a financial order. In the case of a property adjustment order, the order will be effective only on the granting of the divorce in due course, except in special circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para13"></a>As your Lordships will know, because we have referred to it before, under the existing law those financial orders are made only on decree nisi and come into effect on decree absolute. It is obviously entirely consistent with the thrust of the Bill and my noble and learned friend's intention, which I share entirely, that arrangements for the future should be completed before the divorce is granted. In this Bill, the question of financial arrangements should not be settled as late as they are under present law.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para14"></a>On the other hand, the effect of allowing the party to go to court immediately and obtain an order, whether that order comes into effect immediately or whether it is deferred until the divorce is granted, is really to create irretrievable breakdown in all but name. Once somebody has gone to court in that way at the very beginning of the period for reflection and consideration, thereafter there is really no practical chance of saving the marriage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para15"></a>It is quite clear that one cannot preclude applications to the court for the entire period for reflection and consideration. Again, that would make it impossible for the future arrangements to be concluded in time. Therefore, these amendments try to strike a happy medium and provide that you cannot go to court until six months of the period has expired. The effect of that will be that, during that period, the parties involved in the divorce will have the opportunity of mediation and mediation will be given the opportunity to get off to a good head start over court applications; or the parties may attempt reconciliation; or they may go to their lawyers and try to reach agreement without going to court. That is bound to be beneficial to the ultimate divorce or to the reconciliation, if that takes place.

<A NAME = "60304-32_para16"></a>Amendment No. 118 is a paving amendment for Amendment No. 120. In short, it provides that no financial provision, other than interim periodical payments, shall be incorporated in an order during the first six months of the period. Amendment No. 126 provides similarly for property adjustments orders: they are not to be made during the first six months of the period.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para17"></a>Amendment No. 119 deals with lump sum orders. Amendment No. 120 provides that they are not to be made during the first six months but Amendment No. 119 provides that during the second six months an order for the payment of the lump sum is not to take effect until the divorce order is made, except in special circumstances. The amendment goes on to outline those special circumstances, including the case where the parties have agreed early on as to the terms of the proposed order. At this hour, I do not propose to go into any more detail about that amendment. I should explain that in relation to property adjustment orders, the Bill provides that they will not come into effect until the divorce is granted, except in special circumstances. The special circumstances defined in the Bill are defined in fairly broad terms. Amendment No. 129 seeks to expand and make clearer what those special circumstances are to be. I believe that the total effect of the amendments would be to make the provisions for financial provision in the Bill much more reasonable as between the parties and much more likely to promote a good divorce. I beg to move.

<A NAME="60304-32_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, there are quite a number of amendments in the group. It may help at this late hour if I were to try to state my position in relation to them, giving such explanation as I think appropriate. Noble Lords who have tabled later amendments in the group would then at least know what I have in mind. However, whether or not your Lordships will be enlightened by what I say may be open to question.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para18"></a>I undertook in Committee to seek the advice of my Ancillary Relief Advisory Group (which is a group made up of experts, including members of the judiciary and practising barristers and solicitors, together with two leading academics) on the amendments tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Meston and Lord Clifford of Chudleigh to Schedule 2 to the Bill. I have now taken the group's advice and considered it carefully. As a result, I have tabled amendments to Schedules 2, 8, 9 and 10 to the Bill. I propose to speak to groups of the amendments which deal with particular aspects of financial provision. I shall, therefore, also deal with the amendments tabled by my noble friends Lady Young and Lord Coleraine, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Clifford of Chudleigh. At the same time, I shall speak to the Government amendments on the particular subjects.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para19"></a>Amendments Nos. 118, 119, 120, 120A, 126, 126D, 129, 133G and 133L all relate to the time when property adjustment orders and financial provision orders should take effect. Amendments Nos. 120A and 126D give effect to the intention that there should now be a general rule that financial provision and property adjustment <P>


<a name="column_127"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 127</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>orders should not take effect until on or after the making of the divorce order or separation order. The exception is that those orders can take effect before the making of the divorce or separation order where the court is satisfied that, in all the circumstances of the case, it would be just and reasonable to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para20"></a>Amendment No. 133G ensures that, so far as the taking of the orders is concerned, where the court is varying the orders under Section 31 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 it may only vary the time when the order is to take effect to a time earlier than the making of the divorce order or separation order where it would be just and reasonable in all the circumstances to do so. The amendments adopt the principles behind the amendments moved in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, and Amendment No. 119 tabled in the names of my noble friends Lady Young and Lord Coleraine.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para21"></a>On that one issue, however, I have not followed the views of my Ancillary Relief Advisory Group. The group's view was that those orders should always be made and be capable of taking effect before the divorce order or separation order was made. In particular, the group had in mind circumstances where the husband and wife are living in the same house with the children; there are insufficient funds to enable one spouse to seek alternative accommodation and the application for financial provision is contested. The couple are unlikely to agree a sale in those circumstances, yet the family could be living in a hostile environment for over six months until the divorce order or separation order is granted. The group considered that the availability of occupation orders in those circumstances would not provide assistance. The couple could feel forced to make allegations against one another so that occupation of the house could be regulated, or, alternatively, violence could actually result because of the tension in the home. The view taken was that there would be little to gain from having two sets of litigation proceeding at one time.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para22"></a>I considered the group's views carefully but decided that the rules should not generally permit orders to take effect before divorce. The making of the order itself should sufficiently focus parties' attention on the often grave financial consequences of divorce and the impact of divorce on their lives and those of their children to make them reflect further on whether divorce is really the right path for them to follow. Parties will not, therefore, generally sever financial links between them until divorce. Divorce settlements which take effect before the divorce order or separation order will not be the norm.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para23"></a>To accommodate the various circumstances where there may be a genuine need for an order to take effect earlier than the making of the divorce order or separation order such as those outlined by members of the advisory group, I have made the exception to the rule, which is that orders can take effect before that time where the court considers that it is just and reasonable that they should do so.
<P>


<a name="column_128"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para24"></a>Amendment No. 119 in the name of my noble friends Lady Young and Lord Coleraine states that financial provision orders can take effect in special circumstances. The special circumstances are listed for financial provision orders and, in Amendment No. 129, for property adjustment orders, and include where one or both parties urgently need to be rehoused. I hope that my noble friends Lady Young and Lord Coleraine will agree that the basic rule underlying those amendments and my own is the same. I have no longer referred to "special circumstances", which was the term previously used in relation to property adjustment orders, as my advisory group said that that term could be readily applied to most circumstances following divorce and it was therefore inappropriate to use the term "special". The term I have used is more likely to be effective in controlling the use of that power.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para25"></a>I have also received comments from certain members of the group on the specific circumstances referred to in my noble friends' amendments. I wondered whether they should be examples of circumstances when it would be just and reasonable for the order to take effect earlier than the divorce order or separation order. The views which I have received were against specifying those circumstances in the Bill. That is favourable towards trying to keep the orders' effect to the later stage. If one specifies circumstances then the court is likely to use those circumstances to make the order earlier, whereas if they are not specified the court's discretion is wider and, therefore, in the cases mentioned, the power will not necessarily be used to make the orders earlier. I suggest that the principle behind my noble friends' amendments would be better served by not specifying the particular circumstances. Fettering the court's discretion in that way is also out of line with the other discretionary powers in the 1973 Act. I accept the members' advice and urge your Lordships not to go down the road of specifying particular circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para26"></a>One of the circumstances specified in my noble friends' amendment is where both parties are agreed on the terms of the proposed order. I have given effect to that in Amendment No. 133L, which permits couples to obtain a consent order which takes effect before the divorce order or separation order where the exception to the general rule applies. I intend that rules should prescribe the type of information which the courts will require before making such an order. I do not wish generally to require court hearings when parties are agreed as that could lead to bitterness and hostility and incur costs. However, we need to ensure that the parties' agreement is properly recorded before the court proceeds on the basis that the order is agreed to.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para27"></a>I also asked my advisory group's views relating to my noble friend's amendments, Amendments Nos. 120 and 126, which prevent property adjustment orders and financial provision orders being made in the first six months of the period of reflection and consideration. Those members' views I received were that the new rule relating to the time when orders could be made and take effect was sufficient. It should ensure that couples do not rush into settlements. Where couples have agreed the financial settlement, they may well wish the court to <P>


<a name="column_129"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>approve the agreement as soon as possible to ensure that neither of them can renege from the agreement, which could lead to costly litigation. There are also other circumstances where one or more of the parties may want a court order within six months where, for example, one party is seriously ill or where a wasting asset needs to be sold. Other examples include the other circumstances outlined in Amendment No. 119. I therefore invite your Lordships not to agree that particular amendment of my noble friend.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para28"></a>I have also considered my noble friend's amendment, Amendment No. 118, which makes the new Section 22A(1) dealing with financial provision orders subject to the new Section 22B which contains restrictions on when these orders should be made. The amendment is unnecessary as the new Section 22A(11) already makes the new Section 22A(1) subject to these restrictions. I am sorry that this is a little dense, but I hope, nevertheless, that it is as sufficiently clear as the subject matter allows.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para29"></a>I now pass to interim lump sums, and Amendments Nos. 118C, 118D, 133A, 133B, and 138A. I have taken on board the amendment tabled in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Meston, and Amendment No. 118D tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and by Amendment No. 118 have given the court a statutory power to make interim lump sum payments until the application for a financial provision order can be heard. I believe that this was widely sought and I think that it is a considerable improvement. My Ancillary Relief Advisory Group's view was that the court's current inherent jurisdiction to grant interim lump sums was very limited and inadequate. There seems absolutely no reason to have great discussions about that if the circumstances of the case seem to require an interim lump sum. Amendments Nos. 133A, 133B and 138A are made as a result of conferring the power. They make necessary consequential amendments to the other provisions of the 1973 Act and among other things ensure that these lump sums can be paid by instalments. In addition, the criteria in the new Section 25(5) of the 1973 Act in Schedule 8 is extended so that it applies to interim lump sums and interim periodical payments.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para30"></a>I now refer to the deletion of new Section 22A(5) and (6) of the 1973 Act. Amendments Nos. 118E and 118F delete the new Section 22A(5) and (6) of the 1973 Act. The noble Lord, Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, drew my attention to the amendments when he tabled drafting amendments to them during the Committee stage. My Ancillary Relief Advisory Group considered that these provisions, which replace Section 23(3(a) and (b) of the 1973 Act, no longer added anything to the powers of the court to grant lump sum orders and that they should be deleted.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para31"></a>I now come to the question of interest on lump sums payable by instalments and deferred lump sums; Amendments Nos. 118G to 118L and 125A to 125F. Amendments Nos. 118G to 118L and 125A to 125F solve a technical problem with the wording of Section 23(6) of the 1973 Act, which is replaced by the new Section 22A(10) and (11) of Schedule 2. They ensure that the court can make an order for interest to be paid on lump sums payable by instalments or deferred lump <P>


<a name="column_130"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sums from the date of the order to the date when it is due to be paid at any time on or after the making of the order. Equivalent amendments are made for the provisions relating to nullity. It is currently not possible to make such an order for interest after the making of the order.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para32"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, tabled in Committee an amendment linking the rate of interest payable to the bank base rate. My Ancillary Relief Advisory Group considered this proposal but advised against it on the grounds that it was important that the court had complete discretion as to what rate of interest should be payable. The referral of the payment of a lump sum was of benefit to the payer and there were circumstances where the bank base rate may be wholly inappropriate as the court may consider a penal rate of interest is required or, alternatively, in other circumstances that a very low rate would be appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para33"></a>I turn now to the powers of the court on considering an application to vary a periodical payments order. Amendments Nos. 133H to 133K and 146A and 146B adopt, with technical adjustments, the amendments tabled in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Meston. They give the court power, when dealing with an application for variation or discharge of periodical payments order, to make a property adjustment or lump sum order where it considers this appropriate in order to enable it to bring about a "clean break" by discharging or limiting the term of the periodical payments order. The amendments implement, with some minor modifications, the recommendation of the Law Commission in its report The Ground for Divorce and deals with the problems created by a lack of such a power which were highlighted in S v. S (1986), 1 Family Law Reports at page 71. My Ancillary Relief Advisory Group was in favour of the power.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para34"></a>The group was not, however, in favour of the other amendment to Section 31 of the 1973 Act tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Meston, at the Committee stage. It extended the power of the court to vary, discharge, suspend or revive a property adjustment order settling property, varying a settlement or extinguishing or reducing an interest in a marriage settlement. Some members of the group were reluctant to see any extension of the power to vary property adjustment orders in the interests of certainty.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para35"></a>The collective view of the group was that the question of when property adjustment orders should be varied was very difficult. The complexities surrounding it meant that this was one matter which could only be considered in the context of a major review of the substantive law relating to financial provision on divorce. In the meantime, where a question arose as to the variation of a settlement, use would have to be made, where appropriate, of the power to order a sale of the property under Section 24A of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 and the limited powers of the court to set aside orders, for example in Barder v. Caluori (1988), Appeal Cases, page 20.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para36"></a>I turn to the question of conduct which was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Clifford of Chudleigh. His Amendment No. 129AB proposes that the court should <P>


<a name="column_131"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 131</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>take into account any conduct of the parties and the cause of the breakdown of the marriage. At present, one of the factors to which the court is to have regard when deciding whether, and if so how, to exercise its powers in relation to financial provision on divorce is the conduct of each of the parties if that conduct is such that in the opinion of the court it would be inequitable to disregard it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para37"></a>Amendment No. 129AB is similar to the amendment which was tabled at Committee stage and on which I have sought my Ancillary Relief Advisory Group's advice. The group considered that the current provision worked well--it was reviewed in 1984, which led to the current provision--and there was no call for change. I accept that advice. Ancillary relief proceedings are not the appropriate means of identifying in detail the cause of marital breakdown. I am satisfied that it is right that conduct should be taken into account to the extent that is necessary to reach a proper distribution of the property between the parties and that the present test on which that is done is the appropriate one.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para38"></a>Costs, delay and litigation would be increased by extending the role of conduct. That test has been adopted as a result of very mature consideration of the matter over the years by the courts. I am not inclined to increase the role of anything that would cause unnecessary conflict when I believe that, where a substantial issue is raised by conduct, the courts can take account of it properly under the present arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para39"></a>Two other main amendments were tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Clifford, during the Committee stage of the Bill which my advisory group advised me against accepting: first, the proposal that periodical payments and secured periodical payments should automatically end when a party in whose favour the order is made starts to cohabit with another party as if married. This rule currently applies only on remarriage. The group was against extending the rule in the way in which the noble Lord suggested for two reasons. First, a cohabitee has no legal duty to maintain another cohabitee, in contrast with the position regarding spouses. Secondly, there are evidential difficulties in determining whether the payee is cohabiting as if married.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para40"></a>Secondly, the group was not in favour of the noble Lord's amendments to the provisions relating to variation on reconciliation. In particular, it was against removing protection to third parties who would be prejudiced if the order which had been made was varied or discharged.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para41"></a>There are then drafting amendments and amendments inserted for clarification: Amendments Nos. 118A, 118B, 126A, 126B and 126C. They are intended to ensure that the scope of financial provision orders should not be circumscribed by the making of an order in earlier proceedings and that the making of a property adjustment order in earlier proceedings should not prevent a further order being made in later proceedings subject to the restriction in the new Section 23A(2) of the 1973 Act.
<P>


<a name="column_132"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para42"></a>Amendments Nos. 122A and 129A clarify that applications have to be made for financial provision and property adjustment orders on nullity and bring the provisions into line with those on divorce in this respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para43"></a>Amendments Nos. 133E, 133F and 148A relate to the variation of property adjustment orders on or after the making of a separation order. They amend Section 31(2)(e) of the 1973 Act so that the powers to vary property adjustment orders made before or after the making of a separation order varying or settling property apply only where there is an application for a divorce order.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para44"></a>The new Section 31A of the 1973 Act in paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 which provides for variation on reconciliation could then be used where the separation order is rescinded. This had been my intention but the previous amendment to the provision did not put this properly into effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para45"></a>During the Committee stage, the noble Lord, Lord Meston, said he did not appreciate why the amendments to the 1973 Act were inserted by way of substitution. The reason, I understand, is that Parliamentary Counsel at the Law Commission who drafted the original Bill took this approach because of the complexities of the amendments necessary to take account of the change to the time at which the various orders could be made in relation to separation and divorce but not nullity. The separation and divorce provisions had to be "pulled" out of the existing relevant sections of the Matrimonial Causes Act and amended but the nullity provisions left as they are. Counsel took the view that to amend each section and subsection as it stood by distinguishing between the timing of orders during the separation and divorce process and those following nullity would have made the amended sections incomprehensible. (And if Parliamentary Counsel says they are incomprehensible, I am prepared to say that they are!) That is why the provisions relating to separation and divorce were separated out and redrafted.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para46"></a>Parliamentary Counsel's advice is that it is unlikely that the position will have changed in the developments that have taken place since then, but he has agreed to look again at the matter over the next few weeks as the Bill proceeds on its course in the light of the latest amendments to Schedule 2.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para47"></a>The Bill does not amend the law of nullity. For this reason, Schedule 2 to the Bill makes only minor modifications to the law relating to financial provision on nullity. I am accordingly unable to accept Amendments Nos. 122B and 122C by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, to confer a statutory power on the court to make interim lump sum orders on nullity. Other amendments in the 1973 Act have also not been applied to nullity for the same reason. I will, however, take the need for a statutory power to make interim orders on nullity fully into account when I am reviewing the whole of the substantive law relating to financial provision on divorce and nullity in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para48"></a>I hope that in the light of this explanation my noble friends Lady Young and Lord Coleraine will be able to withdraw the amendments to which I referred, and that Amendments Nos. 118D, 122B and 122C will not need <P>


<a name="column_133"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be moved. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, will feel that his Amendment No. 129AB need not be pursued in the circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-32_para49"></a>I am sorry to take so long. On the other hand, I have been able as a result to give a reasonably comprehensive view of what all the later amendments in my name are about. I hope that noble Lords will feel that this is of some assistance.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199596/ldhansrd/vo960304/text/60304-33.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-33_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   My Lords, I am bound to say to my noble and learned friend that I found it quite difficult to follow all the detail that we were given. Clearly, I shall have to read it. The amendments moved by my noble friend Lord Coleraine are, we believe, extremely important. I am not absolutely clear. I regret that that is entirely my own fault; however, it is quite late and the argument was rather complicated.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-33_para0"></a>Perhaps I might extract two points on which I should like particular clarification. The first refers to our Amendments Nos. 120 and 126. I should like to know whether or not the court should have jurisdiction to make an order for financial provision or property adjustment other than interim maintenance at any time in the first six months.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-33_para1"></a>This is, after all, a very important issue. As I understand it, if the court has the power to do that, it as it were indicates that the divorce is to take place at a time when I thought one of the principal points of this Bill was that the time of the operation at the beginning of the year would be a time for reflection, consideration and all of that. It is hardly likely to take place if the court is settling all the differences over property, which gives a finality to the situation which did not exist before.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-33_para2"></a>It is probably entirely due to my failure to understand what my noble and learned friend said, but I should like to know whether his amendments put in a different way his very real point as to whether or not one can start the property settlements, as it were, virtually on day one. If that is the case, it negates a great deal of the whole idea of reconciliation, reflection, consideration and so forth.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-33_para3"></a>The second point which I do not quite understand--again, it is probably entirely my own fault--concerns the question of whether a financial order other than an interim order should come into effect before the divorce or separation order on the just and reasonable test, which is the one to which my noble and learned friend referred, or only on the proof of special circumstances, which has been quite narrowly defined and included in Amendments Nos. 119 and 129 spoken to by my noble friend Lord Coleraine.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-33_para4"></a>The point of my concern is that the just and reasonable test is not very tight. It implies that 12 months is not an absolute waiting period under the Bill but one which may be abrogated in certain circumstances. It is partnered with an earlier amendment. I should like to know how the courts would regard the just and reasonable test. For instance, would it be a fact that at the beginning they would confine it so that it has a limited effect? Over the passage of time would pressure from litigants and advocates be brought into effect to weaken the standard, so that it becomes a <P>


<a name="column_134"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>rule rather than the exception for orders to come into effect before the expiry of the 12 months? Then the 12-month period would become an empty formality with mounting proposals for abolition. That may be a very gloomy prospect for the future, but it seems to me central to all the provisions of the Bill that the 12-month period should stand as it is for a period of reflection and consideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-33_para5"></a>I do not want to waste the time of the House at this late hour, but these are very important issues and I am not at all clear, from what my noble and learned friend said, whether his amendments, which cover very much the same ground about which we are all talking, satisfy my anxieties and those expressed by my noble friend Lord Coleraine on these matters.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-33_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, with the leave of the House, perhaps I could answer those two specific matters. I think I referred to them but I missed many other matters and I can bring them out now.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-33_para6"></a>No order in this category will have effect before the divorce or separation takes place, unless it is just and reasonable in the opinion of the court that it should do so. The advice that I have been given by the Advisory Group on Ancillary Relief, constituted as I said, is that the phrase "special circumstances" will not be anything much in way of a protection. Almost any circumstances are special to the particular case and therefore that will not be much of a protection.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-33_para7"></a>Noble Lords will have noticed that my noble friend Lord Coleraine, in Amendment No. 119, also states that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'special circumstances' may include the fact (if it be the case)", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-33_para8"></a>and so on; and those are listed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-33_para9"></a>The advice that I received was that listing those would in fact promote the possibility that the court would have to give effect to an order before the divorce or separation order took effect if one of those circumstances applied, whereas the court might think that it was not in the interests of being just and reasonable that it should do so. The advice I have is that the amendment which I tabled would be more effective in achieving the purpose that my noble friend has in mind of keeping the general rule in favour of the orders taking effect only on divorce or separation rather than any alternative version which has so far been produced.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-33_para10"></a>Perhaps I may say that, looking at that example, it can be seen how it would happen. The amendment says that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'special circumstances' may include the fact (if it be the case) that ... both parties are agreed on the terms of the proposed order".

If that is a special circumstance, the court might find it very difficult to refuse to have the order made effective before the divorce or separation, if it had been agreed, whereas if the court can make it have this early effect only if it is just and reasonable to do so, even if the parties are agreed, it might not think that it was wise to do so in all the circumstances. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<A NAME = "60304-33_para11"></a>As regards the first six months, my proposal does not give effect to that. One of my most important points is that consideration of what will be the future terms on which the parties' property will be held can be a most important factor in deciding them to go back and try to make a go of the marriage. Therefore, while to have a <P>


<a name="column_135"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sort of frozen period at the beginning has some attraction, I do not believe that that is in the ultimate interest of reconciliation in some cases. The truth is that some parties, when they get to this stage, are so much at loggerheads that there is really no prospect of them talking about anything which has to do with their present situation, but they might have to talk about the future and, in doing that, they might well come to talk again about their present relationship.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-33_para12"></a>That is the effect of the amendments that I propose. The six months would not be sacrosanct. It would not be possible to have orders, apart from the interim orders, taking effect before the divorce or separation order was pronounced, except where it was just and reasonable to do so.

<A NAME="60304-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Meston: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may briefly thank the noble and learned Lord for the very full and speedy way in which both he and the advisory group have responded to these amendments, and particularly to the amendments which, motivated by the Family Law Bar Association, I moved at Committee stage. I believe that I scored two out of three, which is not bad. As regards the amendments of my noble friend Lady Hamwee, I am not sure why it is that nullity proceedings are somehow discriminated against in connection with interim lump sum orders. I do not seek to explore that point at this late hour.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-33_para13"></a>The only other matter I wish to comment on and welcome is the noble and learned Lord's indication about interest payments on lump sums. It seems appropriate to preserve the discretion of the court to set a rate. The disadvantage of linking interest to bank rate, for example, is that one might find oneself in the position whereby it was cheaper for the paying party to withhold payment of the lump sum than to borrow the necessary money at the usually friendly rate charged by banks, which is several percentage points above bank rate.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clifford of Chudleigh: </B>   My Lords, I wish to thank the noble and learned Lord for his summary and also for the letter he sent me today with advice from his advisory group. I shall certainly look at that with my legal advisers too before Third Reading. Before I sit down, I should like to accept the apology of the noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington. I believe that she was probably encouraged to make that slight error by the extraordinary reaction of another party in the House. I hope that that particular party will be noble enough to deliver the same form of apology.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-33_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Coleraine: </B>   My Lords, I can probably speak for the whole House in saying how grateful we are that my noble and learned friend did take the trouble to put these matters to his advisory group and explain its advice to us in dense but, I believe, very important prose. There is a lot that he said that needs to be carefully considered.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-33_para14"></a>As regards the amendments in the names of my noble friend Lady Young and myself, I feel sure that we shall want to consider carefully whether "reasonable and just" <P>


<a name="column_136"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is a better way of expressing the matter than "in all the circumstances" or whatever the existing phrase is. Certainly, what my noble and learned friend said seemed to be correct.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-33_para15"></a>On the question of proceedings in the first six months of the period, I am afraid that I cannot accept my noble and learned friend's idea that that is a frozen period. It is a period in which the parties can attempt reconciliation or mediation or attempt to reach agreement in some other way secure in the knowledge that if they do not reach agreement, if the mediation seems to be failing and if either party wishes to go to court, he or she may do so at the end of the period and get a court-ordered provision made. My noble friend Lady Young and I will want to reconsider this matter with a view to returning to it on Third Reading. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 118.

"Division of matrimonial property. 
<BR>
(1) The principles which the court shall apply in deciding what, if any, order to make under any of sections 22A to 24 above, are that--
<BR>
(a) the net value of matrimonial property should be shared fairly between the parties to the marriage;
<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_138"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column 138</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>(b) fair account should be taken of any economic advantage derived by either party from contributions by the other, and of any economic disadvantage suffered by either party in the interests of the other party or of the family;
<BR>
(c) any economic burden of caring, after the marriage breakdown, for a child of the marriage under the age of 16 years should be shared fairly between the parties;
<BR>
(d) a party who has been dependent to a substantial degree on the financial support of the other party should be awarded such financial provision as is reasonable to enable him to adjust over a period of time to the loss of that support after the marriage is dissolved or annulled;
<BR>
(e) a party who seems likely to suffer serious financial hardship as a result of the marriage breakdown should be awarded such financial provision as is reasonable to relieve him of hardship over a reasonable period.
<BR>
(2) In subsection (1)(b) above--
<BR>
"economic advantage" means advantage gained whether before or during the marriage and includes gains in capital, in income and in earning capacity, and 'economic disadvantage' shall be construed accordingly;
<BR>
"contributions" means contributions made whether before or during the marriage and includes indirect and non-financial contributions and in particular any such contribution made by looking after the family home or caring for the family.
<BR>
(3) In applying the principles set out in subsection (1)(a) above, the net value of the matrimonial property shall be taken to be shared fairly between the parties to the marriage when it is shared equally or in such other proportions as are justified by special circumstances.
<BR>
(4) The net value of the matrimonial property shall be the value of the property at the time the court deals with the matter in exercise of its powers under this Part save that any appreciation or depreciation in value since the parties' separation which is primarily attributable to the acts of the party may be disregarded.
<BR>
(5) Subject to subsection (6) below, in this Part 'matrimonial property' means all the property belonging to the parties or either of them which was acquired by them (otherwise than by way of gift or inheritance from a third party)--
<BR>
(a) during the marriage: or
<BR>
(b) before the marriage for use by them as a family home or as furniture and effects for such home.
<BR>
(6) The proportion of any rights or interests of either party under a life policy or pension scheme or similar arrangement referable to the period beginning with the marriage and ending with the date of the parties' final separation shall be taken to form part of the matrimonial property subject to any discounts which the court thinks fit to apply (for example, in the case of an unfunded pension scheme, for the chance of receiving less than the quoted benefits).
<BR>
(7) In subsection (3) above "special circumstances", without prejudice to the generality of the words, may include--
<BR>
(a) the terms of any agreement between the parties on the ownership or division of any of the matrimonial property or maintenance;
<BR>
(b) the source of funds or assets used to acquire any of the matrimonial property where those funds or assets were not derived from the income or efforts of the parties during the marriage;
<BR>
(c) any destruction, dissipation or alienation of property by either party;
<BR>
(d) the nature of the matrimonial property, the use made of it (including use for business purposes or as matrimonial home) and the extent to which it is reasonable to expect it to be realised or divided or used as security;
<BR>
(e) the actual or prospective liability for any expenses of valuation or transfer of property in connection with the proceedings.".").

<A NAME = "60304-36_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I cannot be as swift as the noble and learned Lord but I shall be as swift as I can. At present a husband and wife can take advantage of the exemption for capital gains tax purposes only during the fiscal year in which they separate. That is the result of the definition in the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 which in turn refers to Section 282 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act l988. That section provides:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A married woman shall be treated for income tax purposes"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para1"></a>as I said, that is transferred to capital gains tax purposes--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"as living with her husband unless they are separated under an order of a court...or by deed or separation or"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para2"></a>and this is the relevant provision--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"they are in fact separated in such circumstances that the separation is likely to be permanent". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para3"></a>Given the Bill's objectives, it has been drawn to my attention that there may be a problem in that the period for reflection and consideration will not work in conjunction with tax considerations in the way in which the Bill is aimed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para4"></a>If the parties are living separately but reflecting and considering, it would be sad if tax considerations forced them to make over-hasty arrangements for tax saving purposes or to make transfers of property at a time when they should be reflecting upon whether the marriage has broken down.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para5"></a>I understand that this is very much a matter of Inland Revenue practice rather than legislation. I move the amendment to provide that the period of separation shall not be regarded as likely to be permanent during the period of reflection and consideration as a probing amendment in the hope that the noble and learned Lord will be able to assist on the general point. I have realised that somewhere between my attempts to get my brain around the issue, providing a draft and it appearing on the Marshalled List it appears to have extended to income tax as well as capital gains tax. That was not what I intended. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-36_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, the amendment seeks to extend the married couples' allowance to couples who have separated during the period of reflection and consideration. The married couple's allowance is a tax allowance which goes to married couples who are living together. Broadly, in order to qualify for the allowance for a particular tax year a husband must be "living with his wife" (defined in Section 282 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act). Couples who are separated by court order, or who are separated,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in such circumstances that the separation is likely to be permanent"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para6"></a>a question of fact--do not qualify. Once a couple fail the "living together" test, the allowance continues until the end of that tax year but then ceases. If they are subsequently reconciled and live together again, they can make a fresh claim.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para7"></a>I can see that if the couple have not separated during the period of reflection and consideration they will in all probability be entitled to the allowance. But it would not be right to make it automatically so, because we might have a couple who had been living apart for three or four years and who then decided to start divorce proceedings. It would not be right then artificially to say that they should receive the MCA as if they were living together.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para8"></a>The effect of the amendment would be to ensure that married couples who are in a period of "reflection and consideration" would continue to be entitled to the allowance, even if they fail the "living together" test. So physically separated couples (where one partner had left the matrimonial home) would be able to claim the allowance during that time.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para9"></a>One can see that there could be complexities about this as a general rule. The Bill seems to me to be an inappropriate place in which to change the tax allowance. If it were merely a matter of revenue practice, one might make something of it. To treat couples who have actually separated as if they were living together is contrary to the policy of encouraging couples to focus upon the financial consequences of divorce before they take the step of becoming divorced.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para10"></a>I do not believe that this is an appropriate amendment. Perhaps in the light of that explanation, the noble Baroness will consider whether she wishes to persevere with it. I shall be willing to draw the matter to the attention of the revenue authorities for their further consideration because I am sure that they would wish to promote the policy of the Bill so far as they can. Obviously, I cannot guarantee success if that is what the noble Baroness, in consideration of the matter, would like me to do. Perhaps in the light of my explanation she will give me a note to say what she proposes in this connection in the future.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-36_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, that explanation is extremely helpful. I understand that the Revenue interprets the section differently with regard to different taxes. I shall provide the noble and learned Lord with a note and I am grateful to him.

<P>
<A NAME="60304-36_spmin4"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Ampthill): </B>  Before I put the Question that the Title be postponed, it may be helpful to remind your Lordships of the procedure for today's Committee. Except in one important respect, our proceedings will be exactly as in a normal Committee of the Whole House. We shall go through the Bill clause by clause; noble Lords will speak standing; all noble Lords are free to attend and participate; and the proceedings will be recorded in Hansard. But the House has agreed there shall be no Divisions in this Committee. Any issue on which agreement cannot be reached should be considered again at the Report stage when, if necessary, a Division may be called. Unless, therefore, an amendment is likely to be agreed to, it should be withdrawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para19"></a>I should also explain what will happen if there is a Division in the Chamber while we are sitting. This Committee will adjourn as soon as the Division bells are rung and will resume after 10 minutes.

<A NAME = "60304-36_para21"></a>Clause 1 [Constitution, functions and membership of Deer Commission for Scotland]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-36_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 15, at end insert ("welfare,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para22"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall start by declaring the two interests which I declared at Second Reading and in the Select Committee in Edinburgh in that I own a deer forest and that I sit on the Stalking Committee of the British Field Sports Society. Amendment No. 1 is grouped with Amendments Nos. 19 and 85, to which I shall also speak. Amendment No. 1 would require the new deer commission to further the welfare of deer, as well as their conservation, control and sustainable management, which are already mentioned in Clause 1 as being statutory functions of the new commission. So it would add the deer's welfare to the commission's responsibilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para23"></a>I shall not weary the Committee with a repetition of my Second Reading speech, but nearly all of the 50 or so amendments to which I and some other noble Lords have put our names have been tabled with the welfare of deer in mind. I mention this because there is the outside chance that there may be some people outside this House, and perhaps even one or two Members of the Committee, who might make the mistake of thinking that some of our amendments have been tabled more with the welfare of deer forest owners in mind than that of the deer, or indeed of the natural heritage.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH2"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH2</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para24"></a>To put this fear into perspective let me say at once, as I indicated at Second Reading, that there are certainly a number of deer forests which have not shot enough deer in the past, and some which are not doing so today. This Bill comes at a time when that situation has been improving rapidly in recent years, thanks largely to the setting up of our deer management groups guided by the Association of Deer Management Groups which now speaks for over 90 per cent. of the Highland land mass, and thanks also to the new collaboration which exists between the groups and the Red Deer Commission. That collaboration is underlined and supported by the new harmony which has broken out with Scottish Natural Heritage--it is a harmony which owes not a little to the amendments passed in this House in 1991 when SNH was set up.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para25"></a>I would just remind any Members of the Committee who might think that some of our amendments are slanted too much in favour of land owners that that was precisely the charge made against our amendments in 1991, and yet those amendments are now generally regarded as having proved beneficial to the natural heritage, the land owner, and the wider interests alike. I trust that they may serve as something of a track record for the work which lies ahead of us on this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para26"></a>I regret that our new Select Committee procedure in Scotland did not include making perhaps the briefest of reports about those matters on which the committee was in broad agreement. That would have been helpful to this stage, and to subsequent stages, of the Bill. Be that as it may, if there was one matter about which there was such broad agreement, I should have thought it would be that the new commission should have the duty of looking after the welfare of deer. As I recall it, all our witnesses agreed with that. Indeed, even my noble friend the Minister said that the Government:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"see the welfare of deer as being unavoidably central to their control, their conservation and their sustainable management." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para27"></a>
I am sure that we all agree with that, but it leads many of us to go on and say that the word "welfare" should therefore be on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para28"></a>In Amendment No. 85 I have attempted a definition of the word "welfare" in that context, and I should like to quote it for the record:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>""welfare" includes the concept that deer are living within the capacity of their normal range," </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para29"></a>
at the time of year in question,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"which should support them in a healthy condition and that management to achieve this requires the removal, by taking or killing, of old and unhealthy animals or for the purposes of reducing the herd to a number which does not exceed the capacity of their normal range, by means which do not cause unnecessary suffering." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para30"></a>
When the amendment suggests that deer should be living
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"within the capacity of their normal range", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para31"></a>
that implies that they should not be so numerous as to be damaging the natural heritage interest. The definition may not be ideal--I suspect it is not--and no doubt it can be changed, but I trust that your Lordships can see that it is put forward in good faith.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para32"></a>I have to confess that I was a little worried when my noble friend the Minister implied that it is not necessary to have the word "welfare" itself on the face of the Bill, <P>


<a name="column_CWH3"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH3</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>but that it is somehow presumed to be included in the words, "conservation" or "control" or "sustainable management". It is not. Each one of those expressions could disguise considerable unnecessary cruelty to our wild deer, and that is what this amendment is aimed at preventing.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para33"></a>Finally, there are a few dark--if rather silly--rumours being put about by those who do not wish to see the word "welfare" on the face of the Bill. On the one hand, those of us who represent the sporting interest in deer are being told that having "welfare" on the face of the Bill might come to mean that we could not shoot them. We are told that that may be especially true when contraceptive schemes have reached a stage of perfection, which is well over the distant horizon at the moment. On the other hand, it is being suggested that the welfare of deer is incompatible with the drastic reduction in numbers which is sought in certain quarters.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-36_para34"></a>Both those suggestions seem irrelevant to me, especially when set against what is to me an imperative with this Bill; that is, that whatever carrying capacity may eventually be decided for our deer range, our largest wild mammal should not be subjected to unnecessary suffering when its numbers are reduced. I therefore commend the amendment to the Committee. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-37_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I wish to support the amendment moved by my noble friend, but before I do so perhaps I can make two points. The first is to declare an interest. I am the tenant of a deer forest in Scotland on the Isle of Jura. The second point I should like to make is that I spent many hours reading the evidence of the Scottish Select Committee, which showed what a good job the committee did. However, one point about the committee rather alarmed me; that is, that it consisted only of Scottish Peers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para0"></a>It may be said that that is a thoroughly sensible thing to do, but it rather concerns me. It seems to me that we are rather different from another place. We are not like the Commons in that we do not represent any area or constituency. Our writ of summons does not say that we come from a certain county that we must necessarily represent. We represent the whole of this country and therefore, in spite of the fact that, as a so-called English Peer, I am a member of the Scottish Peers' Association, because I was not a Scottish Peer as such, I was excluded from being on that Select Committee. There were probably other very good reasons for excluding me, but I hope it was not because I am English.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para1"></a>The point I should like to make is that we must not fall into the trap of having only Scottish Peers on Scottish Bills, any more than we should have only Welsh Peers on Welsh Bills or indeed English Peers on English Bills. It would be a great pity if all Scottish Peers were excluded from sitting on English Select Committees. Having made that plea to those who are in charge of those matters, perhaps I can come back to the amendment before us.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para2"></a>I believe that the word "welfare" is very important. It sums up everything on which those of us who care about deer in Scotland want to concentrate; that is, the welfare <P>


<a name="column_CWH4"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH4</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of deer. When the SNH was set up by an Act a few years ago, it made it entirely clear that its remit was to look after the heritage--the flora, the fauna and such things. We should be clear that the deer commission is there to look after the welfare of deer. It follows that the welfare of deer includes their management and everything that falls under that heading. It is a good word on which to hang all that we care about whether it is shooting, conservation or marauding. Welfare must be paramount in our minds. That is why I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-37_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur: </B>   I very much support the amendment. The term "conservation" which appears in the Bill in subsection (1)(a) occurs also, of course, in the Natural Heritage (Scotland) Act 1991. However, it does not go far enough in trying to indicate how deer are to be protected as well as dealt with in ways that the Bill describes in the light of the changes introduced by that Act. It seems to me that a real weakness exists here. The welfare of deer, however the term is used, is extremely important. I had thought that the husbandry of deer would be appropriate, but that is difficult to imagine with what is not a domestic animal. I support very much the tenor of the amendment. It would give a great deal of confidence to all concerned if somehow the concept of welfare could be brought into the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-37_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   I start by declaring an interest. I am the owner of an estate in Scotland and I believe that there are 12 roe deer on it. I have not seen them but my forester tells me they are there. I support the inclusion of the word "welfare" on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para3"></a>I come back to the challenge over whether this is an issue for Scots Peers or anyone else. I was very heartened by the remarks of the noble Earl, Lord Lindsay, at col. 828 on Second Reading when he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am sure that noble Lords understand that the specific nature of deer issues affecting us in Scotland differ sometimes considerably from those elsewhere in the United Kingdom and that therefore a specific Scottish approach to deer is required". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para4"></a>
I liked that very much, and I am very pleased to read it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para5"></a>In Scotland, we are a fairly dour bunch on occasion, not saying too much when we do not need to do so. However, I believe that the addition of a meaningful word such as "welfare" would be very useful and would clarify the issue for all time. I hope that the Minister will agree not to leave it implicit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-37_spnew3"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   I should declare an interest. A family trust owns a deer forest, but I do not have a beneficial interest in the trust. The real point is that although it has been suggested that sustainable management includes welfare some of us are not entirely convinced.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-37_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   It is difficult to oppose the idea proposed by the amendment if one is concerned about the welfare of deer. But there is a problem. The noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, put me in a dilemma when he talked about the capacity of the environment. Who decides what the capacity of the environment is? The shooters may have quite a different <P>


<a name="column_CWH5"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH5</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>idea from those who are rearing deer for slaughter for venison. It is a very difficult issue. The other point concerned the question of whether husbandry is perhaps a better word, but, again, you enter into a difficulty. The whole question of deer capacity and why certain deer are encouraged for their big antlers or for good venison meat is a closed circle. This is a very difficult one.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para6"></a>On the other hand, I understand that the Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill either has had or is about to have Royal Assent and since we are concerned to some extent with the whole question of animal welfare--at least I hope we are--it would be very difficult not to accept the amendment, although we have a great deal more work to do in deciding what capacity a deer forest or a deer area can hold. I do believe it means different things to different people. However, by and large I will give my support to the inclusion of welfare.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-37_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Robson of Kiddington: </B>   I would very much like to support this amendment and while doing it, I would like to point out that the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, said that it should not only be Scottish Peers who take part in this Bill. He said he was not a Scottish Peer! I am neither Scottish, Welsh nor English because I was not born in this country, so I am a British Peer, and I would like to take part on that basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para7"></a>At Second Reading I spent some time on the importance of introducing the word "welfare" and although I am a British Life Peer I do have an estate in Scotland and I do have a deer forest. It is at the heart of every person who is involved in Scotland to have a feeling for the welfare of the deer on their land. I would therefore very much like to support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-37_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   Perhaps I may briefly advise the noble Baroness since she was kind enough to mention that she is a British Peer--indeed so are we all. The point I was making was that it was not this Committee, because this is a Committee of the Whole House, but the Scottish Select Committee which sat in Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-37_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Robson of Kiddington: </B>   I was not part of that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-37_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office   (The Earl of Lindsay): </B>  Very little separates us here. Everything that those who have spoken want, I also want. The difference between us, which I hope is a very small one, is how we go about achieving that and how we do so without risking other consequences. I would just say to my noble friend Lord Astor that the membership of the committee was agreed by the House on a Motion from the Committee of Selection. The best thing I can do is to pass on to that committee what my noble friend has said so that it can bear in mind the points made. In fact, I entirely agree with him. The whole strength of the House is in the fact that we have a very wide range of wisdom and expertise. My noble friend's expertise in Scottish deer is well known. I will make sure that the message gets through.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para8"></a>The original proposals from the Red Deer Commission contained the suggestion that its general functions should be widened to include "welfare" as well as "sustainable management". However, in drawing <P>


<a name="column_CWH6"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH6</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>up the Bill we had it clearly in mind that, though the Red Deer Commission takes an interest in aspects of deer welfare, we do not wish to impose a primary duty on the commission to further the welfare of deer, which are, after all, wild animals. That might in certain circumstances conflict with legitimate pursuits concerned with the control of deer numbers, such as the sporting interest in deer.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para9"></a>In fact, welfare is acknowledged in certain provisions in the 1959 Act; for instance, in the close season and anti-poaching provisions and restrictions on the methods of killing deer, including the commission's published code on night shooting. Welfare is also an integral part of sustainable management. The concept that deer should live in balance with their habitats needs to be pursued as much for the long-term welfare of the deer themselves as for environmental considerations. Under the Act as it stands, therefore, the commission takes account of the welfare of the deer in exercising its specific functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para10"></a> I return to the assertion that I made both at Second Reading and in Edinburgh that welfare is implicit both within the 1959 Act and the Bill, and that the welfare considerations in the Bill have been strengthened in comparison with the 1959 Act. For instance, we are taking action on night shooting, which strengthens the welfare provisions which attach to deer in that respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para11"></a>I also disagree with my noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch that sustainable management, and indeed conservation, must include an element of welfare. There is no way that cruel practices could fall within the definition of sustainable management or of conservation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para12"></a>The question of whether welfare should appear on the face of the Bill in a more general way was raised at various stages. As a result, I asked my officials to look at that question again to see if it is possible to incorporate the term in a general way in the Bill. However, I am advised, principally on legal grounds, not to include the term in that way, given that the Act already makes sufficient provision, wherever appropriate, for deer welfare.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para13"></a>The legislation is based on the proposition that deer, as wild animals, may live where and as they please, except where they are in conflict with other legitimate land uses. Where action has to be taken against deer, the legislation ensures that such action will be humane. The welfare content of the legislation is therefore already implicit and appropriate for the purpose for which the legislation was intended.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para14"></a>There are quite powerful legal arguments against the inclusion of the term: first, both Parliament and the courts would expect that changes to the wording of the Act signal a material change to the way things are done. It should not therefore be done for purely presentational reasons. Secondly, the inclusion of deer welfare as a general function of the commission under the revised Section 1(1) of the 1959 Act, as set out in Amendment No. 1, could be interpreted as imposing a primary duty of care on the commission to promote the welfare of deer. That may all too easily conflict with the legitimate <P>


<a name="column_CWH7"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH7</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pursuit of control of deer numbers for whatever reason and, as I said, it could also conflict with sporting practices.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para15"></a>Thirdly, if welfare were introduced into the commission's balancing duty (under the proposed Section 1(1A)), it could signal an intended shift in the balance between "human interests" and those of the deer. Finally, we have to be sure that the term "welfare" could not be interpreted so as to prevent the commission properly carrying out its statutory functions in relation to control of deer which are threatening the land use and other interests which the legislation aims to protect.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para16"></a>While I sympathise with the wishes of those who asked that deer welfare be included on the face of the Bill, and I will give the matter further consideration, I must at the moment caution against such an approach because of the warnings I received from parliamentary draftsmen and other legal experts. I believe that there may well be other methods of control that, within a period of eight to 10 years, could become realistic and practical. I have been looking recently into the different methods of control which should become possible for grey squirrels, for instance, and for grey seals. In both those areas of work, it is felt that contraceptive control may be only eight years away. It may not be unrealistic, therefore, to assume that alternative approaches to rifle shooting will be available for controlling deer within 10 years. If welfare is in any way interpreted as the avoidance of pain, there might be an insistence that rifle shooting is replaced by other methods of control.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para17"></a>I should like to add one brief comment on the definition of welfare suggested by the noble Lord in Clause 85, where he suggests that it would involve the taking or killing of old or unhealthy animals. I am well aware that on many stalking estates a high priority is also placed on taking animals which may be young and healthy but which may be called "switches" as I know them--they have single spiked antlers which can cause considerable damage during the rut. Any attempt to define welfare could lead to problems at a later stage. I am also aware that some environmental and animal conservation groups are not convinced that, if you are properly managing any number of animals, you should necessarily only take the old and the unhealthy. It may be necessary to take a wide spectrum across a certain colony of animals for very sound conservation reasons.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para18"></a>I am determined that welfare is essential to the Bill. I am determined that the way in which we handle Clause 1 and the duties imposed in terms of conservation, control and sustainable management and the way we handle other areas of the Bill such as night shooting have welfare at their heart. I am determined that we deliver what all noble Lords who have spoken to this amendment want. At the moment, while officials continue to look at the request that we try to put welfare as a general provision on to the face of the Bill, I counsel caution. There are too many dangers if we draft welfare incorrectly. It is a high risk strategy. Much is to be gained by ensuring that the detail of the Bill implies or denotes welfare, but we can lose a great deal if we get the general definition wrong.

<P>

<A NAME = "60304-37_para19"></a>One of the primary definitions of welfare which may come to the fore in later years could be the right to life. That could have unfortunate consequences on traditional methods of deer control. The central point, however, is that I want the Bill to achieve everything that those who support the amendment want the Bill to achieve, but my concern is how we achieve it on the face of the Bill. I do not want the Bill to become bad legislation through bad drafting.

<P>
<A NAME="60304-38_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken, every one of whom has supported the amendment with the unfortunate exception of my noble friend the Minister. The noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, asked about the definition of the carrying capacity of a deer range as regards the national heritage or whatever other management objective there might be. He asked who decides--and that is a very good question. The intention of the Bill is that it should be predominantly the new deer commission which would decide that, no doubt taking advice from Scottish Natural Heritage and in collaboration with the deer forest or the deer management group concerned. It is absolutely clear that the new commission will be the lead body. It may be that in a certain part of Scotland there will be a requirement to regenerate a lot of trees and everyone will agree with that and it will happen, and in another part of Scotland it may be different. I agree that I cannot answer the question and I agree that the amendment is not perfectly worded. That goes some way towards answering the noble Lord's question.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-38_para0"></a>When we come to the comments of my noble friend the Minister--and I am grateful for the ray of pallid light that he threw out that he might be able to look at this matter again--I cannot accept that "welfare" is necessarily part of sustainable management or "conservation". I would have to point out that the definition of those two expressions is not to be found in Clause 9 of the Bill. Perhaps it would be helpful if we could make sure that the expression "conservation" were to be found in Clause 9 and that it included the concept of welfare. I feel that the word "conservation" is likely to lend itself to welfare more than "sustainable management", which may mean an awful lot of different things to different people. Whatever else one can say about the red deer in the Highlands of Scotland at the moment, they are certainly sustainable--perhaps too sustainable.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-38_para1"></a>My noble friend says that welfare aspects have been strengthened in the Bill. We will come to some of those later. I am grateful to notice that the Government have tabled an amendment insisting that there will at least be a close season for female deer. My noble friend says that the commission will take account of this matter. If that is so, why should it not be on the face of the Bill? My noble friend also says that the legislation ensures--or will ensure; I am not quite sure what he said--that heavy culling, were it to be necessary, would be humane.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-38_para2"></a>I have to point out to my noble friend, as we discussed in Edinburgh, that even the guidelines of the Red Deer Commission allow for animals to be shot at considerable distance, sometimes moving, and there is <P>


<a name="column_CWH9"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH9</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>quite a paragraph in there about polishing off orphaned calves. This is not a scenario that encourages one to think that we are necessarily looking at the humane killing of wild animals, so I have to put a straight question to my noble friend. Even including the sporting interest in deer, can he envisage deer management including the use of helicopters to drive wild deer into corrals, of whatever size, for effective slaughter? If he can then I personally object to it, and I would not find that a practice which goes with the welfare of deer.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-38_para3"></a>As to contraception--this eventually leading to shooting being banned--that seems to me such a long way off that if it does happen I have no doubt that shooting may be banned anyway. We need not look so far into the future with this Bill that we have to go down paths of that kind.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-38_para4"></a>My noble friend then went on to mention herd management, saying that the amendment talks of the removing of old and unhealthy animals. I am happy to say that it also says,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for the purposes of reducing the herd to a number which does not exceed the capacity of their normal range". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-38_para5"></a>
I would agree with my noble friend when he mentions a "switch", a switch being a stag which has no points on its horns. If you have a number of switches it is a sure sign that there are too many deer for the carrying capacity in question.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-38_para6"></a>For the purposes of reducing the deer herd, which we all accept, I cannot see why this word should not be on the face of the Bill. The contraceptive argument is a red herring and I suspect that if welfare does come to mean the right to life and shooting is banned, it will do very much more harm to the deer than the good which it may be intended to do.

<A NAME="60304-38_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur: </B>   Before my noble friend, if he is going to do so, withdraws the amendment, I wonder if I may press my noble friend Lord Lindsay a little further. He seemed to indicate that, while he accepted the concept, there were serious difficulties about the legal position. He also said that the Deer Commission for Scotland will take account of it anyway, and that it could conflict with the control of deer numbers. He also indicated that he would try to find a form of words which would somehow match the concerns which have been expressed. Can he elaborate a little more and give some indication--because presumably it has been thought about--of what terms it might be possible to develop?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-38_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   Before my noble friend replies, will he also address the question I put to him? Does he envisage that the Bill as drafted would allow the use of helicopters to drive wild deer into corrals for effective slaughter? I know we come to it in later amendments regarding vehicles but we ought to start talking about this issue under the heading of welfare.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-38_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   Regarding the point raised by my noble friend Lord Glenarthur, I can say that I have instructed officials to find a form of words which reflects the wishes of many Members at Second <P>


<a name="column_CWH10"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH10</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Reading, the evidence taken at the Select Committee and what is said in the Committee today. When we were preparing for today, there was no form of words which parliamentary draftsmen felt were safe to put forward. But the instruction to his officials from the Minister, who wants to achieve what everyone here wants to achieve, is that we should try to find that form of words. However, I must warn Members of the Committee that the form of words may carry some degree of risk. I hope that brings some reassurance to my noble friend Lord Glenarthur.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-38_para7"></a>My noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch asked about helicopters. Helicopters could be used only with the specific authorisation of the deer commission and in compliance with the code of practice which will be drawn up by the deer commission. Welfare will be a central plank of that code of practice. So welfare could not be excluded or ignored in the use of helicopters.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-38_para8"></a>I would just add for the enlightenment of the Committee that the Deer (Scotland) Act 1959 already provides a higher degree of protection for the welfare of deer than the new Wild Mammals (Protection) Act, which has just come into law. I am drawing a comparison here between the 1959 Act and the latest 1996 Act. When the new Bill hopefully passes into legislation, with its increased welfare elements, it will draw yet further ahead of the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act in terms of the welfare it affords wild deer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend for that explanation, which will bear some examination over the next week or so. I am not sure I was listening as closely as I should have been to what the Lord Chairman said at the start of the proceedings. I believe it is in order for me to withdraw the amendment unless I am confident that there is unanimity in its favour. I do not think I can rely on that unanimity at the moment from my noble friend the Minister. In those circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<A NAME = "60304-38_para14"></a>Amendment No.3 suggests reversing the batting order of the three interests. I notice that under the Bill as drafted, the new boy of the Bill--if I may put it that way--namely:

I feel that the needs of agriculture and forestry should come first, as they have done for many years now; then the interests of owners and occupiers of land, who have to make this thing work, if it is to work without all the ghastly threats that hide in the background of this Bill, and I should have thought that the new interest could come at the end. But they are both probing amendments to elicit some comment from my noble friend.

<P>
<A NAME="60304-39_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   These proposed amendments have no significant effect on the working of the legislation and the second amendment is purely presentational. The ordering of the items has no significance in legal terms in respect of their importance.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-39_para0"></a>Substituting "have regard to" in Amendment No. 2 for the current form of words is a slightly stronger version, but it does not bind the commission to do more than consider the fact as mentioned. The terminology in the Bill more accurately reflects the fact that not all factors will be relevant in every case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-39_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   Before my noble friend replies, perhaps I could ask my noble friend the Minister a question.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-39_para1"></a>I believe that in framing legislation we are trying in this Committee, which is a revising chamber, to make legislation as simple as possible, and to use as few words as possible in a Bill, so that there is less to argue about.

<A NAME = "60304-39_para2"></a>One of the difficulties with the Bill as it stands is that we have this rather bizarre wording:

<A NAME = "60304-39_para3"></a>
I put it to my noble friend that this is really what one might call departmental drafting gone haywire. It is using a complicated set of words when a simple one would do. I beg my noble friend, if he could, to look at it again and see if a simple form of words would have a much better effect so that we can all understand it.

<A NAME="60304-39_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Forbes: </B>   May I make a general observation which applies to many of the amendments to Clause 1. I believe it is essential that the commission should have flexibility to carry out its task.

rather than "have regard to", because it may be impossible to have regard to the needs of forestry, to take one of the items, where there are no trees anywhere within the area being focused on.

<A NAME = "60304-39_para9"></a>The noble Lady said: At Second Reading and in the hearings before the Scottish Select Committee, a number of persons commented that there should be a minimum number of members of the commission so that it is able to represent effectively the range of interests in deer. Indeed, in answer to a question, the chairman of the Red Deer Commission indicated that at present he did not think that less than 12 members would be appropriate. This amendment is designed to ensure that future commissions have sufficient members to represent the key interests in deer and their management as stipulated in the proposed new subsection (3A) of the 1959 Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-39_para10"></a>While it is desirable that future Secretaries of State should have flexibility to appoint a commission of fewer than 12 members if the situation warrants it, it does not seem sensible to allow the appointment of a small commission which could have the effect of unduly restricting representation of key interests. Setting a minimum size of nine for the commission will allow both flexibility of numbers and at the same time the key affected parties can be confident that their interests will be properly served on the commission.

<FONT SIZE=3>commission for another year. In such circumstances it would not have to fill his place--it could keep it open. The figure of nine, if chosen, will enable the Secretary of State if he so chooses, to select three from the deer management category as proposed in the parallel government amendment, and sufficient representation from the other categories. In practice, he may well decide that a larger number is needed, but we need a guarantee that, at the very least, nine members will be appointed. I beg to move.

It seems that the Bill, as drafted, does not require a quorum, which might mean that the chairman of the commission could sit alone and dispose of the very considerable powers that it is proposed that we grant the commission. Something along the lines of Amendment No.5 might be useful to ensure that there would not be fewer than nine members of the commission of whom six shall form a quorum, or of whom not fewer than five might form a quorum, which is what the situation may be at present. I shall be most interested to hear the Minister's views on this.

<A NAME = "60304-39_para12"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 5, the quorum, the 1959 Act already provides that the commission should have a quorum of five or such larger number as the commission may from time to time determine and I now see no reason to change that.

The response to my noble friend, Lord Pearson, is that we will consider the way he has drafted this suggestion and address the issue at Report stage.

The difference between the two amendments is that our Amendment No. 6 suggests that,

<P>

<A NAME = "60304-39_para18"></a>
and so forth.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-39_para19"></a>My noble friend's amendment goes some way to meeting our concern that those with a sporting and economic interest in the management of deer must be adequately represented in any future commission. After all, it is those people in the main who will have to make the Act work. The Bill is really about the management of deer, and it seems to me that the membership of the commission is inadequate as it stands. Even with my noble friend's suggested amendment, I fear that the clause as presently framed remains ambiguous. It is possible that as few as one of the members of the commission could represent the sporting interests in relation to deer, and if that were so I consider that it might not be enough.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-39_para20"></a>This may be an unlikely scenario, but to illustrate that from current circumstances as we read the Bill, it is not inconceivable that the four persons representing deer management--under my noble friend's amendment that would be one third of the commission--could include one representing the sporting interest, with the remaining three being drawn from bodies with an interest in the management of red deer which is secondary to other objectives; for instance, natural heritage or forestry objectives. The National Trust for Scotland, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds or Forest Enterprise may meet that description at present, all three having an interest in a relatively low deer population consistent with other prime objectives, but not sufficient for a viable sporting enterprise. That type of representation of deer management could be in addition to pure natural heritage and forestry representations under categories (iv) and (iii) as represented on the face of the Bill respectively.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-39_para21"></a>It is therefore to clarify that important matter that we suggest the wording tabled by myself and other noble Lords, and I shall be grateful to hear how my noble friend the Minister's mind is moving on that point. I beg to move.

<A NAME="60304-40_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Forbes: </B>   I agree that Amendment No. 11, as a composition of the commission, is an improvement. I must point out that in dealing with deer and their effect on our natural heritage, the most important consideration is to obtain the correct balance. To achieve that the Secretary of State must have sufficient discretion and flexibility to find the best people--people of considerable ability and wisdom--to become members of the commission. The commission need not be composed of experts, can always call on scientific or technical advice from specialist bodies as and when it wants to. In furthering the conservation and control of deer, which was the aim of the 1959 Act, the <P>


<a name="column_CWH15"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH15</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>commission is bound to have, from time to time, difficulty in maintaining the right balance when carrying out its duties as laid down in Clause 1(1A)(a) bottom of page 1. Great wisdom and sound judgment by members of the commission will be vital if the objectives of the Bill are to be achieved. I hope my noble friend the Minister can give an assurance that consideration will always be given to the need to appoint people of the highest qualities and greatest wisdom to the commission as the overriding consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-40_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch for raising this important issue, and I must express my gratitude to my noble friend Lord Forbes, who, in both his interventions to date, has stressed the importance of having the best accumulation of wisdom and the best width of experience on the deer commission however it should be composed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-40_para0"></a>I start by speaking to Amendment No. 11, which sets out what the Government have in mind. This amendment is designed to ensure that the composition of future commissions contains a significant proportion of members with knowledge or experience of deer management. Clause 1 of the Bill, as originally drafted, required the Secretary of State to appoint such numbers of members as he considers appropriate to represent the interests of persons or organisations concerned with each of the following key interests in deer; namely, deer management; agriculture (including crofting); forestry and woodland management and the natural heritage. It is essential that all of these interests have appropriate levels of representation on the commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-40_para1"></a>I have listened carefully to suggestions that a significant level of representation of knowledge or experience of deer management is necessary on the commission to enable it to do its job properly, since the exercise of its functions, I admit, will continue to rely to a significant degree on the relationship of trust and respect it will maintain with those who manage deer on their land. At the same time, it is essential that the commission is a balanced body whose composition and mode of operation reflects all of the key interests in deer.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-40_para2"></a>The various issues raised by deer in land management generally in Scotland and the conflicts that can arise because of them require the commission to have a range of knowledge and expertise in issues outwith the field of deer management alone. I consequently propose that a specific minimum proportion of persons with knowledge or experience of deer management be set, at the level of one third, which I regard as the appropriate level to ensure significant representation of deer managers, while maintaining an effective balance with other interests. We have just passed the amendment dealing with the minimum number of commissioners being nine, therefore if the Commission was as small as nine, that would mean there would be three drawn from those with direct experience and knowledge of deer management. If the commission just went up one to 10, then of course at least one third becomes four, so that is how the mathematics would work out.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-40_para3"></a>The amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch, Amendment No. 6, would have the effect of stipulating that a majority of commissioners should have knowledge or experience of deer management. It is quite true that members of the commission need to have between them knowledge and experience of all issues relating to deer. It is true also that a significant proportion of the members need to have knowledge or experience of deer management per se, since much of its work will relate to deer management at ground level and to deer management groups.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-40_para4"></a>It is, however, essential that the commission has balanced representation of all the relevant interests which are likely to arise in the pursuit of deer management, since the effectiveness of its operation as a commission will depend upon the relationship which it develops with all bodies with an interest in deer and in deer ranges. It is for that reason that Clause 1 stipulates the key areas of expertise that the commission will need among its ranks to do its job properly. I sympathise with the suspicions of my noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch and therefore the line which he has taken with this amendment. But I stress that the one-third minimum proportion of deer managers, or those with experience in that field, is a significant proportion. It is especially significant given the extraordinarily wide range of interests which deer management now provokes, from farming, forestry and crofting to all the different parts of the natural environment. If the balance of interests on the deer commission is reduced or in any way skewed so that it is less of a level balance across the different interests, the commission would be in danger of losing some of its credibility and legitimacy in the wider community in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-40_para5"></a>It is terribly important that the commission commands status and respect among all those who are likely to have an interest in the way in which deer are managed, and is not simply seen as the supporter of one specific interest group. The fear is that if the deer commission was to lose credibility and respect, the ability with which it could promote voluntary action involving different parties would be more difficult, and therefore the likelihood of the Clause 5 compulsory control schemes being invoked would become more likely. It is thus very important that the deer commission commands that wide respect across the community.

<P>
<A NAME="60304-40_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Before my noble friend replies, perhaps I may say that, having spent a lot of my life on quangos and commissions of this sort, if such a body is carefully balanced and that balanced commission can come to a conclusion and then discuss it and sell it throughout Scotland, it is far more likely to command respect. If it is carefully balanced the discussion is much more constructive.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-40_para6"></a>Let us suppose that the commission consists of the minimum number of nine, which is implied by the acceptance of the amendment of the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, five of whom are landowners and four simply representing the other interests. If that number were all <P>


<a name="column_CWH17"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH17</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>present or if somebody was missing from the four, it would not make for an easy or balanced discussion. Good sense comes out of a body which is balanced in the sort of way which my noble friend is suggesting. One should not be fearful, if one were a deer manager or a landowner with interest in deer, that the interest would go by default because the number of land owners or deer managers was slightly smaller. It is quite an important point and the kind of number which is being suggested is a good one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-40_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur: </B>   I very much understand the points that my noble friend Lord Lindsay is making about flexibility and the credibility of the commission. It is important that it is not too constrained and that, at the same time, those areas which should be covered are covered adequately by the interest groups which are represented. To that extent, although I understand the point made by my noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch, I also share the views expressed by my noble friend Lady Carnegy. My noble friend Lord Lindsay has put down Amendment No. 11 which I find appealing. It goes a long way towards the case which my noble friend Lord Pearson has made but without over-egging it and removing some of that flexibility which might otherwise accrue or be available to the commission. I support that amendment, but not the other one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-40_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   I thank my noble friend the Minister and my noble friend Lady Carnegy for their interventions. I say to my noble friend Lady Carnegy that Amendment No. 6, which I am proposing, does not indicate a majority of land owners but it indicates a majority of people who appear to the Secretary of State to have knowledge and experience of deer management.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-40_para7"></a>I absolutely accept the point made by my noble friend the Minister that the commission must command the widest possible respect. But I submit that there is no more important category of people whose respect it must command than those who actually manage the deer. I would say to my noble friend the Minister that under the 1959 Act as it stands the commission, which has roughly the same number of people on it, has to have two nominees of such organisations as appear to the Secretary of State to represent the sporting interests in deer. I would therefore ask my noble friend the Minister when he comes to reply whether my analysis of the amendment that he has tabled--Amendment No. 11--is correct, that it would allow there to be only one representative of the sporting interests in deer in future, and whether he feels it will be sufficient to command the respect of the people who will have to carry out this Act.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-40_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I am grateful for the useful contributions that have been made by noble friends Lady Carnegy, Lord Glenarthur and Lord Pearson. I can reassure my noble friend that we have seen a very sensible way to meet the body of this concern, but perhaps not going quite to the degree he would like us to have gone to. We think that a solid and balancing proportion of those representing experience and knowledge of deer management should be there. I am advised by those who know deer management much <P>


<a name="column_CWH18"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH18</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>better than I that there are more issues which involved deer management now than just sporting interests. The marketing of venison is an increasing interest and priority for deer management groups because that is part of the viability of the sporting tradition--the ability to sell the product and cover some of the costs in that way. We would expect the minimum of one-third on the new commission who represent primarily deer management and knowledge and experience of that skill to have sufficient knowledge of the sporting side of deer to articulate that issue well, but at the same time we would expect the other side of deer management also to be available to that minimum one-third.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-40_para8"></a>Let me also point out to my noble friend that wherever you sit on that commission, whatever label it is that has justified your appointment in terms of the knowledge and experience that you bring to that commission, there is still the balancing duty imposed upon you in the commission's deliberations. Not only must the commission demonstrate that it has reached a reasonable decision on an issue, but it must also take into account the balancing duty which, for instance, would include the interests of owners and occupiers of land. Therefore, inherent in one of the balancing duties there is a very strong sporting interest as an undercurrent.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-40_para9"></a>I hope that Amendment No. 11 provides the reassurance without upsetting the balance of the commission. Many of us agree that the balance is vital for the credibility and that the credibility is vital for the voluntary principle and if we start rocking the balance we will lose a lot of the very good work that has been achieved to date. In the 1959 Act, of the 12 members, two were able to represent the sporting interest; eight represented agriculture and forestry of one sort or another and two represented environmental matters. Despite what nowadays seems a very unbalanced commission, it has achieved an extraordinarily good track record of balanced decision-making. I hope that the new proposal that we have lodged today as an amendment certainly produces a more visible balance than the 1959 Act seems to enable. Therefore, given how successfully the 1959 constitution has operated, I hope that the Committee accept Amendment No. 11 and that we will have very fine prospects from the new constitution.

<P>
<A NAME="60304-41_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down, would he not accept, and I am sure he would, that one of the reasons why the Red Deer Commission has operated so well in the past is that it has been a broad church and it has represented the interests of all those involved? All of us who have had dealings with the Red Deer Commission know what a good job it has done. One of the reasons it has done such a good job is that there has been, and I quote from the Act:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"two from nominees... to represent the sporting interest in deer;" </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-41_para0"></a>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"three from nominees... to represent the interests of farmers and crofters.." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-41_para1"></a>
and,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "60304-41_para2"></a></UL><FONT SIZE=3>
Therefore the Act very clearly said where these representations could come from.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-41_para3"></a>I think the 1959 Act got it right and it has worked very well. The problem I have with the Minister's amendment is that it says that one-third of the persons shall have
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"knowledge and experience of deer management," </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-41_para4"></a>
but what is knowledge and experience? We can all have either a very limited knowledge and a lot of experience, or limited experience and a lot of knowledge. That is open to interpretation and is a very difficult way to take this forward. We will have huge arguments on who represents who. Are you representing one organisation or another? The great advantage of the 1959 Act is that it brought into the Red Deer Commission all those people who represented the organisations that mattered so that when they considered problems with deer, whether it be from the crofters' or farmers' point of view, or the forestry point of view, everybody was able to represent their own interest as well as taking a general view about everything.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-41_para5"></a>I put it to my noble friend that his amendment weakens this very strong aspect of the working of the Red Deer Commission. I plead with him to look at the matter again between now and the next stage of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-41_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Buchan: </B>   I support the Minister on Amendment No. 11. It seems to me that the discussion is becoming almost metaphysical in its detail. I believe that the success of the Red Deer Commission over the years owes a great deal to the gentleman with the long, complicated name, Gordon-Duff-Pennington. The exact number of people who represent this, that or the other probably does not matter a great deal. I support the Minister's amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-41_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I should like to add to the welcome contribution of the noble Earl, Lord Buchan, by saying that the new constitution of the deer commission picks up the strengths of the 1959 system but sheds some of the weaknesses and constraints to which that system led. For instance, in identifying agriculture (including crofting) we fully intend that appointments should be made from people who have knowledge or experience of hill farming. It is clearly central to achieving a successful deer commission. We therefore have the four categories identified from which appointments will be made. We hope to specify that at least one-third will come from those who have primary knowledge or experience of deer management. We are certain that the strengths, so abundant to date under the fine chairmanship of Patrick Gordon-Duff-Pennington, will continue. But the constraints which have arisen will be removed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-41_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   I am grateful to all who have spoken. My noble friend the Minister has not confirmed my analysis, which I put to him as a question, that under Amendment No. 11 it would be possible to have only one representative of the sporting interest in deer whereas before there were at least two. Of course, I agree with all noble Lords that the balance of the <P>


<a name="column_CWH20"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH20</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>commission and the respect with which it is viewed will be absolutely crucial to its future activity. But I should have to point out that we are coming to Amendment No. 76 which is the Government's definition of the words "deer management" and I believe that in that amendment, which we come to next but one, the definition of "deer management" includes the management of deer for sporting purposes.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-41_para6"></a>Therefore, as far as I can see, the new commission could only have one representative of that category and I am afraid that I do not think that is enough. I agree with everything that has been said about the balance needing to be right and the respect in which the new commission needs to be held. I do not believe we have it right if we only have one of those.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-41_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down, I make one more point to the Committee and that is that the vast majority of deer managers in Scotland are involved in the sporting side of deer management. We have amended the definition of "deer management" in the Bill so that it quite specifically includes the sporting element of deer management. Therefore, we are fully confident that the three or four members of the deer commission that must represent knowledge and experience of deer management will substantially articulate the needs of the sporting aspects of deer management. At the same time, if, for instance, deer marketing becomes increasingly important--and we have good reason to believe that it will be--we also would hope that the deer management category on the commission will be fully conversant on that side of deer management as well. We therefore do not necessarily want to exclude or include specific aspects of the deer management experience.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-41_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   Under Amendment No. 6, we would not have to. We would only have to have more than half the commission:

<P>

<A NAME = "60304-41_para7"></a>
That indeed could, I have no doubt, include the marketing of venison and so on. I do not think I should take up the time of the Committee any further at this stage. I shall read with interest what my noble friend has said. I thought there was a moment where he appeared to be giving a little more encouragement than it is possible to read into the amendment as drafted. I will come back to the matter at Report stage.

<A NAME = "60304-41_para10"></a>These amendments are designed to ensure that the Secretary of State does consult relevant persons or organisations, and considers suggestions made to him before appointments are made to the commission. While it may make sense to move away from the current strict stipulations in Section 1 of the 1959 Act, it does nevertheless seem unfortunate that the current wording could allow appointments to be made without relevant interests having the opportunity to make suggestions to the Secretary of State. Making consultation obligatory rather than discretionary will help to ensure that the best candidates are drawn to the Secretary of State's attention before he makes his decisions. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="60304-42_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur: </B>   I very much support the thinking behind this amendment. Section 1(4)(c) of the 1959 Act very starkly laid out that among those appointed to the commission should be:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"two from nominees of such organisations as appear to the Secretary of State to represent the sporting interest in deer". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-42_para0"></a><P>

<A NAME = "60304-42_para1"></a>The main differences here appear not only to be that the words "the sporting interest in deer" are omitted from the Bill that we are now considering, but also that the Bill does not refer in any way to the organisations which might have produced those people who would have been able to represent "the sporting interest in deer". With the substantial history within Scotland and the islands of the relevance and the importance of "the sporting interest" to the whole concept of deer conservation, this is a very substantial change indeed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-42_para2"></a>In speaking to the earlier amendment my noble friend Lord Lindsay said that he could not conceive of those being involved with deer management being other than those who had a substantial interest in or knowledge of a sporting interest in deer--or words to that effect. That was the burden of his remarks. In that case I am not quite clear how the situation cannot be turned about. In subsection (1), as has been suggested here, we should leave out "deer management" and insert "the sporting interest in deer". Those concerned will then presumably be just as much expert on deer management that way round as they would be under the way that my noble friend suggested.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-42_para3"></a>I do not think this is just semantics. It is an important point. To have such a major change made from what was contained in the 1959 Act--it was certainly not looked at in the 1982 Act with which I was so closely involved--does require greater explanation, although I appreciate that my noble friend Lord Lindsay is yet to cover his Amendment No. 11 in detail, and the qualifying explanatory clause which follows under Clause 9.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-42_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I support what my noble friend Lord Glenarthur said and would like to ask my noble friend the Minister a question. On an earlier amendment he seemed to imply that the interest of deer management included something which was beyond just sporting interest--for example, the marketing of venison. I put it to my noble friend that they are the same; they cannot be exclusive. One manages a herd of deer in order to maximise the revenue and, currently, with venison prices as they are, half the value of a stag is its sporting value for someone to come and shoot it, and half its value is its venison.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-42_para4"></a>Those interests have to be the same. We must not think that somehow there is a different agenda if we use the word "sport" than there is when running a herd commercially. After all, that is what we are doing in the Western Isles, for example on the Isle of Jura, where there are 5,000 deer outnumbering the population by 25 to one. Deer management provides the main employment for the island, even more than the local <P>


<a name="column_CWH23"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH23</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>distillery which employs many people. All the estates are run for commercial reasons, along commercial lines, maximising all the incomes. I hope that it will not be thought that there can be a separation in any way of those two important points.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-42_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   I understand that Amendment No. 10 has been linked with this amendment. Is that correct?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-42_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   Amendment No. 10 has been grouped with Amendments Nos 9 and 11, but I am not sure that it should be. I would have thought it should be taken separately.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-42_spnew4"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   Should not Amendment No. 76 be grouped with Amendment No. 9?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-42_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   This may be a good moment to speak to Amendment No. 76. The introduction of the category "deer management" reflects the importance that this concept has gained in recent years since the first deer management groups were formed in the early 1970s and should help to ensure that future commissions contain persons with an active knowledge or experience of the way deer management practices are developing in Scotland as a whole. There can be no doubt that, for many purposes, in almost all respects--and I will come to the comments of my noble friend shortly--deer management and the sporting interests in deer are inextricable. That is why the definition in Clause 9, which we are amending through Amendment No. 76, makes that point beyond all doubt.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-42_para5"></a>I completely agree with my noble friend Lord Astor that we cannot partition out the different parts of the whole cycle, from vermin control in the spring through to the taking and the marketing of the beast, and how one funds such an operation and markets the product. It is all one continuous cycle. My noble friend Lord Glenarthur suggested that, because of the inextricable link, whether one called it sporting interest or deer management, each would encompass the other. My modest and humble suggestion is that deer management has a generic feel to it, and it quite specifically includes all parts of the cycle involving deer management; whereas the sporting interest in deer is conceivably a little more ambiguous and could be taken by some to exclude some parts of the cycle.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-42_para6"></a> So I hope that the Committee can agree to Amendment No. 76, when we come to it, but I hope that I have reassured my noble friend Lord Pearson and my noble friends Lord Glenarthur and Lord Astor, because we are aware that the vast majority of deer managers, and those involved with deer management, are very familiar or are actually involved in the sporting aspect of deer management. Just to underline what my noble friend Lord Astor said, you cannot be involved in deer management at one end and not somehow have experience of the sporting interest. Therefore we believe that our amendment will ensure that that point is taken on board.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-42_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   Once again, I shall have to read what my noble friend the Minister has said, but I am afraid that deer management now is very much wider than the sporting interest in deer, and indeed the whole industry to which my noble friend Lord Astor referred. Deer management would include counting their droppings in a dense forest to see how many deer there might be. It might be the management of a forest for birds.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-42_para7"></a> I could go on and give many examples where people could be chosen from the category of deer management without having any interest in, and indeed possibly being antagonistic to, the deer forests and the interest which supplies most of the employment and benefit in this area. I do not know whether my noble friend Lord Lindsay has covered Amendment No. 76, but I merely point out that it is a definition of deer management, which includes the sporting interest in deer. The best thing that can be done at the moment is for me to beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 9 because I spoke to Amendment No. 11 before, did I not?--or am I getting in a muddle now? I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-42_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove </B>   moved Amendment No. 10:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 2, line 18, at end insert--
<BR>
("(v) local government").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-42_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment will be not as well discussed or received as perhaps some of the other amendments. This is an amendment on which, frankly, I want to find out the Minister's views on the whole question of the appointments. The amendment would include a representative of local government on the commission. Although at first sight it may not be thought essential that the deer commission should include anyone from the world of local government, there is an expertise in local government and, on reflection, I believe there is a strong case for one councillor, or councillors, to be put on this commission. They are democratically elected people and I believe the protection of the environment in general, and natural heritage in particular, is a task which has been carried out for a very long time by local government. Therefore, I believe it would be right and proper if at least one of the commission was drawn from the local authority sector at elected member level to represent those interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-42_para10"></a>The second and perhaps more compelling reason for wanting an elected representative from local government to be on the commission is that these days we have an ever-increasing number of quangos. Councils and councillors are elected and therefore they have some democratic credibility. To include persons from such bodies would at least ensure that the views of ordinary persons in the street could be considered during the deliberations of the commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-42_para11"></a>At the very least, people who are elected are answerable to some group of the electors. I know that I am listening here to people who really know a great <P>


<a name="column_CWH25"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH25</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>deal about their subject, but one of the points we have to accept--I have known about it for a long time and appreciate it even more now--is that deer forests and the whole question of deer are not small matters. A deer forest is not like a farm. It may cover hundreds and hundreds of acres, taking in public roads, public highways and public streams, and therefore local people should have someone they can complain to who is accountable to them. They may have a very nice landlord or they may have a very difficult landlord. In the short 10 years I have been in this House I have met both types of landlord. Some are very malleable and others are not. Indeed, if a child stepped across the verge of some of the landlords I have known, they would be very annoyed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-42_para12"></a>There must be a representative who people can go to and feel they have a right to go to, not cap in hand, not begging and saying, "We want to know why the deer keeping running across our roads", or whatever. One would get co-operation from a councillor in these circumstances. He would accept that the people who are deer managers or the owners know a great deal more about the actual subject of deer itself but not perhaps enough about the point at which the public and the deer interests meet. It is very difficult.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-42_para13"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, spoke about the balance of quangos. There is no balance in quangos. We know how the quangos are made up. We have had years and years of them. We know that they are picked to get the results that the Minister wishes to get, with probably whichever group is in power. I feel that the Minister would make himself much more popular and perhaps make the whole question of the new deer commission much more acceptable if there were some evidence that there were people who were representative and meant something in the community--not because of their birth and not because of their wealth.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-42_para14"></a>I am presently reading an interesting book about who owns Scotland. It sets out the situation we have now where if someone makes an awful lot of money in South African gold, he can buy a country estate and then become a very important man in the community. He may not have had any interest before. But a local councillor must have a base in the area. He must be there all the time in one form or another. I beg the Minister to give this a little more thought.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-43_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur: </B>   I have listened with interest to the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael. I am bound to say that I do not find it nearly so easy to accept the suggestion as perhaps he hoped I might from where I sit and from my own experience of this matter. The fact is that those who under the 1959 Act should be appointed to the commission follow a very set pattern of interest specific to the subject matter which is likely to be encompassed.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-43_para0"></a>While I can understand that it may be appropriate to widen the group a little to include, for example, someone who represents a local authority and has an interest, therefore, in the roads or some other issue, it is a point which could be so stretched as to involve many other interests that it would go much wider than any <P>


<a name="column_CWH26"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH26</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concept that has hitherto been considered in relation to the Red Deer Commission or the Deer Commission for Scotland under its new name.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-43_para1"></a>The other point the noble Lord made was that somehow--I think I quote him correctly--elected people are answerable in some respect. I hope the noble Lord will accept that the Red Deer Commission is indeed answerable. If he looks at Section 3(2) of the 1959 Act he will see that the commission makes an annual report to the Secretary of State. It exercises its functions under the Act and lays a copy of the report before each House of Parliament. The point about answerability is already well covered by the Red Deer Commission under its existing responsibilities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-43_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   I should like to support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael. It is certainly true that wild deer range over local authority areas. They affect local people and form part of the local economy. I believe it is very important that the commissioners should have a knowledge of the context in which the future Deer Commission for Scotland will operate.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-43_para2"></a>In some respects I would possibly prefer the phrase "public administration" to "local government" because that probably is a wider definition ensuring that people understand the context in which they will work.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-43_para3"></a>My next point is aimed at the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, who unfortunately is not in his place at the moment. I am sorry to return to this but I feel I must. The point of the Select Committee going to Scotland to take evidence was to demonstrate the relevance of the Westminster Parliament to the people of Scotland and to try to counter the feelings of disaffection. The point I wish to make is that the Select Committee gained credibility in Scotland because it was predominantly made up of Scottish domiciled Members of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-43_spnew2"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   I have one difficulty with this amendment. If you have on the commission one councillor, say perhaps from Invernesshire, then Aberdeenshire, Banffshire, Argyleshire, Perthshire or Angus will say "Why Invernesshire? Why not us?". Unless you have a commission consisting entirely of local councillors, I can foresee nothing but trouble.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-43_para4"></a>As to the comments of the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, on the composition of the Select Committee in Edinburgh, I must say to him that I do not think the people of Scotland took a blind bit of notice. I never saw more than two people in the public gallery the whole time we were sitting and mostly there was nobody there.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-43_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, for raising what I thought would be a short and simple amendment which could be dealt with in a couple of minutes, although he indulged in some histrionics as regards the other matter. He claims that anything that smacks of a Quango is unacceptable, but he has completely lost sight of the new rules and procedures and codes of practice which are now abided by in the appointment of members to non-departmental public bodies. If the noble Lord says he dislikes <P>


<a name="column_CWH27"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH27</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Quangos and political appointments, why on earth is he proposing a constitutional future for Scotland when nearly one half of the Scottish parliament would be political appointees? They would be party placements. Why he should be so angry about the way in which the new deer commission might be appointed, and yet is happy to have Scotland governed on a day-to-day basis by a body that is largely composed of political appointments, I cannot understand.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-43_para5"></a>The implication of his remarks is that there was some degree of unacceptability about the deer commission at the moment, and I would take issue with that. I believe the deer commission under its current constitution has earned very high respect from many people. It has had a very good record and is widely admired for that, and we fully intend that it should continue thus.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-43_para6"></a>The noble Lord, though, points up the importance of acceptability generally, and behind much of our Clause 1 amendments to the 1959 Act is the hope that the commission, through its composition, can appeal to a broad church of people and can command respect across many different interests. This is part of the logic behind the amendments that we are making. Indeed, it is not impossible that a councillor or community representative, or indeed as the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, suggested, a public servant of some sort might well be a candidate for appointment to the commission. That is not an unlikely scenario.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-43_para7"></a>More important, perhaps, is that the deer commission has already made great strides towards working with the local community in the areas where deer management is an issue, and I suspect that as the years go by its efforts to work with local people will be redoubled--they certainly will not be lessened.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-43_para8"></a>My noble friend Lord Glenarthur correctly pointed out that there is accountability already written into the 1959 Act, and indeed if the Secretary of State is responsible for any inefficiency or performance that the deer commission achieves which is questionable or controversial, it is something which the Secretary of State must answer for. If for some reason someone wants to take issue with the deer commission, but he is unable to feed the strength of his feelings through deer management groups or through commissioners, he can get directly to the Secretary of State through MPs and ask him to account for the performance of the deer commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-43_para9"></a>I have one further point, which is the point raised by the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun. She in a way touched on the red deer counties and areas of Scotland; but the new deer commission will stretch from Berwickshire to Stornoway and from Wigtown way up to Thurso. It will deal with all species of deer in Scotland. The problem is not only as bad as it is painted, but I believe it to be very much worse if one is attempting to address issues which pertain to roe deer in the Borders. I hope the noble Lord is partly reassured by the fact that the deer commission will be picking up a tremendous reputation from the Red Deer Commission for consultation and <P>


<a name="column_CWH28"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH28</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>communication with local people and that what it has done to date is merely a springboard for the yet greater lines of communication that it will build in the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-43_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his courtesy in replying to me. I wish to raise a number of points. The annual report is a way of people making representations. We know that annual reports come in here regularly, but unless some outisde body is particularly interested or has the time to debate it, it is not a very effective way of communicating with the Secretary of State or any Minister. The Minister will be well aware of that from his own field.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-43_para10"></a>Does the spread of representation--or the spread of the area from Berwick to the Orkneys--mean that there will be any regional selection of the members of the Red Deer Commission or of the subcommittees of the Red Deer Commission? I believe that a councillor--or if CoSLA itself had a representative on the commission--that person would be approachable by anyone in Scotland; whereas, if the Minister is right, the members will be fairly thinly spread and people will not know who to contact in different parts of the country.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-43_para11"></a>An approach to a Member of Parliament falls into the same category as annual reports. It has to be something pretty important, or there will be a day's debate once every two or three years upon an annual report from one quango or another. I did not really expect to get a great deal from the Minister, but I did feel that I should raise the matter. I am not decrying the existing Red Deer Commission. I know it has done a great job and the gentleman who is very involved with it has been extremely helpful to us. (I suggested that he be given a knighthood; he has a very long name which I cannot remember).
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-43_para12"></a> I hope that, based on that experience, we can move forward. It gives us another chance to have a break in the existing system and to put at least one local government representative on the commission. I believe that CoSLA would be the perfect body.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-43_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   The noble Lord is absolutely right that the deer commission must keep in close contact with local government when local government issues arise. That is important on the planning side, as well as on the road side, and possibly also environmental health.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-43_para13"></a>When one thinks of how local government will be comprised after 1st April with so many councils, one sees how difficult it will be to have a representative on the commission appointed by the Secretary of State who can speak for local government. The commission will not have representatives appointed. If it were the kind of body which consisted of representatives, one might suggest that one of the representatives could be from local government.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-43_para14"></a>I see that in their submission the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities suggested that a member should be drawn from the local authority sector--perhaps it had in mind a planning officer or councillor. It does not sit very easily with the way the thing is <P>


<a name="column_CWH29"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH29</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>structured. I wonder if my noble friend the Minister could make very sure if this matter is raised again--or perhaps now--that there really is a requirement to consult with local government when local government issues arise, because it will be important and the commission must not get carried away and think that it does not have to pay any attention to planning or whatever it is. I am sure the present Red Deer Commission does that very well. I am not familiar exactly with the way it works, but I do not believe that this should be completely neglected as an issue, although I do not believe this particular approach, in view of the new structure of local government and the way in which the deer commission is going to be appointed, is the right approach.

<P>
<A NAME="60304-44_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   All I would say to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, is that we did not want this new type of local government. We believe this new type of local government is a disaster and would have been much better left as it was. Perhaps there are ways of improving it, but not as drastically as this. However, I have raised the question with the Minister and I would be only too happy to let him finish.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-44_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   Before the noble Lord withdraws his amendment, very quickly I will reassure my noble friend Lady Carnegy that there is already extensive dialogue between local government, local authorities and the deer commission on any matter that appears before the deer commission. This obviously has a local authority angle to it, so there is precedent there which will continue to be operated.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-44_para0"></a>The second point relates to the regions. I would just remind the Committee that two years ago the Red Deer Commission set up an office in Stirling to establish an administration which was quite clearly more Scotland-wide than it had been up to that point, and it foreshadowed the fact that the Bill now applies to all species of deer in Scotland. We hope that, for instance, those in the Borders can feel that the deer commission is an accessible body through its office in Stirling, rather than having to go way further north to see the commission in its own offices. So we are conscious of the issues which the noble Lord has raised.

<P>

<A NAME = "60304-44_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment provides for the right of removal of appointments under the old Act and for new appointments to be made from the start of the new commission's life. The present-day Bill does not create a new commission; it merely changes the name and some of the powers and duties of the old commission. Therefore, appointments recently made, that is in January 1996 for a three-year term of office, will continue in office for the whole term unless by means of this amendment the Secretary of State is required to replace them with appointments according to the new formula.

<P>

<A NAME = "60304-44_para7"></a>One of the most significant passages of the Bill is the proposal to change the formula of appointments in order to re-adjust the composition of the commission, and promote public confidence in this body as properly representative of the wide range of interests involved and impacted by deer.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-44_para8"></a>It would be quite wrong to hobble the new commission for the first two years of its service by retaining a composition which Parliament will have agreed is inappropriate for the task. It is possible that the Minister will merely reply that a delay in new appointments is appropriate in order to secure a smooth transition. That argument should be rejected on the basis that the Bill has taken many years to prepare. It is now widely regarded as long-overdue and all of its provisions should, I believe, be enacted as soon as possible. I hope that the Minister will accept the spirit of this. If we are to have a new start, we should have a new start. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-44_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I understand the spirit of the noble Lord's amendment and indeed am not unsympathetic to it. But many of the new appointments that were made towards the end of last year were made in the light of the new duties that are being increasingly thrust upon the commission. We also have a level of confidence in its chairman, Patrick Gordon-Duff-Pennington, and his colleagues, which reassures us anyway that the new challenges which the Bill is flagging up are ones which the new commission will be able to meet. I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment. I understand exactly the logic that has prompted him to move it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-44_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   I hope I did not give any slight to the present chairman of the commission and I am not criticising him in any way at all. Will the Minister insist that all the present members serve out their time before new people are appointed, or will there be an interim period after notice has been given and the new appointments made following that? If the Minister can answer me, I shall be quite happy to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-44_spnew12"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   The most honest answer I can give is that I shall look carefully at the issues the noble Lord has raised. We can either correspond with each other on this point before Report stage or return to it at Report stage.

That is why I personally would have supported Amendment No. 16 which would place a duty upon the commission to consider these categories of people, whereas at the moment it is left open as to whether or not it should do so. It seems to me that these panels will not be very effective if they do not have sitting on them the interests mentioned. Therefore I would have hoped that this was an amendment which my noble friend the Minister might be able to accept. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-45_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   The amendments as described by my noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch and the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, explored the area which the amendment not moved by the noble Lord, Lord Carmichael, would also have explored; namely, the method of appointment of local panels and the extent to which knowledge or experience of the key issues relevant to deer, following the prescription in Clause 1 to the commission itself, should be applied as a prescription to the local panels as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para0"></a>In practice, although currently there are no local panels in existence, should there be the need for one or more, the commission would seek to ensure that they worked effectively with all local interests in deer. To that extent, I am not convinced that the amendments are necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para1"></a>I should also point out that there may be local issues which are priorities and which dominate, but which do not fall within the four categories set out for appointment to the commission itself in Clause 1.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para2"></a>I also remind the Committee that these panels are advisory panels only; they will not have executive functions delegated to them. Finally, the local panels cannot be set up without approval from the Secretary of <P>


<a name="column_CWH33"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH33</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>State. Therefore, there is that check in the process which will ensure that reasonable and proper procedures are used in the appointment of the panel.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para3"></a>I do not want rigidly to set my face against these two amendments. I understand exactly the thinking of the noble Lords who have put these two amendments forward. I should, however, point out to the Committee that we are reasonably confident that should there be a need for a local panel it would work effectively with local people. While we do not think these amendments are necessary, I shall be happy to discuss this point again at the Report stage and will give the matter some more thought myself.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-45_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend, but when he comes to consider this matter between now and the Report stage, could I ask him also to give some consideration to the status of these panels with regard to Section 6 of the original Act--the section dealing with marauding deer.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para4"></a>I have been sent by my noble friend the Minister the notes on proposed government amendments which say that there is to be a policy amendment to repeal the delegation of powers over marauding deer. I am not quite sure how it is proposed that that should be done and I notice that in Section 2(3) of the original Act,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Commission may delegate to a panel appointed under" </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para5"></a>
that section, which I imagine is the same sort of panel as we are now considering,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the functions of the Commission under section six of this Act", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para6"></a>
that is, marauding deer,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"so far as relating to the locality of that panel, and the panel in the exercise of the functions so delegated to them shall comply with any directions given by the Commission". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para7"></a>
I am afraid I am confused as to whether it is intended to withdraw these powers from the panel. It may be that what is happening is part of the clarification of Clause 4 to which we shall come shortly. If the panels were to be left with these powers, or anything like them, I submit that the interests mentioned in Amendment No. 17 become very important indeed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-45_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I shall try to enlighten my noble friend. Government Amendment No. 89 does indeed repeal the ability for Section 6 powers to be delegated to local panels. Thirty or more years ago we saw it as necessary that local panels, in an era of fairly slow communication, should be able to act fairly quickly in an emergency. Today the deer commission, at headquarters level, through modern communications, can choreograph and manage a situation that requires prompt response. We believe therefore that any local panel that might be set up should not have Section 6 powers delegated to it and should be an advisory panel only.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-45_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   I am very grateful to my noble friend for that reply. I am sure we all look forward to Amendment No. 89 with confidence. In those circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "60304-45_para10"></a>Clause 3 [Particular powers of the Commission]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-45_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur </B>   moved Amendment No. 18:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 3, line 7, after ("with") insert ("the owners and occupiers of the land in question and with").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: It may be convenient if I also speak to Amendment No. 20 which has been grouped with Amendment No. 18. We now turn to the particular powers of the commission--powers to issue guidance or advice, and to conduct, or collaborate in, research, inquiries and investigations in various forms, or in any experiment, trial or demonstration.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para12"></a>I have no difficulty with the concept of particular powers. They were present in the 1959 Act. I am concerned, however, that the owners and occupiers of the land in question somehow do not need to be part of the collaborative process. What is proposed to take place under the powers would be planned. It would not be required urgently and a great deal of thought would have gone into it beforehand. So there does not seem to be any need or urgency requiring that the owner or occupier of the land should not be brought into the process. The commission shall,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"have power to conduct or to collaborate with any person or organisation which is conducting". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para13"></a>
But the Bill does not make clear whether that "any person" could include the owner or occupier of the land in question. It merely seems to indicate that the person conducting the research or experiment could be either an individual or an organisation. That point requires clarification. In any case, there is a question of principle involved. But obviously if this sort of work is going to be done it must take place almost certainly close to, or even on, land in which deer are to be found, and it is going to be owned by somebody, so it seems logical that they should be brought into it beyond peradventure.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para14"></a>Amendment No. 20 is very much on the same theme. If it is agreed that some work should be done in collaboration with organisations and individuals, as set out in paragraphs (i) and (ii),
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"relating to the conservation, control or sustainable management of deer", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para15"></a>
and that work is to be done in a way which furthers the interests of the commission, then it seems almost unreasonable to suggest that the work on property owned by individuals should not carry with it the agreement of the owners and occupiers of the land in question. So the two in a sense run together. I hope that my noble friend Lord Lindsay is clear about the point I am making.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para16"></a>The last element in Amendment No. 20 refers to veterinary supervision. This is in a sense a probing amendment. It seems to me that if experiments, trials or demonstrations are conducted which may be to the furtherance of the interests of deer in the broadest possible sense--my noble friend Lord Pearson touched earlier, as did others, on the question of the use of helicopters or vehicles, or the moving of deer from one place to another which could be damaging to the wellbeing of deer--they should be extremely carefully monitored by veterinary supervision. I have no reason to believe that the Red Deer Commission would not bear <P>


<a name="column_CWH35"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH35</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>this very closely in mind but it seems to me to be essential that veterinary supervision is somehow brought into play in the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-45_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   I should like briefly to support this amendment. If one reads through Clause 3 as drafted and takes what might be the heart of the matter, it seems to me inconceivable that the commission could attempt to do these things without the co-operation of the owner of the land in question. I quote as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Commission shall have power ... to conduct any experiment, trial or demonstration ... relating to the ... control of deer, or to any other aspect of the Commission's functions". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para17"></a>
Who is to say that a demonstration relating to the control of deer could not involve shooting quite large numbers of them? I do not believe that should happen without at least the stalker in question, or, as the amendment says, the owner, being consulted and supported. If it were to happen like that, I would not want to be the person conducting that experiment on the ground.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-45_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I hope I can reassure both my noble friends on this point. Both of them said in so many words that it was inconceivable that the powers of research or experiment available to the commission could be carried out in breach of normal private property rights. Indeed, that is the case--it is inconceivable. The powers in Clause 3 do not override in any way private rights, nor do they provide any special rights of entry. Therefore I cannot conceive circumstances where the commission's powers of research or experiment could be carried out without the necessary agreements and supervisions which are implied or sought in these amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para18"></a>I am confident that the commission can be trusted to carry out that important function in a reasonable way and in co-operation with those who might be affected by any project. But even if, for some reason, it were to choose a course which could be construed as being less reasonable, I reiterate the important point that the powers of Clause 3 do not override in any way private rights, nor do they provide any special rights of entry.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para19"></a>On the veterinary point raised by my noble friend Lord Glenarthur at the end of Amendment No. 20, I hope to reassure him that any experimentational research done by the deer commission would be under the general law on experimentation, and that includes veterinary supervision. In addition to that, the Red Deer Commission, as it is at the moment, has developed an extremely constructive and useful relationship with the Lasswade Veterinary Centre which conducts research on deer welfare and deer health on behalf of the Red Deer Commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-45_para20"></a>I am conscious that Amendment No. 19 was grouped in with Amendment No. 1 because it was spoken to in the discussion we had around Amendment No. 1. It may be useful if I just reassure the Committee that deer welfare is a priority in research and experimental matters. It is quite clearly an important issue with the Committee in regard to Clause 3 and therefore I am telling the Committee that we will consider the <P>


<a name="column_CWH36"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH36</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>argument for specific inclusion of the word "welfare" in Clause 3 and will come back to the Committee at Report stage with our decision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-46_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   I am most grateful to my noble friend for agreeing to include the word "welfare", at least in the experimental and demonstrative parts of the future commission's activity. It is not perhaps for me to ask my noble friend the question, but if it is obvious that the commission will indeed respect the normal rights of property and so on, can my noble friend give any reason why these amendments should not be accepted on the face of the Bill?
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-46_time0"></A><H5>5.45 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-46_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   It is because they simply duplicate safeguards which are already in effect, in that what Clause 3 enables the commission to do does not override any private rights or special rights of entry that are already sufficiently protected and taken into account by other general legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-46_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I wonder whether my noble friend is right to take the official's advice absolutely straight like that? We all accept that rights of entry exist and will be observed, but when we are talking about this commission we have already talked about how it should have the confidence of the broad public in Scotland. It is important that small crofters, as well as large occupiers and farmers, should feel that the commission will not march onto their land or conduct experiments. We are not just talking about land owners here--we are talking about all sorts of owners and occupiers. I can see no reason why there should not somewhere be a slight duplication of this--just a mention somewhere. Perhaps my noble friend the Minister could look at this point. I know that he has been warned against this by those behind him, but this is very much an official point of view. We have to think about how people will see this Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-46_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur: </B>   I do not want to prolong the debate, but I have much sympathy with what my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour said. My noble friend said that it is inconceivable that anyone would try to override existing rights--private rights, rights of entry or whatever--in order to try to conduct what is suggested in this clause. He also said that the Red Deer Commission can be trusted. I have no doubt whatever about that. However, if that is the case, and there is still concern about it, what is the difficulty in actually adding to the Bill the words that I have suggested in Amendment No. 18, that the commission should have the power to conduct or collaborate with,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the owners and occupiers of the land in question and with", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-46_para0"></a>
any person or organisation? It is self-evident that it will not do any damage or make it more awkward for the commission to have to go through that particular hoop, particularly in the light of the fact that there is no time constraint on this.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-46_para1"></a> I hope my noble friend can reassure me. It may be that he will have to quote chapter and verse on this and perhaps he will be able to draw on the experience of past <P>


<a name="column_CWH37"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH37</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>instances since 1959 of particular powers being used in this way and how they have been brought into effect, or say what indeed are the over-riding private rights, rights of entry and so on, which are referred to. I hope he will be able to respond positively to that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-46_para2"></a>As to the question of veterinary supervision, I am certainly very interested to hear him say that the general laws on experimentation will apply. One of the reasons why I am sensitised to this particular area is that I piloted the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Bill through the House in 1986. Experiment, so far as animals are concerned, often generates vast interest and concern, and rightly so. I hope that my noble friend will explain a little more about the general law on experimentation in this particular field because those words seem remarkably loose.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-46_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   Before my noble friend rises, I should remind him that very similar wording to this was included in the original Bill for Scottish Natural Heritage, except that for any experiment, trial or demonstration, we were asked to give the new Scottish Natural Heritage complete powers for development projects and schemes. I should remind my noble friend that the Government heavily lost an amendment on that. Unless he can do a little better in giving the Committee some reason why these very simple words should not be on the face of the Bill, this is one to which we may wish to return with a vengeance at the Report stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-46_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I have seen my noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch return to other things with a vengeance so I am suitably warned. I want to quote legislation which goes way beyond the legislation in front of us. The best thing is if I write to those noble Lords who have spoken on this issue and I hope that it is in sufficient time so that we can discuss that letter prior to Report stage.

<A NAME="60304-46_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   This appears to me to alter the introduction to Clause 4, which goes under the rubric of "Marauding deer" and is the clause which causes some of us the most worries about the Bill. Section 6 of the principal Act is of course the clause in that Act which deals with marauding deer, and I must confess that I am in a little bit of a muddle, jogging forwards and backwards with the various Acts. It may be that the wording of the Bill in front of us is the one which will take precedence. If, however, Amendment No. 21 is accepted at face value, it would alter the original Act from using the words:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"power of Commission to deal with marauding deer", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-46_para11"></a>
to become:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(power of Commission to authorise killing of deer causing damage). </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-46_para12"></a><P>

<A NAME = "60304-46_para13"></a>I must confess, therefore, that I am confused as to exactly what the amendment does. If my noble friend can assure me that it is merely a minor drafting amendment and paves the way for the new wording which is before us in the new Clause 4, then of course I am happy to accept it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-46_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur: </B>   I very much endorse the remarks of my noble friend Lord Pearson. It would be helpful, because of the complexity of all of this, if my noble friend could briefly run through in rather more detail what it is that these particular amendments do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-46_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   Particularly Amendment No. 21.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-46_spnew15"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   The catch-all, which I will give you once again, and then go on to some of the detail, is that there is no material change to the decision nor indeed the policy of any of these amendments. In fact, if it were not for the consolidation, we would not even be taking it before the Committee.

<A NAME = "60304-46_para14"></a>On the point made my noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch, the opening to Clause 4 does not affect the operation of Clause 4, or indeed Section 6 of the 1959 Act. This is simply a drafting change. The actual triggering of the marauding deer power is done not in these first lines but where the prerequisites are set out in order that the Section 6 authorisation can then be issued by the commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-46_para15"></a>There are other clarifying amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-46_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   I do not wish to take the time of the Committee, but I believe I have the correct version of the 1959 Act as revised in July 1982. Section 6 is described as the power of the commission to deal with marauding deer. It seems to me that this amendment proposes to change that into the power of the commission to authorise the killing of deer causing damage and that is very different. Marauding is something upon which we shall need to concentrate in some detail.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-46_para16"></a>I shall not intervene again. I just want to make it absolutely clear that my noble friend and his advisors know what I am on about. If I am confused and wrong, I am quite prepared to withdraw the objection.

<P>
<A NAME="60304-47_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   One of the issues I should refer to is the difficulty that the word "marauding" has caused in legal terms. In fact Amendment No. 82, if I remember correctly, sought to remove that term from part of the Act. The side notes have no legal effect. I do not want to prejudge discussion on Clause 4 because I realise there are many significant issues which we want to look at within Clause 4.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-47_para0"></a>Amendment No. 21 changes the introduction, because Amendment No. 35 inserts a new subsection into Section 6, and the previous version amended only subsection (1). As I said, it is a technical drafting amendment that we would not be entering into were it not for the drafting exercise and the demands made on us by the Consolidation Bill which we hope shortly to have in the pipeline.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-47_para1"></a>I allude to just one other amendment which deals with terminology and the fact that the term "farm animals" is better replaced by the term "livestock" because of legal definitions that arise from the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968. It is also desirable to clarify in the context of control agreements and control schemes that the animals against which action may be taken refers only to deer. We are simply clarifying some drafting amendments in this group of amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-47_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur: </B>   I only have one very brief comment to make and that is that, having raised a particular concern at Second Reading, that Clause 4(1)(a) refers to "on any land, deer are causing" etc., I am most grateful to my noble friend for finding ways to leave out that term. He has not explained precisely why he has decided to leave it out. I can only assume that <P>

<A NAME="60304-47_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My noble friend is correct. I shall reintroduce this by saying that I will be speaking to Amendments Nos. 23, 30, 34, 89 and 100. I apologise to the Committee for misleading it.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-47_para5"></a>Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 do indeed arise from points raised by my noble friend Lord Glenarthur at Second Reading. I am grateful to him for raising those points. I hope my response is adequate to meet the concerns that he raised.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-47_para6"></a>As regards Amendment No. 30, I made it clear on Second Reading that the revised power to deal with marauding deer under Section 6 of the 1959 Act, which are proposed in Clause 4 of the Bill, would be used only in emergency situations when there was a need to take urgent action to deal with deer damage. I repeated this clear intention when I appeared before the Scottish Select Committee. Nevertheless, a number of individuals and organisations have expressed the concern that the terms of the clause as drafted could, in certain circumstances, be used where there was not an emergency. In order to clarify this point I am therefore moving Amendment No. 30 which requires the commission to be satisfied that none of its other powers is adequate to deal with the situation at hand before proceeding with action under this section.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-47_para7"></a>For the most part I expect the commission to proceed through agreement with deer managers using its range of advisory and authorisation powers to meet its objectives. In circumstances where there are particular, often long standing, problems, I see the commission using the flexibility offered under new Clause 5 to reach control agreements to promote effective action. Only when early action needs to be taken and no other means of bringing the situation under control are apparent will the powers under revised Section 6 be appropriate. In the last resort, emergency powers such as these are needed to ensure that deer, which belong to no one, can be effectively controlled if they are causing serious damage to public or private interests or danger to public safety which needs to be stopped. In reaching decisions <P>


<a name="column_CWH41"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH41</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on Amendment No. 30 and the proposals we are putting forward, the commission must have regard to its balancing duty to ensure that the interests of owners and occupiers are taken into account before decisions are made.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-47_para8"></a>The revised Section 6 will retain the existing provisions that apply to the commission to request action by the person with the right to shoot deer before taking action itself and to give such notice as may be reasonable in the circumstances before action is taken on the ground. The important point is that the circumstances should be exceptional and that emergencies should be genuine; in other words, that no other power is available to the commission to respond to a particular set of exceptional circumstances. We hope our amendment makes that clear.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-47_para9"></a>I shall speak to Amendments 89 and 100. When the Red Deer Commission was established in 1959 it made sense to envisage the marauding deer powers under Section 6 being delegated in certain circumstances to local panels. Local agricultural executive committees had played a role in authorising action against marauding deer before that time and it was thought that the local panels might play a similar role. In practice the commission has been able to perform the function effectively thanks to improved communications, as I explained to the Committee, and effective work locally through deer management groups. We do not any longer feel that this delegated power needs to be thrust upon local panels.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-47_para10"></a>Now that the powers in Section 6 are to be extended to cover emergency threats to the natural heritage and to public safety and are expressly made appropriate only when other powers are adequate it makes sense to restrict the use of this power to the commission alone. Local panels could well play an important part as advisers to the commission, and indeed to local managers in the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-47_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend for that explanation, but even with the government amendment it seems that Clause 4 can still be used against deer on their normal territory; that is, when they are not marauding and not coming from other land. We shall return to this area in greater detail soon, but I remind my noble friend that in the committee in Edinburgh he said that the definition of marauding was quite important. Clause 4 cannot be triggered if the deer that are inflicting the damage are resident or established on the site. They must be marauding deer moving from another site to cause that damage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-47_para11"></a>I am not sure that the Bill, even with Amendment No. 23, fulfils the intention expressed by my noble friend in Edinburgh. We shall come to more detail on Clause 4 and the meaning of "marauding". I am not sure that we have adequately dealt with it yet.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-47_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   Perhaps it will help if I focus briefly on Amendment No. 23. The purpose of these linked amendments is to make it clear that authorisation to control marauding deer under Section 6 of the 1959 Act can only proceed in the specific circumstances of each individual case. They also have the effect of <P>


<a name="column_CWH42"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH42</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ensuring that action can be taken on whatever type of land on which deer are causing trouble where emergency action needs to be taken.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-47_para12"></a>Given the nature of the new grounds for action introduced by Clause 4, it is important that the commission has the powers to take action wherever this is warranted by the circumstances of each case. It is, however, equally important that the authorisations to control marauding deer only proceed in the specific circumstances of each individual case and are bound to it so that they cannot run on beyond the circumstances of a specific case. I hope my noble friend Lord Pearson will welcome that clarification and improvement contained in Amendment No. 23 which stems from concerns expressed to us at Second Reading.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-47_para13"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-47_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch </B>   moved Amendment No. 24:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 3, line 20, after ("land") insert ("marauding").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-47_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: We now come to the specific amendments on Clause 4 regarding the expression "marauding". I, and other Members of the Committee, are very keen to pin down exactly what the word "marauding" means. Amendment No. 24 replaces the words "on any land", which have just been removed by my noble friend, with the word "marauding". Amendment No. 79, in Clause 9 of the Bill--the schedules to the Bill--attempts to give a definition of what a marauding deer is, as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'marauding deer' means deer which have left their normal range", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-47_para15"></a>
for the time of year in question. I would add,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and have caused or are likely to cause damage to agricultural production or woodland, and where remedial action is required without delay and where the procedures under section 5 above would not prevent further immediate damage". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-47_para16"></a><P>

<A NAME = "60304-47_para17"></a>I am sure that, once again, that definition is not perfect legally, but I am far from persuaded that a definition of marauding cannot be found. A marauding deer, against which the very considerable and immediate powers of this clause can be used, must be one which is marauding. That does not mean to say that it is on its normal territory, going about its normal business--grazing the heather and so on. There must be an element of surprise that the deer arrived where it was not expected to arrive. It must have come from somewhere and go back somewhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-47_para18"></a>In the original Act, and indeed in this Bill, the suggestion arises that those who will have to deal with marauding deer will have to follow them and kill them. That means, presumably, that they run away from where they are marauding and go back to where they came from. I am not going to the stake or indeed to the corral on the definition of the word "marauding", but I believe these amendments are important and we must make some attempt to define this area before we move onto other areas of Clause 4. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="60304-48_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur: </B>   I would like briefly to support my noble friend Lord Pearson on this not least because I really believe that there is a serious issue of clarity here, particularly following my noble friend Lord Lindsay's remarks in connection with Clause 23. It seems to me <P>


<a name="column_CWH43"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH43</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be absolutely crucial that this definition of precisely what marauding entails is made totally clear. At the moment, I am by far from convinced that I even understand what will be the outcome of the amendments in their totality suggested by my noble friend. Therefore, I hope that he will go some way further to satisfy my concerns.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-48_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   The effects of Amendments Nos. 24 and 79 have been substantially explained by my noble friends Lord Pearson of Rannoch and Lord Glenarthur. I would repeat the definition that we have used of "marauding" both in Notes on Clauses and indeed by myself in earlier evidence: marauding deer are deer which are not being effectively controlled and which are on land on which they are not normally established. The need for clarity, if the term is used strategically or substantially in the Bill, called for by my noble friend Lord Glenarthur is one with which I agree, and it is the need for clarity which makes us cautious about the sort of definitions which are being suggested by my noble friend Lord Pearson.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-48_para0"></a>On the difficulty about creating a legal definition of marauding deer, it is impossible to be certain about what constitutes the normal range on which deer are established, and therefore to have a clear legal prescription of where deer should and should not be. Because of my sympathy with the motives behind this amendment--it is not dissimilar to the welfare issue--I have spoken to the parliamentary draftsman. He points out that normal range to deer managers may be one thing, but that the normal range of a particular species of deer to woodland owners, crofters or farmers may be another thing, and it may be possible, if one was contesting the label "range", to produce biologists or other experts who come up with yet another definition of what should be the normal range of a wild animal. I have no quarrel with what the two noble Lords are trying to achieve in principle. My concern is that the term "normal range" is something which my experts, officials and parliamentary draftsman say is potentially terrifying because of the number of different ways in which it can be interpreted for the various different species of deer that we have in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-48_para1"></a>On the basis of the difficulty over the actual definition, I hope that my noble friend will withdraw his amendments, but it is something that we have spent a good deal of time looking into.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-48_time0"></A><H5>6.15 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-48_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend but I am not convinced that we have spent enough time looking into it. Before withdrawing the amendment, I wonder whether we may have his assurance that we can discuss this in some depth before we move to the next stage. All the powers which centre around Clause 4 come from this difficulty of the immediacy of Clause 4 and exactly how they are going to be used. If we cannot solve the problem by reaching an agreement on the meaning of the word "marauding", <P>


<a name="column_CWH44"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH44</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>then there must be another way that we can define where we all want to be with this clause. Perhaps I may put that to my noble friend as a request.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-48_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I am happy to discuss this with my noble friend before the next stage. I would also point out to him exactly where we are coming from. We are happy, away from the face of the Bill, to define "marauding deer" as those which are not being effectively controlled and are not normally resident in the area where they exist. There may be grounds for optimism for my noble friend that somehow we can agree on what is at the heart of this. It is a matter of whether we can put a safe definition of "marauding" into the Bill and know that it is secure from counter-definitions from others.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-48_para2"></a>Perhaps I may also remind the Committee that the impact of the definition and how it is interpreted are vital. This is why the amendment which I am about to move specifies that all other options and powers available to the deer commission must be unavailable or inappropriate before it can turn to the marauding power. This will help by de facto defining the circumstances in which marauding deer will be classified as such, because if through discussion with the people who have a right to shoot deer wherever they are or if through control agreements or control schemes or through the deer management groups you can solve the problem that those deer are creating, then you do not have marauding deer. You only have marauding deer and can tackle them where no other power is available to the commission. I am happy to discuss this point with my noble friend prior to the next stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-48_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   I am most grateful to my noble friend. I take particular encouragement from his agreement that a marauding deer cannot be one that is normally resident where it is supposed to be marauding! With that small satisfaction, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="60304-48_spnew5"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy </B>   moved Amendment No. 25:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 3, line 21, after first ("to") insert ("enclosed").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-48_para4"></a>The noble Lady said: I beg leave to speak also to Amendment No. 69. If "woodland" is not enclosed by some fence or barrier designed to keep deer out, surely they cannot be considered to be "marauding" if they get into it! As the definition of "woodland" stands at present, which I shall return to in a later amendment, and in the absence of any definition of "marauding", which we have just spoken about, "woodland" can, as I see it, mean any land on which there are just a handful of trees in possibly a square kilometre of land. The normal range of red deer is frequently over just such land.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-48_para5"></a>As I understand it from the submissions of various witnesses to the Select Committee, if one plants trees, or tries to regenerate them without deer fencing, one would need to reduce the deer population to between three and five deer or less per square kilometre (400 hectares). At that level, the letting of stalking for sport <P>


<a name="column_CWH45"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH45</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as a commercial activity, as we know it, would be impossible with consequent loss of income from rent and venison sales and loss of capital value.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-48_para6"></a>The RSPB suggested in its submission that that would not be the case but, under questioning, it admitted that its stalkers were the owners of--I think it was the solum. In the red book it says the "soul", and it certainly cannot be the "sole". I think it means the solum. The RSPB's stalkers only stalked about 15 days a season, which is very little; took one beast per outing; only paid any expenses involved, and also admitted that it did not have to make the estate pay, thanks to outside funding.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-48_para7"></a>I have a nightmare vision. If woodland does not have to be enclosed, SNH can come along waving a European Communities habitats directive from Brussels, and declare a large part of what is at present a sporting estate to be a special area of conservation, where the native forest is to be regenerated without the use of politically incorrect deer fencing. Then, when the deer eat or threaten to eat the seedlings on what has hitherto been their normal feeding ground, it can demand that the commission has them massacred. What is more, to add insult to injury, it keeps the carcasses. That would be pretty hard on the wretched owner, who is left with the wages to pay, no income and an unsaleable estate. That might suit some future government of an independent Scotland bent on nationalisation of all sporting estates, because compulsory purchase would then not cost them very much. But do the Government really want to put powers into this Bill which, as I see it, could be used in that way? I do not say that they would, but it is possible that they could. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-48_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lady for explaining Amendment No. 25 to us and indeed for speaking to Amendment No. 69.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-48_para8"></a>The existing provision at Section 6 of the 1959 Act does not specify that the woodland should be enclosed. One can easily anticipate a situation where a particular woodland or forest is not enclosed because deer were not a problem at that time. Later, deer leave their established range, or their range under pressure moves, and enter that woodland and could potentially cause serious damage. To specify that only enclosed woodlands merit protection would be to suggest that any woodland within possible striking range of deer populations, either now or at some stage in the future, should be expected to be fenced or else risk damage, regardless of whether or not deer are a problem at present. That would be an unreasonable burden to place on the proprietors of woodlands.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-48_para9"></a>It has been suggested that the commission might authorise out of season shooting to protect the natural heritage or unenclosed woodland in a manner which does not take into account neighbouring land interests. As we have already discussed, the effect of the new balancing duty introduced by Clause 1 is to ensure that such matters are taken into account when relevant as the commission exercises its powers. Consequently, the commission will not be able to issue authorisations without taking into account any impact they might have on neighbouring interests or indeed in general on the interests of owners and occupiers.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH46"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH46</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-48_para10"></a>In any case, those with experience of the way the commission exercises its functions will know that the commission's role in respect of deer management groups has been very much to stress the voluntary principle in solving potential problems and to encourage co-operation between neighbouring owners. The sustainable management of deer throughout Scotland in the manner envisaged by the Bill will be possible only if the commission can demonstrate that it is carrying out its overall responsibilities in a balanced and reasonable manner.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-48_para11"></a>Amendment No. 69 is designed to restrict out of season authorisations to enclosed woodland also. New Section 33A(5) of the Bill specifically aims to allow the commission to authorise shooting to prevent damage to unenclosed woodland. The important point behind this is that unenclosed woodland--especially if it is near or within the normal range of deer--is less likely to trigger Section 6--as amended by Clause 4 of the Bill--powers. The powers will be very strictly defined and with my Amendment No. 30 will be even more closely defined. The damage must be serious; the damage must also be continuing damage. It cannot be damage that has happened or is about to happen. The other powers and procedures available to the commission must be inadequate. They must have been either tried and failed or be inappropriate to the circumstances of the case. The most likely scenario with unenclosed woodland is that one has a build up of a problem which is then subject to the control agreement that at worst could be a control order. But there is a much smaller likelihood of marauding powers being triggered for the unenclosed woodland in a way which I believe the noble Lady so fears.

<A NAME = "60304-49_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment and Amendment No. 71 with which it is grouped are designed to tease out from my noble friend the Minister the exact circumstances in which the somewhat draconian new powers of the Bill might be used to defend the natural heritage interest.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-49_para2"></a>Amendment No. 84, with which those two amendments are grouped, seeks to exclude the use of helicopters for that purpose and the use of helicopters to drive deer into corrals for slaughter.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-49_para3"></a>Amendment No. 26 therefore removes the words "whether directly or indirectly" deer are causing damage "to the natural heritage generally" in Clause 4, and more or less the same words from Clause 7 of the Bill, which authorises the commission to carry out certain acts. Those acts include the use of any vehicle

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to drive deer in order to take or kill them for the purposes of deer management". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-49_para4"></a>
That clause then goes on specifically to say that "deer management" does not include sporting activity, so presumably it does include the large-scale slaughters to which I have referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-49_para5"></a>Lying at the back of these amendments is the strong suspicion that these violent clauses are not really needed to protect the natural heritage at all. If deer are on what I have called their normal range, or my noble friend the Minister has described as where they are normally resident, then any damage they may be doing to the natural heritage is something which builds up over a period of years and can be dealt with by Clause 5 of the Bill, to which there are few objections.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-49_para6"></a>What I am asking my noble friend to do, for the record, is to explain why the natural heritage interest is required within the emergency powers of Clause 4 to deal with marauding deer, especially when he is trying to persuade me that no-one can say what a marauding deer really is. Secondly, can he explain why the ability to drive deer--and in this case, under Clause 7, on their normal range--with helicopters into corrals to kill them for the purposes--as the Bill so euphemistically puts it--of "deer management" is included, but yet the Bill goes on specifically to exclude any sporting activity? I imagine my noble friend will confirm that that means fairly substantial culling, if "massacre" is too emotive a word, in the Bill as drafted.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-49_para7"></a>Those are my worries about the natural heritage interest being included in these clauses, and my worry as to the use to which the intention to use helicopters to drive them will clearly be put if the Bill goes ahead as drafted. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-49_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur: </B>   My noble friend will be aware that during the passage of the Natural Heritage (Scotland) Bill there was a very great deal of concern raised that the powers that that Bill introduced, coupled with anything that might emerge on deer could have very much the effect that my noble friend Lord Pearson has described. These really are matters which go to the heart of the concerns of a great many people about the way that the powers that are being introduced in the Bill could be used. I accept that in the totality of the commission's powers, including the responsibilities of individuals, there is a sense of gradation of what can be done to try to meet the concerns which at any time could arise. However, it seems to me that what is being authorised by the Bill could go much further, and in a way which is as yet improperly defined--my noble friend has given the example of the incomplete definition of precisely what marauding deer are in this respect--than any of us really feels at all comfortable with.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-49_para8"></a>There is a duty embodied in the Bill to further the conservation. Yet it seems that, in the points we are considering now, that conservation looks a little weak when it does not sit easily with the idea that, for a particular circumstance to preserve the natural heritage in the ways that are described, somewhat draconian powers can be taken. I hope that my noble friend will <P>


<a name="column_CWH48"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH48</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>take this very seriously indeed. I have grave concerns about it and will return to the question of helicopters in due course. I shall certainly have a few things to say then. At the moment, however, I am less than assured from all I have heard so far that we have this right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-49_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   Before my noble friend sits down, I am not sure that we do return to helicopters. This is our chance to deal with helicopters by excluding them from the vehicles which the commission may use to drive deer for deer management purposes, which are strictly unsporting.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-49_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur: </B>   I was hoping to come to it during the definition phase--under Clause 9--which was the point I was making. I certainly do agree with my noble friend that the idea of using helicopters in this respect is highly undesirable. I also wonder--I know that my noble friend the Minister has not yet covered it in any remarks he has made--whether some consultation would no doubt be taking place to establish whether or not this is a practice which could be endorsed by those who are more immediately concerned with helicopters in this way. I suppose I ought to declare an interest as chairman of the British Helicopter Advisory Board, which is the trade association for all the helicopter operators. I have to say that I have no advice from it on the subject but I wonder whether my noble friend has sought any advice as to the use of aircraft generally. Having said that, that does not detract from the fact that I deplore the possibility that they could be used in this way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-49_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   The amendment and related amendments introduced by my noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch cover quite a lot of very important ground. Part of his concern is perhaps whether the natural heritage itself should be sufficient reason for the deer commission to exercise its stronger powers. We have looked at this very carefully before bringing it forward in the Bill and indeed we would not have brought it to this stage without sufficient consensus and without the recommendations of the Red Deer Commission itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-49_para9"></a>Across society, there is a general understanding now that environmental matters are of increasing importance and are likely to become even more important as the years go by. They need to be handled in a sustainable manner which does not disregard the needs and interests of other land users and other interests; for instance, owners and occupiers. At the same time, the importance of the natural heritage and environment is now seen as being as important as any other factor and therefore justifying the focus of the deer commission when it is exercising either Clause 4 or Clause 5 powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-49_para10"></a>There could be emergencies which, if I think hard enough, I could envisage where one might want to invoke a Section 6 power for reasons of natural heritage. It could be that there is an enclosed woodland which houses some feature of the natural heritage which is an important and significant feature, and it could be flora or fauna. Into that woodland at a later date deer manage to arrive and invade that area as marauding deer in exceptional circumstances. They therefore destroy the <P>


<a name="column_CWH49"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH49</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>survival or prospects of whatever it is that was so important in the first place. They literally cause it serious damage. I have stressed in the past, and I stress it again, that unless serious damage can be substantiated, that that is the description of events, then there is no way that Section 6 powers can be invoked for the natural heritage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-49_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   I am most grateful to my noble friend for giving way. Perhaps he would allow me to point out that he has just made precisely the same mistake that the Chief Executive of Scottish Natural Heritage made at our committee proceedings in Edinburgh. If my noble friend will direct himself to Clause 4, he will see that we have not objected to Clause 4 being used against marauding deer, whatever they may turn out to be, when they are causing serious damage to woodland. Clause 9 of the Bill as drafted says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"'woodland' means land on which trees are grown, whether or not commercially, and includes any such trees and any vegetation planted or growing naturally among such trees on that land". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-49_para11"></a><P>

<A NAME = "60304-49_para12"></a>I take the point that the noble Earl makes. There are amendments tabled to decide whether the woodland should be enclosed or unenclosed; whether the trees should have been planted; whether they should be mature woodlands or groups of mature trees and all the rest of it. The definition of "woodland" appears to be much too widely drafted to some of us and would, in fact, enable much more land than is intended to be covered by the Bill. But we are coming back to that.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-49_para13"></a>Clause 4 as drafted allows marauding deer to be dealt with when they are,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"causing serious damage to woodland, to agricultural production (including any crops or foodstuffs)". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-49_para14"></a>
It then goes on to talk about injury to what no doubt would become livestock and so forth, even when they are a danger to the public. My objection to this clause is the inclusion of the expression that those deer should be dealt with when they are causing damage,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"whether directly or indirectly, to the natural heritage generally". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-49_para15"></a>
That is the point to which I ask my noble friend to address himself.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-50_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I stress the word "serious" as an adjective to the word "damage". For decades, if not for centuries, deer in Scotland have caused a level of damage just to ensure their own survival, but Clause 4 talks specifically about serious damage to woodland. That is of greater importance in terms of severity than merely talking about damage. It may not be woodland we are talking about. I am sure the noble Lord accepts that it could be open moor or other types of vegetation of natural heritage significance. Where a significant aspect or feature of the natural heritage is concerned, the ability to act quickly in cases of serious damage is of vital importance, but if it is merely damage and not serious damage, then quite properly Section 6 should not be available to the commission. There is a very important distinction here. I hope the Committee accepts that we must have this ability to act in emergency situations where the natural heritage is under threat, not simply because there is a continuing level of damage which is not categorised as serious but because there is a serious threat and the damage itself would be serious.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-50_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, spoke to two other amendments. If I understood my noble friend correctly, he seeks to remove natural heritage as a ground for authorising out of season shooting under the proposed Section 33A(5), as proposed by Clause 7. For the same reason that I would defend the ability to authorise a Clause 6 power to protect the natural heritage against serious damage, I would also defend the ability of the commission to authorise out of season shooting to defend the natural heritage against serious damage.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-50_para1"></a>My noble friend Lord Pearson also spoke to Amendment No. 84. I would point out that the definition was taken from the English Deer Act 1991, and it was the intention of the Bill to allow the use of vehicles to move deer subject to permission, authorisation and a code of practice. We have thought the matter through very carefully and will continue to look at the whole subject from all angles. There is sufficient concern, and it is a sufficiently provocative subject, that we should not resort to a closed mind. We will continue to keep an open mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-50_para2"></a>However, our fundamental belief, which has come to us through advice from the Red Deer Commission, is that if legislation is only available to a government to revise the powers of the deer commission every two to three decades it is important to take a reasonably long-term view as to what powers and provisions may be needed in the medium term. It has been anticipated by the commission itself in discussions with us that deer on difficult terrain could be subject to very fast rising numbers and that the only way to remove that deer could be the use of some vehicle, be it airborne or a land vehicle. That would be the only sensible way to manage the deer over that ground.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-50_para3"></a>We have made it quite clear that there is to be no sporting dimension to such movement of beasts. It may be that, both for welfare reasons, if there are too many deer on that particular range, or indeed for natural heritage reasons, deer might have to be managed like that. The deer commission would have to consider and authorise each case specifically, and the code of practice which is still to be worked up into its final form would be imposed upon any such exercise. I can reassure the Committee that the use of helicopters in deer management in Scotland will be discussed again in Committee, and again on Report. I can further assure the Committee that I will continue to discuss it with officials between Committee and Report stages. We are keeping an active mind on this.

<A NAME="60304-50_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Before my noble friend Lord Pearson replies, on the question of deleting natural heritage in this context, if you asked people in Scotland generally whether they would agree that the deer commission should not have power in an emergency to do something quickly about serious damage to some aspect of the heritage by deer, they would ask what was the point of having a deer commission. I really do think that. I am not talking about helicopters at this moment. I can understand that my noble friend may have fears <P>


<a name="column_CWH51"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column CWH51</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about the effect of the Bill on the ground--we have to look at that--but that must stay somewhere in this clause.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-50_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend and to my noble friend the Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-50_para4"></a>To my noble friend Lady Carnegy I would say that we accept that the deer commission requires emergency powers to deal with marauding deer. The question posed by Amendment No. 26 is whether the natural heritage can be the subject of such emergency action. The natural heritage lasts over a very long period of time and it may be that deer are moving into an area and threatening a rare species of plant, or some montagne environment. But if we allow marauding deer to be dealt with in a woodland--even vaguely within the definition of woodland--and everything that goes on in a woodland within this Bill and all the other categories for which marauding deer can be dealt with--then you are only left with the open hills for the use to which the natural heritage interests might be put. It is that which I am trying to protect.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-50_para5"></a>I have to say to my noble friend that I take no comfort from his statement that the damage has to be serious. I imagine that the difference between damage and serious damage must be somewhat in the eye of the beholder. The beholder, on this occasion, will be the commission. If my noble friend can tell me what the difference between damage to the natural heritage on the open hill, not in the woodland, and serious damage to the natural heritage is likely to be, then we might all begin to understand what this clause could be about. Until that can be done, I view it with the very gravest suspicion.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304-50_para6"></a>Finally, I am encouraged that my noble friend is prepared to have another look at helicopters, because helicopters are not any good at driving deer in dense plantations; the deer simply turn round and go back. You cannot drive deer out of the modern forestry plantation with a helicopter. I have tried it and it cannot be done. Through the amendment we are trying to deal with the use of helicopters on the open hill under the excuse of the natural heritage to drive deer to their painful destruction. I regret to say that my noble friend has not comforted me on this yet and I hope we can continue to discuss it. If I have that assurance, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "60304-50_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: This is an amendment to page 3 line 31 of the Bill, which suggests that it might be impractical to move deer away from the area where they are causing damage, and, if that is so, they should be dealt with where they are. It seems to me a perfectly reasonable little amendment and I wonder whether my noble friend can view it favourably.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-50_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur: </B>   I rise briefly to support my noble friend. It does not seem to me to be a particularly difficult concept to bring to bear and for that reason, because of its simplicity, I very much hope that my noble friend will look at its virtues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304-50_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   I can promise that I will take this away and look forward to considering it in more detail. The spirit behind it is not something with which we will quarrel in that we would hope that, in the hierarchy of action that is applied to any situation where deer damage is thought to be occurring, the deer should be managed where the damage is occurring in the first instance and only in the second instance from where the deer are coming to inflict that damage. Indeed, the deer commission has therefore to contact those people with the right to shoot deer where they are more normally resident. I stress that what the noble Lord is trying to achieve through this amendment is something to which we are not unsympathetic and at which we shall look.

Can the noble Earl clarify the position?

<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>stress that deer are wild animals belonging to no one--they do enjoy a right of protection against that serious damage. There should be discretion within the commission in the process leading up to such a decision as to the most appropriate action to take in respect of a problem which is becoming more aggravated. The commission should exercise a discretion in terms of the voluntary agreements open to it and the control orders open to it and, finally, if all else fails and it is an emergency situation, then the marauding power in Section 6 of the 1959 Act is available. There should be discretion up to that point, but once serious damage is being inflicted on other legitimate land use interests, then this power should be activated.

<P>
<A NAME="60304w01_wqn1"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the European Commission wishes to revise the allocation of funds under the "financial perspectives" and, if so, what sums are involved under which "budget" headings, and what is their response and why.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security   (Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish): </B>  The Commission have not put forward any formal proposal to revise the Financial Perspective. However, comments made by President Santer at the end of January and reports in the press suggest that such a proposal might be forthcoming, and would involve some additional provision for spending on Trans-European Networks and Research, possibly offset by adjustments to expenditure ceilings elsewhere, notably in the provision for agriculture.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w01_para15"></a>The UK is strongly opposed to any revision of the Financial Perspective, particularly where this would have the effect of increasing total Community expenditure. The Financial Perspective ceilings were agreed at Edinburgh in 1992 to enable the Community to meet its obligations from 1993 to 1999. Nothing has changed to render the basis for this agreement invalid.

<A NAME="60304w01_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office   (The Earl of Lindsay): </B>  I am pleased to have been able to offer 53 individual grants totalling &#163;450,000 to 46 voluntary bodies in Scotland to assist them in carrying out their valuable environmental conservation, improvement and education work. The sums available in the Special Grants (Environmental) Programme in 1996-97 match those available in 1995-96. This continued level of support reflects the Government's commitment to the voluntary sector, and its role in carrying out the Government's environmental objectives.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304w01_spmin3"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Earl Howe): </B>  The purpose of the Married Quarters Discounted Sale Scheme (MQDSS) has been to assist Service Personnel into home ownership. It has been popular, but has over the years necessarily helped a relatively modest number of personnel. This, combined with the proposed sale of the Married Quarters Estate, has resulted in consideration of a replacement scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w01_para17"></a>We now intend to replace the MQDSS with an interest free advance of pay for house purchase which is based on the current scheme available in the Royal Navy. The replacement scheme will come into effect on 1st August 1996.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w01_para18"></a>The scheme will allow us to target resources more effectively to assist retention. It will be available to all Regular Army and RAF personnel aged 35 and over on pensionable engagements or commissions. The advance will be a maximum of &#163;8,500 and will be repayable over 10 years of service. The qualifying age for the Royal Navy scheme will reduce from 25 to 23 years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304w02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   The deadline for providing all prisoners with 24-hour access to sanitation was 29th February. On 29th February over 99 per cent. of prisoners had 24-hour access to sanitation. If every cell without sanitation had been withdrawn from use on that date, there would have been a loss of 267 places in the area between Leeds and Liverpool and this would have increased the likelihood of using police cells in that region. For this reason my right honourable friend the Home Secretary approved the retention of some cells without sanitation until early April when other accommodation opens.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w02_para16"></a>Since the sanitation programme was announced in 1991, over 19,000 places have been provided with sanitation. During this period the prison population has <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>increased by approximately 30 per cent. We anticipate that all prisoners will have 24-hour access to sanitation by 12th April 1996. The delay has been caused primarily by the need to include necessary security improvement in the refurbishment programme.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304w02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   It is an important part of the Government's policy on immigration to continue to admit the spouses and minor dependent children of refugees and people settled here. The Immigration Rules provide accordingly.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w02_para17"></a>There is no provision in the Rules for family reunion for those who do not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee, but asylum seekers who are allowed to remain exceptionally may apply to be joined by their immediate family after four years.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304w02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   No. Family Credit is included in the definition of public funds in the Immigration Rules because it is one of a number of benefits to which people coming to this country on the understanding that they can be maintained and accommodated without recourse to public funds should not have access.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304w02_spmin4"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of National Heritage   (Lord Inglewood): </B>  The Government's consultation exercise is now effectively complete. There has been a series of meetings with terrestrial, satellite and cable broadcasters, with regulatory authorities, with sports bodies, and with consumer, viewer and listener organisations. We have had extensive correspondence, <P>


<a name="column_WA8"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column WA8</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>particularly from the public. We have reviewed the recommendations of the National Heritage Select Committee's 1994 report on television coverage of sport. We have also had very much in mind points made in debate on the Broadcasting Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w02_para18"></a>This consultation exercise has proved useful. It has given all concerned the opportunity to put their case in the knowledge that the matter was under review. And it has allowed the Government to reach a better understanding of the issues, and to decide on a way forward which recognises all the interests involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w02_para19"></a>It is clear that the primary public concern relates to listed events and how they might be protected for terrestrial free-to-air television. This issue was raised in our discussion paper. It was the focus of debate at Lords Committee stage and of the amendment which now forms Clause 1 of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w02_para20"></a>The Government accept the strength of public and parliamentary concern on this issue and that there is a case for additional protection for listed events. We propose at Third Reading to bring forward an amendment building on Clause 1 of the Bill as amended in Committee to guarantee the availability of live coverage of listed events for terrestrial free-to-air television and to provide for a number of measures to secure the best deal for sports bodies, broadcasters and the public. These include scope for subscription and pay-per-view services to offer alternative or fuller coverage of a listed event, supplementing terrestrial coverage to the benefit of viewers. We shall include a review mechanism to reflect the need for flexibility in the fast-moving broadcasting sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w02_para21"></a>In addition, the Government keep the list of listed events under review. One point raised in consultation was that the process of deciding on the list should be made more transparent, and that criteria should be established to act as a reference point for future decisions. The Government think that this is an interesting suggestion and will consider it further.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w02_para22"></a>The Government have also consulted on a separate proposal that broadcasting rights to any sporting event of national or local interest should be "unbundled", so that a broadcaster with exclusive rights will be obliged to license rights to recorded or radio coverage to general reception broadcasting services. The Government are not persuaded of the case for such a control. It would introduce an entirely new concept of very wide scope. It could have damaging financial consequences for sport. And it ignores the widespread availability of highlight and radio coverage, freely negotiated between sports bodies and broadcasters. The Government understand that the ITV Association thinks it preferable that the market should take its course within existing competition rules, and sees advantage in this approach.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w02_para23"></a>The Government understand that the Sports Council advocates a voluntary code of conduct, including an agreement by governing bodies of major spectator sports that viewers and listeners should have the widest possible access to major sporting events. The Government see attractions in this approach and invite the Sports Council to develop it with the governing bodies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="60304w03_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of the Environment   (Earl Ferrers): </B>  The Rough Sleepers Initiative, which has operated in central London since 1990, has been an outstanding example of co-operation between government and voluntary organisations to bring effective help to people in the greatest need. This partnership to tackle the problems of people sleeping rough in central London has helped thousands of people to start a new life away from the streets, and has prevented many more from having to sleep rough. When the Rough Sleepers Initiative began, voluntary sector agencies estimated that between 1,000 and 2,000 people were sleeping rough in central London. The numbers now sleeping rough in this area have fallen to around 270 on any one night. This is a tremendous achievement.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w03_para0"></a>By the end of this month, the Government will have invested over &#163;180 million through the initiative, providing at least 3,300 permanent homes, 950 short-term hostel places, 700 places in flats and houses leased from the private sector for up to three years, an annual winter shelter programme of up to 400 beds (with further emergency beds available during episodes of particularly severe weather) and, importantly, year-round outreach and resettlement work to engage people sleeping rough and to support them in moving to new accommodation.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w03_para1"></a>The White Paper, Our Future Homes: Opportunity, Choice, Responsibilities, published in June 1995, confirmed that the Government would continue a programme to help people sleeping rough in central London beyond March 1996, and would also consider assisting the development of the Rough Sleepers Initiative model in areas outside central London where rough sleeping could be demonstrated to be a major problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w03_para2"></a>In October 1995, the Government issued a consultation paper on future plans for the initiative. The paper invited views on a number of proposals for continuing the initiative in central London. It also asked local authorities outside central London to assess the extent of rough sleeping in their areas. Two hundred and fifty-eight responses to the consultation document were received.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w03_para3"></a>Following analysis of those responses, we are publishing today a strategy paper, Rough Sleepers Initiative, The Next Challenge, which sets out our plans for a third phase of the initiative over the next three years, 1996-97 to 1998-99. The emphasis of the third <P>


<a name="column_WA10"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column WA10</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>phase will be on providing extra help for the hard core of people who have been sleeping rough for considerable periods of time, often because they suffer complex problems, such as mental ill health or alcohol or drug misuse, which require special care.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w03_para4"></a>The department plans to make &#163;73 million available over the next three years to fund the third phase of the Rough Sleepers Initiative. In addition, we plan to make &#163;25 million available over the same period in grants under Section 73 of the Housing Act 1985 to voluntary sector agencies for the relief of homelessness.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w03_para5"></a>In central London, our plans for the third phase of the initiative are to fund:
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w03_para6"></a>the provision of at least 250 new homes providing permanent accommodation for people sleeping rough;
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w03_para7"></a>up to 40 beds in permanent high care accommodation for the homeless mentally ill; up to 200 new beds in hostel accommodation; continued funding for some hostel and nightshelter accommodation already funded under the initiative; ring-fencing of up to 80 beds in existing hostels (about 30 of which would be for clients with disruptive behaviour and 50 specifically for clients referred by outreach agencies); up to 30 beds in a new "wet" hostel for people sleeping rough who have drink problems; an annual programme of winter shelters for people at risk of sleeping rough during the coldest months of the year; and more effective outrech and resettlement work.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w03_para8"></a>Also, we plan to retain the Clearing House system as a means of allocating permanent accommodation until at least March 1997; and to uphold the current criteria for access to permanent accommodation (people sleeping rough or with a clear history of sleeping rough).
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w03_para9"></a>Responses to the consultation document did not provide clear, quantified evidence of a major problem with rough sleeping in any area beyond central London. Therefore, our plans for the rest of England will impact in two stages.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w03_para10"></a>First, we will extend the Rough Sleepers Initiative to Bristol, the only area outside central London where a major rough sleeping problem has been demonstrated conclusively. Bristol City Council is invited to form a consortium with voluntary sector organisations, the private sector, housing associations, the Housing Corporation, the police, health care providers and other relevant bodies. The consortium will be expected to agree a local strategy for targeting rough sleeping in Bristol, and to bid for Government resources.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w03_para11"></a>Second, we will be proposing further evaluation of the extent of rough sleeping in 23 other areas where local authorities have identified a possible problem, before deciding whether there is a need to extend the initiative further. These areas are Basingstoke, Bath, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Brighton, Cambridge, Exeter, Gloucester, Leicester, Manchester, Norwich, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Tunbridge Wells, York; <P>


<a name="column_WA11"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>and the London boroughs of Barnet, Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Richmond-upon-Thames, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w03_para12"></a>As part of the Government's strategy, the Department of Health is further developing the Homeless Mentally Ill Initiative to complement the extension of the RSI by making available &#163;2 million per year from the Mental Illness Specific Grant (MISG). This nearly doubles the &#163;2.2 million per year already spent from the MISG on this initiative, which has so far cost over &#163;20 million. The additional resources will target both the care needs of those requiring long-term high care accommodation <P>


<a name="column_WA12"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1996 : Column WA12</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and will also enable specialist staff to provide support to those with mental health problems in direct access hostels. This additional help to local authorities will enable the Government to build on the successes already achieved in central London and to develop services for homeless mentally ill people based on the lessons learned from the HMII in other centres.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w03_para13"></a>The Government are committed to ensuring that there is no necessity to sleep rough. What we are announcing today aims to achieve this.
<P>

<A NAME = "60304w03_para14"></a>Copies of the strategy paper have been placed in the Library and the Printed Paper Office. Copies of the responses may be viewed at the Department of the Environment's library.
