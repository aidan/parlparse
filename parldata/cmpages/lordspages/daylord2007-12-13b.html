Does that mean that, apart from the weighty arguments that have been received by the Government from many expert bodies, such as the BMA, the BDA, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and so on, the Government also agree with the opinion expressed by Mr Nicholas Blake QC that it would be unlawful to subject persons claiming to be minors to ionising radiation as, it appears, would have been permitted by the original draft of the rules? I thank the Government for apparently coming to the right decision about X-rays, but would it not have been better to have consulted those professional bodies of experts before publishing the draft?</p>

However, the timetable has slipped because it has taken rather longer than we expected, particularly with regard to funding and local authority funding. We are aware of the opinion of a number of learned doctors. My honourable friend Liam Byrne was invited to speak with a team of them before Christmas, and that will be part of the consultation leading to where we go from here.</p>

In about 95 per cent of cases it is within plus or minus two years, but this technique, combined with a social worker&#146;s assessment and other techniques, can narrow down the possible range of ages. It is therefore a useful tool. People sometimes use dental X-rays to try to prove their own age. They are also used by many EU countries. However, it is because of the concern that has been expressed that we are having further consultation. The technique is part of a package of measures that will enable us to identify the age of immigrants.</p>

When these are put together as a package it is very useful. We are talking about significant numbers of people coming in and claiming to be of this age. About 3,000 unaccompanied children come into the country every year and in the region of 1,000 to 2,000 people claim to be of this age. There are very serious issues here. If we put an adult into the children&#146;s arena it raises serious child protection issues when he gains access to their support, accommodation and so on. It is extremely important to try to narrow down the age.</p>

Indeed, we bend over backwards to ensure that the error tends to be the other way. That is why I am concerned about these child protection issues. The number of children who have been returned to any country is very small. We are careful not to use X-rays as the sole data, but they are useful. We are still consulting and this might not be the final outcome. We must wait until the paper comes out in the spring.</p>

As I say, in conjunction with the other methods we use, it is a useful tool. This is why we are continuing the consultation. It would be wonderful if there was a magic bullet which allowed us to identify age exactly. The cost of dealing with these people who are not children is about &#163;140 million a year&#151;which is quite a lot of money&#151;and there are also these risks to youngsters. We must push on to try to do the best we can on this.</p>

We are not fully part of the Schengen agreement. Although the EU has issued a procedures directive there is further work to be done. We have not yet decided fully that dental X-rays are the right procedure and therefore we do not think it is wise to include those EU changes in our rules at the moment. We shall have to wait until we have further consultation.</p>

The original draft of Rule 352 included the possibility of medical examinations with a view to establishing age. In the final version of Rule 352, that does not appear. The conclusion that was drawn by all the agencies was that the Government had dropped the proposal. If they go ahead with dental X-rays, do they intend to publish yet another statement of changes in the rules?</p>

It is equally key that there is broad support for international efforts. Recent polls show the majority of Afghans continue to feel that their country is headed in the right direction. Support remains high for the presence of international forces, with national approval ratings of between 60 per cent and 67 per cent in recent polls.</p>

We heard in the Statement yesterday that the international community is redoubling its efforts towards national security and front-line services. But what about individual security and the rule of law? What about access to justice and conditions in the courts and in prisons? Has the Minister seen Amnesty&#146;s report on the ISAF detainees who are being handed over to the Afghan authorities and need protection from ill treatment, torture and the general conditions in those prisons?</p>

There will never be confidence in the new democratic Government of Afghanistan if they are not able to bring justice to their people. The Afghan Government, with the support of the international community, are developing a national justice sector strategy, which sets out their priorities for the period 2008-13. There is a significant amount of international support for this strategy. Pledges were made of some $360 million, of which the UK committed $4 million, at a rule of law conference. This is well understood as a key priority in the hearts and minds campaign to which the noble Earl&#146;s Question refers.</p>

We have to face the problem that the stretch of the Afghan state has not extended over the whole of Afghanistan for a very long time, if ever, and that a number of regional lords are deeply engaged in the drugs trade and corruption.

Secondly, through ISAF&#146;s activities in targeting and attacking laboratories as well as through financial means, we can seek to identify and sanction the leaders of this trade and bring them to justice.</p>

Both have polled over several years in Afghanistan and show very high findings that 67 per cent of Afghans support the presence of international forces and that 75 per cent thought that it was a very good thing that the Taliban had been brought down by foreign forces in 2001, and so on. However, I very much agree with the noble Lord that polling should be treated with some caution in the case of Afghanistan; Afghans have also indicated in answering polls that they are reluctant to criticise the Government. But it is a nationwide poll. In that sense a lot more of the country is accessible than was the case in the NGO poll of the Senlis Council, to which I think the noble Lord refers and which we do not accept.</p>

Recently&#151;in a previous life&#151;I led a review in London on the end-of-life pathway. I came across one shocking piece of information: 58 per cent of those who approach the end of life are dying within a hospital setting, in contrast to their preferences since about 60 per cent wish to die at home with their family and loved ones. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="07121360000072"></a>Interestingly, finances have never been the main enabler in this; mostly, the enabling has been in how we integrate the different providers of that pathway.

It consists of 26,000 African Union and United Nations peacekeepers&#151;the largest number that Africa has ever volunteered. It is absolutely vital that that mission does not fail, and that we do not stand by while another genocide occurs in Africa.

The sheer scale of the loss of life makes this Africa&#146;s Great War. As the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, intimated at Questions, Darfur is the first genocide of the 21st century. The causes of conflict are many: sometimes it is naked greed and the plunder of minerals and assets, as in Congo or Sierra Leone; sometimes, in addition to minerals, oil has become a factor; and as in Sudan and increasingly in Nigeria, when this is accompanied by attempts to impose a different culture or religion, it has had calamitous results; sometimes it has been the genocide of war lords or their agents, as with the Janjaweed in Darfur; sometimes the ethnic hatred of one group against another, as with the genocide of the Tutsis by the Hutu Interahamwe militia in Rwanda or the depredations of the Lord&#146;s Resistance Army in Uganda; and sometimes local war lords and violence have been triggered by cattle raids for livestock, the stealing of territory or disputes over water, as on the Kenyan borders with Ethiopia and Somalia. Elsewhere in Africa, in countries such as Zimbabwe, corruption and the denial of political liberties conspire to set African against African with disastrous consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="07121360000101"></a>Others will speak with greater knowledge and authority on the crisis in Zimbabwe. The Government of Zimbabwe have in effect declared war on their own people. It will be years before we are able to quantify the full costs of Robert Mugabe&#146;s destruction of Zimbabwe&#146;s infrastructure. Not only agriculture, industry and commerce, but the entire health and education systems will need to be rebuilt. Compared with much of sub-Saharan Africa, Zimbabwe was well developed and exported food; now half the population of Zimbabwe depends on donor food aid. While unable to provide adequate water in the major cities, Robert Mugabe&#146;s regime allocates almost half the national budget to security and the secret police. How will Africa ever attract the inward investment necessary for sustainable development while her leaders fail to condemn such wanton destruction and such squandering of natural and human resources? Many of us are full of admiration for the forceful leadership given by the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York on the need for change in Zimbabwe.</p>

<a name="71213-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="07121360000102"></a>In many parts of the continent, the consequences of conflict may be seen in the charred remains of development projects, in the harrowed faces of refugees, and in the haunting images of the victims. Throughout Africa the proliferation of weapons has made conflict more deadly and crime easier, feeding cultures of retribution and downward spirals of violence. In addition to taking a heavy toll on human life, small arms undermine nations&#146; development. The widespread abuse of weapons deprives developing countries of the skills and talents of the victims of small arms. Small arms are the preferred tools of violence in most internal wars, coups, militia and gang rampages, government oppression and human rights abuses. They are the weapons of mass destruction. The arms are also commonly used in domestic and transnational crime. In cultures of violence and gun ownership, these weapons become symbols of power and pride, even objects of affection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="07121360000103"></a>A recent report documenting the consequences of conflict was published by Oxfam International, IANSA&#151;the International Action Network on Small Arms&#151; and Saferworld, an independent non-governmental organisation that works to prevent armed violence and to create safer communities in which people can lead peaceful and rewarding lives. The report estimates that during the 15 years up until 2005 the cost of conflict in Africa has been around $300 billion. The study, <I>Africa&#146;s Missing Billions</I>, represents the first time that analysts have estimated the overall effects of conflict on GDP across the continent.</p>

<a name="71213-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="07121360000104"></a>Along with better controls of the manufacture and sale of small arms, conflict resolution and the disarming of bands of lawless militia which prosecute these wars of attrition must surely be the single most important priority for progress and prosperity in Africa. One simply cannot sustain agriculture, industry, health and education programmes in the middle of a battlefield. On the other side of that coin, fratricide and blood letting drive people out of their homes and off their land into the often fatal status of refugees. I have seen first hand the situation in Darfur and DRC, where the conflict in the east is reaching crisis point.</p>

<a name="71213-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="07121360000105"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, when she comes to reply, will tell us the latest situation in Sake, where the United Nations forces are today in a state of virtual siege, the Government&#146;s forces having been driven back by Laurent Nkunda&#146;s troops. Four hundred thousand people are thought to have been displaced, many of them children, and violence against women is widespread.</p>

<a name="71213-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07121360000106"></a>Situations such as that in the DRC, southern Sudan, which I visited with the SPLA during the civil war, and the genocide sites which I have visited in Rwanda leave one with a sense of our impotence in failing to avert conflict. That sense was well expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, in the Question that preceded this debate. Our failure to prevent genocide in Rwanda continues to be matched by our lamentable failure to prevent genocide in Darfur.</p>

<a name="71213-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07121360000107"></a>Two weeks ago, the Secretary of State for International Development, Douglas Alexander, addressed the All-Party Group on Sudan. He described the Russian-made Antonov bombers that he had seen at El Fasha in Darfur and said that they represented,</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000616"></a>&#147;a brazenness which has been visited on the people of Darfur by Khartoum&#148;.</ul>
<a name="71213-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07121360000108"></a>He said that 2.2 million people had lost their homes, and that twice as many as that were reliant on food aid. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000617"></a>&#147;the threat of violence remains high&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000564"></a>and that it had become,</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000618"></a>&#147;more difficult for humanitarian agencies&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000565"></a>Ninety per cent of Darfur&#146;s villages have been razed to the ground while the international community has failed to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. It has impotently watched as people have been corralled and concentrated into camps in Darfur, Chad and the Central African Republic.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_332"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 332</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71213-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07121360000109"></a>At the same meeting, as I intimated during Questions a few moments ago, the Minister of State at the Foreign Office, the noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown, said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000619"></a>&#147;once force has been deployed, it is vital that its credibility is not undermined&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000566"></a>Yet the Government of Sudan continue to undermine the deployment of the UNAMID peacekeeping force by trying to dictate who will and who will not be part of it. This is matched by the failure of the international community to guarantee the provision of helicopters to enable the deployment of the force. It is due to take over in January, not six months from now. As we heard at Question Time, the logistics have still not been resolved, although the conflict has been under way for four years.</p>

<a name="71213-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07121360000110"></a>Sudan is a textbook example of what happens when you appease a dictator or dictatorial system. Two million people died in southern Sudan, and there is a real danger that, after the 18-year civil war in the south, we will slump back into further conflict. The withdrawal of the south&#146;s leaders from the national Government, the failure equitably to distribute the oil revenues, the questions left unresolved by the comprehensive peace agreement and the festering situation in the east of the country all underline the importance of credible peacemaking and enforcement.</p>

<a name="71213-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07121360000111"></a>The Government of Sudan, who, as the case of Gillian Gibbons illustrates, are past masters at manipulation. They have every good reason to assume that the world will be indifferent to their actions in Darfur; after all, they got away with butchery in southern Sudan. Why should it be any different in Darfur?</p>

<a name="71213-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07121360000112"></a>I will never forget travelling in the Torit diocese of southern Sudan with its bishop, Akio Johnson. In three raids on Ikotos, where he lived, 72 bombs obliterated his residence. The compound also housed a primary and secondary school, which were destroyed. Early-years education for south Sudan&#146;s children involves learning the difference between the engines of UN relief planes and the Antonov bombers, such as those which the Secretary of State saw in Darfur, and then running for your life. Where do the funds for these atrocities come from? As Sudan Divestment makes clear, our investments and purchase of oil provide the revenue for the purchase of arms and ammunition.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="07121360000113"></a>However, Sudan is by no means the only centre or victim of conflict. Between 1990 and 2005, 23 African nations were involved in conflict. According to research by these agencies, this is equal to the amount of money received in international aid during the same period. The study, <I>Africa&#146;s Missing Billions</I>, shows that, on average, a war, civil war or insurgency shrinks an African economy by 15 per cent. For example, during Guinea-Bissau&#146;s conflict, the projected growth rate from 1998 to 1999, without conflict, would have been 5.24 per cent, whereas the actual growth rate was a negative of 10.15 per cent.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="07121360000114"></a>In countries affected by war, the direct costs of violence, such as military expenditure or the destruction of infrastructure, pale in comparison to the indirect costs of lost opportunities. These include inflation, debt and high unemployment. In Kinshasa I visited what was once one of the finest hospitals in Africa. Congo&#146;s extraordinary wealth has been leached away  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_333"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 333</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by decades of fighting and corruption. As a result, there are no funds to repair crumbling facilities or to pay doctors and nurses. I saw incubators with premature babies in them; virtually none of the incubators worked. In the absence of beds, I saw patients lying on the floor and once pristine facilities in a catastrophic condition. I also saw many patients who were the victims of the conflict that has endlessly plagued the DRC. Rape is often used as a weapon of war and has been a major contributory factor in the spread of AIDS.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07121360000115"></a>Conflicts are costing African economies an average of $18 billion each year&#151; desperately needed money, which could solve the HIV/AIDS crisis, prevent TB and malaria or provide clean water, sanitation and education. Save the Children tells me that more than half of the 72 million children still out of primary schools live in countries affected by conflict: that is 36 million children. Save the Children says that international donors are reluctant to commit funds for education in conflict-affected countries and it describes this as a blind spot that it would like DfID to address. Hit by conflict and then denied education, children in situations of conflict deserve far greater commitment.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07121360000116"></a>The shortage of education, healthcare, food and medicines is matched by an abundance of small arms. Kalashnikovs are the most common weapon in Africa&#146;s conflicts, the most available of which is the AK47. These are weapons of mass destruction and you do not need international weapons inspectors to find them. You can see them everywhere you go, often brandished by young children. In too many parts of Africa there are too many children under arms. Ninety-five per cent of the Kalashnikov rifles used in these conflicts come from outside Africa. Until a global arms trade treaty is ratified, they will continue to do so. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us which countries continue to be the major suppliers of the arms used in Africa&#146;s conflicts. Joseph Dube, IANSA&#146;s Africa co-ordinator, said of its findings about the cost of conflict to Africa:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="07121360000589"></a>&#147;As an African, I implore all African governments and weapons-producing governments to support a strong and effective Arms Trade Treaty. Without this regulation, the cost and suffering borne by Africans will continue to be immense&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71213-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07121360000117"></a>More people, especially women and children, die from the consequences of conflict than in the fighting itself. Paul Collier, professor of economics at Oxford, says that conflict is one of the &#147;four traps&#148; that lock the &#147;bottom billion&#148; into lives of grinding poverty and stagnant or shrinking economies. One study suggests that, in a seven-year period, the net losses to agriculture alone from armed violence in Africa was more than $25 billion. Compared to countries living in peace, African countries suffering from conflict, on average, have 50 per cent more infant mortality, 15 per cent more undernourished people, life expectancy reduced by five years, 20 per cent more adult illiteracy, 2.5 times fewer doctors per patient and 12.4 per cent less food per person. The proliferation of arms in countries in conflict, from Somalia to Sudan, from Eritrea to Congo, means that arms flow across borders into more peaceful countries such as Kenya and destabilise them. The Kenyan foreign minister recently said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000620"></a>&#147;when guns get into the calculus then it becomes a recipe for disaster&#148;.</ul>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07121360000118"></a>I end on a more hopeful note. From Ghana to Kenya, from Rwanda to South Africa, many African leaders are working to create stable, peaceful and democratic societies. We should applaud them. We should also underscore the crucial role played by customary institutions in conflict resolution. In managing inter-ethnic conflict, we need further to strengthen the role of customary institutions and traditional mechanisms and ensure that the African Union and the United Nations can deal effectively and rapidly with conflict when it does arise. I hope that the Government will take seriously our obligation to ratify an arms trade treaty in 2008 when it comes before the United Nations.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="07121360000119"></a>In the century before the birth of Christ, Cicero wrote,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="07121360000590"></a>&#147;Laws are silent in times of war&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000567"></a>Nothing much has changed. Conflict is inimical to the creation of a civil society and the ability to uphold the law. In many parts of Africa enlightened leaders have recognised the truth of that. I hope that this debate will serve to reinforce the message that, without resolution of conflict, without curbing the proliferation of arms and without sustained approaches to peacemaking and peacekeeping, Africa will continue to bleed and the prospects for building a civil society where law is respected will be endangered. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

In 2005, the same committee was very optimistic about the capacity and the will of the African Union to put things right, thanks to its new Constitutive Act, which gave it the right to intervene in member states&#146; affairs in the case of grave circumstances. The EU was encouraged by that to finance and support the African peace facility. That has not worked for Sudan; if there was intervention, it was ineffective.</p>

The AU has succeeded in using its bloc in the UN to prevent any discussion of Zimbabwe, even in the Human Rights Commission, and in preventing any discussion of Zimbabwe in Commonwealth forums, despite the precedent set in the case of South Africa, which the Commonwealth continued to put on its agenda after the apartheid Government took the country out of the Commonwealth on the grounds that the people of South Africa had not voted to leave. That precedent was recognised in the Harare Commonwealth declaration

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07121360000123"></a>We are never going to solve conflict in Africa by the use of troops&#151;with small exceptions, such as Sierra Leone&#151;or even by attempts to control the inflow of arms. The Russians have always made a lot of money selling small arms; they will continue to do so. They and the Chinese will continue to sell military aircraft and arms because of their interest in African oil and minerals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="07121360000124"></a>The UN is to provide troops to back the African force in Sudan, but I have not the slightest doubt that their mandate will be to observe and not to intervene. If they had a mandate for intervention, that might be something, but it will not be. The Sudanese Government will continue to murder, rape and destroy, and we to ring our hands. Was anything said, I wonder, to the Sudanese head of state in Lisbon?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="07121360000125"></a>In a notable debate led by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, in this House in 2005, we discussed the eminently sensible Brahimi report. That made clear the serious limitations of the UN&#146;s actual capacity to be militarily effective, its lack of trained troops or institutions fit for effective action, and the need for stronger policies in the case of state failure. I do not believe the UN has moved far to create that necessary effective force. Indeed, I cannot really see how it can. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="07121360000126"></a>The UN may do its best, although apart from the admirable Anna Tibaijuka, who reported with devastating honesty on the Murambatsvina, it has not distinguished itself in Zimbabwe. Much of the money that DfID has channelled to the Zimbabwean people through UN agencies&#151;we and the Americans are very generous givers&#151;has gone straight to the Mugabe Government. In the last analysis, ways must be found to make the African Union, and SADC in particular, use its strength constructively rather than being an obstructive dog in the manger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="07121360000127"></a>We have meekly accepted NePAD&#146;s insistence that aid must be accompanied by absolute acceptance of AU policy, on the grounds that conditionality is colonialist imperialism. Why? Desmond Tutu said that there are no African rights; there are human rights. At least some of our problems in this area arise from our readiness to accept the thesis that conditionality equals political intervention.</p>

They can no longer fail to act because of a wholly dishonest policy of not listening to us&#151;and it is generally the West whose help will be needed&#151;on the ludicrous grounds that they are striking a blow for liberation.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="07121360000130"></a>We have been given a lead by the admirable most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York. Let us tell the African Union that committees and quiet diplomacy and, sadly, even an African force, are not enough if they are used to obstruct any action to save a suffering people. We should recognise the limitations of such bodies as the EU and the UN which often by their acts or failures to act obscure awkward facts and take away the individual responsibility of nations to do something. The presence of a number of UN agencies in Zimbabwe, for instance, encourages the illusion that through them the world is acting to care for people suffering under tyranny. DfID, which is one of the two major world givers of aid, does it through the UN agencies, yet those agencies, with those funds at their disposal, actually feared to act to support the victims of Murambatsvina as one of them admitted to Anna Tibaijuka and was so recorded in her report.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07121360000131"></a>We have been complicit for too long in allowing food aid to be handed out only to ZANU-PF supporters, with the knowledge of the UN. The UNHCR, when urged to set up refugee camps for Zimbabweans fleeing to South Africa, or at least to intervene on their behalf, claimed as recently as this year that they were not refugees in the accepted UN sense; they were economic migrants.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="07121360000132"></a>The UN is being exploited by the AU to prevent any discussion in that forum and to flout even the UN's own mechanism to protect human rights. The AU has replicated its success in these bullying tactics in its only-too-effective moves to keep Zimbabwe off the CHOGM agenda. I hope that a number of decent nations, including especially the Scandinavians, who of course ruthlessly colonised us in their day, will work together with the many right-minded Africans such as Moeletsi Mbeki, Pius Ncube and Anna Tibaijuka to broker and secure press freedom in Zimbabwe and promote a series of life-saving missions to help the sick and the starving at once while a truly free political climate is created by Zimbabwe's own civil society; still a potentially effective instrument to restore the rule of law. What we must not do is require the people of Zimbabwe to accept as valid the elections that have already been comprehensively rigged and in which, in any event, the millions now in the diaspora driven from their country would not be able to vote.</p>

The distressing agony of this reality of conflict is that the overwhelming majority of deaths and casualties are civilian and not military. What is the true cost of

Quite apart from the almost &#163;18 billion a year estimated by a wide cross-section of experienced NGOs, there is the grim human consequence, the psychological trauma and lasting mental damage, the widespread rape, acceleration of AIDS and the bereavement. But how is the &#163;18 billion itself calculated?</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="07121360000135"></a>There is the military expenditure; medical and rehabilitation costs; the burden on policing, private security and justice systems; care and protection of refugees and displaced people, often in neighbouring countries; damage and destruction of infrastructure and livelihood assets; reduced economic activity and adverse economic effects on adjacent countries; capital flight; damage to the tourist industry; inflation; reduced savings and investment and exports; increased debt; loss of development aid; rampant corruption and wealth transfers to the illicit economy; and damage to the education system and to public services in general.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07121360000136"></a>As the noble Lord said, it is essential to address prevention of conflict; in that, as he emphasised, conflict resolution and potential conflict resolution have to be given attention, as does the generation of economic and social hope and the engagement of the population as a whole in security sector reform. It will not be easy, as the pressures of population and land issues are compounded by water shortages and climate change. What is striking about the collective experience of a wide cross-section of frontline NGOs is their concern about the opportunist arms trade that fuels conflict and armed violence. Those responsible for that irresponsible trade should be seen and identified for what they are: greedy and cruelly cynical merchants of death.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07121360000137"></a>The UK Government and the European Union are to be commended for their stand on the issue. The European code of practice is a good start; but it is only a start. The Prime Minister&#146;s recent support for the extension of arms export laws to control extra-territorial brokering and trafficking in small arms is encouraging; but it, too, needs to go further and support the extension of controls to cover such brokering of all conventional weapons.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07121360000138"></a>There is a pressing need to ensure that in the context of the Government&#146;s review of the Export Control Act, remaining loopholes in our export controls are closed, not only to deal with the extraterritorial brokering, but also to introduce effective monitoring of the end use of UK exports and to regulate the increasingly globalised nature of the UK arms industry. More resources are therefore required for proper investigation and enforcement of all possible breaches of existing and future controls. Of course, African Governments themselves have to shoulder their share of responsibility and the 2004 Nairobi Protocol for the Prevention, Control and Reduction of Small Arms and Light Weapons, covering the Great Lakes region and the Horn of Africa, is an example of good intent. I hope that the Government will do all they can to support, strengthen and actively encourage such initiatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="07121360000139"></a>China&#146;s engagement in Africa can bring many benefits, but it has not been without disturbingly negative dimensions, not least the support of oppressive regimes  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_338"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 338</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and the blocking of UN resolutions on Darfur, as well as its arms transfers to conflict centres. Our Government favour positive relations with China. They must use any influence this provides to win China&#146;s support for long-term stability and the reduction of conflict in the African continent.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07121360000140"></a>A global arms trade treaty, effectively implemented, is an imperative for the promotion of stability and the containment of violence in Africa and beyond. The Government have done well in their work and consistent commitment to that at the United Nations and elsewhere. The unwillingness so far of our US allies to come on board must be bitterly disappointing and frustrating. The emotional belief in the right to own, buy and sell guns runs deep in the psyche of too many of our American cousins. When that is extended into the international community, it can have literally devastating consequences. I fervently hope that our Government will not lose heart&#151;they must not. Everything possible should be done to win the US to the cause and to build and strengthen the resolve of the rest of the international community.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07121360000141"></a>An arms trade treaty would provide a code reflecting existing obligations of UN member states under international law, including the UN charter, UN embargos, human rights principles and international humanitarian law. Within the UK, we need an interdepartmental commitment by trade, industry, the Treasury, FCO, DfID and, of course, No. 10 itself. The arms trade is lethal. In Africa, it fuels a brutal nightmare. In the dangerously volatile world in which we now live, it is absolute madness not to give priority to the control of this dreadful business.</p>

I would pick only two facts: first, 50 per cent of the states that have emerged from conflict lapse into conflict within five years and, secondly, at least 32 per cent, a third, of the population of Africa are affected in their countries by conflict or emergence from conflict. However, I wish to concentrate on another angle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="07121360000143"></a>If the House would bear with me, I would like to start with my recollection of an experience as the last British administrator&#151;later, when I was a Minister, President Mubarak described me as the last British imperialist&#151;when I was a district officer in Kenya. There was a crisis and a policeman reported to me that there was fighting over a water hole some 70 miles away. I went straight there with an escort and, probably rather patronisingly, summoned the two tribes who were fighting to sit under a baobab tree while I lectured in very bad Swahili that they should not fight wars. If they were to share the water hole they would find that they could all get some water. Whereupon, a man put up his hand at the back. &#147;Bwana,&#148; he said in Swahili, &#147;could I ask you a question?&#148;. I said, &#147;Yes, of course&#148;. He said, &#147;You tell us not to fight, but how is it that you in Europe have fought two world wars this century?&#148;. &#147;Of course&#148;, I said, &#147;you win&#148;. They went away rocking with laughter and shared the water.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="07121360000144"></a>I came to the conclusion, probably subjectively, that the time had come for Britain to leave Africa and her empire. I am in full support of Mbeki&#146;s approach to the problems of Africa: that there must be African solutions to African problems. It is no good anyone in Europe or Africa blaming the past. The cobwebs of the empire have now gone; colonialism is now dead and independence means taking responsibility for your own country. It is worth reminding ourselves that Mugabe obtained independence as the first leader of Zimbabwe 27 years ago. He takes full responsibility for the condition of Zimbabwe today. Ian Smith may have been the other major contributor, but Mr Mugabe carries the responsibility for the condition of his people today.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="07121360000145"></a>Africans themselves say that what they need most is leadership from Africans. All of us who know Africa can see that it is capable of producing great leaders, from Kenyatta to Mandela to Kofi Annan to Bishop Tutu. The people of that continent no longer need outdated leaders who are leaders of anti-colonial liberation wars. They need leaders who can develop their countries and can develop democracy in their countries. African leaders do great harm to our perception of them from outside the continent when they fail to condemn brutal dictators like Mugabe or Omar al-Bashir of the Sudan. It is always the people of Africa who suffer from it, not the former colonial masters.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="07121360000146"></a>The key is how Africans solve their own problems. What do they most need and want to do? Here I must commend a very remarkable book published by the British Council called <I>Under the Tree of Talki</I><I>ng: Leadership for Change in Africa</I>. It gives African views rather than European views on how they can and want to best solve their problems.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="07121360000147"></a>The Commission for Africa&#146;s executive summary report of 2005 highlighted two weaknesses in Africa over the past 50 years. The first was the capacity of African states to prevent and manage conflict and their ability to design and deliver policies. The second was accountability&#151;how well a state answers to its people. In my view, there is much that we can do&#151;either multilaterally or bilaterally&#151;to help these countries, and to help them help themselves; our experience through the Commonwealth is one illustration. However, the growing competition between China, the United States and the European Union to trade in Africa is producing dangers for its people because, if the issue of governance, accountability and human rights is forgotten in this competition, it will do the biggest possible disservice to the people of Africa&#151;it is they who will suffer.</p>

<a name="71213-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07121360000148"></a>Our approach must be to help the African nations build on success. In Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, Liberia and South Africa strong Administrations are emerging with success stories. We should encourage that and through the African Union and other nations we should demonstrate to the people of, say, Zimbabwe, Somalia, Sudan, the Congo and the Ivory Coast that it is possible to have African leaders who can lead their countries back to a better and happier condition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07121360000149"></a>I end on one particular area. We need, both in the European Union and the African Union, a positive approach to reconstruction and peace building. This

One specific issue of interest is that there is now a diaspora of Africans living outside the continent&#151;20 million have left since the Second World War. They are people with great experience and skill; their remittances back to their continent amount to exactly the same as the amount of overseas development that is given to Africa. These skills are badly needed back in Africa. I would like to see the European Union, our country and the African Union develop a plan to mobilise these people&#151;or at least some of them&#151;into a kind of peace corps of African expatriates who could help to rebuild these countries that have been devastated by conflict. After all, we have to remember that the first priority must be the people of Africa.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07121360000151"></a>It is about the Sudan that I am competent to speak in your Lordships&#146; House at first-hand. I too know what the sound of an Antonov bomber is like and when you need to dive for the hole. In January 2005 the comprehensive peace agreement was signed between the Sudan People&#146;s Liberation Movement and the ruling National Congress Party in Khartoum to try to end 21 years of war in southern Sudan. It granted southern Sudan a degree of autonomy for six years, followed by a referendum about independence. In January we shall reach the half-way mark of that timetable.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="07121360000152"></a>However, this agreement did not mark the end of conflict in southern Sudan. It was only the beginning of a process to settle the most contentious outstanding issues; issues of wealth distribution in Sudan, territorial boundaries between the north and the south, and, perhaps critically, the issue of the identity of the state and its national character, divided as it is between a lower and upper Nile area and an African people. If there is to be a sustainable peace, these issues have to be addressed in a way that can at least promise a continuing dialogue, supported by international pressure for resolution.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="07121360000153"></a>At the moment, as noble Lords know, there are fears that the Government of Sudan are seeking to divert attention from those issues by continuing to allow, if not actively to encourage, the situation in the Darfur region to escalate and the Lord&#146;s Resistance Army to continue to maraud across boundaries in southern Sudan. This draws international attention away from the crucial work of the boundary commission and the question of the proper distribution of wealth derived from the mineral resources which lie along the north-south boundary.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="07121360000154"></a>My colleague the Bishop of Sherborne has recently returned from a visit to Sudan in his capacity as the chair of our link organisation.

<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_341"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 341</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has reported to me on the conversations that he had with members of the border commission, who are taking great care to establish just where the border between north and south lies and to use local knowledge to obtain precise definitions that the rather straight lines on the old and somewhat notional maps cannot give. This consensus, worked out on the ground by talking to people and asking on which side of the boundary that tree or this river fell, can now be mapped using modern satellite techniques to establish a much more secure boundary so that, in the event of a division in the wake of the promised referendum, the question of the distribution of wealth arising from the oil can be determined equitably and held to fairly.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07121360000155"></a>More alarmingly, Bishop Thornton was informed about the reality of the non-implementation by both parties of the comprehensive peace agreement. In the words of Anthony Poggo, the Anglican Bishop of Kajo Keji in southern Sudan, who I am happy to say is my guest in the House today,</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000621"></a>&#147;the hopes of the Sudanese people are being dashed&#148;.</ul>
<a name="71213-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07121360000156"></a>The comprehensive peace agreement is the best hope for continued peace and stability in Sudan, and I believe that Her Majesty&#146;s Government must intensify their efforts to support its implementation. Pressure and support may be brought to bear in the most measured and efficient way through neutral intermediaries, such as the mediation team from a regional organisation, the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, which played an essential role in maintaining distance between the conflict parties and the supporting states during the Naivasha peace process that issued the comprehensive peace agreement.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07121360000157"></a>However it is achieved, I believe that pressure for the implementation of the CPA should be directed to achieving three ends. First, the two parties must be held accountable for non-implementation and the international signatories to the agreement must strengthen its Assessment and Evaluation Commission. Secondly, the international community must send a strong, co-ordinated message to the National Congress Party that it is legally bound by the report of the Abyei Boundary Commission and that it is expected to implement it in good faith so that the south receives its fair share of the oil revenues from this disputed region. I hope that my noble friend Lord Sandwich will be able to say more about Abyei later.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07121360000158"></a>Thirdly, the forthcoming census, elections and referendum on independence from the north could easily be triggers for conflict and must be supported and prepared for thoroughly in advance. Very little preparation has been made for free, fair and representative elections to take place in 2009. However, these elections must take place according to the timeframe of the CPA. The UK, EU and other Governments have a key role to play in supporting elections with logistical support and electoral observers. I hope that Her Majesty&#146;s Government will be able to signal in this debate their willingness to intensify their efforts to support the implementation of the CPA so that we can concentrate on the provision of education and healthcare, which are almost entirely absent in southern Sudan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07121360000159"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Luce, referred to enabling skilled people to get back into these countries and use their skills to help rebuild new worlds. With virtually no secondary schools in southern Sudan, that is an enormous challenge. Who will go back there if they cannot get education for their children? The support we give to education&#151; not just putting bricks and mortar into place but providing teachers and supporting their skills&#151;has an enormously high priority in the diocese of Salisbury.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07121360000160"></a>There are some rays of hope. For example, there is a lower than average incidence of AIDS in southern Sudan because the roads have been impassable and the bridges are down so the truckers have not been able to get through. What are we learning about how to do educational programmes to support the medical and health education needed in southern Sudan? Appropriate support at this stage by the wider community would go a long way towards ensuring the planned and sustainable development of the region, which has such enormous potential. It is a part of Africa where some of this is within our grasp. I hope that Her Majesty&#146;s Government will do everything they can to support these processes lest the hopes of the people of Sudan are dashed yet again.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07121360000163"></a>Mugabe claims that he is fighting against Britain, but he is not; he is fighting against his own people. Our role was to end the war of independence and to arrange the elections that put Mugabe into power. He makes two allegations against us: neo-colonialism and that our sanctions have caused the appalling economic condition of Zimbabwe. Both charges are ridiculous. The &#147;sanctions&#148; are not sanctions, but targeted measures, and it is not likely that they have caused the inflation in Zimbabwe which, according to the latest report that I saw today, has now reached a rate of 14,840 per cent. So good is Mugabe&#146;s spin that it seems he has convinced a majority of the leaders of the SADC countries of what he is saying. The three principal African treaties have been breached by Mugabe, but the SADC leaders appear to be unaware of that&#151;at least they do not refer to it. The effects of the economic situation in Zimbabwe are horrifying. One-third of the population has fled, especially the best qualified people and young people who were born after 1980, when Mugabe came to power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07121360000164"></a>On 11 March, a prayer meeting in Harare was violently broken up by the police and the military. That shocked even the leaders of SADC and led them to give a mandate to President Mbeki of South Africa to facilitate negotiations between the opposition and Mugabe. That was accompanied by a police warning to the MDC opposition, who are entirely peaceful, not to cause any trouble. No such warning was given to Mugabe, who has been causing turmoil among the opposition by the beatings and the intimidation of all sorts that he was conducting before that event and which have continued until now. Mugabe is preparing for elections with the usual measures that he has used in the past. The latest one&#151;which is new, so far as I know&#151;is that 4 trillion Zimbabwe dollars have been set aside as a fund available to Mugabe in preparation for the elections. We can imagine that it will be used to persuade voters&#151;so far as they need persuading, given the violence that has been going on&#151;to vote for Mugabe.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="07121360000165"></a>Is there any ray of light on the horizon? Four representatives of the European Union recently made speeches in Lisbon that criticised Mugabe. I do not remember other members of the European Union often criticising him, so that is a step forward. In a few days there will be an election for the next president of the ANC in South Africa. It could be quite important if it leads to the election of Zuma, who is a robust character compared to President Mbeki. His history is not entirely without blemish, but it is possible that he will be much more active in pursuing peace in Zimbabwe than President Mbeki has been. Kofi Annan recently made an important speech&#151;the Nelson Mandela lecture&#151;in which he cited Zimbabwe as one of the crises in the world that the United Nations should pay attention to. He said that Africa is particularly crying out for resolute action by fellow Africans. That was with particular reference to Zimbabwe, so one or two straws are beginning to blow in a light wind. However, we cannot regard the end of Mugabe as being likely soon. We have to bear in mind also that his mother lived to 100, and he is only 84. An end could be put to the problem if the SADC leaders got together with a powerful president of SADC in the form of Zuma, if he wins.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07121360000168"></a>Since entering Parliament in 1992, I have taken every opportunity to visit Africa to learn more about that fascinating continent. There is no doubt that there are some good countries and that there are others which are not succeeding. There are many still suffering the after effects of conflicts which have ended; there are others where conflicts are taking place today&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Alton, told us about those; and there are others where future potential conflicts are bubbling under the surface.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07121360000169"></a>The recent report to which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred, <I>Africa&#146;s missing billions</I>, was published in October. It is a sobering document and I recommend it to all noble Lords. Armed conflict costs Africa $18 billion a year and $300 billion has been lost by 23 countries since 1990. Those 23 countries are: Algeria, Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Republic of Congo, C&#244;te d&#146;Ivoire, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan and Uganda. It is a catalogue of shame, but some countries are not on that list.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="07121360000170"></a>I am patron of the Kambia Hospital Appeal in my former constituency of Cheltenham. This is a link between Cheltenham General Hospital and the Kambia area of north-east Sierra Leone. The population served by the hospital there is more than 100,000 and it is a little more than a large shed&#151;or, rather, it was little more than a large shed because during the civil war in Sierra Leone rebels looted anything worth taking and set fire to the buildings. Now, some years later, thanks to the European Commission and our Cheltenham appeal, there is a new hospital. So the consequences of the civil war in Sierra Leone resulted in European taxpayers picking up the cost of reconstruction.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="07121360000171"></a>I also went to Sierra Leone in 2002 to monitor the first elections shortly after the civil war ended. It was the most difficult visit I have ever experienced in Africa. Perhaps because it was an EU observer mission they sent me, a British MP, to a former rebel-held area in Kabala&#151;&#147;We&#146;ll teach these Brits&#148;&#151;and it was really difficult. Most of the buildings had no roof; there was no electricity supply because the electricity pylons had no cables; and there was no water supply. Each day, a UN wagon turned up which contained a liquid that they called &#147;water&#148;. It was either green with brown bits floating in it or brown with green bits floating in it and we used it to flush the toilet. Residents of Kabala asked us if they could have some of our water to take home to cook with and drink. It was a terrible experience. So the consequences of civil war are bad. As the noble Lord, Lord Alton, described, the consequences in Sudan and Darfur are truly terrible.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="07121360000172"></a>The countries neighbouring conflict areas suffer economically because of reduced trade, political insecurity and an influx of refugees. I visited Burundi in September with an Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation. Burundi lost 37 per cent of GDP during its 13-year, savage civil war. This was more than Rwanda, although the conflict there received more widespread international coverage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="07121360000173"></a>In the report to which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, introduced us, there is a snapshot entitled, &#147;<I>The cost of a bullet</I>&#148;. It states that:</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000622"></a>&#147;a surgeon from Kenya tells the story of a 17 year-old Congolese boy whose jaw was shattered by a bullet. The son of a diamond prospector, he was shot by rebel soldiers who thought he had diamonds. It took him one year to raise the money from friends and family to have it treated. During this time, he kept his disfigured mouth covered. He travelled 3,000km to Nairobi for the operation to insert a steel plate into his jaw, which took nine hours and cost $6,000.</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="07121360000591"></a>The cost of the operation is equivalent to a year of primary education for 100 children, or full immunisations for 250 children, or 1.5 years of education for a medical student&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000568"></a>That is the cost of one bullet.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07121360000174"></a>Tourism is important to Africa. The report contains a snapshot on tourism which states that:</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000623"></a>&#147;the continent&#146;s share of global tourism revenues is twice its share of global GDP. It is an essential source of foreign exchange to many countries, and for Kenya the largest source.</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="07121360000592"></a>However, armed violence deters millions of potential visitors. The chief director at South African Tourism admitted that the reality and reputation of South Africa as a country beset by gun crime had lost it 22 million visitors in five years&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71213-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07121360000175"></a>There is no doubt that Africa will continue to have conflicts in the foreseeable future. Many countries have had bad rulers, and corruption, the misuse of resources and conflict have cost Africa dear. In the 21st century the continent must put that legacy into the past and build good countries for the future. It will need our help.</p>

Like the right reverend Prelate, I shall focus on Sudan, the site of Africa&#146;s longest-running conflict.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07121360000177"></a>The comprehensive peace agreement&#151;the CPA&#151;of 2005 has brought some welcome relief from the war waged by the National Islamic Front regime against the peoples of southern Sudan and marginalised areas such as the Nuba mountains, Abyei and Southern Blue Nile&#151;but not before 2 million people perished and 4 million were displaced. As my noble friend Lord Alton reminded us, this toll of human suffering was inflicted before the horrors of Darfur began to unfold, culminating in a continuing genocide in which at least 200,000 have been killed and a further 2 million displaced.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07121360000178"></a>The current situation is acutely disturbing in at least three ways: the possibility of eruption of further war in the south; the recent disintegration of the Government of National Unity; and the continuing lack of co-operation by Khartoum, preventing effective intervention by the international community in Darfur. Therefore we must welcome the initiative this week to bring the CPA back on track, with the two sides reaching agreement on all issues except Abyei. This may, indeed, be a ray of hope on the dark horizon, although everyone must be well aware that Sudan&#146;s President al-Bashir and his National Congress Party&#151;the NCP&#151;have reneged on every agreement to date.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07121360000179"></a>Therefore, while we welcome this development, we must do so on the basis of the principle, &#147;Trust but verify&#148;. It is essential that there is effective supervision  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_346"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 346</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and monitoring of every aspect of the agreement. Therefore I ask the Minister whether Her Majesty&#146;s Government will use their influence to ensure that such monitoring is implemented and to indicate that failure to honour this agreement by either side will trigger powerful sanctions. This is particularly important given the continued deployment of large numbers of troops in strategic locations, where the scene is set for a potential imminent resumption of war. Indeed, the last time I was in southern Sudan, the talk was, very reluctantly, not about if war would start again, but when. This is entirely understandable.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07121360000180"></a>Khartoum has also reneged on its obligations to supply resources to the south so that urgent, essential reconstruction and rehabilitation have been impeded and the condition of the people is, in many places, little better under the new Administration than it was previously. It is widely believed that this restriction of resources is a ploy by Khartoum to create such disaffection in the south that, when the referendum for self-determination comes, the people will have no incentive to vote for independence.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="07121360000181"></a>Like other noble Lords, I have seen the plight of the people. There is obvious relief that the peace agreement has brought a cessation of fighting, including the incessant aerial bombardment by Khartoum, with Antonovs dropping their bombs, often targeted at health centres, feeding centres and schools, and terrifying attacks by low-flying helicopter gunships. These were diverted to Darfur and have since been inflicting their terror and carnage there.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="07121360000182"></a>But we have also seen in the south how people are still suffering and dying from diseases for which treatment should now be available. In Equatoria, in rural areas, we have seen preventable, treatable diseases such as meningitis, measles and malaria killing people on a huge scale. In eastern Upper Nile earlier this year, we found leprosy, possibly of pandemic proportions.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07121360000183"></a>These problems help to explain why the leadership and the people in the south are feeling so desperate. There are also indications of the lack of good faith on the part of the northern leadership, with regard to not only the CPA but Darfur. President Omar al-Bashir, whose Government are widely believed to be instigating atrocities in Darfur, has consistently refused to allow a sufficient number of peacekeepers or military assets to protect civilians. But without an effectively equipped peacekeeping force, the assaults on human dignity&#151;the executions, rapes and ethnic cleansing&#151;will continue, as the noble Baroness, Lady Park, has emphasised.</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07121360000184"></a>What efforts are being made by Her Majesty&#146;s Government to support the United Nations in the provision of all resources essential for an effective peacekeeping force for Darfur, and what representations are they making to Khartoum to ensure effective compliance with the requirements of the UN for deployment of the peacekeeping forces?</p>

<a name="71213-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="07121360000185"></a>The debacle over the teacher and the teddy bear is a further indication of the bankruptcy of British policy vis- -vis the Islamist regime in Khartoum. A leader in the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> on 4 December summarised the situation:</p>

<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_347"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 347</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>holding one of its citizens to ransom speaks of the impunity with which it believes it can operate in the world ... Mr Bashir, who has been responsible for some of the worst atrocities in post-war history, has successfully blocked the deployment of peacekeeping forces that would protect Darfur citizens. It is that failure of international resolve which encourages him to believe that he can flout moral and diplomatic conventions. As we argued last week, we should recall our ambassador and consider sanctions against the regime&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000569"></a>Indeed, many of us have long been urging Her Majesty&#146;s Government to do just this. I therefore ask precisely what representations were made to Khartoum over the totally inappropriate treatment of the British schoolteacher.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="07121360000186"></a>The issues of Darfur&#151;particularly Khartoum&#146;s intransigence and continued aggression&#151;and the growing tension in the south are connected. There is a fear among experts that al-Bashir will exploit the weakness and indecision of the international community regarding Darfur to deliver a decisive defeat to the south as soon as possible. Strong voices in the uppermost circles of Khartoum now recommend this line of action to solve all the other outstanding problems by &#147;resolving&#148; the unfinished campaign in the south. The enduring instability in the vital Abyei area can provide Khartoum with many excuses for violating the recent agreement to revive the CPA. It is therefore very important to signal to Khartoum that the outside world is most interested in the sustenance and completion of the CPA. I hope that the Minister will give reassurances that Her Majesty&#146;s Government will adopt appropriately robust responses to any deviation by Khartoum from the CPA, or to any failure to provide full co-operation for peacekeeping initiatives in Darfur. I also hope that the Minister will give some assurance of adequate succour for the victims of Sudan&#146;s longest-running conflict. They will be deeply interested in the Minister&#146;s reply, and I hope that it will bring them some comfort.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="07121360000188"></a>Since other Peers have spoken about the consequences of conflict, which are well known anyway, I want to concentrate on, first, why conflicts occur and, secondly, what we should do about them. In discussing conflicts in Africa, we must avoid two mistakes. There is a tendency to think that it is a conflict-ridden continent, that conflicts have been there ever since the independence of various countries and that nothing can be done about them. That is not entirely accurate. Conflicts have ebbed and flowed. They peaked in 1991 and then fell. They rose again to 1991 levels in 1998, and they have been falling ever since. Between 2002 and 2005, conflicts in Africa declined by 15 per cent. It is also striking that more and more wars have ended in negotiated settlements, instead of being fought to the end.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="07121360000189"></a>The second point is that conflicts in Africa are of three kinds. There are conflicts between countries, conflicts within countries and conflicts that are a mixture of both. They either develop indigenously and then spill over, or they begin outside the borders  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_348"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 348</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of these countries and have their consequences within them. It is important to bear in mind that these conflicts have different causes. To homogenise them and assume that they all arise in the same way and can be solved by the same magic wand would be a grave mistake. Therefore, I want to highlight some general factors that seem to characterise all these conflicts, albeit in different forms.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="07121360000190"></a>The first factor is the ethnic and religious discrimination in most of these countries. It is striking&#151;all the statistics show it&#151;that those countries that practise ethnic and religious discrimination are 10 times more likely to have wars than those that do not. It is also striking that states that practise ethnic and religious discrimination are five times more likely to fail than those that do not. Therefore, the first problem to address is the question of ethnic and religious discrimination.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07121360000191"></a>The second factor is the easy availability of arms. There are as many as 500 million small and large arms freely available.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07121360000192"></a>The third problem is bad governance. One must bear in mind that in Africa, once you are out of power, you are nothing. You can be harassed, persecuted and deprived of all your rights. Therefore, the only alternatives for those who are discriminated against are to keep fighting or to surrender, in which case they will suffer all the consequences at the hands of those in power. They are simply left with no rational choice to enter into any peaceful negotiations.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07121360000193"></a>The other source of conflict is the ease with which people&#151;rulers in particular&#151;are able to plunder national resources and siphon off money abroad. It is also striking that wars, both civil and international, are more likely in those countries where Governments are able to borrow vast sums from international institutions and bankers in the name of the country. A ruler has a constant temptation to plunder resources, and political power gives him access to them. It is striking that Nigeria&#146;s military leaders left a debt of $30 billion, which is 80 per cent of the GNP, and absolutely nothing could be done about it.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07121360000194"></a>The final factor that causes, or at least aggravates, wars is external interference. This was the case during the Cold War, when one country was played off against another. There is a danger of something similar happening, if we are not careful, with China being actively involved in Africa and we ourselves thinking that we must do everything in our power to stop this, as we did with the Soviet Union. Even if countries do not get involved, multinationals always want to play off one group against another and create conflicts.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07121360000195"></a>This is, briefly, why I think conflicts occur. The question is what we do about them. The first and most important step is to make sure that Africa develops economically. Unless there is a large middle class, and ordinary people have a stake in the country, wars will continue. It is sad and self-contradictory that we talk a great deal about preventing conflicts and do little to provide Africa with sensible terms of trade, or help with economic development. The second important step is to encourage civil society in Africa. Civil society has a greater chance of success if there are sensible international mediators, if conflicts  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_349"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 349</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are anticipated in advance, before they appear on the horizon, and if women are involved. It is striking that where women have been involved in negotiating conflict settlements, wars tend to end about six years earlier than they otherwise do; we might have some lessons to learn here, too. Also, when religious leaders are involved, situations are easier to control.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07121360000196"></a>The third important thing to bear in mind is that many of these conflicts have exogenous sources&#151;they arise outside the country and spill over into it. It is extremely important to ensure regional co-operation, as the Great Lakes regional summits have done from time to time. Finally, we must tackle the situation in certain countries where one can get into a position of power, plunder national resources, get kick-backs and siphon off money abroad, or borrow money legitimately from international institutions. It is very important that there should be internationally agreed restrictions on the borrowing privileges of unelected military leaders in those countries. It is also important that their right to dispose of national resources must be severely restricted. It is equally important, in this context, to track the movement of money from African countries to others and the ultimately disgraceful practice of secret Swiss bank accounts. The time has come to put an end to that. It has more to account for in terms of human bloodshed than almost anything else I can think of.</p>

Africa is rich in natural resources yet remains among the poorest continents in the world. Much of my speech is based on the extensive work carried out by Oxfam, IANSA, Safeworld and Save the Children.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="07121360000198"></a>As the noble Lord said, the report estimates that the economic cost of armed conflict in Africa&#146;s development has been about $300 billion since 1990, money which could have helped solve problems such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, addressed Africa&#146;s needs in education, clean water and sanitation and helped towards preventing diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. The report also estimates that some 95 per cent of Africa's most commonly used weapons come from outside the continent, the most common being the Kalashnikov assault rifle, in particular the AK47, a light rifle readily used by child soldiers, a point that I will return to. Of course some African nations have made significant efforts towards arms control, but there is an urgent need to reduce the international supply of arms and ammunition into Africa, otherwise the cost of African development will be measured not only monetarily but in lives shattered and opportunities squandered. About 40 per cent of the world's conflicts are fought in Africa, conflicts that prevent development and that keep the world's poorest continent poor, confining people to a life of poverty and shrinking economies.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="07121360000199"></a>There are huge intangible costs&#151;and here I return to my earlier remarks on child soldiers. Save the Children reports that most child soldiers are abducted or coerced into volunteering to become soldiers. Resistance often  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_350"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 350</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>means torture or death to them or their families. It reports that, in 2005, more than 8,000 children were still fighting in west Africa, with up to 20,000 more child soldiers waiting to be released. Approximately 300,000 child soldiers are used around the world, with numbers on the increase, not decrease. That is despite the Cape Town principles set down in 1997 by the international community&#151;strict guidelines to eradicate the use of child soldiers and to protect children released from service, children who were subjected to brutal intimidation. Children who have no access to school or healthcare are exposed to abuse and exploitation beyond our imagination. Ex-child soldiers, once released, often find themselves rejected by society. They are refused access to education and find it near impossible to re-enter normal life.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07121360000200"></a>On 5 February 2007, the international community established new guidelines. Johanna MacVeigh, an adviser to Save the Children, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="07121360000594"></a>&#147;Being recruited by armed forces has a devastating effect on children's lives. They are immersed in violence, are subject to terrible abuse and are forced to forfeit love, play, education and hope. Governments and the United Nations must show their support and commit to stamping out the use of child soldiers&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71213-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07121360000201"></a>The plight of young girls is even more horrific. They face sexual abuse, physical abuse, and then the prospect of rejection by their families. They have to live with the scars left of both physical and emotional abuse inflicted on them by grown men. I recently watched a film called &#147;Blood Diamond&#148;. It was based on true events in Africa, graphically portraying the ugly, violent and tortuous way in which innocence is sucked out of the lives of young children and how easily that is replaced with behaviour devoid of any emotional responsibility towards another human being.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07121360000202"></a>The United Kingdom announced that it would double its support to the African Development Fund over the next three years. I hope that the Minister can tell us whether projects will be funded to look at the rehabilitation of child soldiers and young girls who have suffered abuse. Can she also say what progress African nations are making in achieving the millennium development goals and whether the progress to date looks promising? Unless progress is made in achieving gender balance in both civil and public life in the African continent then changes affecting the plight of women and the implications for the lives of children, particularly girls, will remain a serious issue. When increasing funding levels to Africa, will special attention be paid to empowering women&#146;s organisations so that they can participate more fully in the decision-making process of their nations? Is there any tangible evidence to show that real progress is being made to address gender issues, and are all African nations signed up to implementing real changes?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="07121360000203"></a>I look forward to the Minister's response. I am pretty certain that we will revisit this enormously important subject again and again. As we all recognise, the stability and economic success of this region has huge compounding consequences for the rest of the world. In last week's debate on Kenya I argued that the key to success for Africa was to make the continent economically strong and that, to achieve that, our emphasis should be as much on trade as on providing aid. Although I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Luce,

<a name="07121360000204"></a><b><a name="71213-0005.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07121360000783"></a>The Earl of Sandwich:</b> My Lords, I thank my noble friend very warmly. He speaks with passion, especially about Darfur, a word which is almost synonymous with conflict in Africa. However, Abyei, in neighbouring Kordofan, threatens to become another household word if the right action is not taken in time to prevent another conflagration.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07121360000205"></a>The history is important, and the right reverend Prelate and the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, have already set the scene. Abyei straddles the border of north and south, the home of the Ngok Dinka people, and is bordered to the north by two sections of the Misseriya cattle herdsmen who have claimed a customary right to graze their animals down to the Bahr el-Arab and other shifting tributaries of the White Nile. It was only in 1905 that Britain brought nine Dinka chiefdoms in Abyei within the borders of Kordofan, setting a fuse for the conflict which broke out after Sudan's independence half a century later.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07121360000206"></a>This dispute should have been settled by the Addis Ababa agreement of 1975, but instead Ngok Dinka became the spearhead of the powerful Anya-Nya II movement, which led to the formation of the SPLA. The Misseriya, meanwhile, raided Dinka villages and enslaved their women in their well known government-backed offensives against the SPLA. The Machakos Protocol of 2002 again postponed the problem, leaving Abyei in the north and excluding it from the prospect of a referendum and self-determination in the south. Abyei from then on became one of the &#147;three areas&#148; separately negotiated and was one of the main causes of delay in the painstaking negotiations that led to the CPA.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07121360000207"></a>The Abyei deadlock seemed to be broken at Naivasha in 2004, with the help of US Senator Danforth, when the Abyei Protocol was conceived as a means of creating a special administrative status for Abyei, and yet again the CPA itself was signed without agreement in those important areas.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07121360000208"></a>The presence of some of Sudan&#146;s most important oilfields has naturally aggravated the dispute, because the revenue, instead of benefiting the people, has been withheld entirely until the boundary is settled. The Abyei boundary commission in a sense revived the pre-1905 boundary by bringing the nine chiefdoms back into the south within a territory still to be defined. This logical solution has been bitterly opposed by the National Congress Party. It seems an intractable issue and will require a much greater international effort to resolve it.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07121360000209"></a>I think that the UN can be seen at its best in this part of Sudan, where demilitarisation and disarmament under the CPA is edging forward on many fronts despite the dissatisfaction on both sides. The SPLA, meanwhile, complains quite reasonably that guarding oilfields cannot explain the vast numbers of government

The special representative of the Secretary-General has given the UN a new impetus and UNMIS is working overtime towards an agreement, and it has achieved success with confidence-building initiatives and workshops involving civil society.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07121360000210"></a>As my noble friend Lady Cox said, there has been sabre-rattling partly because the Government had not accepted UNMIS's jurisdiction north of Abyei. However, the Ceasefire Joint Military Committee has had some success in defusing conflict and the local monitoring committee has now agreed to lift restrictions on the movement of UNMIS north and south of Abyei.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="07121360000211"></a>If we are looking for comprehensive causes of conflict we should include climate change and especially water shortage, whose effect is to drive both pastoral and nomadic tribes, who have traditionally shared resources, into competition at certain times of the year which can be desperate. Abyei and many areas of southern Sudan which were models of racial harmony in the past have become areas of tension, aggravated by recent memories of slaughter during the civil war.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07121360000212"></a>As in Nigeria, the presence of foreign oil companies, however carefully they tread, is bound to make these situations even more explosive if they are not seen to bring direct benefits to the population. I had personal experience of Chevron's activities during a visit to Upper Nile in the early 1980s, and I recall their managers' genuine interest in the welfare of local people. They also drilled successfully in Abyei at that time but they had to work with President Nimeiri, who created his own oil boundary in forming the unity state at Bentu, in 1980. They left soon afterwards and since then the general lack of security throughout the oilfields has further separated the companies from the communities.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07121360000213"></a>Only four years ago about one-quarter of national oil supplies were coming from Abyei but production has since steeply declined. The National Petroleum Commission dominates control of oil resources and the SPLM are hardly involved in the discussions. The south theoretically receives 45 per cent of the revenue, and the Dinka, the Misseriya and the provincial Governments are supposed to receive 2 per cent each. The International Crisis Group has estimated that each 2 per cent would work out at $36 million in 2005-07. Such a contribution paid out now would build up good will and make a huge difference to negotiations on the ground.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07121360000214"></a>How can we help? What is Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s response to the ICG's suggestion that the UN should create a demilitarised zone at Abyei until this conflict is settled? What about the constitutional court? Does the Minister favour that route? Finally, is the Minister aware of the concern among some NGOs about the effectiveness of the pooled funding mechanisms and the speed at which funds can be disbursed through the non-governmental organisations? I have great admiration for those who have to work with the details of conflict resolution in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. I know that the Government have such experts, whom we must use, and I know that the Minister will reflect their opinions today.</p>

<a name="07121360000215"></a><b><a name="71213-0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07121360000784"></a>Lord Sheikh:</b> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, on initiating the debate and on his excellent presentation.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07121360000216"></a>The subject is very broad and we do not have time to talk about the details of any particular country. I wish, therefore, to make general comments. During recent history, Africa has experienced significant turmoil, upheaval and war. That ranges from large conflicts including the problems in Darfur and the statelessness of Somalia, to the smaller, more localised problems including the turbulence in the north-east of Kenya involving disputes between different tribal groups.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07121360000217"></a>Africa is a vast continent comprising hundreds of distinct ethnic groups with complex histories. Therefore, the continent has witnessed conflicts of tremendous diversity in nature, size and scope, including struggles for independence, civil war, tribal conflict, genocide and terrorist attacks. All this means that it can be difficult to draw broad conclusions about the causes and consequences of these conflicts. Having said that, it appears possible to draw a clear link between conflict in Africa and poverty. Poor economic development can be seen as both a cause and a consequence of conflict. Conflict can quickly cause inflation, debt, reduced investment and unemployment.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07121360000218"></a>Poverty, in its many facets, can create social discontentment which in turn can create an environment more prone to conflict. Poverty, and specifically financial inequality within a society, can be exploited by leaders to mobilise followers and legitimate violent actions. Thus the nature of the problem goes in a cycle. Poverty results in conflict and conflict results in further poverty. There are also reasons to relate conflict to the absence of good governance. Weak government institutions, a lack of transparency and poor adherence to democratic principles all predispose a state to conflict. The ideas developed by Immanuel Kant in his essay, <I>Perpetual Peace</I>, in 1795 have since evolved into the theory that democracies rarely fight or go to war. It could be suggested that the absence or weakness of democracy in certain African states has led to conflict and war.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07121360000219"></a>Furthermore, conflicts have arisen from the failure of leaders to relinquish power, resulting in military coups and other attempts to seize power. The example set in 1991 by Kenneth Kaunda in Zambia, who gave up power, needs to be repeated in states where unpopular leaders, such as Mugabe, cling to power. In the spirit of working with Africa as a partner, I would like to see Africa solving African problems, through an empowered African Union, albeit working with strong support from the international community. I feel this is probably the best way to deal with problems in Darfur.</p>

<a name="71213-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07121360000220"></a>The implementation of an international arms trade treaty would represent an important step forward in preventing tomorrow&#146;s crises in Africa becoming violent conflicts. Ninety-five per cent of the small arms in use in Africa were made outside the continent and ensuring tighter global controls on the sale and movement of such weapons would help to stem their flow into Africa, where they fuel conflicts and cause untold damage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07121360000221"></a>If Africa is to become a peaceful, stable and secure continent, we need to show support to countries recently emerging from conflicts, otherwise those countries may slip back into a cycle of violence and conflict. Conflict resolutions are therefore very important. I would like to take this opportunity to remind us all of China's heavy involvement in Africa. The concern is that the numerous projects and financial aid packages funded by China seem to be unrelated to any requirements for good governance.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07121360000222"></a>However, we are pleased to note that the EU remains the largest donor to Africa and that there seems to be a shift away from projects for Africa towards a more mature partnership involving projects with Africa. This method is to be commended as it represents a stronger and more responsible solution for obtaining peace and development in Africa. I am pleased that, despite problems connected with Mr Mugabe, the EU-Africa summit was held last week in Lisbon.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07121360000223"></a>A major challenge facing Africa as a continent is climate change, the effects of which could stoke new conflicts in the continent in the years to come. There are predictions from some scientists that the continent will have 25 per cent less water by the end of the century. This points towards an increasingly bleak scenario for certain areas of Africa, in which the availability of water will decrease and there will be a reduction in viable agricultural land and an increase in food shortages, possibly leading to conflict. We all appreciate that the problem of climate change needs to be tackled globally, but I am very pleased that we have taken the initiative and are discussing the Climate Change Bill.</p>

Others have talked about governmental and strategic issues; I want to talk more on the local level about a single topic, health, which I hope will complement what others have said. Health is an area where, I believe, more action is possible. I will make my remarks about, first, the impact of conflict on health; then on the support that health can give in dealing with the aftermath; and, finally, on preventing conflict in the first place.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07121360000225"></a>On the impact, the noble Lord, Lord Alton, began our debate by telling us that awful story about Kinshasa hospital. Others have commented on the impact of conflict on health. I want to pull out two aspects that I think have not yet been mentioned. One is the long-term nature of the damage done; for instance, if a child does not get appropriate nutrition early in life, there will be impacts on the development of the brain and the rest of the body. Therefore, in the longer term, if a community contains many such people, there is less ability to develop that society economically. That is a real, long-term impact on individuals.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07121360000226"></a>Secondly, there is another long-term economic impact. Before conflict, Liberia had something like 500 doctors&#151;not very many. After conflict, it had about 75. It was also observed that, as more doctors were brought into Liberia, inflation on salaries was not 1,000 per cent  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_355"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 355</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but 1,000 times their salaries. We have therefore seen inflation and changes in costs in Liberia having knock-on effects elsewhere. So, my first point is that impacts can be very long-term, and they therefore need action that is sustained over the long term.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07121360000227"></a>On dealing with the aftermath of conflict, the UK can do&#151;and already does&#151;an enormous amount. It can do that practically to support local people. I certainly take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Luce, that it will be Africans who solve Africa&#146;s problems, but that does not mean that we cannot be there in support, providing help through respectful partnerships based on trust. As a simple example, the King&#146;s College NHS trust here in London has, since 2000, been partnered with Somaliland. Over that period, something like 90 people from that trust have gone for various periods to work with partners in Somaliland. They are starting to have a real impact: this year, for the first time in 20 years, medical students graduated in Somaliland. I could give other examples of partnerships; there is the Cheltenham link with Sierra Leone that was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Jones. It is interesting to note that these volunteers are going to work in countries with such difficult circumstances.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07121360000228"></a>Earlier this year, I published a report for the then Prime Minister on what more the UK could do to support such person-to-person or institution-to-institution partnerships. I am yet awaiting a government response, so I will take this opportunity to ask two specific questions. First, do the Government support and value that sort of capacity-building partnership in the aftermath of conflict, or in developing countries in any case? Secondly, the Government give no significant financial support there, so will they do so in future? There is much more that we can do to mobilise the terrific goodwill in this country to support such people. This is about people-to-people partnerships; we should pause to salute the many people who take on those difficult and daunting responsibilities. Health, with other actions, is thus a key part of development.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07121360000229"></a>I will move briefly to prevention, with two examples. The first is of eight countries from west Africa, a sub-region that has been devastated by ongoing civil conflict. As a result, populations have been dispersed and infrastructure has collapsed. As a means to break the cycle and provide a stabilising influence on security in that sub-region, as well as addressing the crisis in healthcare provision, the ministries of health in those eight countries met in August 2001 and developed the &#147;Health for Peace&#148; initiative. That was designed so that they would work together&#151;they are, generally, small countries&#151;with different countries taking the lead on different aspects of health, which provides a common ground. I should declare an interest as chairman of Sightsavers International, one of the British organisations that have been playing the lead role in eye health in that region.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07121360000230"></a>West Africa is not the only example. I am indebted to Ingrid Stellmacher of the International Commission of Peace for drawing my attention to many others around the world, not just in Africa, where health has, in many places,</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000624"></a>&#147;provided a platform to build cultural bridges and social cohesion ... Health care professionals and the accompanying

<p><a name="07121360000570"></a>She has also observed to me that, in many places, hospitals or health facilities are relatively neutral grounds where communities can come together.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07121360000231"></a>Finally, health is a basic human need. We need to see it as a much greater part of the whole development process, and in terms of the practical things that can be done to bring people together at both individual and community levels. I believe that paying more attention to health can play a big role in conflict prevention, during conflict and, of course, in rehabilitation.</p>

I should at the outset declare an interest, as for the past 12 years my wife and I have worked on a hospital ship in most of the countries of west Africa under the auspices of the charity Mercy Ships. We have seen at close quarters the appalling results of conflict&#151;especially in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which have been torn apart by civil war.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07121360000233"></a>There, rebel soldiers would invade a village, round up the children and ask each one, &#147;Are you left- or right-handed?&#148;. If a child said &#147;Right-handed&#148;, the rebels would amputate the right hand. The children became wise to this, so if they were right-handed they would say that they were left-handed. That hand would then be amputated, but at least they were left with their more useful hand. The fate of the adults was even worse. The women were repeatedly raped and often killed, and the men killed in their hundreds. </p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07121360000234"></a>Then there was Salamatu, a 19 year-old married lady in Sierra Leone with a young baby. The rebels surrounded her village, murdered her father and took her into the bush. They forced her to choose her fate by making her pick up one of three pieces of paper. On one was written, &#147;Hands and feet&#148;; on another &#147;Feet and waist&#148;, and on the third &#147;Hands and waist&#148;. Not knowing the significance, she picked up the paper with &#147;Feet and waist&#148; on it. The rebels promptly amputated both feet and her buttocks with a machete, cheering as pieces of her body fell to the ground.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07121360000235"></a>In spite of all those disasters, and the death of her husband a few years later, she eventually made her painful way to the hospital ship, where she was hospitalised for four months while having extensive and successful plastic surgery. She was fitted with lightweight, artificial legs. As her story became known, donations came in that enabled a house to be constructed for her and for her dependants, and to provide her with the materials to start a tie-dying business that would make her self-sufficient. What amazing courage and faith; it was a great inspiration to all 400 people on that hospital ship.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07121360000236"></a>Then there was a girl of 12, kidnapped by the rebel soldiers in Sierra Leone and taken away as a hostage. They raped and tortured her for a whole year and left her doubly incontinent. Somehow or other, she managed to escape and hide in the jungle for a week; no one knows how she managed to survive, but she made her way to the ship and her appalling injuries

However, psychologically she was very damaged indeed, and it was the tender, loving care of the nurses on board that helped her to come to terms with her appalling trauma.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07121360000237"></a>Many of the countries in Africa are potentially rich, as many noble Lords have already said, in diamonds and other resources. Sierra Leone should bring prosperity to its citizens, but the corruption and intertribal warfare have prevented this.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07121360000238"></a>One of the most interesting countries in west Africa is Ghana. We often wondered what makes that country different from the neighbouring countries; it may be that its educational structure is the solution, as children of different tribes and religion are educated peacefully together, which creates lifelong friendships and tends to preclude later internecine warfare.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07121360000239"></a>There have been some encouraging signs elsewhere in west Africa. The 200 British troops who restored and maintained the peace in Sierra Leone did so much more besides in helping the local population to rebuild their homes, schools and hospitals. They went the second, third and fourth mile&#151;so much so that many of the Sierra Leoneans asked the British troops to stay for ever and run their country. In Liberia, there is also good news, as they have elected a president, Mrs Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, who is the first lady president in Africa. She is strong, honest and charming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="07121360000240"></a>Has the Minister thought of using the really radical solution to the African problems which Costa Rica found when it abolished its army in 1948? As the <I>New Internationalist</I> stated in August 2005, as a result of abolishing the army,</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000625"></a>&#147;the nation&#146;s limited resources were channelled into infrastructure, especially education and health, which rewarded the country with the highest living standard in Central and South America&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000571"></a>There are now 28 nations without armies. Former Costa Rican president, Dr Arias Sanchez, has stressed that abolishing the army reduces the threat of military coups but he emphasises that it is essential to have a comprehensive programme to disarm and reintegrate soldiers into society. Otherwise, armed groups can reform under a different banner. Radical and imaginative solutions are essential for this terribly troubled continent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="07121360000242"></a>The Government have agreed with the estimate that conflict in Africa is costing $18 billion a year, which is roughly the same as the amount of aid by the whole of the world. In the year to June 2008, the UN budget for peacekeeping in six of the seven major conflicts where it is involved comes to $4.9 billion, which does not include the amount for Chad and the CAR, for which the budget has still to be agreed. In addition, there is the 3,700-strong EU force to be deployed in Chad starting early next year, the UN Peacebuilding Support  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_358"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 358</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Office in CAR, and the UNHCR&#146;s operations in Africa, for which it is requesting $380 million in 2008. That is to consider only the direct costs of the seven larger conflicts, leaving out the numerous indirect costs to the UN and its agencies such as those incurred in the conflict in Somalia, and of the smaller conflicts in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya, and so on.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="07121360000243"></a>The Oxfam estimate is a conservative one, as Oxfam acknowledges. It includes nothing for Somalia, for the simple reason that there are no data, and nothing for the cost of armed crime, on which the only data, in relation to Ghana and Nigeria alone, are seven years out of date. There are also no data for piracy along the coasts of Africa, including 27 hijacks or attempts near the Somali coast alone this year. The downstream costs, extending for a generation or more, are also neglected in these estimates, as has been highlighted by the noble Lords, Lord McColl and Lord Crisp, simply because they are utterly incalculable. However, as the Commission for Africa said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="07121360000595"></a>&#147;War does not only harm people. It destroys roads, bridges, farming equipment, telecommunications, water and sanitation systems. It shuts down hospitals and schools. It slows trade and economic life, sometimes to a halt&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000572"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, said, those effects carry on for many years after a conflict has ended.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07121360000244"></a>One contributory factor identified by Oxfam and highlighted by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, is the steady flow of weaponry into the hands of private militias and organised criminal gangs. Most of the arms and ammunition come from outside Africa, and in spite of the EU code of conduct, which prohibits arms exports that provoke or prolong conflicts or aggravate existing tensions or conflicts, one EU state is the largest supplier of ammunition to sub-Saharan Africa. The international arms trade treaty, which all noble Lords have agreed is absolutely necessary, will have to include better provisions for reporting and enforcement than the EU code. It will be useful to hear from the Minister whether in the light of experience that code is to be strengthened, and what the EU is intending to propose to the UN group of experts when they start work on drafting the treaty next month. Will they seek to include an international monitoring mechanism such as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, has indicated would be of great importance?</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07121360000245"></a>One answer to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, is that it is impossible to generalise about the causes of conflict in Africa, although I agree to some extent with the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, that many of them are due to ethnic and religious differences. For instance, there is only one that I can think of that is based on traditional antipathy between two neighbouring states, ostensibly but not mainly about the boundary between them. That is the confrontation between Eritrea and Ethiopia, and their proxy war in Somalia, which stems from the grievous mistake of the UN in 1950, when Eritrea was compulsorily federated with Ethiopia in the absence of any proper democratic consultation. When the people of Eritrea rose against the colonialist occupation, and there was a war of independence lasting 29 years, the international community did not lift a finger to help, and the Foreign Office throughout continued to parrot the mantra that some form of federal solution was best for the people of Eritrea.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_359"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 359</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71213-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07121360000246"></a>When the Eritreans finally gained their independence, but war broke out again over the boundary, the international community failed to act firmly against Meles Zenawi&#146;s refusal to accept the findings of the boundary commission. Now, after that commission has been disbanded, Meles remains in illegal occupation of some Eritrean territory, and refuses to accept the commission&#146;s final recommendation for the boundary to be demarcated by co-ordinates. One-quarter of a million troops are confronting each other along this border, and Eritrea, a desperately poor country of 4 million inhabitants, has become a militarised police state, dubbed the worst country in the world for press freedom. Those are the reasons that the UN has to spend $120 million on the peacekeeping forces of UNMEE this year, and they help to explain why the two states are involved in a war in Somalia. Even now, if the UN took a robust line on the border decision and on withdrawal of Ethiopian forces, it could solve this problem, which would allow both countries to reduce military spending, to benefit from trade through Assab and Massawa, and to release the agricultural potential along the border. What is the UK doing, as a friend of both countries and as a permanent member of the Security Council, to avert this potential war?</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07121360000247"></a>I do not underestimate the risk of a resumption of the conflict between north and south Sudan, which has been referred to by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Salisbury, and the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, who urged us to take action to shore up the CPA and to make Abyea into a demilitarised zone. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on that. The situation in Darfur, which is turning into the most expensive of all UN peacekeeping operations, illustrates the problem of mobilising international action even when you have in front of you &#147;an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe&#148;&#151;to use the language that justified the intervention in Kosovo without the approval of the Security Council, as we discussed the other day in the debate of the noble Lord, Lord Soley. Although objectively the Darfur statistics on the loss of life and the dispossession and involuntary displacement of inhabitants far exceed the worst that could have happened in Kosovo, the deployment of the hybrid force to protect the people and to allow refugees and IDPs to return home has been thrown into doubt by Khartoum&#146;s refusal to accept non-African forces, and by the persistent obstruction by President al-Bashir, which is still continuing. Yet there was no mention of Darfur or any of the other conflicts in the EU-AU summit declaration. The communiqu&#233; said that a high-level EU delegation discussed the refugee situation with President al-Bashir, and President Sarkozy said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="07121360000596"></a>&#147;We told him it is in Sudan&#146;s best interests ... that there is a halt to the massacres on its territory and that in order for the massacres to stop, the hybrid force needs to be deployed as soon as possible&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000248"></a>Is that really all that the EU has achieved? It must be clear to Khartoum that there are no penalties attached to its intransigence over the UN deployment, and that with the EU unable to come up with the hardware necessary to make it a success, there is no real political will in Brussels either. If I am wrong, I sincerely hope that the Minister will correct me.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07121360000249"></a>To return to where I started, the debate has amply demonstrated that conflict and insecurity have been identified as the greatest barriers to development for poor people across the continent of Africa. As Saferworld emphasises, all the evidence&#151;the World Bank&#146;s <I>Voices of the Poor</I>, the report of the UN High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change and the Commission for Africa&#146;s report, among others&#151;points to the conclusion that secure environments are fundamental prerequisites to the achievement of human development. Collectively, we are still not doing enough either to restore peace in several of the most severe conflicts or to prevent new conflicts breaking out where there are clear signs of imminent danger.</p>

I thank noble Lords for all their interesting contributions. This was your Lordships&#146; House at its best. I will not go into detail on individual countries, as each one mentioned has been covered comprehensively by your Lordships in a better way than I could do.</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07121360000251"></a>Let me start with the proposition that the causes and consequences of conflict in Africa are often indistinguishable. Poverty, for example, can provoke violence, and violence can perpetuate poverty. Desperate and impoverished groups of people are more likely to turn to violent conflict. Violent conflict can lead to the reallocation, misappropriation and diminution of vital resources, and the fiscal cost of conflict invariably has an adverse effect on the living standards of the poorest people. A report on armed conflict in Africa has shown that the cost to the continent&#146;s development over a 15-year period was, as we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and my noble friend Lady Verma, nearly $300 billion or &#163;146 billion.. Between 1990 and 2005, 23 African nations were involved in conflict, and, on average, that cost African economies $18 billion a year. The report argues that this sum of money is,</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000626"></a>&#147;equivalent to international aid from major donors in the same period. If this money was not lost due to armed conflict, it could solve the problems of HIV and AIDS in Africa, or it could address Africa&#146;s needs in education, clean water and sanitation, and prevent tuberculosis and malaria&#148;.</ul>
<a name="71213-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07121360000252"></a>However, poverty in itself is not the only cause of conflict and it is not my intention to oversimplify the matter. If poverty were the only cause, there would doubtless be many more outbreaks of violence across the developed and the developing world. Clearly, there are many complicated, diverse and interrelated factors which lead to conflict; so many that it is almost impossible to list them all. However, I believe that there are certain underlying factors, which I am sure your Lordships will agree have contributed to the outbreak of conflict in Africa. So what are those factors?</p>

<a name="71213-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07121360000253"></a>Corruption and bad governance, ethnic divisions and religious intolerance, illegitimate government, scarcity of resources, despicable human rights abuses, and, according to Professor Paul Collier in <I>The Bottom

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="07121360000255"></a>Furthermore, societies that have one group large enough to form a majority of the population, but where other groups are still significant, are indeed more at risk. The list of causes goes on and the effects are paramount. As we have heard from many noble Lords, since 2003 Darfur in western Sudan has been in the grip of a bitter civil conflict between African rebels and government troops. In the past four years, more than 200,000 people have lost their lives, 2 million been made homeless, and a further 2 million forced to rely on foreign aid. We all know that when civilian populations are provided with at least a basic standard of living, when Governments have a proper mandate to govern, when individuals are allowed to go about their daily business without fear of persecution, and when a country&#146;s economy is able to achieve a certain level of sustainable growth, then the probability of conflict is radically reduced, and reduced it must be. As Professor Paul Collier points out:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="07121360000597"></a>&#147;Civil war is development in reverse. It damages both the country itself and its neighbours&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000256"></a>That is a very good way of putting it. So, what can we do to minimise the risk of future conflicts in Africa or to solve the problems? In his eloquent speech the noble Lord, Lord Luce, stressed a positive approach towards reconstruction, suggesting that the talented African diaspora be encouraged to return or to help in some way. My noble friend Lord McColl, in his moving speech, spoke about Costa Rica&#146;s radical solution.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07121360000257"></a>I suggest four ideas. First, as Andrew Mitchell, the Shadow Secretary of State has said, we should show a lead in promoting UN reforms to strengthen UN peacekeeping and peacemaking efforts around the world and to protect vulnerable populations from great harm. Secondly, we should make certain that aid is monitored and spent effectively, and that it reaches those people who really need it. Relieving hardship may be the best form of conflict prevention. Thirdly, we should work with the international community to reduce formal and informal trade barriers that hinder growth; because without growth peace is considerably more difficult. Fourthly, we should address the problem of conflict from a practical, rather than from solely an academic, perspective.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07121360000258"></a>As the Department for International Development noted in its 2001 consultation document, <I>The </I><I>causes of conflict in Africa</I>, by 2000, more than half the countries in Africa and 20 per cent of the population were affected by conflict. Not much has changed today, as we heard in the debate, despite aid of billions. The facts of civil war are clear; thousands of people are exposed to risk of death or displacement, and the process of development is severely hindered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07121360000260"></a>Until there is peace in Africa, opportunities for development by us are limited. I have not mentioned today China, India, Malaysia and others, but support all that my noble friend Lady Park and the noble Lord, Lord Luce, said about those countries.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="07121360000261"></a>I end, as did my noble friend Lady Verma and the noble Lord, Lord Luce, by reiterating that Africa should help itself. However, after so many years of fighting, it is clear that external help, too, is needed to end its many conflicts.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07121360000263"></a>Conflict has sadly been a regular feature in Africa in recent decades, although we should be careful not to fall into generalisations&#151;a large majority of Africans continue to live in peace. The end of the Cold War had a dramatic impact in Africa. Governments often lost the economic and military props they had previously enjoyed and political change was suddenly on the agenda. Conflict in Africa since the early 1990s has been largely internal, with government forces pitted against rebel groups often representing regional or ethnic interests. Cross-border groups acting as proxies for neighbouring regimes have been common. The number of conflicts rose dramatically, reaching a peak in 1999, which saw 17 significant conflicts.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07121360000264"></a>Every conflict in Africa has its own complex story, its own specific triggers and drivers, but there are some clear trends, of which climate change, cited by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, is clearly one. The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings was right to mention poverty as an underlying cause of conflict. The noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, spoke of governance: economically developed democratic countries rarely fall into conflict, which is often a product of poor governance and lack of development, and which then reinforces them. Many post-colonial African states have been vulnerable to conflict because they lacked the ability to act like a state, to provide a secure environment for their citizens and improve their quality of life. In many cases, the state is next to non-existent in remote rural parts of Africa. It is no surprise that many armed conflicts arise in such areas. Too many African Governments in the past have been non-inclusive, favouring one or more regional, ethnic or social groups at the expense of others. That has left other groups excluded, with no channels to express their grievances and often no access to scarce resources.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07121360000265"></a>If those basic problems of governance and exclusion have lit the flames of conflict, they have been fanned by many other drivers, including impunity and arms. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, rightly drew attention to the pernicious impact of irresponsible arms trading in Africa, in particular in small arms. In some African  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_363"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 363</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>countries, a few hundred men with small arms can have a huge and terrible impact. There may be major barriers to trade within Africa, but the Kalashnikov is an exception. The noble Lord powerfully pointed out that weapons represent power and pride; they fuel the conflicts that sap human life and economics.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="07121360000266"></a>Many noble Lords mentioned the arms trade treaty. The UK was the first major arms exporter to throw its weight behind the campaign for an arms trade treaty. We want a treaty with teeth, which will make a real difference to those who are suffering as a result of armed conflict in Africa. UK engagement has been instrumental in galvanising international support, and we will not lose our resolve on this matter. To my noble friend Lord Judd, I say that we will continue to engage with the US on this issue and to encourage it to participate as work progresses, with the aim of securing its support for an eventual treaty.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="07121360000267"></a>Violence begets violence. Too many African Governments have used their security forces not to defend their people, but to oppress them. This often creates a bad neighbourhood, encouraging others to use proxies. We saw the impact of Charles Taylor&#146;s appalling regime throughout the Mano river sub-region, and events in Darfur have exacerbated instability in Chad and the Central African Republic. Perhaps we should pay more heed to the example of Costa Rica, as cited by the noble Lord, Lord McColl.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07121360000268"></a>We know only too well the devastating consequences of conflict in Africa. First, as always, should come the human impact. Figures are unreliable, especially so given the nature and location of many African conflicts. Battle deaths probably reached some 100,000 per year in the late 1990s, but have now declined significantly. The number of total deaths was much higher, from disease&#151;including HIV&#151;displacement, malnutrition and the like. The numbers of those suffering physical and mental injuries, from the trauma of experiencing extreme violence, the appalling phenomenon of child soldiers and the terrible incidence of sexual violence in eastern DRC, are enormous and sometimes forgotten. We must not forget the terrible hardship and impact of internal and external displacement, with the brightest and best often fleeing their homelands for ever. It is only the amazing fortitude of many people in Africa, and their willingness to forgive, that prevents the human impact being larger. I shall return to child soldiers.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07121360000269"></a>The recent report by three NGOs that was cited by many noble Lords gives us a dramatic sense of the economic costs of conflict. It is a powerful and sobering report, and we have no reason to take a radically different view from that expressed in it. Similar conclusions were drawn last year by the International Development Select Committee. What is undeniable is that conflict undermines development. In 2005, it was estimated that of the 34 countries furthest from achieving the MDGs, 22 were in conflict or emerging from it. In Sierra Leone&#146;s conflict, for example, rice production fell to 20 per cent of its pre-war levels. I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Jones, and Cheltenham hospital are having such a tangible impact in a country that is still suffering from conflict. The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, asked about progress on the MDGs. Despite the fact that UN Millennium Development

According to the UN, poverty in sub-Saharan Africa has fallen by nearly six percentage points since 2000. We are contributing &#163;417 million to the African Development Fund over the next three years, which is double the amount of previous support.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07121360000270"></a>On child soldiers, the UK has been active in supporting activity that addresses the terrible effects on the children involved, including innovative work in Sierra Leone and northern Uganda. I entirely agree with the noble Baroness that putting resources in the hands of women and involving civil society in conflict issues is terribly important. That is integral to DfID&#146;s work. The noble Lord, Lord Parekh, spoke about conflict resolution and the important part that women can play in that.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07121360000271"></a>Conflict is not just a tragedy for Africa, but a very serious issue for the wider world and this country. It brings direct costs to the international community: lost trade and investment, spending on emergency and post-conflict aid, and international intervention. Perhaps more significantly, conflict can fuel uncontrolled migration and create ungoverned spaces, which criminal networks and extremists can exploit.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07121360000272"></a>This sounds like a very bleak picture, but there is real cause for optimism; things are improving. The number of conflicts in Africa has reduced dramatically in recent years, from 17 significant conflicts in 1999 to five in 2005, but of course those conflicts are dreadful. This is not by chance. African countries and the international community are taking a more active approach and greater responsibility for preventing conflicts before they begin, ending them when they start and providing the means to recover from them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07121360000273"></a>The formation of the African Union in 2002 enshrined a new commitment to democracy and sound economic management. The picture remains uneven, of course, but two-thirds of African countries now have multi-party elections and the successful military coup has almost ended as a way of changing governments. The AU no longer recognises regimes that have come to power by force. It has distanced itself from the former Organisation of African Unity&#146;s mantra of non-interference in internal affairs and has committed itself to a policy of non-indifference. The AU has acted on this, sending peacekeeping missions to Burundi, Darfur and Somalia, leading peace negotiations and preventing conflict through mediation. We should continue to encourage and support this trend. The AU has also developed a long-term vision of an African peace and security architecture, covering early warning, mediation, peacekeeping and post-conflict work. This Government is one of the AU&#146;s major supporters in this. We have trained more than 11,000 African peacekeepers since 2004 and provided capacity-building support to the AU and African regional organisations such as ECOWAS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07121360000274"></a>At the UN, 60 per cent of the Security Council&#146;s time is spent on African issues. Many of the largest UN peacekeeping missions in the world are in Africa&#151;in DRC, Liberia, southern Sudan and, soon, in Darfur in partnership with the African Union. Peacekeeping is a vital and effective tool. UN, AU and EU missions contribute to a more secure environment in Africa.  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_365"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 365</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The UN world summit in 2005 saw a clear recognition of the links between conflict and development. One of the outcomes was the peacebuilding commission, which aims to highlight the critical gaps between peacekeeping and post-conflict development, and better to co-ordinate international donors to ensure that funds are used more strategically. The first two countries to be addressed are Sierra Leone and Burundi. The UK has contributed some &#163;30 million to the peacebuilding fund.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07121360000275"></a>On conflict resources, the Kimberley process, involving governments, industry and civil society, has made remarkable progress. In the 1990s some 15 per cent of all diamonds traded internationally were conflict diamonds. Now, some 99.8 per cent are traded legitimately through a system of inspections, certificates and warranties. We do not have to be impotent; sometimes we can make things work.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07121360000276"></a>The UK has been instrumental in ensuring that those who perpetrate genocide and crimes against humanity are held to account. We are strong supporters of the International Criminal Court and the international tribunals in Rwanda and Sierra Leone. We stand by to imprison Charles Taylor if he is convicted by the special court in Sierra Leone. The British Government take a comprehensive approach to conflict in Arica, bringing together diplomatic development and defence expertise from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence to work on African conflict-prevention programmes, totalling more than &#163;350 million since 2001. We also aim to ensure that all our development work is sensitive to conflict. This is essential. Rwanda, just before the genocide, seemed to be making social and economic progress, but foreign assistance was not addressing the fundamental divisions within that society.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07121360000277"></a>Of course, there is absolutely no room for complacency. The crisis in Darfur continues; the Government of Sudan continue to put obstacles in the way of the UN/AU mission. The prompt deployment of effective force is essential. We are doing all we can to ensure that the UN can generate the necessary force and that the Government of Sudan and the rebel movements deliver on their commitments. We are working hard to encourage a solution to the differences between north and south Sudan in implementing the comprehensive peace agreement. This is indivisible from the solution to the Darfur crisis. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Salisbury, the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, and the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, spoke powerfully about the needs of the people of southern Sudan. We welcome the SPLM&#146;s announcement that it will rejoin the Government of National Unity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07121360000278"></a>Two parties have made detailed plans for redeployment of forces in three phases, with 100 per cent deployment by 9 January. Abyei will be protected by joint integrated units and will be monitored by UNMIS. We welcome this. We have supported the capacity building for the JIUs. The UK is supporting the work of the Darfur Assessment and Evaluation Commission, an independent body, whose remit is to monitor and report on the implementation of the CPA. The UK also supports a high-level international meeting to push for more rapid CPA implementation. Of course, free and fair national elections in 2009 are crucial for the whole of Sudan.

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07121360000279"></a>The situations in Somalia and eastern DRC remain real causes for concern. In eastern DRC the situation is fast-moving and we are aware of Nkunda&#146;s counteroffensive. The real concern is that the current situation is creating more humanitarian misery. It is essential that we focus on the underlying problems, action against both Nkunda and the FDLR in parallel, and that we continue to focus on the political end-game.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07121360000280"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, and the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, quite rightly and properly drew our attention to the appalling situation in Zimbabwe. The tragedy is unfolding daily before our eyes and continues to endanger stability in the whole area. Like them, I pay tribute to the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York for his persistence where Zimbabwe is concerned. Like the noble Lord, Lord Luce, the Government believe that the solution to Zimbabwe&#146;s current crisis has, ultimately, to be an African one, supported by the international community. We support President Mbeke in leading efforts to resolve Zimbabwe&#146;s problems and President Wade of Senegal&#146;s recent comments on the need for the whole of Africa to solve the problem. We want to see positive outcomes on the ground. That is the only real test of any initiative.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07121360000281"></a>Zimbabwe&#146;s crisis is not only a regional or African problem, although it requires strong African leadership that is willing to condemn atrocities and recognise injustice. I cannot quite remember the very excellent quotation of the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, but I entirely agree with him about resolute actions. At the last meeting in August, SADC&#146;s leaders did not blame the EU or the West for Zimbabwe&#146;s problems. It was a very small step forward, but perhaps we should take some small comfort from that.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07121360000282"></a>I listened carefully to the experiences and wise words of the noble Lord, Lord Luce. I very much like his idea of an EU/AU plan to mobilise members of the diaspora who have skills that can be used in peacebuilding. Having had discussions with various diasporas in the past, I am sure that they would warm to such a suggestion. The noble Lord, Lord Crisp, and others drew our attention to the impact of conflict on health, that basic human need. Yes, the Government strongly support partnerships such as the one he cited between King&#146;s College Hospital and Somaliland. I will come back to him on the issue of funding. I greatly respect the noble Lord, Lord McColl, for his extraordinary work on mercy ships and, of course, the organisation itself. His words were chilling, but the work that he does brings warmth to our hearts and we are very proud of him.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07121360000283"></a>In respect of the border dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia, the Government&#146;s policy is based on three principles: avoiding a return to war, which would be unacceptable; demarcating the border; and finding a way for the parties to normalise relations. In November we set out this policy very forcefully when the Foreign

The noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown also conveyed these points to the Eritrean foreign minister. We recognise the seriousness of that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07121360000284"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, asked about pooled funding. The UK in southern Sudan uses the pooled mechanism with six other donors and works to assist the Government of southern Sudan to use the World Bank-managed multi-donor trust fund.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07121360000285"></a>There are important future challenges for the UK and the wider international community. First, there is the question of progress on agreeing an arms trade treaty at the UN. We need a treaty that will stop the irresponsible trade in weapons that are used to fuel conflict, repression and human rights abuses. Secondly, we should ensure that the concept of responsibility to protect, endorsed by 191 world leaders at the UN world summit in 2005, is operationalised so we can help states to improve their capacity to prevent the most egregious crimes. Where they are not upholding their responsibilities we pressurise them to do so, and as a last resort we step in when they fail. That is part and parcel of the Government&#146;s approach to hard-headed internationalism. Thirdly, new approaches should be developed to new challenges such as the potential impact on Africa&#146;s security of climate change as water, land and other resources become scarcer in some areas. Finally, we should put into action the key linkages highlighted recently by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister to ensure that all future peacekeeping missions have plans for post-conflict recovery at their heart.</p>

<a name="71213-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07121360000286"></a>The Government are fully committed to addressing both the fundamental causes of conflict in Africa and its consequences. We will continue to put that at the heart of our broader agenda for Africa&#146;s development and to use our influence within the wider international community.</p>

 &#147;Following my Statement of 13 November, I would like to update the House on the actions that we are taking to address Security Industry Authority licensing checks and the issue of entitlement to work in the United Kingdom.&#147;An SIA licence demonstrates that the holder has undergone training and that identity and criminality checks have been completed. An SIA licence has never constituted evidence of entitlement to work in this country and it is the responsibility of employers to ensure that the people whom they employ are entitled to work.&#147;Before my previous Statement, steps were already being taken to prevent illegal working in the security industry. From 2 July 2007, the SIA introduced immigration status checks with the Border and Immigration Agency on all non-EEA applicants as part of the security industry licensing process. This is not a substitute for employers meeting their clear obligations, but the SIA checks provide a double lock on illegal working in this area.&#147;Alongside these immigration status checks, my department took steps to determine how many people who were granted licences prior to 2 July did not have the right to work. Plans were put in place for the BIA to check all the 39,885 non-EEA nationals licensed by the SIA before 2 July. Manual checks had started at the rate of 1,000 cases per week.&#147;I wanted the process to be speeded up without compromising accuracy. I therefore ordered automatic matching between the SIA list of non-EEA nationals and databases operated by the BIA and UKvisas. The BIA and the SIA have now completed these checks on the 39,885 non-EEA nationals licensed by the SIA before 2 July. On the basis of these checks, I am advised that the BIA is fully satisfied that 28,737 have the right to work in this country. It believes that 6,653 do not have the right to work in this country. In 4,447 other cases, the BIA is not satisfied that the individual has proved the right to work. The balance of 48 represents duplicate records.  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_369"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 369</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;The following steps are being taken to revoke the licences of those found not to be entitled to work in this country. The SIA has written to all companies on its database to remind them of the need to check regularly on the SIA&#146;s website the registers of licence holders and of revoked licences, to ensure that all their staff have the right to work. The registers are currently receiving over 1,000 hits a day.&#147;Apart from a small number of cases where the SIA licence is close to expiry, the SIA has written to all those individuals&#151;more than 10,500&#151;where checks indicate no right to work or where the BIA is not satisfied that the individual has the right to work. These letters advise the licence holder that the SIA is minded to revoke their licence. The SIA gives the recipients 21 days in which to respond with further information and it expects that many will do so. If evidence is not forthcoming, the SIA will move for revocation. The law then allows the individual a further 21 days in which to appeal to the magistrates&#146; or sheriff courts.&#147;Once the SIA has completed this process, it will be in a position to determine the number of individuals not entitled to work but who obtained SIA licences prior to the new double-lock checking regime now in place. The SIA expects that a significant proportion may yet establish that they have a right to work in this country. I am advised that, of the new applications for licences initially considered for refusal by the SIA on the basis of checks with the BIA following 2 July, over 30 per cent have since shown that they have the right to work. The SIA will publish the final numbers of the pre-2 July group on its website when they are complete. &#147;I repeat that it is important that all employers fulfil their obligations by carrying out all the proper checks before taking anyone on. We are also taking further steps to protect the public from those individuals who we suspect have breached our immigration laws by working here illegally. First, all the cases where minded-to-revoke action is now being taken against individuals have been passed to BIA enforcement intelligence units to be assessed for further action. The BIA is screening these individuals against the police national computer and other databases so that we can target any individuals who may pose a risk to the public.&#147;Secondly, these cases are being analysed for evidence of employers who appear to have a track record of employing people who do not have a right to work. BIA tells me that a third of its illegal-working operation is currently being deployed on this employment sector. Visits to specific individuals and employers have already begun and swift action has been taken in those cases that merit it. A series of targeted enforcement operations will take place in the coming months, with a view to prosecuting employers and removing or prosecuting individuals in the worst cases.&#147;Thirdly, in line with our enforcement strategy, we will continue to target illegal working on the basis of the risk of harm to the public. New powers that come into force in February mean that

Now that we have identified a significant problem in the security industry, we will maintain a focus on its employers and staff.&#147;We are taking other steps to further guard against illegal working in the security industry. First, the BIA has passed to the SIA the right-to-work expiry dates of all existing licence holders and recent new applicants. The SIA has agreed that in future it will send minded-to-revoke letters to all these licence holders shortly before their right to work status expires. Secondly, I have asked the BIA to work with the SIA to provide specialist advice to enhance its ability to spot fraudulent documentation. Thirdly, at present, the SIA&#146;s licence application form does not specifically ask applicants to state that they have the right to work in the United Kingdom. I have therefore asked the SIA to review the application form to ensure that it contains all the information that both the SIA and the BIA may need with a view to making changes as soon as possible. Fourthly, in January, the SIA will run a joint seminar with the British Security Industry Association to underline the importance of employers meeting their responsibilities in this area. Fifthly, the task force that I set up to resolve this issue in September, chaired by my honourable friend the Member for Gedling, will continue to oversee action.&#147;I believe that the update that I have provided today demonstrates my and the Government&#146;s determination to put in place effective systems and procedures to further protect the public&#148;.

I remind your Lordships that, although the Government knew of the problem of illegal working in the security industry as early as last April, we learnt of it only in November, through a Sunday newspaper. That is over six months later, even though we are talking about the security industry. At that time, it seemed that about 5,000 people might be involved. Now we learn that more than 11,000 may be working in this country illegally in the security industry alone. The Government say that they are applying a double lock, but it seems that a large horse has already bolted. Would it not have been much better to have had competent staff in the stable preventing this breakout from the system?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07121360000295"></a>It would help the House greatly if the Minister could respond to the following questions. How many people are protecting sensitive individuals such as Ministers and police and how many are protecting sensitive sites belonging, for instance, to the critical national infrastructure? The Minister said that the individuals involved had the right of appeal and that the whole process of establishing entitlement to work could take up to 42 days in individual cases. During that time, the individual has the continuing right to work. But where the safety of sensitive people, including government Ministers and installations may be involved, is this provision the right way round? Should there not be at least an ability to suspend pending confirmation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07121360000296"></a>In another place, the Home Secretary said that investigation of a significant number of cases was now in train. How many are likely to result in deportation? Why does the system function so badly? In the Statement, the Minister says that the granting of an SIA licence,</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000628"></a>&#147;has never constituted evidence of entitlement to work in this country&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000573"></a>That is not what the SIA says, nor is it what any employer would reasonably understand from its website. In a document published in 2006 and reflected on the website, the SIA states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="07121360000598"></a>&#147;To obtain an SIA licence it is necessary to pass checks relating to competency and being a fit and proper person for the role&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000297"></a>It continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="07121360000599"></a>&#147;The fit and proper person check is made up of the following checks: a right to work in the UK&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000574"></a>with a lot of other requirements thereafter. To establish the right, the SIA required applicants to submit originals of a wide variety of documents, including passport, driving licence, firearms certificates, photo ID and so forth.</p>

<a name="71213-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07121360000298"></a>What is the SIA for if it is not going to establish immigration status? Why is it only now that the SIA is going to benefit from close co-operation with the Immigration Service? Would it not have been natural for the SIA to seek this collaboration with the BIA from the outset? Does the Minister not accept that that would have been a competent way of proceeding, especially when the SIA was giving the industry the impression that it was checking immigration status? Presumably a number of the documents presented in applications were also forgeries. How many have been uncovered by the SIA? Is the Minister in a position to say whether there will be any prosecutions?</p>

<a name="71213-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07121360000299"></a>Finally, will the Minister now tell the House how the SIA proposes to strengthen its procedures? The board members are all appointees of the Home Secretary. Had she been in the House, it would have been helpful to have heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, who is chairman of the board. It is a matter of public record that she is paid &#163;64,800 a year for a three-day week. Her duties are therefore not insubstantial in this matter. Will the Minister say when the department is likely to have finished its current investigations, so that it can advise the House of the outcome and reassure us about the confidence and integrity of the system that has been put in place?</p>

Individuals are being licensed, but employers have the legal responsibility for checking. That issue has contributed to the present position. Since the original Act was drawn up in 2001, it has become apparent that the security industry has expanded considerably. The Government&#146;s intention to farm more work out to it in all sorts of areas means

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="07121360000302"></a>I have talked with people from the industry, who describe the Act as a starting point. Perhaps if they were generous they would describe it as the 11-plus compared with university entrance. It may have served a purpose before there was anything else in place, but it needs an overhaul now.</p>

<a name="71213-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07121360000303"></a>I have some questions for the Minister. He mentioned that cases were being analysed for evidence of employers who appeared to have a track record of employing people who do not have the right to work here. The BIA said that a third of its illegal-working operation is concentrating on that. I wonder how many people constitute a third of that operation. Are we talking about five people, 15 people or 50 people? That will be relevant to how fast the case load can be got through.</p>

<a name="71213-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07121360000304"></a>Secondly, according to the Security Industry Authority, of the 114 contractors currently licensed there have been four withdrawals of licences, from the employers&#146; side, I imagine, although it is not clear to me. Perhaps the Minister would explain exactly what happens where an employer is found still to be operating even though it has a large number of individuals whose individual licences have been withdrawn. Lastly, will the Minister tell me the current position of all this in Scotland?</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, raised the chronology of how various decisions were made and referred to the timings of when things were known and my right honourable friend the Home Secretary&#146;s response. Effectively the SIA, although it was under no obligation to do so, started checks in 2006 to identify whether any of the people who were being cleared on the basis of their CRB and competence were not entitled to work in the United Kingdom. They did some checks with a small sample and found that there were a number. That made them think that they should check in a little more detail and a larger sample was chosen. In April this year that highlighted that this was a problem.</p>

<a name="71213-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07121360000306"></a>That shows how important the matter is and what a good thing it was that we established the SIA back in 2003, because there was nothing in existence before that to look at these things. My right honourable friend Liam Byrne became aware of the issue in April this year. The full scale of the problem became apparent in about August, but before that on 2 July, as I said in the Statement, every applicant identified as a non-EEA national by the SIA had their right to work in the UK checked by the BIA. That was done off its own bat before Ministers had looked at this. In August we had a couple of meetings on the issue. The Home Secretary was made aware of the problem and she understandably said that she wanted to know the full scale, the full implications and the actions to be carried out. That she wanted to check the figures was shown clearly by the fact that the numbers have changed regularly, as was pointed out by the noble Baroness. Initially we thought that it might be about  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_373"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 373</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>5,000, but now we have bottomed that out and come to the latest figure. That shows that it was essential that she looked at those issues.</p>

<a name="71213-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07121360000307"></a>A point was raised about the number of people protecting sensitive ministries and so on. All the people who work at the Home Office in this context have SIA checks anyway. There is not an issue. In August the Cabinet Office wrote to all HR directors of various departments to establish the fact that they had to use the directive that points out the baseline personal security standard for all their people. That has been done. We have looked across the board and there are no areas where we are concerned about that risk to government departments, agencies, the military, the police and so on.</p>

<a name="71213-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07121360000308"></a>Since the 2 July cases we have passed 338 cases to enforcement teams. We have produced 328 intelligence packages, where they try to identify the full detail. We have made 101 enforcement visits, 44 encounters and so far arrested 15 people, but these are early days and there is a 42-day period for people to respond.</p>

<a name="71213-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07121360000309"></a>I was asked about what happened with the immediate suspension of a licence. The SIA can suspend a licence immediately if it is reasonably satisfied that there will be a clear threat to public safety. Having looked through the relatively high proportion that we have and the number of successful challenges, we believe that this is not an appropriate course of action at the moment for the ones that we are dealing with.</p>

<a name="71213-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="07121360000310"></a>It was said that the SIA website says that it will conduct right-to-work checks. That is not correct. It says that it may conduct right-to-work checks. As I said before, it was set up on the basis of checking competency and CRB, not that right-to-work check. However, the double lock system now means that that is done and will be covered.</p>

<a name="71213-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07121360000311"></a>The noble Baroness thought that the SIA had functioned badly. I go back to what I said before, which shows me that we are lucky that we established an SIA, that it was doing its job thinking of other aspects and that it did the right things. It has been brought to our attention and now a raft of measures are being implemented to find out the exact position and to take action to make sure that we get this right. Therefore I do not think that it functioned badly at all. It functioned well and spotted something that was going wrong, bearing in mind that it was established in 2003.</p>

<a name="71213-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07121360000312"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, mentioned the licence of individuals and employees and rightly raised the fact that Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 does not fulfil what is required of it. That has been recognised. Later today in this House, for example, we will be discussing the Immigration (Employment of Adults Subject to Immigration Control) (Maximum Penalty) Order 2007. That is part of a series of measures to replace Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act with something a little more practical that we will be able to use properly to prosecute the firms that the noble Baroness was talking about who are clearly breaking those rules. It has been difficult and clumsy to do it in the past.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="07121360000313"></a>The BIA has over 30 enforcement officers across the UK, so one-third of that must be 10. Perhaps I may come back to your Lordships with this in writing, because I am not sure myself, to give a precise figure.</p>

<a name="71213-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07121360000314"></a>I do not know the position for Scotland and I will come back in writing on that. If I have not answered any questions from the noble Baroness I will be happy to talk afterwards or to come back in writing.</p>

Has not the situation that we are now considering moved with extreme swiftness? Have the Government received any earlier representations from the Conservative Opposition in particular, expressing concern about the matter?</p>

As I mentioned, the establishment of the SIA was a good thing. As I understand it, although it was long before I came into any political arena, it was opposed strongly by the Conservative Party on the grounds that it was not required. Thank goodness it is there and has bowled these things out. We now have to sort it out, but because the SIA was there we discovered that there was this problem.</p>

I have two questions for the noble Lord. First, what action is recommended to employers to ensure that the documents submitted by the prospective employee are genuine, because I am told that the documents are sometimes forged? Secondly, what action is taken to ensure that employers carry out the checks, and if they do not, are there any penalties?</p>

<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="07121360000318"></a><b><a name="71213-0008.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07121360000798"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for those points. We are introducing a new list of documents in the context of the work being carried out in relation to this change to Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act. These have been picked particularly because the way that they lock together gives a clear indication and makes it much easier to ascertain whether prospective employees have a right to work in this country and to spot forgeries. Because we also have the double-lock system, an added security is the fact that the SIA goes to the BIA, which has very expert people who check these documents. We are also giving guidance to the industry to show it what to look for. So there is a double check which will make it much more certain that we get this right.</p>

Is there any possibility of a link between these unfortunate events that are being corrected and the disasters in the sub-prime loans business, in which there seems to have been a parallel failure in the regulatory process? There might conceivably be a link between the two.</p>

The Government make much of the fact that they put this system in place and that it is working well. However, that does not make it a good system. The difficulty is that the system is faulty, as it stands. It would help the House to hear in due course from the Minister on how the system will be strengthened to function better.</p>

The double lock makes the system far, far better and it will be very sound indeed. It is unfortunate that all this has happened in the way that it has; it is great that the SIA actually discovered it. Now we will have a good answer with the double-lock system, which will be secure and robust. There are a number of areas which we have to focus on, and we have been made to look at them because they are important in the context of our overall security and managing our borders. They fit together and interlock with a number of other things that are taking place.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07121360000324"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of this debate is to attempt to move forward with greater urgency the need to capture electricity from the Severn estuary. The fact that this site has the second-highest tides in the world is a huge incentive. I have no luddite tendencies in securing this debate. I do not say no to electricity generation in the Severn estuary and the Bristol Channel, but I seek answers to questions of how best this is to be achieved. The reduction of fossil fuel use and carbon emissions remains paramount in driving this issue forward.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07121360000325"></a>At the start, it is best to summarise how tidal energy can be classified and captured from the Severn estuary as follows: first, tidal range, which is the normal ebb and flow of the tide and, secondly, tidal streams&#151;flows of water at different depths and geographical locations. On tidal range, there are two methods of tidal energy capture from turbines in the Severn estuary: first, the Severn barrage&#151;an obvious one&#151;and the construction of tidal lagoons is the second option. The capture of energy by tidal stream turbines occurs at varying depths. The big question is: what is the best method to generate electricity?</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07121360000326"></a>This question gives rise to a range of additional questions for which it is highly desirable to have accurate answers. What are the relative capital costs of construction of different tidal electricity plants? What  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_376"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 376</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is the return on capital invested on different electricity generation systems? What additional rates of return will be achieved on more rapidly built systems? What will be the comparative lead-in time before electricity is generated from different systems? What impact will this have on increasing production of renewable energy sooner to reduce carbon emissions? What will be the relative cost per unit of electricity produced from different methods of generating electricity from tidal power? What are the relative environmental impact differences between systems of producing tidal electricity? Regrettably, we do not yet have the answers to all these questions.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="07121360000327"></a>Because work has been done on the concept of a Severn barrage for many years, we know that at current prices it will cost some &#163;15 billion and produce up to 5 per cent of UK energy, and that the build-time is variously estimated to take from eight to 12 years. We know also that there are two possible sites for the barrage. The most canvassed site is the Cardiff Lavernock Point to Weston-Super-Mare barrage, or there is the Shoots barrage, just downstream of the second Severn crossing. A vast amount has been published on the barrage, but the main Sustainable Development Commission report, <I>Turning </I><I>the Tide</I><I>&#151;</I><I>Tidal Power in t</I><I>he U</I><I>K</I>, published on 1 October 2007, contains what purports to be a more independent assessment of a proposed Severn barrage than some other assessments. In particular, this study looks at alternatives to the barrage, with tidal stream and tidal lagoon technology.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07121360000328"></a>In summary, the SDC report details and reviews the options: Severn barrage, tidal stream and tidal lagoon. The report does not attempt to calculate the extent of the carbon footprint of the construction of the barrage, nor does it solve the economic problems of the closure of Bristol, Newport and Cardiff docks, or those of Gloucester. Nor does it address the considerable cost of establishing large new wildlife sites. The European directives concerning habitats on the Severn estuary state that it has an important number of international conservation sites. It is designated as a special protection area for avian features under the EU bird directive and as a possible special area of conservation. SAC status also applies to the River Usk, the River Wye and the Mendip limestone grasslands. There are local conservation sites too, including 26 SSSIs, one national nature reserve, eight local nature reserves, one historic landscape and four wildlife trusts. There are many local biodiversity action plans for habitats and species. This is especially important for Severn fish species and many water birds. According to the SDC report, allis and twaite shad, river and sea lampreys and Atlantic salmon face the prospect of extinction. That applies particularly to the winter and spring run of Atlantic salmon.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07121360000329"></a>The SDC concludes:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="07121360000600"></a>&#147;A Severn barrage must be publicly led as a project and publicly owned as an asset to avoid short-termist decisions and ensure the long-term public interest</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="07121360000601"></a>Full compliance with European Directives on habitats and birds is vital, as is a long-term commitment to creating compensatory habitats on an unprecedented scale</p>

</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="07121360000603"></a>Development of a Severn barrage must not divert Government attention away from much wider action on climate change.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="07121360000604"></a>By taking this approach it would be possible to combine a climate change mitigation project (the barrage) with climate change adaptation, by developing compensatory habitats that reflect our changing climate, and combining this with coastal protection and other climate change strategies, thus creating an &#145;environmental opportunity&#146;&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71213-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07121360000330"></a>The report also states that there is tidal stream and tidal range. It defines that and says that it,</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000629"></a>&#147;could supply at least 10% of the UK&#146;s electricity if fully exploited, around 5% from each resource&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000575"></a>and that&#151;I speak as a Welsh Member&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000630"></a>&#147;50 per cent of this resource is in Wales.</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="07121360000605"></a>There is minimal conflict between the exploitation of tidal stream and tidal range resources, or between the technologies that might be deployed. The best tidal stream sites are in the north of Scotland, with significant potential also around north Wales&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000576"></a>and of course there are some in the Severn estuary as well. The report states that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="07121360000606"></a>&#147;The UK has an excellent tidal stream resource, and is leading the world in the development of a wide range of tidal stream devices, several of which are at the testing stage. The UK must &#145;stay the course&#146; in developing these technologies, as the export and climate change benefits are potentially very large&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000577"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, who is unable to be here today, made these points in his speech on the Queen&#146;s Speech. The report goes on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="07121360000607"></a>&#147;Despite the encouraging progress made so far, Government could do more to assist these emerging technologies, particularly through flexible financial support, and by providing additional resources to the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="07121360000608"></a>On tidal lagoons, the SDC found that there is a lack of available evidence on the costs and environmental impacts, mainly due to the absence of any practical experience&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71213-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07121360000331"></a>These are the main relevant conclusions of the SDC in relation to this topic. However, some criticisms can be made of the SDC report. It used five desk-based research reports rather than carrying out any new work. More new work would be needed, as much of the evidence used dates from the 1980s. Further, the report devotes more than half its pages to the Severn barrage; the report may be about tidal power but the focus is certainly on the Severn barrage. In addition, financing the project needs further explanation&#151;that is very true indeed.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07121360000332"></a>Several other points need to be made in relation to the SDC report. First, the estuary is at risk from fluvial flooding and a barrage would have a significant impact on the rivers and watercourses that discharge into the estuary. The levels on both sides of the estuary rely on drainage systems storing fluvial water during high tide periods, which is quite a good point. Also, it is not exactly clear who would own the plan for the Severn barrage and thus be responsible for the appropriate assessment under the habitats regulations. The &#163;15 billion cost, which I previously mentioned, relates to construction. There would clearly be considerable additional costs relating to feasibility studies, environmental impact, strategic environmental assessment and habitats compensations. Those are all points which could have been made clearer in the SDC report.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07121360000333"></a>However, others have made some points which concern them. The Severn Tidal Power Group represents the main contractors who would be involved in the construction of the Severn barrage. It understandably welcomes the SDC report&#151;a large project like the barrage would of course benefit it, and one suspects that the report&#146;s indication that either tidal lagoons or tidal stream turbines are a little way off in development terms will encourage it in its view. However, it indicates that the coming study should examine all options and views.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07121360000334"></a>Another body that is contributing to the debate and has an interest in the outcome is Tidal Electric Ltd, which has drawn up a number of points that are worth repeating&#151;in its favour, I hasten to add. It has drawn up a table with the Severn barrage on the left hand side and tidal lagoons on the right. It says that the Severn barrage will be publicly funded, which it estimates at &#163;15 billion to &#163;25 billion capital costs, versus private funding. Its estimate for the production of electricity is 3.5p per kilowatt hour. It further suggests zero costs to HMG, plus taxed revenue, because tidal lagoons would be privately financed and carried out. It says that one would be environmentally damaging and the other environmentally benign; that one would destroy wildlife habitats while the other would create wildlife habitats; that one is opposed by environmental groups while the other is supported by them; that one would give flood protection upstream while the other would mean flood damage downstream; that there is a 10 to 15-year rollout for the barrage versus a two-year rollout, although I suspect it might be more than that; that further HMG-funded studies are proposed versus being ready to build on receipt of consent; and so on. Those are the benefits that it says that its system of lagoons would have over the barrage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07121360000335"></a>Tidal stream technology is going ahead and being assessed at present. That has large potential. Both tidal lagoons and tidal streams are estimated to be able to produce the same amount of electricity&#151;some claim more&#151;than would the Severn barrage itself. Capital costs of the Cardiff-Weston barrage would be &#163;15 billion; to produce the same amount of electricity with tidal lagoons would be &#163;5 billion. Tidal stream would be &#163;6 billion plus a necessary grid connection costing &#163;4 billion, taking the total to &#163;10 billion. There are very varying estimates as to how much the electricity would cost from the output of these different systems. Cardiff-Weston is 3.6p per kilowatt hour, depending on which discount rates were used&#151;it goes up to as high as 22p per kilowatt hour, with a mean of about 12p. Tidal lagoons would be 3.3p per kilowatt hour according to Tidal Electric, but 17.2p per kilowatt hour according to DBERR, so there is a big difference there. Tidal stream has been estimated to be at 2.5p per unit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07121360000336"></a>In conclusion, varying information is coming from divergent sources as to the final electricity costs with different modes of electricity generation. The basis of the proposed Severn barrage is the La Rance barrage in Brittany, looking at design, construction, costs and calculations and the electricity output at sale. At 40 years of age, it is old technology but that is the basis, because it is a tested system. But we must ask

Undoubtedly, tidal stream technology could produce as much, if not more, electricity than the Severn barrage and the results of running this plant are emerging from work taking place in the Orkneys at present.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07121360000337"></a>Tidal lagoons have considerable potential and could at least equal the Severn barrage in their electricity output. However, it is vital that the Government grant a licence to commence the construction of a working lagoon model in Swansea Bay which would produce accurate data for comparison. Generating electricity from tidal power in the Severn estuary is a massive opportunity. Will the Government meet the challenge and have the wisdom to see that there is an alternative vision to a barrage, one which has the potential to produce just as much electricity and eventually more? The rewards for this are the creation of an entirely new and innovative tidal power industry in tune with carbon reduction objectives, a green industry with worldwide multi-billion pound export opportunities for British-built technology, and the creation of real, high-value, long-term jobs here in Britain. All that is required is for the Government to kick-start it. In doing so, they would also be saving for future generations one of the most important environmental sites in these islands. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

When I was in another place, our constituency boundary to the west was the middle of the Severn, from Sharpness to Avonmouth. During my time as an MP, great studies were done on the possibility of a barrage, and I followed them closely and met many of the people involved. Since then, of course, global warming has added considerably to the case for trying to exploit the tides.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07121360000339"></a>The exceptional tidal range on the Severn should not surprise anyone. If you look at the map of south-west Britain, you can see the huge funnel into the estuary between South Wales and Devon and Cornwall. That funnel faces directly out into the Atlantic Ocean, and the huge volume of water in the ocean is pulled backwards and forwards, primarily by the Moon&#146;s gravity, to produce the tides. That huge volume swirls up the estuary and is then sucked out again twice daily. The ebb tide is reinforced by the fresh water coming down from the Severn and its tributaries&#151;it is after all the longest river system in the country.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07121360000340"></a>The highest tide this year was in March, when the difference in height between the high and low tides at Avonmouth was 14.3 metres, which is about a foot higher than the ceiling of your Lordships&#146; Chamber. If noble Lords imagine a wall of water as high as your Lordships&#146; Chamber and several miles across coming and going twice a day, they will have an idea of the power which a barrage or the other facilities would be designed to tame. Of course, the height of the tide varies during the month and during the year, but the

Even on that basis, the Magna Carta Lords depicted above us would get their feet wet twice a day.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07121360000341"></a>It is clear that we must, as I am sure we will, harness that awesome natural power. There are various ways of doing so, as the noble Lord made clear, some of which could be pursued simultaneously, as they are not all mutually exclusive by any means. The barrage is only one way, albeit the biggest and most powerful, but it would involve some very large problems. I believe that we need to assess those problems once again and then decide&#151;and the sooner we do so, the better. The problems that would be entailed are well documented in studies over many decades. They need updating but it would by no means be wholly new work.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07121360000342"></a>First, there is the enormous scale of what we are considering. The front-runner among the various barrage configurations&#151;the Cardiff to Weston barrage&#151;would be 16 kilometres long and would cost nearly &#163;1 billion a kilometre, according to one estimate, which is half of the whole defence budget. The actual technology is not that complicated or advanced but the problems of construction in such a harsh environment are considerable: imagine holding back that amount of water when the barrage is half-built and you are trying to close the gap. I watched the building of the second Severn bridge. It is one of the greatest engineering marvels of recent years and should, incidentally, be much more widely appreciated than it is, but it gives an idea of the challenge. The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, mentioned the French barrage at La Rance. It is true that it is currently the largest tidal barrage in the world, but the Severn barrage, by capacity, would be 36 times its size. It is on a quite different scale.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07121360000343"></a>The habitat problem is well known and will clearly loom large in any decision. However, I want to draw attention to two of the other important factors. One is the problem of the timing mismatch between the generation of electricity by a barrage and the peak demand for electricity. On some days, generation and demand will coincide but on many they will not. The barrage would be expected to generate during most of the time that the tide was ebbing, but the output would vary even during the times of generation. The times when the barrage would be generating are calculable with precision well in advance but they cannot be chosen. The barrage will produce electricity when it wants to, when the tide allows.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07121360000344"></a>The SDC says that that is not a technical problem for the grid&#151;it is less of a problem, for example, than fluctuations in wind power&#151;but it is an economic problem. It means that electricity produced by the barrage must comparatively be so cheap that the other sources can be rested with advantage when the barrage is working. For a project of this scale, that is a high hurdle to overcome.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07121360000345"></a>The other problem is the silt. The river always looks extremely muddy and that is because thousands of tonnes of sediment constantly swirl up and down the river. The sand banks move about and much of the sediment is always in suspension. If we build a  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_381"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 381</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>barrage, thousands of tonnes of sediment will settle&#151;somewhere; the difficulty is knowing where. If they settle in front of the generating turbines, the problems will obviously be acute; if they settle in the sea lanes near the locks, then huge dredging costs will have to be paid, and, in my view, they should fall squarely on the barrage company.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07121360000346"></a>The Port of Bristol is the port in this area that I know best and it has done exceptionally well over the past few years. Of course, other ports are affected on both sides of the estuary and they are at risk, too. They are all most concerned that the locks should be large enough and sufficiently well managed. In my view, the costs of building and operating the locks should be a charge on the barrage and not an additional overhead for the ports. Anything else would be unfair and damaging in terms of both commerce and unemployment.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07121360000347"></a>When the Oldbury power station was built a few miles upstream from the older bridge, a tidal reservoir over a mile long and half a mile wide was constructed to hold the cooling water when the tide goes out. I was told that, after elaborate tests, it was carefully designed to be self-scouring. In fact, it is no such thing, and it has been necessary for a dredger to be there permanently since the power station opened many years ago. That shows the difficulty of forecasting what will happen to the sediment if a barrage is built.</p>

<a name="71213-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07121360000348"></a>So far as the barrage is concerned, I am a cautious enthusiast. It is potentially one of the biggest and most exciting engineering challenges of the next few decades, and it would change the environment, including that of those who live in the great cities of Bristol and Cardiff and the other towns nearby. We must investigate the problems and, above all, we must decide as soon as we respectably can whether to go ahead with it or whether to proceed with one of the alternatives. Whether by barrage or in other ways, we must harness the massive power of these tides and currents. Industry needs a lead. The Government must get on with the studies and then decide&#151;and the sooner the better. The new ministerial committee has been sitting for nearly three months and I hope that by the end of this debate we shall know what it has achieved so far.</p>

There is no doubt that climate change is the biggest economic, social and environmental challenge that we face, and we must do everything that we possibly can to address it, including creating more low-carbon renewable energy generation. However, the Severn barrage, attractive as it may seem in principle with a claim that it will reduce carbon output by 3 per cent, has some pretty big snags attached to it. The first is economic: it is a very expensive way to reduce carbon and to generate electricity. The sustainable development report&#146;s verdict was that it would not be viable as a commercial investment proposition and could go ahead only if it was provided, run and financed by the Government  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_382"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 382</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on cheap government money. There are many cheaper ways of reducing carbon, including some energy efficiency measures and, indeed, nuclear power. If the Government decide to go ahead with a new nuclear programme and we are going to build 10 or 12 reactors, why not build 14? I refer noble Lords to some very interesting work done by McKinsey on the costs of generating low-carbon energy and mitigating greenhouse cases. It looks at the costs and benefits of more than 120 greenhouse gas abatement options. We have a policy conflict looming in this area. Heads of state recently signed up to the European renewables target which may increase renewable energy generation but perhaps on a very expensive basis. My view is that the touchstone ought to be how we get least-cost carbon reduction rather than an artificial renewables target that may not be least cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07121360000350"></a>Perhaps everyone expects that the issue on which I will focus more than others is biodiversity and why the Severn is important. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, for going through some of the features of the Severn. Its irreplaceability is on the basis of the extent of its tidal range. This proposal would considerably reduce the tidal range of a large part of the estuary. The estuary is designated under the habitats and the birds directives, and I am proud that I was chairing English Nature at the time that that designation was put forward to government. That was 10 years ago, and the Government have only recently put it forward to Europe for final endorsement. The designation is a sign that the Severn is one of the more important estuarine systems in Europe and, indeed, globally for its salmon rivers, its intertidal habitats and the mobile sandbanks mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Cope, which are some of its most distinctive biodiversity features. It is a globally unique river.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07121360000351"></a>If for reasons of overriding public interest, which is the technical term under the habitats directive, the barrage were to go ahead, I can assure the House from my background of 20 years as a conservationist that it is not possible to create a replacement habitat elsewhere in the country to replace what was lost in the Severn. There have been proposals and suggestions that a replacement habitat could be created in the east of the country, perhaps in East Anglia in or the Humber. I should here declare an interest as chief executive of the Environment Agency, which struggles each year to create about 100 hectares of replacement habitat in response to its flood-risk management programme. I am not sure how the Environment Agency would see 14,000 hectares of habitat being created in East Anglia. Indeed, it would be interesting to hear the reaction of East Anglian landowners and farmers if it were suggested to them that 14,000 hectares of their land should go underwater in the interests of a Severn barrage. Nor should we kid ourselves that it would truly be replacement habitat. Nobody in the world has yet recreated a salmon river or a tidal estuarine system. We should also regard with a little caution the siren words of the Sustainable Development Commission report that habitat creation in the east would be an exciting opportunity in the face of climate change.</p>

It is one of the few sites in Britain that is designated to the highest level. It is important not only for the wildlife it protects but because of its signal value in terms of government commitment to protecting the few very high-value wildlife sites when, generally speaking, our biodiversity is diminishing across the board. It is not just a signal within the UK, but also in Europe. We hear very strong mutterings from, for example, Poland as a new entrant to the European Union and we see signs of backsliding in Spain, Italy and Greece against directives such as the habitats directive. If we were to override the protection of one of our few most highly protected sites, it would become open season and any proposition that had to respond to climate change would be capable of overriding these important designations. It would happen a bit here, but it would happen a lot across Europe.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07121360000353"></a>All of this is to be tested in the feasibility study, but I am nervous about the way it was announced. When John Hutton announced it at the Labour Party conference, he did not refer to it in a neutral tone of voice, but said in his statement that he was quite excited about the prospect. That seems to imply that there is already a degree of government commitment to this proposition before the feasibility study had even begun. Indeed, the tenor of the work in the feasibility study seems not to be whether this barrage should go ahead but how it can be allowed and enabled to go ahead. The big problem with high-profile, charismatic and politically led announcements is that they are difficult to back away from. I vividly remember in 1997 appealing to the newly appointed Secretary of State for Scotland to regard the funicular up Cairngorm as the white elephant that it has undoubtedly become since there is now no snow up there, and to use the opportunity of his arrival in post to cancel that high-profile, politically statemented development, but by then it was too late. We must watch that there is not an inexorable momentum behind this proposition so that Governments of any complexion will find it difficult to go back on it.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07121360000354"></a>I urge the Government to consider the barrage and the feasibility study in the context of what could be achieved by investing this scale of finance in cheaper carbon reductions; for example, perhaps in less damaging tidal technologies such as lagoons, in major programmes of energy efficiency, other renewable technologies or cheap nuclear that does not destroy the distinctiveness of this globally important biodiversity resource. I hope that we are not in a position where for the future we are of the belief that we cannot solve the challenge of climate change without junking other environmental resources. For me, that would be very much throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p>

<p><a name="07121360000578"></a>In my opinion, that statement accurately describes the position of the Severn barrage project.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07121360000357"></a>I was introduced to the project in 1993 when I was appointed to the Welsh Development Agency and shown papers at that time of the study that was created in 1988. Believe it or not&#151;I am sure many noble Lords may know this&#151;the 1988 project was probably Mark V or Mark VI in the historical sequence. The first reference to the Severn barrage was made by a Frenchman in 1911. We are indeed but four years away from its centenary, so to speak. The first government-sponsored investigation was in 1926, which reported in 1933&#151;a speed, one hopes, not indicative of importance. But the economic crash in that decade put an end to the English Stones scheme. This is now the location of the second river crossing.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07121360000358"></a>Between 1942 and 1945, the second government study was undertaken, driven by the energy shortage during the Second World War. In 1965, the focus moved from the English Stones to the Cardiff-Weston location. In 1974, the House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology studied the project. In 1978 the third government commission concluded in favour of the Cardiff-Weston location. In 1983 the Severn Tidal Power Group was formed, consisting, as we have heard, of major private sector companies. Then the Department of Energy, which carried out two preliminary studies, published the largest and most detailed study to date in 1988. This still remains the definitive work published through the tripartite players; namely, the then Department of Energy, the Central Electricity Generating Board and the Severn Tidal Power Group. With the dissolution of the CEGB following the Electricity Act 1989, a key driver of the project at that stage has still not been replaced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07121360000359"></a>I could go on and on with historical analysis but I believe that I have demonstrated that a great deal of talk has taken place over many years and that a considerable number of trees have been consumed.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07121360000360"></a>We now know that the report published by the Sustainable Development Commission in October of this year was largely constructive in its approach to the Severn barrage providing compliance with European directives&#151;which is easier said than done, as the noble Baroness has just illustrated&#151;with habitat and species protection being a central condition for a sustainable Severn barrage.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07121360000361"></a>On the other side of the coin, the European Union has severely criticised the UK Government for failing to meet its renewable energy targets. The aim of 20 per cent of electricity being generated by renewables in 2020 is now basically accepted as unachievable unless there is an immediate change in policy. We are often informed that the UK has the best potential energy resources in Europe. We are also more than aware, as has been so eloquently described by the noble Lord, Lord Cope, that the Severn estuary has the second largest tidal range in the world, and we are aware that it has a unique and dynamic environment. The Severn barrage alone  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_385"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 385</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would contribute more than 25 per cent of the UK 2020 renewable energy target. That is more than from all renewable energy projects now in operation.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07121360000362"></a>It is important that this project is seen and promoted within the national context of a co-ordinated plan to harness estuarial power around the United Kingdom, rather than something that may be good for Wales and the south-west. Of course it will be good for Wales and it will be good for the south-west, as the envisaged scheme will bring substantial job creation and economic benefit. With the planned new road and rail links over the estuary, the barrage will create a regional economic powerhouse, integrating the economies of the south-west and Wales. These facts are evidenced by support given to the project by the Secretary of State for Wales, the right honourable Peter Hain, and cross-party support in the other place. It is also supported by the First Minister for Wales, the Welsh Assembly, my noble friend Lord Cameron of Dillington, who unfortunately is unable to be here today, together with many business interests and academe.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07121360000363"></a>In 1988, the project promised the provision of 7 per cent of UK electricity, at an indicated capital cost of &#163;8 billion. Today, these figures appear to be somewhere near 5 per cent and &#163;15 billion&#151;illustrative, of course, of the significant increase in grid demand. The project would reduce UK carbon output by some 3 per cent and would, above all&#151;this is very important&#151;meet the United Kingdom Government&#146;s security of supply objectives, for it is a predictable, renewable energy source. It would have an indefinite life expectancy, as exampled by the successful barrage at La Rance, which has been running reliably for some 40 years. The Severn barrage does not preclude other schemes. There is ample opportunity for tidal lagoons further down the channel and, indeed, for underwater tidal operations, as supported recently by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, recently in this House in reference to the activity off St David&#146;s.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07121360000364"></a>Finally, the devastation caused in the summer of this year by tides backing up the river would be prevented in future by the protection of some 140 miles of coastline from high tides and storm surges. Let us therefore now break this mould of inaction by successive Governments over many decades and address positively and quickly the extraordinary opportunities that present themselves, not only in the Severn estuary, but around all the coasts of this sceptred isle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07121360000366"></a>I should mention my interests in this subject. I live by the Severn and in fair weather I sail on it most days in the summer when I am not here. My husband chairs the Environment Agency&#146;s flood defence committee for the Wessex area. I was given a dinner by the Severn Tidal Power Group, as were several noble Lords, earlier this week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07121360000367"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Rowe-Beddoe, so eloquently said, this debate has been going on for a very long time. I think there is complete consensus here that we should harness the power of the Severn. The big debate is over exactly how we should harness it. We should harness it because it is very predictable power and a constant power in its flow in and out. For those reasons, we have to get on with harnessing it. Perhaps the most depressing fact of the past few years is that the Government have really prevaricated over pursuing some studies that could have been going on; for example, into tidal lagoons. When we had the debate in your Lordships&#146; House with the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, we were pleading the case that this could be piloted, as the promoters wanted, in Swansea Bay. It is taking a pathetically long time to pilot such a scheme. That project, in the intervening time, could have been constructed and could be feeding in to the information that we will need when we come to deciding between the options&#151;because that is what we are going to need to do.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07121360000368"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, laid out extremely well why we should be very nervous of even looking at a barrage scheme. I completely concur with her conclusions about habitat loss. If we consider the small amount of habitat that would have been lost with the Dibden Bay proposal, it is quite clear that to replace the habitat that would be lost if the barrage were constructed would actually be impossible.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07121360000369"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley, spoke of the port of Bristol. If a barrage is to be constructed for very good climate-change reasons, we should also have regard to what will happen if we make shipping more difficult. Will more goods be air-freighted or will they have to take a much longer route to other ports? Some useful tables show what those longer routes would mean.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07121360000370"></a>As I live on the Severn, I see exactly how much that route is used. It is astonishing to see how much freight comes and goes. We must also bear in mind that the size of the ships will alter considerably. When the Panama Canal is reconstructed, with all the shipping that will come from China carrying the goods that we happily import from there, a completely different scale of ship will be required. I do not believe that that has been sufficiently factored into the barrage equation.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07121360000371"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Young, about the amount of spin that has already gone into this. It is possibly the ultimate spin. When I watched the BBC programme showing days in the life of Her Majesty the Queen, I noticed that she mentioned the barrage and the 5 per cent that could be obtained from it. I wondered where that figure had come from. Was it from the Prime Minister&#146;s briefing?</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07121360000372"></a>There is obviously a considerable amount of interest in the barrage, but it would be extremely dangerous if the Government had already come to a conclusion about where the feasibility study is going; it needs to be done on an absolutely level playing field. In an earlier debate about a tidal lagoon those interested in tidal lagoon promotion had secured private funding and needed only the backing of the  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_387"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 387</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>DTI but they had considerable problem in getting the then DTI to agree to meetings to discuss it. It took Defra and the efforts of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, to get everyone in one room. There is a history of not providing a level playing field.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07121360000373"></a>Possibly my only disagreement with the noble Baroness, Lady Young, is when she speaks of &#147;cheap nuclear&#148;. I do not think there is such a thing.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="07121360000374"></a>Another issue that may seem a small detail to your Lordships&#146; House, although it is not, is the historical elver run up the Severn. Some noble Lords have mentioned the migration of salmon. We do not know whether disruption due to the barrage will cause a complete and catastrophic failure of the elvers.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="07121360000375"></a>What do I want? I want a completely fair and level playing field. Although we know we can get 5 per cent electricity from a barrage, that barrage will cost in the region of &#163;15 billion to &#163;20 billion and the Government should be looking at what they can harness from the Severn for that amount of money. I have done only a back-of-the-envelope calculation but perhaps the Minister can do a better one. I think that might provide for up to 150 tidal lagoons. The Minister needs to ask his officials to estimate how much power that would provide. There could be an enormous benefit as there would be less transmission loss. A barrage will send its electricity far greater distances, whereas tidal lagoons could feed through the grid into the local communities, in Wales or on the north and south-west coast.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="07121360000376"></a>What will the national grid competition be? The Government say that they will commit to new nuclear build, so we are probably looking at a new Hinkley Point C, if they go ahead with that. We already have a commitment to an onshore wind farm at Fullabrook Down. I support the proposal&#151;I should declare an interest as I chair the economic advisory group for it&#151;for the Atlantic Array offshore wind farm north of Lundy Island. There are a lot of national grid pressures on that area. I wonder whether something centralised like the barrage is even feasible in terms of grid connection. Even if it were, the grid loss needs to be put into the equation.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="07121360000377"></a>I hope that the Government will therefore put an extraordinary amount of energy into the feasibility study and make up the time that they have lost to date by dragging their feet on marine energy. I hope that there is a completely level playing field and that the extraordinary habitat represented by the Severn is not lost. However, our drive to solve climate change must not mean that we sacrifice everything else on that altar.</p>

Despite the obvious problems outlined by a number of speakers, the barrage is needed. I line myself up with the remarks made by my noble friend Lord Cope of Berkeley and the noble Lord, Lord Rowe-Beddoe, in thinking that it is needed. I have picked &#147;need&#148; as my text.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07121360000380"></a>The Government need the barrage to attain their target of obtaining 20 per cent of energy from renewables by 2020&#151;full stop. With no barrage, I doubt whether the target will be achieved. Secondly, the country needs a balanced and secure energy supply derived from a broad spectrum of sources, everything from second-generation nuclear, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, just referred, to first-generation barrages, of which this would be the first.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="07121360000381"></a>Thirdly, the public, who are now alert to and well informed on environmental issues, need a process of information and consultation on the Severn barrage that is open and transparent. There, for the second and last time, I will agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. I do not want to harm her reputation by agreeing with her too often, but she is absolutely right to say that we need a level playing field in any ongoing process of consultation. It needs to be open and transparent; if it is not, not only regional but national consent would, probably, be withheld and life would be difficult for this or any future Government who sought to have the barrage.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="07121360000382"></a>Fourthly, the green movement, writ large, needs to move on and embrace a new realism about where future energy is coming from, while being vigilant over potential environmental degradation and determined to seek environmental enhancement at every turn. The Sustainable Development Commission is showing a broad-minded lead here, which pleasantly surprised me. Some members seem to have joined what might be thought of as the new realist environmental movement, changing their minds from where they were about 20 years ago. No one should pour contempt on them for doing that. After all, John Maynard Keynes was once teased or derided for changing his mind on some great economic issue. He said, &#147;My Lords&#148;&#151;well, he did not say that; coming from King&#146;s College, Cambridge, he probably said, &#147;My Dears&#148;&#151;&#147;I think that when the facts change, I need to change&#148;. The facts have changed in the last 20 years.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="07121360000383"></a>Fifthly, we should remember that the landscape around the Severn, to which the noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth, referred, is largely manmade. That includes some of the estuary margins. Equally, some severe tidal environments would be damaged, destroyed or altered in various ways. If that is the case, there must be offsetting contributions to habitats and environments elsewhere, even though it is certain that that exact environment can never be replicated. There would also be much gain through the establishment of new protection zones in the area. We shall have to get acclimatised during this debate to the terms &#147;habitat offsets&#148; and &#147;environmental gains&#148;, in exactly the same way as anyone who serves on local councils is used to &#147;planning gains under Section 106 provisions&#148;. There should be a clear grasp of what those phrases mean.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="07121360000384"></a>Sixthly in this little litany of needs, the Government need the construction industry, if this is to go ahead, to be confidently engaged as genuine long-term partners. Behind the industry are shareholders and investors who will need to have confidence in the business case behind the construction of the barrage. I have great confidence in the abilities of our equally great British construction companies, such as Sir Robert McAlpine, Taylor Woodrow or Balfour Beatty, all of which have shown great interest in at least the potential of becoming involved in the barrage construction. If the process gets going, those companies will have to take on massive financial and construction risks over a sustained period, during which I suspect that the &#163;15 billion headline figure may multiply more than a little in the uncertainties of such a great construction project. No one should underestimate this. If we want the barrage to be funded and constructed by the private sector, the Government and everyone else must be realistic about the risk that companies and shareholders take on. There needs to be a high degree of certainty about the appraisal process and the subsequent planning process. In this, the management of risk will be paramount, as the Minister understands all too well, with his distinguished past.</p>

<a name="71213-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="07121360000385"></a>Seventhly, on the other side of the construction coin, the construction industry writ large needs continually to recognise the need on its part for openness, transparency and genuine engagement with regional and environmental concerns. Over the past few years, the construction industry has been going through quite a public period of self-examination, commissioning various reports, and much angst over what has been seen sometimes as tough and adversarial attitudes to customers and between companies. That has been apparent from the housebuilding end of the industry through to the large-scale and tough concrete-pouring end of the industry, wherein certainly lies the barrage. If the construction industry wishes to help to promote the barrage, it must be thoroughly modern and listen to all the concerns that arise, whether from the environmental world or the ports, which feel that their activities may be adversely affected. It is sometimes like treading on eggshells and, if we are to proceed, the industry has to recognise the need for openness and transparency in all that it does.</p>

I declare an interest as president of the Welsh Salmon and Trout Angling Association and the Radnorshire Wildlife Trust and as the owner of a small fishery on the upper Wye. My main interest is in fisheries and wildlife generally, especially in Wales, where I live.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="07121360000389"></a>I have been concerned for a long time about the likely impact on migrating fish of a conventional Severn barrage. In 1986, 21 years ago, I asked in the House whether the Government would satisfy themselves that, if a Severn barrage were to be built, migrating fish would be able to pass through it without excessive loss. A year later, I asked whether the Government were aware of research in the United States suggesting that fish passing through Kaplan turbines, a type then planned for the barrage, had an instantaneous mortality rate of between 11.5 per cent and 80 per cent, and that 43 per cent of salmon smolts passing through such turbines lost 20 to 28 per cent of their scales, while 75 per cent of the survivors had gross or microscopic lesions.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07121360000390"></a>In 1992, when moving a Motion on barrages, I said that to the best of my belief scientists had so far found no way in which a yard-long fish, swimming strongly against the flow, but being sucked slowly back through the turbine, could avoid being cut up by rotating turbine blades. Therefore, there could be 100 per cent mortality and the runs of salmon in three famous rivers&#151;the Severn, the Wye and the Usk&#151;could be wiped out. All this is still true not only for salmon but for other species of migratory fish, notably the delicate and vulnerable allis and twaite shad, the endangered species for which the special habitat conditions found only in the Usk, Wye and Severn sustain three of just four viable breeding populations. There are also two species of lampreys.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07121360000391"></a>The report from the Sustainable Development Commission and its accompanying research report 3&#151;all 250 pages of it&#151;give us valuable and up-to-date background. Reading these reports, one is left with a conviction that any measures taken to mitigate or to minimise the losses to migrating fish would not be effective. Research report 3 makes it clear that mesh screens across turbine intakes would be unlikely to work. So irreversible damage would lead to the local extinction of all the migratory fish. For wading birds, some have suggested that we merely have to provide an area of mudflats the size of Dorset. The noble Baroness, Lady Young, gave short shrift to that proposal. Still less is creating an alternative habitat for fish a practicable option. We cannot seriously contemplate creating replicas of the Severn, Wye and Usk, nor can we replace the unique genetic make-up of these rivers, which is what brings fish back to the rivers where they were born.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07121360000392"></a>The Severn estuary is beautiful and rich in wildlife. It has also unique features such as the Severn bore. It is protected by a whole range of statutory designations, which were described by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey; the marine Bill may provide more. Apart from that, the Wye and the Usk are SACs in their own right. It is the habitats directive that creates problems for the barrage project. The SDC deals carefully, on page 131 of its report, with the argument that EU directives do not take adequate account of the challenge of climate change and the suggestion that there might be a one-off derogation from EU environmental legislation. On page 144, the report concludes,</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000632"></a>&#147;that it would be untenable for the Government to take a decision in favour of a Severn barrage unless it is prepared ... to demonstrate its commitment to upholding the integrity of the environmental legislation and the processes it has signed up to. Failure to do so would undermine the Directives, set a dangerous precedent to other EU Member States and countries elsewhere in the world, and would not deliver a Severn barrage consistent with the UK&#146;s agreed framework for sustainable development&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000579"></a>It says on page 147 that,</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000633"></a>&#147;if compliance with the Directives is found to be scientifically or legally unfeasible, then proposals for a Severn barrage should not be pursued&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000580"></a>So far as migrating fish are concerned, this means that unless a way can be found for them to avoid passing through the turbines, to travel up to the rivers with which they have a genetic link and then to return, a conventional barrage within the Severn estuary should not be built.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07121360000393"></a>The environmental downside of the barrage project and its enormous costs were evidently decisive in persuading the Government four years ago that it would not be fruitful to pursue plans for it, as announced in this House by the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury of Turville, on 13 January 2004.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07121360000394"></a>We are required to do all that we can to deal with climate change and reduce carbon emissions, but there are many alternatives, not least nuclear power and especially tidal stream technology, as discussed in the SDC report. Those need to be carefully considered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="07121360000395"></a>As a nation, we have had a series of disasters, for which the Government have, I am afraid, been responsible: the debacle of our intervention in Iraq, the loss of two disks containing the personal details of 25 million people that were sent out by HM Revenue and Customs, the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease caused by infected drainage at government-controlled institutions at Pirbright, and so on. The Prime Minister promised the Liaison Committee this morning that failure in public service delivery would no longer be tolerated. He added:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000581"></a>That is encouraging, but it seems all too likely that a Severn barrage would fail, most probably on environmental grounds. We do not want another big failure. Let us for once get something right. We should concentrate on some of the other promising technologies now being explored and leave the waters of the Severn, the Wye and the Usk to the birds and the fish.</p>

Throughout the world, there is a shortage of electricity. It is not a matter for the UK alone. We know that China plans 544 new coal-fired power stations, plus the immense output of the Three Gorges dam. They are all indicative of the situation in the world. As nations develop, so the demand grows and the environment is under increasing threat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="07121360000397"></a>In the Severn area in Wales, two of our nuclear power stations have already stopped production&#151;Trawsfynydd and Hinkley Point A. The other three, Hinkley Point B, Oldbury and Wylfa, are nearing the end of their useful lives. We have a problem: as they go out of service, what is to replace them? Some people support new nuclear power stations, but others see the problems that go with them. I shall not go into them at length, other than to say that I pass Trawsfynydd possibly more often than anybody else in this Chamber. I think that my great-great-grandchildren also will pass it before it is able to be demolished. Nuclear power stations are expensive to maintain. For many years to come, we will have to face that problem.</p>

Even in the very sunny resort of Llandudno from which I come, I assure noble Lords that there is not enough sunshine to merit a great solar project.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="07121360000399"></a>Such projects are already proposed. The Gwynt y Mor project in Llandudno Bay would consist of 236 wind turbines, each of which would be the size of Blackpool Tower. That area has been recommended also for tidal stream technology. However, the local community is saying, &#147;236 wind turbines? It will be the biggest one in Europe&#148;. Do we not need somehow to maintain close contact with local communities, whose environment will be undermined or changed by such developments? Perhaps we should incorporate a referendum in such projects. It might be able to say whether 236 turbines are too many, whether 100 or 80 are enough, or perhaps that there should be none at all. The local people must be kept on our side as we move with these developments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07121360000400"></a>We must accept that if we oppose nuclear power stations because we see the big problems there, we have to prepare to accept an alternative. One alternative, which we have not really discussed this afternoon, is energy saving. Perhaps this is not the debate in which it should be done. We think of domestic energy saving, but industrial and commercial concerns use far more electricity than a household. We have seen some progress with home insulation and energy saving in the home. I have suggested here, perhaps once or twice, to some derision, that as bulbs fail in the great illuminated seaside resorts, we need to replace them with energy-saving bulbs. I would not mention Blackpool, but I would mention Llandudno; there are tens of thousands of bulbs in these places. That should save a tremendous amount of electricity in those areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07121360000401"></a>There are, of course, other ways of doing it. Back to the Severn Estuary: the use of tidal power is, of course, the most appealing option of them all. We have mentioned three possibilities here this afternoon: the barrage; the lagoons; and tidal streams. As has been stressed time and again, this is an urgent matter. If China, India and the developing countries in Africa all need electricity, we must provide our own alternative, and do so very soon. Looking at the reports produced, the more I read, the more I tend to think that our best option lies in tidal streams. It is a matter for urgent, immediate, thorough and possibly final investigation. The decision must not be delayed because it is not a crisis for the future, but a crisis that is already here.</p>

<a name="07121360000402"></a><b><a name="71213-0011.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07121360000811"></a>The Earl of Liverpool:</b> My Lords, I join other noble Lords in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth, for giving us the opportunity to discuss this fascinating subject today. I found myself agreeing with much of what he had to say, particularly on the subject of tidal lagoons, of which I have been an enthusiastic supporter for some years now. Not surprisingly, I also strongly agree with the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, on that.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07121360000403"></a>As many noble Lords have already said, we have the second highest tidal range in the world around the shores of the UK, particularly in the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel. This is a highly prized asset, which we have been too slow to take advantage of. We have just had the Minister&#146;s announcement of plans to increase offshore wind power substantially. New wave power devices are receiving support and subsidy from the Government. However, wind and waves cannot be guaranteed, whereas the tides can; you can set your clock by them with absolute certainty, into the next millennium and beyond. It is a 100 per cent green and free source of energy, so I sometimes ask myself why we are being so pedantic about using it and, instead, concentrating our energies on the wind sector. I find that incomprehensible.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07121360000404"></a>Of the three ways in which our tides can be harnessed to supply electricity, I am on record in this House as favouring lagoons. This is because, far from being environmentally damaging, they can promote new ecosystems, they do not impede the passage of shipping and can be positively beneficial as the landward side of any lagoon can be used as a safe haven for ships, and even used as a marina. They would help to reduce coastal erosion and produce electricity for about 20 hours of every day. As far as I am aware, Tidal Electric Ltd is the only company actively seeking to build such a lagoon at the moment. As the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, said in his opening speech, they want to locate it in Swansea Bay and have been working on the project for at least the past seven years. They are not seeking any funding from Her Majesty&#146;s Government, although if tidal streams are being supported with funding&#151;which they are&#151;lagoons are equally deserving.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07121360000405"></a>However, I was pleased to read some encouraging words on that possibility in the SDC report entitled <I>Turning the Tide</I>, which says of tidal lagoons:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="07121360000610"></a>&#147;To help fill this information gap, the SDC believes there is a strong public interest in developing one or more tidal lagoon demonstration projects in the UK&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="07121360000582"></a>It recommends that the Government take this forward by providing financial support to encourage private sector or joint initiatives.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07121360000406"></a>The company, Tidal Electric, says that it should be possible to construct the lagoon for about &#163;100 million, which is relative peanuts when set against &#163;15 billion to build a barrage, and that it would have a capacity of 60 megawatts with an output of nearly 200,000 kilowatt hours per annum.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07121360000407"></a>This is an opportunity the Government should have been grasping with enthusiasm. Instead, the DTI, now BERR, has been consistently negative about Tidal Electric&#146;s proposals, even going to the expense of commissioning a report in April 2006 that&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;concluded that the company had seriously underestimated the costs. One of the main bones of contention in the report is that it does not accept what Tidal Electric is saying, which is that lagoons can be built using a rubble mound construction for the retaining walls. That is a completely different and less costly building method than that necessary for tidal barrages, which are built almost entirely of reinforced concrete. When the company conducted its feasibility study it appointed two engineering consultants, WS Atkins and Montgomery Watson Harza, both Goliaths in the field of civil engineering, to advise on the project. Both agreed that the rubble mound method was the most suitable and cost-effective option.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="07121360000408"></a>The upshot of all this is that the company has now reached something of an impasse. It needs seed corn funding of about &#163;2.5 million from private enterprise to complete the environmental impact assessment and deal with planning issues, but the negativity at the ministry guarantees that that is most unlikely to be forthcoming.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07121360000409"></a>We know what delay means in terms of lost chances to make early reductions in our emissions, and we know lagoons can produce electricity for about 83 per cent of the time whereas, using only the ebb flow of the tide, the barrage will produce power for only about 25 per cent of the time. We know that we need a working model of a tidal lagoon so that we can properly evaluate them, and that none exists at present. After all, there are a number of other sites around our shores for lagoons which, if built, could collectively produce 8 per cent to 10 per cent of our entire electricity needs. That is what tidal electric is offering with the Swansea Bay lagoon and, as I understand it, it has the support of the Welsh Assembly. We are being offered a gift. I say to the Minister, with all the seriousness I can muster, please do not look this gift horse in the mouth. The Swansea Bay lagoon is outside the area that requires scoping and a comprehensive study for the barrage. We should be giving Tidal Electric the encouragement it deserves and let it show us what it can do. So far as I can see, we have nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07121360000410"></a>I shall now talk briefly about the Severn barrage project. Like my noble friend Lord Cope of Berkeley, I give it cautious support. I have concerns about bird and marine life habitats and about the silting and sewage buildup. Shipping seems unlikely to welcome the project as it will delay ships&#146; arrival in port, be that Bristol, Newport, Cardiff or Gloucester. The  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_395"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 395</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>jury is out on what impact it will have on fish and fishing, although the noble Lord, Lord Moran, spoke in very worrying terms on some aspects of that. Overriding all these concerns, however, is the fact that the barrage offers real green energy that is not nuclear and would be much cheaper to build than a nuclear power station.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07121360000411"></a>The clock is ticking. We need to proceed with all possible haste with the scoping studies, environmental impact assessments and the SDC report if we are to get anywhere near reaching our renewable targets by 2020.</p>

After some years&#146; experience in this House, I sometimes think that that is also a law of politics, but that is life.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07121360000413"></a>We all need to remind ourselves that if we and mankind in general fail to curb our appetite for using fossil fuels and producing carbon dioxide and the other sophisticated carbon compounds that we pour out, the whole environment will be ruined anyway. There will be no Severn estuary as we know it anymore because, if sea temperatures and sea levels rise, the fauna and flora will change inextricably. We are in a situation where action must be taken.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07121360000414"></a>I was going to refer to the noble Lord, Lord Stern, but as he is not here yet&#151;he will join us next week&#151;I will say Sir Nicholas Stern. Sir Nicholas said that not taking action was not an option. We have to do things. Of course, the first thing we have to do is get our energy without producing carbon dioxide. One or two of us in this Chamber spent a full day earlier in the week discussing the Climate Change Bill, so we are already thoroughly immersed in this subject. But it is necessary to remind ourselves of the scale of the problem that we are looking at.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07121360000415"></a>The Government have pledged so far to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent from the 1990 position by 2050. That is probably 65 per cent or 70 per cent from where we stand today. One of the real pressures during the debate on the Climate Change Bill was whether in fact we did not already have sufficient information to suggest that there ought to be an 80 per cent reduction. If you start to envisage that economy, just over 40 years hence, there are one or two industries where carbon dioxide emissions will have to continue. I am thinking specifically of the smelting industries. There is no alternative there, because smelting is a chemical reaction and you cannot use electricity for heating in order to reduce ores to base metal. Some industries will have to emit carbon dioxide.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07121360000416"></a>What we are really talking about is a world in which all the energy that we use for everything other than those basic industries comes from renewable green sources or nuclear power. It is a much greater change than the 2020 figure that we float easily. Of course, it is much closer, but the 2020 figure needs to more than double by 2050. It needs to quadruple, so we have a really huge problem. That is the first thing, and I mention that in this debate to get into our minds the context in which we are standing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="07121360000417"></a>We do not yet know what will be the best options. Many people are saying that we must be open and have full-time to study to come to sensible conclusions. I agree with that, but we also need to recognise the immense pressure that we are under. Inevitably, mistakes will be made and we should not worry about that too much. If we are going to make progress, we have to take the chance that some of the things we do may be wrong.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="07121360000418"></a>So then we come back to the specific issue that we are debating: the Severn barrage. I am slightly interested in the comparison that has been made between building a barrage in the Severn estuary and the possibility of building 150 lagoons up and down the estuary, as if 150 lagoons up and down the estuary would not irremediably alter the estuary. They might not alter it in the same way as a single barrage would, but they unquestionably would alter the estuary.</p>

<a name="71213-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07121360000419"></a>We have not heard whether they would produce as much electricity or more; nor have we heard what the cost might be. My noble friend Lord Liverpool suggested that one lagoon might cost &#163;100 million. If that is so, I merely point out that the 150 lagoons in the estuary will then cost the same as the barrage. Whether we get the same amount of electricity out of it or not we do not yet know. I am into the business of producing equal and opposite arguments, which is not a piece of ground that I particularly want to stand on. However, I should enter yet another thought about estuarial barrages into the debate: I remind the House that the Environment Agency is discussing the possibility of a barrage across the Thames to protect London, if both the east coast continues to sink, which it undoubtedly will, and the sea level continues to rise, which it seems to be doing.</p>

It may be that the tentacles of the organisation are not necessarily discussing everything that is going on with the head, but that is not at all unusual in a vast and widely spread operation. These discussions are going on and if we consider the east coast-west coast and the problem of tidal generation and time, and we then put a barrage across the Thames, we do a lot if we use the barrage for a power generation to smooth out the peaks and troughs in generating capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="07121360000422"></a>If we then put a barrage across the second big estuary up the east coast, which is the Humber estuary, we would have virtually continuous flow tidal generation capacity across the country. We would then be in the realms of 10 per cent of United Kingdom electricity use. Of course there are all these other systems: there is tidal stream, wave and so on and all of them will undoubtedly have a part to play, as will wind and solar polar. I particularly wanted to speak this afternoon because it is easy to look at a

Somewhere along the way we are going to have to take decisions. If we are lucky most of those decisions will be right, but we need to recognise that we will be exceedingly fortunate if the word &#147;always&#148; applies.</p>

I come to the issue as a civil engineer. I briefly worked on the project in the 1970s and &#146;80s. I have nothing like the eminence in civil engineering of my noble friend Lord Howie of Troon. I am sorry that he is not contributing to the debate. I agree with noble Lords that there is a need for diversification of supply in the use of renewables. I do not think that that is under debate. Last week the debate seemed to be covering the North Sea and other places with windmills and today it is the turn of the Severn. We have to be careful that our concerns for the fish or the birds do not cause the lights to go out. The Government have some challenges ahead. They would not let the lights go out and maybe the third way is energy saving, as the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said. We should be harnessing what people perceive as free electricity from the tides.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07121360000424"></a>I agree with many noble Lords on tidal stream technology. Sitting generators on the sea bed and letting the tide go backwards and forwards would seem simple. Unless you are a submarine, they do not get in the way. I hope that the Government will take tidal stream a bit more seriously and I expect that my noble friend will tell us about that when he winds up.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="07121360000425"></a>I am bemused by the different claims we have heard today and elsewhere about the benefits of lagoons and barrages, because they are variations of the same technology&#151;they allow the water in and out, and power is generated by the difference in head between one side of the generator and the other. Whether that is done on both the flood and the ebb, or just on the ebb, is debatable; I do not know, but it seems simply that the benefits relate to the volume of water times the head as the maximum generating capacity, and the costs are the capital costs and some maintenance. The costs are to do with the volume of materials, rocks and any other works needed. I shall return to that. Large volumes of water are involved, but I do not believe that the technology is impossible&#151;it is used in major dam constructions around the world. That technology applies equally to something as big as the Severn barrage and smaller lagoons. It is good that engineering companies are debating whether the best method is concrete, rock or whatever.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="07121360000426"></a>However, I take issue with the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, on the question of a new Thames barrier&#151;whether it is being promoted by the Environment Agency or someone else. I am sure that that is not the case, because the noble Baroness, Lady Young, would have told us. The Thames Barrier is closed only when a high tide is forecast, because ships have to go through it and there is not much constraint to the tide. I  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_398"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 398</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>assume that the same would apply to any new Thames barrier, especially as the Government have given planning permission for something called the London Gateway, which is an enormous port development of what used to be called Canvey Island. A Thames barrier is a very different issue to a Severn barrier, which relies on a big head difference to generate electricity.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07121360000427"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cope, and the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, talked about the timing of tides. I remember when I was working on that, someone discovered that because there was three hours&#146; difference between the tides of Morecambe Bay and the Severn, if both had a barrages working to the same capacity there would be an almost continuous supply of electricity for 24 hours a day. If the timing is not right&#151;well, it is down to King Canute, is it not? There is not much else we can do about it.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07121360000428"></a>More serious is the effect on ports, which one or two noble Lords mentioned. Bristol, Cardiff, Newport and Sharpness are clearly worried by the construction of a barrage that would prevent access to the deep sea. It is worth reflecting on the port industry in the UK. I suspect that some noble Lords will know that congestion in the ports in the south-east of England is so great that the shipping lines have put a fairly hefty premium on any container that is delivered there. So the ports on the west coast of England and further north up the east coast are experiencing some revival. They expect that to continue. The forecasts for traffic in ports are quite frightening. I was in Amsterdam last week where I listened to the head of the port of Rotterdam saying that traffic through Rotterdam was expected to grow by 10 per cent every year for the foreseeable future. Provision is being made to build more ports and extend the capacity to cope with that. Okay, Rotterdam has a big hinterland, but I do not think that the economics will change very much. Whether the big ships come to the UK or we have feeders will not make a lot of difference.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="07121360000429"></a>So I suspect that the ports in the west of England have quite a future, especially considering that, when you look at the geography, the south Wales ports and Bristol are actually very close to the Midlands&#151;almost closer than the ports of south-east England. I know that there is a longer steaming time around the coast, but any barrage would have to take seriously into account the needs of those ports and provide for locks. The port of Amsterdam is the fourth biggest in that part of the continent between Hamburg and France. It is fed by a canal with locks. They are just building a few more locks and I believe there will be four to take the biggest ships that they believe they can handle. It might be possible if we planned it in advance, but I would worry whether adding an extra lock or two when the demand increased through a barrage would lead to arguments about who would pay, when it would be done and the effect it would have on the port, which would be pretty stifling. Compare this to what they are doing in Amsterdam, where it is a case of, &#147;We have got to do this, we have got to find the money, it will be done and the Government will pay&#148;. That does not happen here. We have got to be very careful about the effect on ports and ensure that they are provided with locks that allow them to remain competitive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="07121360000430"></a>I am slightly attracted by the idea of lagoons. If they can be constructed in a place that does not cut off ports and does not affect the environment so much, that seems to be quite an advantage.</p>

I was involved in the Channel Tunnel and yes, it got built, but the estimates of cost overruns and the risks and so on between the public and private sector lead me to conclude that Governments are not very good at big projects. I am not sure that the private sector is any better. It rather depends on who is taking the risks when things go wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="07121360000432"></a>The construction industry will, of course, welcome a barrage or lagoons but, if they run out of money, or if it goes wrong, who is going to pick up the tab? I rather favour the Friends of the Earth view in Wales, which is that a big lagoon is much more cost-effective in capital costs and the price of electricity and it would have the added advantage of keeping the ports open. That is a really important matter; I worry about what would happen and whether the ports would be able to survive and prosper with a big barrage across the Severn.</p>

<a name="07121360000433"></a><b><a name="71213-0012.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07121360000816"></a>Lord Cotter:</b> My Lords, first, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, for calling this very timely debate. It has provoked much discussion and teased out many points that needed to be teased out, among which was the need for prompt action. His initiative has enabled a good discussion.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="07121360000434"></a>We have had a good debate, which has thrown up many issues. For environmental reasons, an alternative renewable source of energy needs much consideration, but we must also ensure that we have real security of supply for these islands. There is certainly still a need for consideration of many issues. As the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, rightly said, there are many challenges to come. Some of these can be examined only by precise, detailed modelling which, importantly, needs to be done by independent people with no particular axe to grind. There is support for this from many others, including the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, who called for a level playing field and for investigations to start as soon as soon as possible. So, indeed, did the noble Lords, Lord Cope and Lord Rowe-Beddoe. Time must not be lost.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="07121360000435"></a>We cannot ignore the potential financial costs of building a barrage. Special measures will have to be taken for environmental reasons and also to meet any concerns there may be over flooding. Further, the cost per unit of energy will have to be a factor. The Government&#146;s duty is to secure our energy, so they therefore have a responsibility to ensure that any future project is adequately supported and funded. The noble Lord, Lord Patten, rightly emphasised the need for security of supply.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="07121360000436"></a>From this debate, it is clear that there needs to be a full investigation of the technical aspects, including in  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_400"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 400</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relation to lagoons&#151;a point referred to by a number of noble Lords. In addition, any investigation must have a clear timescale and there must be a clear programme for assessing the project.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="07121360000437"></a>On the economic aspects, although the work would create jobs, there are concerns about whether the Port of Bristol, for example, would be able to operate properly with delays through locks and some ships being diverted elsewhere, with a consequent loss of business. However, were a roadway to be constructed from the industrial part of south Wales, there could be economic benefits, and that would bring pressure for development. The noble Lord, Lord Patten, talked about costs and I would hope that, as time went on, the project would not turn into another Olympic Games in terms of their escalation.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="07121360000438"></a>The subject of flood defences also has two sides to it. This is one area that many supporters of the barrage instance as being a plus, but others say that, due to erosion and other reasons, it is far from certain that flood defences would be improved. It would be interesting to consider that in more detail.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="07121360000439"></a>Many points were raised about the environmental considerations. The local impact on birds, fish and wildlife is, rightly, important. The noble Baroness, Lady Young, who has expertise in this area, rightly pointed out that it is almost impossible to find habitats elsewhere&#151;a matter that perhaps I had not considered sufficiently. My noble friend Lady Miller supported that point.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="07121360000440"></a>Equally, we have to find a way of dealing with climate change. As my noble friend Lord Roberts said in relation to a different point, we have to look urgently at the international view on this and not just at our own local or national needs. The local impact may be a problem but, in the round, we need to provide long-term habitats and something has to be done somewhere. Therefore, although there is a concern about wildlife, there is also a big question of how we address climate change, which affects wildlife everywhere.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="07121360000441"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moran, made a specific and welcome contribution on the subject of fish and fisheries&#151;an issue on which he clearly has great knowledge. Answers are obviously needed on that and I hope that they will be provided.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="07121360000442"></a>Climate change is a big problem. As the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said, there is a tremendous need for possibly even stronger action to be taken, as the present proposals may not be adequate. If we are to meet the concerns about the environment, it is clear that very serious thought needs to be given to a number of ideas, and chief among them could well be lagoons.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="07121360000443"></a>Lagoons have been mentioned by many contributors this afternoon. Lagoons would perhaps help in terms of not destroying habitats, many of which have existed for 15,000 years, and it should be remembered that 65,000 birds flock to the estuary. The tenor that I picked up from the debate is that a lot of time has been lost in addressing this issue and that there has been a loss of government focus on the matter. The noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, spoke in great detail about lagoons. His contribution certainly made me think that it is a very serious subject, and clearly people have  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_401"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 401</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>done serious work on it. Perhaps there has not been sufficient support from the Government but, after today, the Minister might consider that.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07121360000444"></a>The real thing that has come out of this debate is that where there is a positive there is also a negative, and that is the great difficulty. If it was just a question of erecting a barrage that would contribute 5 per cent to electricity, it would be wonderful, but there are issues around that because building a barrage would involve environmental considerations about the construction and the disruption. I hope that this debate has put urgency into this issue, and I thank my noble friend Lord Livsey for obtaining it. We need to ensure that the project is investigated and that if there is to be a project, whether lagoons or barrages, it will be securely financed and supported. I think that all noble Lords who have taken part in this debate have found it extremely interesting. The expertise has been excellent, and we all look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

<a name="07121360000445"></a><b><a name="71213-0012.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07121360000817"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth, for securing this important debate. He set the scene very well and listed many of the questions to which we need answers.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07121360000446"></a>He said that we know that the cost of the barrage will be about &#163;15 billion, but that estimate came from the figure in the studies undertaken in the 1980s uprated by the appropriate indices. It does not include the cost of compensation measures, which may be considerable, if they are possible. The good news is that Ministers have stopped being so negative about a Severn barrage. I was asking questions about it back in January 2004. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, spoke about the Government&#146;s prevarication on tidal power, and she is right.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07121360000447"></a>Today&#146;s debate is about the barrage, but it is vital that we look at tidal stream technology as well as tidal range, including the barrage and lagoons. The SDC report looked at tidal-stream technology, which clearly has potential, but is nowhere near ready for a pilot, let alone a full-scale device in the Pentland Firth. It is fortunate that none of these technologies is mutually exclusive, but the only one ready to roll from a technological viewpoint is the barrage. There has been much talk about tidal lagoons&#151;I received a briefing on them some time ago&#151;but since the technology is relatively simple, I find it hard to understand why there has been no progress and none has been built, not even small-scale ones. There may be a pump-priming problem; perhaps the renewables obligation needs to be tweaked to give further incentives. Can the Minister say why progress has been so slow? Is he convinced that the costing of lagoons is hopelessly optimistic?</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="07121360000448"></a>The principal benefit of the barrage is the production of nearly 5 per cent of the UK electricity requirement with zero carbon output&#151;its carbon output is lower than nuclear power. The SDC report indicates that the carbon pay-back period for the Severn barrage is less than 12 months. There are additional benefits of the barrage, but I do not think that they should be the  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_402"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 402</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>major driver. It is easy to measure the benefits of a barrage and possibly to identify the disbenefits, but it is rather more difficult accurately to measure and cost the disbenefits. When it comes to wildlife and biodiversity, it becomes extremely difficult and subjective.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="07121360000449"></a>I have no doubt that the barrage will change habitats, but global warming is doing so right now, as my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith explained. The SDC report covers ecology issues in some detail. It indicates that the birds and habitats directives need not be a showstopper, and the report is strongly against any derogation from the relevant directives.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="07121360000450"></a>It is vital that the government study should look at this issue comprehensively and in great detail before a project consent is sought. We need to know what species will be affected, how they will be affected and whether the changes will be positive or negative, bearing in mind the observation in the STC report that an increase in the quantity of a few species is no substitute for variety or biodiversity.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07121360000451"></a>Once the adverse effects are understood, we need to ask whether they can be mitigated and, if not, compensated for. The noble Baronesses, Lady Young and Lady Miller, suggested that compensation was impossible&#151;it cannot be done&#151;and my noble friend Lord Patten said that habitat can never be replicated. They may well be right; there will be some adverse effects on species that cannot be mitigated or compensated for. At that point, we should consider the uniqueness of the species and balance that with the overriding public interest. It would be quite unwise to discard this opportunity for a Severn barrage without having studied it very carefully.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="07121360000452"></a>My noble friend Lord Cope explained the awesome natural power of the Severn estuary. He said that we need to update the existing studies. He is right, but we also need to look at issues that we would not have looked at 20 years ago.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="07121360000453"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, has done us a great service by pointing out some of the difficulties, which are considerable. She suggested nuclear power&#151;quite rightly, in my view&#151;but it is a pity that the Government have made such slow progress in dealing with the problem of nuclear waste post the 1999 report of your Lordships&#146; Select Committee. Nuclear power is only part of the solution. What will happen if a technical fault arises in the whole fleet of nuclear power stations and they are all off the road? We know we need a mix of power sources and should not rely on one.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="07121360000454"></a>The speech of my noble friend Lord Patten was very helpful. He touched on the difficulty of industry accepting risk, particularly risk that it is not well able to take. He mentioned the need for certainty in the appraisal and planning process. It is to be hoped that the Government will consult industry about the financial structure of the project, rather than trying to invent it themselves.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="07121360000455"></a>I apologise for not responding to every noble Lord. Many noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord Cope of Berkeley, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, raised the issue of the ports that would be affected, in particular Bristol. No doubt there will be many effects, most of which  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_403"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 403</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will be negative, and these will have to be taken into account when assessing the economic case for a barrage. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, reminded us about the capacity of our port system, which is a major concern of the Freight Transport Association. Will the Minister ensure that any study will consider port enhancement and not only measure the cost of the adverse effects.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="07121360000456"></a>On stakeholder involvement in the study, it is vital that the green NGOs, if I may describe them in that way, are closely involved in scoping the study. I am concerned that officials have been given until August to scope the study or parts thereof. Why is the scoping taking so long? This is not a case of &#147;Rumsfeldism&#148;, if I may put it that way; before any decisions are made we must have all the questions answered. Certainly we cannot have any known unknowns. Some questions can easily be answered, and some will require detailed research and will take time, but taking eight months to scope the study will be very dear as it will cost about 4 million tonnes of CO2 if the project goes ahead.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="07121360000457"></a>It is important that the project is studied from every conceivable angle. It would be disappointing in the extreme to complete the project and then discover some adverse effect that should have been anticipated but was not. I hope that the Minister will not fall into the trap of reinventing the wheel by failing to build upon the excellent work, over many years, of the Severn Tidal Power Group. This does not mean that their assumptions should not be tested&#151;of course they should be tested. Some of their work is quite old and we now have much better analytical tools available. The STC report reminds us that the project runs the danger of diverting our attention from energy conservation&#151;a point made by many noble Lords. Quite so, but the barrage would only be 5 per cent of the problem, and the same could be said of any renewable energy project.</p>

<a name="71213-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="07121360000458"></a>Finally, we can study the economics of the barrage project. We can agonise over selecting an appropriate discount rate. But we, the current generation&#151;the current custodians&#151;will have to pay for the project if it proceeds. However, we will definitely be leaving all sorts of problems for future generations, and they will not thank us for them. We have global warming, rising sea levels, deforestation, depletion of natural resources, loss of biodiversity on a grand scale and nuclear waste. It would be nice to leave future generations 17 terawatts of electricity every year, absolutely free.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="07121360000460"></a>This is an important subject and the debate shows, if anyone ever thought that the big decisions on climate change would somehow make themselves, or would be easy decisions, how wrong they would be. There are conflicting interests all over the place. The difficulty for Government and Parliament is to work their way through these conflicting interests to try to find what is best for our generation and above all, as the noble Earl has just said, for future generations.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="07121360000461"></a>I think it is appropriate to begin by setting today&#146;s debate in the context of this country&#146;s wider energy policy. The energy White Paper, published earlier this year, set out our strategy to address the two major long-term energy challenges we face. The first is tackling climate change by reducing carbon emissions, both within the UK and abroad. The second is ensuring secure, clean and affordable energy as we become increasingly dependent on imported fuel. To meet these challenges, the Government have set four long-term goals: first, to put ourselves on a path to cut our CO2 emissions by some 60 per cent by about 2050, with real and substantial progress by 2020; secondly, to maintain the reliability of energy supplies; thirdly, to promote competitive markets here and abroad, helping to raise the rate of sustainable economic growth and to improve our productivity; and, lastly, to ensure, of course, that every home is adequately and affordably heated. Achieving those goals, which are easy to set out, will require a series of changes, developments and decisions over decades to come.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="07121360000462"></a>So we need a framework that delivers the necessary changes, and we think that that framework for action is set out in the White Paper. It is based on the principles of competitive energy markets, energy efficiency and a diverse energy mix, with more low-carbon sources of energy. In the gracious Speech on 6 November last, Her Majesty gave notice of the Government&#146;s intention to take forward policies that will help us meet our energy challenges. Bills covering energy, planning and climate change will provide a package of measures to implement the measures in the energy White Paper, strengthening the framework for investment in low-carbon sources of energy and energy infrastructure; ensure that planning supports sustainable development and measures to tackle climate change through an efficient and fair planning process; and set legally binding emission-reduction targets, requiring government to set five-year targets.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="07121360000463"></a>As the urgency of tackling climate change and achieving energy security increase, the case for more renewable energy has become more and more compelling. That is why the UK supports the agreement of EU leaders that, by 2020, one-fifth of all Europe's energy should come from renewables, a near threefold increase. We are completely committed to meeting our share. We do not know yet what that share will be but it is clear that, over the next decade and beyond, we will need to increase very significantly the proportion of our energy from renewable sources. The Prime Minister announced last month the launch of a consultation  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_405"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 405</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>next year inviting a national debate about how we achieve our renewable energy targets. I venture to think that our debate today may have been the start of that national debate.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="07121360000464"></a>I hope that our commitment to renewable energy such as wind, wave, biomass and tidal power, is clear. On Monday, as was referred to by the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform set out new proposals that could see up to 25 gigawatts of offshore wind operating in UK waters by 2020, with the potential to generate enough power for up to 25 million homes, the equivalent of all UK homes. That followed the announcement last month of consent for a 350-megawatt wood-fuelled electricity generation plant in south Wales in Port Talbot. We understand that, when completed, that will be the largest biomass plant in the world. As well as having some of the best wind resources in the world, we are blessed with some of the best tidal resources in the world too. Estimates suggest that tidal energy could provide more than 10 per cent of the UK's electricity demand. So it must make sense for us to explore the potential for harnessing that resource.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="07121360000465"></a>That brings me to what we are discussing in detail today. Over the past year the Sustainable Development Commission has conducted a study of the potential for tidal power in the UK. It published its report on 1 October, setting out its position and advice to the Government on tidal power. I should like to make clear how grateful we are to the commission for the work it has done. The noble Lords, Lord Livsey and Lord Moran, the noble Baroness, Lady Young, and the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, were among those who referred to the commission and what it said. Its comments are subject to praise and to criticism too, but it is an important contribution to this debate. I shall come in a moment or two to some of the remarks in its conclusion. The report is wide-ranging and considers the potential for different tidal technologies, including tidal barrages, tidal lagoons and the emerging tidal stream technologies. It has stimulated much discussion and perhaps even this debate, but its position on the Severn barrage has attracted the most interest.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="07121360000466"></a>Two of the report&#146;s key conclusions were that, first, the commission believes that there is a strong case to be made for a sustainable Severn barrage; and, secondly, that such a development may provide an environmental opportunity by linking a compensatory habitats package to climate change adaptation. Of course, the commission set a number of conditions that would need to be met for a barrage to be considered sustainable. Those require any consideration of a barrage to be within a framework that places,</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000634"></a>&#147;high value on the long-term public interest and on maintaining the overall integrity of internationally recognised habitats and species&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000583"></a>We welcome the commission&#146;s key message that tidal power can be generated in the Severn estuary within sustainable development principles. We are looking at the report and its conclusions with great care.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="07121360000467"></a>The scheme with which most will be familiar and the one on which most of the discussion today has centred is known as the Cardiff-Weston barrage. It was studied in some depth during the 1980s&#151;we are  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_406"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 406</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Rowe-Beddoe, for that information&#151;but discussed earlier than that. The possibilities of it using what the noble Lord, Lord Cope, described as awesome natural power are clear. It is important that this scheme does not preclude other schemes, as the noble Lord, Lord Rowe-Beddoe, reminded us. As proposed, it would have a capacity of 8,600 megawatts and an output of 17 terawatt hours a year, providing around 5 per cent of current UK electricity demand from a renewable source and saving some 6 million tonnes of CO2 a year over its 120-year lifetime. On that basis we have to consider it seriously, just as the House has this afternoon. It has been estimated to cost around &#163;15 million&#151;I take on board the point made by the noble Earl in his speech from the Opposition Front Bench; it will be one of the largest civil engineering projects in the world and by far the largest single renewable energy generation scheme in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="07121360000470"></a>It would involve building a 10-mile long barrage across the estuary, just downstream of a line between Cardiff and Weston-super-Mare, enclosing some 140 miles of coastline and it would take up to 12 years to build and commission from any decision to take it forward. The issues that will need to be addressed to harness the huge resource that exists in the Severn estuary are complex and challenging, but the benefits in terms of low-carbon energy and emission reduction are, to say the least, significant. Therefore, this is an option that we want to explore further. We have announced our intention to carry out a feasibility study to which every noble Lord has referred.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="07121360000471"></a>The feasibility study will include consideration of the environmental impacts that would occur and cannot be denied and the compliance that would be needed with the wide range of environmental legislation that applies to the estuary. The estuary itself is designated a Ramsar site&#151;an international treaty which, as noble Lords will know, provides the framework for the conservation of wetlands and their resources&#151;and a special protection area under the EU birds directive. It also comprises a series of sites of special scientific interest. In August this year, the UK submitted the Severn estuary to the European Commission as a candidate special area of conservation under the EU habitats directive.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="07121360000472"></a>Clearly, a barrage would have a major effect on the ecosystems of the Severn estuary. Much of the current intertidal area would disappear and, as noble Lords have heard, sediment flows would change and existing habitats would be modified. It is clear that the full range of environmental impacts must be fully assessed and understood. We have to consider how we might compensate for adverse impacts on protected environment habitats and species. Some believe that they cannot be compensated for; others that that is possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="07121360000473"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Young and Lady Miller, expressed the clear concern about whether there would be a fair and level playing field for this feasibility study. I want to make it crystal clear that we have come to no conclusion about the end result; that study will be carried out openly and transparently. It is very much a question of whether this scheme should go ahead, but the &#147;how&#148; is an important part of deciding &#147;whether&#148; it should. The feasibility study will consider different technical options for tidal power in the Severn estuary, including both the barrage and the lagoons. If any message gets across, it is, I hope, that our aim is to have a proper feasibility study that will lead to the right conclusion.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="07121360000474"></a>More generally, the study will look at various options for developing the tidal energy in the estuary, including their impacts, costs and benefits. It will consider in detail the various aspects of tidal development, including economics, which we have discussed, environmental impacts, on which I have touched, and compensatory measures. Your Lordships have also heard about the regional impact; that includes flood avoidance, any effects on the ports and potential socio-economic benefits such as job creation, which should not be left out of the equation. That study is expected to take at least 18 months to two years to complete. Throughout, the Government intend to do the work transparently and to engage the people and organisations that would be affected by any such developments.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="07121360000475"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patten, wanted a little more detail. I will lift the veil slightly, but I ask him to be a little patient as there will be important announcements next month, after the Christmas Recess. However, the study will be led by my department, DBERR, working together with a number of others, as noble Lords would expect. Defra will obviously be an important player and, equally, the Department for Transport will be one. The Department for Communities and Local Government and the Treasury will, of course, be there, as will the Welsh Assembly Government and the south-west regional development agency.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="07121360000476"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley, referred to a cross-departmental working group that has been set up to take things forward; I think he was referring to the ad hoc ministerial committee to which the working group will report. We are currently examining the scope of that feasibility study, as it is important to get right its organisational framework and governance to carry out the study. As I say, we expect to provide more detailed information on the scope of the study next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="07121360000477"></a>This has been a very important contribution to the debate and to our understanding on this issue. Much of the concern has been from those who are attracted by the idea of tidal lagoons. There is not really time to go into details about those, but changes are to be made to renewable obligation rules that will, as I understand it, potentially make it easier for those who want to see, for example, the Swansea Bay process going ahead. As the Commission said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="07121360000611"></a>&#147;We do not consider that large-scale tidal lagoon development in the Severn Estuary would offer any economic or environmental advantage over a barrage&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07121360000584"></a>That is to be found in the summary at page seven. The noble Earl reminded us&#151;and this, too, is important&#151;that there is a strong justification for the development of at least one tidal lagoon demonstration project.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="07121360000478"></a>I hope that the noble Lords who support lagoons as such will not hold to the view that the Government are definitely opposed to them. We are not. The feasibility study will look at lagoons as it looks at the barrage and, I hope, come up with the appropriate judgment.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="07121360000479"></a>We fully recognise, as do all noble Lords who have spoken, the potential contribution that tidal energy in all its forms can make towards our goals. That includes the tidal resource potential that exists within the Severn estuary. We are also very conscious, as noble Lords have been this afternoon, that we have to move ahead and come to a decision. That is what government is about and what the House would expect. However, we need to get it right both for our generation and for future generations.</p>

I thank the Minister, but I cannot possibly refer to everyone who contributed because that has already been done in the summations.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="07121360000481"></a>I have a couple of points that I need to make before closing the debate. There is the whole question of the impact of sewage in the Severn estuary as the result of the development of a barrage. There is, too, the whole question of the ports of south Wales and Bristol. The Chinese are starting to use 150,000 tonne container carriers, and that will be the shipping of the future. Contributions were made on the environment and, in particular, on the point that it is probably impossible to replace what might be destroyed. Then there is the whole question of improved communications; a railway bridge could be built, even possibly on the second Severn crossing.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="07121360000482"></a>There are huge legal constraints, which have been mentioned. I am pleased that the Swansea Bay lagoon project may be supported, but we want to see a working project that can provide us with statistics and information on that system. Furthermore, we must not forget about the Planning Bill now going through the other place, which will speed up the planning process and take away powers from democratically elected authorities, whether that is the Welsh Assembly, county councils in the south-west or whatever.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="07121360000483"></a>Perhaps I would be wise to quote my fellow countryman, Aneurin Bevan, who said that Britain was built on coal and surrounded by sea and fish. I hope that the outcome of the feasibility study will be that Britain will be built on alternative energy&#151;the electricity produced&#151;and that we will still have some fish. Some of the threats are to fish and bird populations. The moon keeps going on, so tidal power is guaranteed and can be converted into electricity; it is how we do that, as the Minister has just said, that is absolutely critical. I trust that we shall have a truly independent assessment of all this. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion for Papers.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="07121360000486"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of this order is to set the maximum level of civil penalty for employers of illegal migrants at &#163;10,000 per illegal worker. It is imperative to take steps, as part of the implementation of our immigration enforcement strategy, to bear down on the illegal jobs that encourage illegal journeys. We have made much progress in fostering a more constructive and realistic view of the substantial benefits that the country enjoys from our participation in the globalised world economy and the consequent flow of human capital across our borders. However, it is crucial that irregular migration is prevented and that we contain positive migration within a firm, enforced framework that removes the economic incentive to act unlawfully and provides a cost-effective means of sanctioning those who break the rules.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="07121360000487"></a>We need a system that reflects a fair and balanced partnership between the Government and employers in regulating the participation of migrants in the labour market, in which the rights and responsibilities are cleared. We must also ensure that we take appropriate steps to protect vulnerable workers from dangerous and exploitative working conditions. We need to take action overseas, at our borders and within our country to ensure that the system as a whole has integrity. There are many strands to our comprehensive strategy for tackling illegal jobs and illegal journeys. These include tougher checks overseas, strengthening our border controls, mandatory biometric identity cards, a licensing system for employers under the new points-based scheme, an increase in enforcement action, an enhanced checking service for employers, closer joint working with other workplace enforcement agencies and a new system of civil penalties for employers.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07121360000488"></a>The provisions in the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 replace the existing offence of employing illegal migrant workers in Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 with a new system of civil penalties where there are less than diligent personnel practices and a tough new criminal offence for employers who knowingly give work to illegal migrants. It is important to note that the repeal of Section 8 and the introduction of these new measures on 29 February 2008 will not provide an amnesty in respect of offences committed by employers before this date. Employers found to have employed illegal migrant workers between 27 January 1997 and 28 February 2008 will continue to be liable for prosecution under the 1996 Act. Therefore, if we encounter an employer with illegal workers after 29 February who started work before that date, the employer will face the prospect of prosecution under the Section 8 offence.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="07121360000489"></a>The new arrangements are not dissimilar to the current legislation in some respects. We will, as now, be encouraging employers to carry out some relatively  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_410"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 410</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>straightforward document checks on all their workers before employment commences to avoid unlawful discrimination. Clearly, it is vital to ensure that employers are aware of the changes to the legislation and how they will impact on their personnel practices. The Border and Immigration Agency&#146;s website contains detailed information on the changes that will be introduced next year. Comprehensive guidance on the new civil penalties scheme will also be available to employers. In addition, an extensive public communications campaign, which commenced last month and will continue into the new year, alerts employers to their obligations. That will be backed up with direct mail communication with employers in the relevant sectors.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="07121360000490"></a>We expect employers not to be forgery experts but simply to spot documents that have obviously been tampered with or do not relate to the person using them. Employers will face a new duty to carry out light-touch annual follow-up checks on workers who have temporary immigration status. Employers who carry out these checks properly will establish an excuse against a penalty, unless they know that the worker does not have permission to work.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="07121360000491"></a>In line with the Hampton and Macrory reports on regulatory enforcement, in the majority of cases employers who break the law will face an administrative penalty, as opposed to the current situation where they face costly criminal proceedings and the possibility of receiving a criminal record. Penalties will be on a sliding scale, which will escalate for repeat offending. The penalty system will be subject to stringent safeguards. An aggrieved employer will be able to make an objection to the Border and Immigration Agency and/or appeal to the courts against the service or level of a penalty. Employers who are found knowingly or deliberately to be employing illegal migrant workers will face prosecution. The &#163;10,000 maximum level of penalty that we propose is the right maximum for those employers who conduct no document checks at recruitment and have been found repeatedly to employ illegal migrant workers.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="07121360000492"></a>It is important to remember that these penalties will be issued case by case, with reference to a sliding scale that allows for the level of penalty to be set according to a range of factors, including the severity of the offence and the ability of the employer to pay. For instance, at the opposite end of the scale, first-time offenders who carry out partial document checks, report their suspicions and co-operate with the Border and Immigration Agency may receive a written warning instead of a financial penalty. Only in the most severe cases of repeatedly slipshod recruitment and employment practice will the &#163;10,000 maximum be considered.</p>

<a name="71213-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="07121360000493"></a>When viewed in the context of financial sanctions for employers of illegal workers in other European countries, a &#163;10,000-per-worker maximum sits in the mid-range. The figure of &#163;10,000 also reflects the estimated unit cost of enforcing the return of an immigration offender to their country of origin. The new sliding-scale penalty system, with a &#163;10,000 maximum penalty, reflects a proportionate approach to non-compliance but provides a sufficient deterrent effect so that employers will not want to risk their profits and reputation by using slipshod personnel practices and employing illegal migrant workers.</p>

The order follows seamlessly on from the Statement that we heard earlier today, because it demonstrates the importance of employers being certain that the people whom they employ, particularly migrant workers, are legally employed and not in breach of employment conditions.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="07121360000497"></a>The Minister may have referred to some of the points that I shall raise, but perhaps I may worry myself at them again. Will he make it clear how the decision on where the penalty lies will be made? The upper limit is &#163;10,000. I understand that it will be &#163;10,000 in each case. Some cases will be more serious than others and some employers may have a number of cases against them. So that one can get an idea of the measure of the offences, will the Minister say where a written warning will be appropriate, at the very lowest level, and where the &#163;10,000 fine might kick in? Who will make the decision about how much is charged? Will it be the Border and Immigration Agency? It can hardly be the Minister, who will have enough to do without worrying about that. If it is to be the Border and Immigration Agency, it will be helpful to have that on record.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="07121360000498"></a>If a number of breaches are found at any one time, will there be a different level of penalty? If there was one illegal employee, I presume that it would be one offence and one charge. If there were 16, would that then be deemed to be a &#163;10,000 fine or thereabouts multiplied by 16, or would there be some way of ameliorating that for employers? If they have made one mistake, will they be deemed to have made 16 or so at the same time?</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="07121360000499"></a>Section 15(3) of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act, states that,</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000635"></a>&#147;an employer is excused from paying a penalty if he shows that he complied with any prescribed requirements&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000585"></a>The requirements are more or less listed in subsection (7), but they are not completely identified. Have these requirements already been issued by order, or are they still to come? If the latter, will they be issued in time for consideration by employers before the order comes into force next February? This may be what the Minister was referring to when he said that it is on the website, but it would be helpful to know that.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="07121360000500"></a>Finally, the Explanatory Notes to this order say in paragraph 7.1:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="07121360000612"></a>&#147;The system of civil penalties is designed to encourage employers to comply with their legal obligations, without criminalising those who slip up in operating their recruitment and employment practices&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="07121360000501"></a>Will the Minister say where you slip from the civil to the criminal on this basis, or whether, as I believe, these are all civil proceedings and, therefore, you could not be criminalised under them? Apart from those points, we very much support these provisions, pending the few explanations for which I have asked.</p>

The noble Baroness may wish to refer to the draft code of practice on prevention of illegal working, which contains an explanation of how the penalties will be calculated in certain illustrative cases. Whether this document is sufficiently widely known I beg leave to doubt, because if she has not seen it, it can reasonably be assumed that many employers will not have seen it either.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="07121360000503"></a>I was pleased to hear what the Minister said about it being vital that employers were fully aware of the changes, because I think that has yet to be confirmed. I also agree with him that this order is without prejudice to the need to apply criminal sanctions against employers who use trafficked migrants, or who deliberately exploit persons whom they know are not permitted to work by, for example, paying below the minimum wage or exposing them to unsafe or unhealthy conditions in the workplace.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="07121360000504"></a>It seems a very long time since we discussed these matters under what was then Clause 15 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill. When we talked about the civil penalty clause in Grand Committee, our main concern, as I remember, was that employers should know what they had to do to check that a person they employed was allowed to work in the UK, and that undertaking the particular checks required would not impose undue administrative burdens on them. The explanatory memorandum says that they have to carry out specified document checks at the point of recruitment, and repeat the checks once every 12 months for anyone who has limited leave to enter or remain in the UK. It is fair to assume that most employers who routinely hire foreign workers are unlikely to have any difficulty with the prescribed checks, because they are not significantly different from those already laid down in previous legislation.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="07121360000505"></a>It is also claimed by the Government that, once the biometric immigration document is rolled out, the process will be simpler because it will mean that fewer documents have to be verified and copied. For the mean time, as I understand it&#151;the Minister will doubtless confirm this&#151;the list of documents that need to be checked is unchanged and was given in the April 2004 guidance, which is not particularly easy to find on the BIA website. I looked for it and was unable to locate it, so I rang the employers&#146; helpline and waited six minutes for an answer. They were getting a very large number of calls about this order.</p>

Analysis of the calls that are received on the employers&#146; helpline might help the designers of the site to identify, from the questions that are most frequently asked, which bits of the employers&#146; section of the BIA site should be given greater prominence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="07121360000507"></a>I had an e-mail yesterday from Ms Christine Lee of the Chinese Community Association, whose name will no doubt be familiar to the noble Lord because we had a lot to do with her and with the Chinese community during proceedings on the legislation. I am sorry to say that she thinks there are some difficulties for that community because they would not necessarily be able to identify false papers from genuine ones. I would like the Minister to say something about cases where an employer who is not a skilled immigration lawyer looks at a document, thinks it is genuine and takes someone on, only to discover&#151;perhaps too late, when the premises are raided by the police, as Chinese restaurants frequently have been in the recent past&#151;that they have mistakenly taken on someone who is not qualified.</p>

I thank the noble Baroness for her kind words about my initial statement. It is clear that your Lordships agree that this is a sensible way forward. The Statement about the SIA by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary, which I repeated earlier today, links in to the order. Part of the problem is that it has not been as easy to prosecute people under the old Act as it should be from now on. The new order is much more practical and useful.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="07121360000510"></a>The framework for assessing the level of the civil penalty relates to the number of times the employer has been checked, the number of times that there has been an incident with them, whether they have done any partial checks or no checks at all, or whether they believe they have done full checks. I have a useful guidance sheet, and it might help if I sent a copy to both noble Lords who raised the issue. It shows exactly how we will go about that.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="07121360000511"></a>We are still coming to a conclusion about the composition of the board that will make these assessments and exactly where it will sit. It will be a Home Office/BIA body. That work is ongoing and will be completed before the order comes into force.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="07121360000512"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned Section 15(3) with regard to the list of documents, requirements and checks that had to be done. We have produced a negative order, which was laid at exactly the same time. That lays out clearly the statutory excuse, the objections and everything that needs to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="07121360000513"></a>Under the 1996 Act there was no distinction between less than diligent employers and deliberately criminal employers who employed illegal migrant workers. That is why there were so few prosecutions. Replacing the existing provisions with these new measures will give us a lot more force and enable us to do something where it really needs to be done.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="07121360000514"></a>The list of documents has been revised, but I have to check whether they are different from April 2004. I will write to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, on that point to see whether they are different. I know that there has been a revision, but I am not sure whether they changed. I will have to get back to him. On the point of the helpline and the six-minute wait, I think that that relates to the other events that have been going on in the security industry area. The points that he made on guidance about the BIA site are of value and we will see whether it can be made slicker and any better. I thank him very much for those.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="07121360000515"></a>As regards the concerns from the Chinese community, as I said in my opening remarks we do not expect employers to be forgery experts, but just to see whether something has been tampered with or does not relate to the person involved; that should be clear. If they have tried to do that, if they have a concern and then something happens, the worst that would ever happen would be a written note saying that they have to be a little more careful. They are not the sort of people we are looking for. The people at whom we are looking for the big fines are people who clearly know exactly what they are doing employing these people and they need to be penalised for it.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="07121360000516"></a>I turn to traffickers. It remains that there is a new criminal offence for employers who knowingly employ illegal migrant workers. That carries a two-year prison sentence or an unlimited fine. That is correct, because we have seen some awful cases. It was important that that provision was made. Overall, the proportionate sliding scale of the civil penalty system&#151;I will be writing about that&#151;with the &#163;10,000 maximum penalty is a key part of our immigration enforcement strategy to bear down on the illegal jobs that encourage illegal journeys. I commend the order to the House.</p>

There are two separate issues but not within the order. The order relates to civil proceedings against employers. That would not criminalise them; it would penalise them. The Minister is referring to another process whereby there could be criminal proceedings for a criminal offence. In the explanatory notes those two become muddled together. The explanatory notes are probably only for us, but we need to be clear that the order relates only to civil proceedings that will penalise people.</p>

I have not read the explanation, which I should have done. If that is not clear it needs to be made clear and explicit. This is an administrative matter, which the sliding scale will make more practical. The other matter is still a criminal offence, so it is two separate issues.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="07121360000521"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the order we are debating here today will pave the way for the Government&#146;s new points based-system for managing the migration of those coming to the United Kingdom to work, train and study. The order sets out the new applications, processes and services for which we will charge a fee under the points-based system, such as licences for sponsors, and certificates of sponsorship issued by sponsors to those migrants whose applications they wish to support.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="07121360000522"></a>We will return to the House early next year to make further regulations specifying the actual fee levels for these services, relying on the powers in Section 51 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, along with the power in Section 42 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Act 2004, as amended by Section 20 of the UK Borders Act 2007.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="07121360000523"></a>In addition, this order will refine and consolidate the Government&#146;s powers to set fees for immigration and nationality applications in the future. Currently, the fee levels for applications made overseas are set through an Order in Council using the powers in the Consular Fees Act 1980, while fees for applications made in the UK are set in regulations before Parliament. Going forward, following the Prime Minister&#146;s announcement of the merger of UKvisas with the Border and Immigration Agency next year, all fees will be set through the same process, offering Parliament the opportunity to consider our proposals in the round. This will provide noble Lords with an opportunity to debate the actual fee levels that the Government are proposing for the services, applications and processes set out in this order.

Since I was not involved in the discussions on the Act, I hope that noble Lords will forgive me if I miss out something that was discussed then.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="07121360000526"></a>This amending order appears to add to the list of matters for which a fee can be demanded, making it a requirement for a fee to be charged to a sponsor seeking a sponsorship licence for a migrant worker licence. As I understand it, such sponsors are not in the list of those who are already required to pay a fee. Perhaps the Minister would give a little background on where in the original legislation the points system for a sponsor was introduced. I have been through both the 2006 Act and the previous statutory instrument and can find no mention of sponsors or points systems. I am sure that this is my error, but I  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_416"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 416</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>wish to be clear where this addition comes from. No doubt, if the Minister cannot answer that, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, will leap to my aid.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="07121360000527"></a>The order clearly adds the application for a sponsorship licence to the list for which fees can be demanded. It would be helpful to know to where this amendment is directed. Would the Minister also confirm that there will be a fee for each individual licence applied for by a sponsor who will be unable to do a sort of conglomerate application for a number of people under one heading? Could the Minister also tell us when the order in relation to the amount of fees to be charged in this and the areas listed in the previous order is to be laid? The previous order came into force in March this year and this order will presumably do so tomorrow&#151;it states that this will happen the day after the order has been passed. Thus the department appears to have had its ducks in a row to start charging for some six months, but has been unable to progress without the order giving details of the level of fees.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="07121360000528"></a>I noted that the Minister said that that would be laid before Parliament. I assume that it will come as an affirmative order on the level of fees. Perhaps the Minister would confirm that. I note, too, that a regulatory impact assessment will accompany that order and that it will be obvious to us that it has been laid, and does not slide past us. Other than that, I do not think that I have anything useful to contribute on this order.</p>

<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="07121360000529"></a><b><a name="71213-0014.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07121360000830"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> My Lords, I think that the answer to the noble Baroness&#146;s question is that the power to impose these charges is in Section 51 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. No doubt the Minister will correct me it that is not right.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="07121360000530"></a>The Merits Committee has drawn this order to the special attention of the House on the grounds that it gives rise to issues of public policy likely to be of interest, and I was rather hoping that the chairman of that committee, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, would have been present to spell out exactly what those issues are. The only one that is implicit in committee&#146;s report is that the Government have not provided enough information about the points-based system and the sponsorship proposals to which the fees are to relate. But the order covers the power to charge fees not only for services provided to sponsors for the issue of a licence to a sponsor, who is either an employer or an educational establishment, but to further classes of individuals who are applicants for entry clearance, transit visas, BIDs, and certificates of entitlement for the right of abode. The Explanatory Memorandum states that no regulatory impact assessment has been produced for this order, because that will be done before the further order, mentioned by the noble Baroness, setting the level of fees to be charged for the applications and processes specified here is made.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="07121360000531"></a>It would be useful to know whether the Merits Committee looked at the debates we had on the previous orders made under the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act&#151;the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order and the regulations that followed, and whether some of the committee&#146;s concerns were similar  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_417"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 417</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to those expressed on the previous occasions, which I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, will recall. As now, your Lordships were asked to give the Government carte blanche to set the fees at any level they pleased in the first order, and by the time we came to the regulations, it was too late for us to have any influence on the amounts that were being charged. The process of determining fees that are in excess of the cost of providing the service had already been decided by Section 51 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act, but I am pretty sure that at that time, Parliament did not fully appreciate that we were relinquishing all control over the amounts that were to be charged. There might not be any objection, if there were some guarantee that,</p>
<ul><a name="07121360000613"></a>&#147;those who benefit most from the immigration system should pay proportionately more towards the end to end costs of the system&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07121360000586"></a>but the unfettered discretion given to the Secretary of State means that departures from the principle are not subject to any democratic control. When they imposed huge increases in the fees charged to spouses, who do not necessarily get any economic benefit from coming to the UK to join their partners, our complaints to the Government fell on deaf ears.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="07121360000532"></a>In the debate on that fees order, we did at least have details of the amounts that were to be charged under the regulations, but this time round we have no information about the amounts proposed to be charged. It may be considered that the employers&#146; organisations and Universities UK are capable of looking after their own interests, and perhaps they are. But it would be rash to assume that because UK institutions of higher education have been attractive to overseas students in the past, they will continue to receive the same numbers of applicants if the amounts they have to charge to cover these new arrangements need to be increased sharply. The cost of the licences will have to be recovered, and so will the cost of the certificates of sponsorship issued to each individual prospective student; and since the certificate itself is not a guarantee that the applicant will be granted an entry certificate, the amount the university will need to add to the standard overseas student fee will be more than the cost of the certificate plus an allocated proportion of the licence fee.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="07121360000533"></a>I have spoken to Universities UK, which has been pressing for information about the new points-based system and its costs, and would welcome fuller disclosure. The first point Universities UK made was that the BIA should obtain a list of subscribers directly from the Quality Assurance Agency rather than requiring every individual higher education institution provide evidence of their subscription.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="07121360000534"></a>Secondly, it draws attention to the level of fees that are likely to be paid by a typical higher education institution, which has to cover three tiers of the new system: tier two for skilled workers with a job offer, replacing the present work permits; tier four for students; and tier five, which it says would apply to academic visitors and sponsored researchers. The sponsor registration fee is &#163;1,000; the tier-two employee certificate fee is &#163;200, and if there are 90 staff subject to immigration control, then by the calculations of Universities UK&#151;which are not definitive because the actual amounts  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_418"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column 418</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have not yet been divulged&#151;the total amount payable would be &#163;18,000. That is based on having 90 staff subject to immigration control. The tier-five visiting staff certificate fee is estimated at &#163;50, so for an enrolment of &#163;400, that would come to another &#163;20,000, making a grand total in the first year of the scheme for that particular institution of &#163;39,000.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="07121360000535"></a>In the second year, with tier four in operation, and if there are 2,500 international students at &#163;20 each, that would come to &#163;50,000. To save time I will not go through the rest of the calculations. If the Minister would like to have a look at the memorandum that I had from Universities UK, I should be glad to pass it over to him, but perhaps his department will already have heard from it and will know that its anxieties on this score remain to be satisfied.</p>

<a name="71213-0014.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="07121360000536"></a>As I said, these are not insignificant costs but of course they also involve an extra administrative burden. The universities are already undertaking much of the work that the BIA would otherwise have to undertake itself in the Student Batch Scheme, under which they check the credentials of students who apply for extensions of leave to remain. At the same time, they are being encouraged to take on more international work&#151;for example, through the Prime Minister&#146;s Initiative on International Education and the UK-India Education and Research Initiative&#151;and indeed they have to do so to earn the fees to make up for cuts in government funding.</p>

<a name="71213-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="07121360000537"></a>We are anxious that all these activities, and the substantial contribution that higher education institutions make to our overseas earnings, should not be jeopardised by a hard-nosed approach to recovering all the costs of the points-based system from users, and the universities in particular. That would be to ignore the intangible benefits that we get from overseas students coming to the UK. They pay indirect taxes, which surely must amount to far more than the fees, and they bring cultural and human value to the higher education institutions to which they belong and to the British students who interact with them. There does not seem to be proper recognition and acknowledgement of these benefits in the arithmetic; nor do the Government take account of the enormous problems that will be imposed on HEIs, which have to set their budgets for several years ahead but still face wide uncertainties around the introduction of the new system and the costs that they will incur.</p>

<a name="71213-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="07121360000538"></a>I am not certain whether Universities UK was sent the letter which described itself as a &#147;short, targeted stakeholder consultation&#148;. It was notified to the recipients by e-mail on 24 October and had a response date less than three weeks later. I should be grateful if the Minister would enlighten us on that matter. If it did, the BIA should have explained that this was the only exercise of its kind that it was conducting, because the term &#147;consultation&#148; is a term of art which technically means a process that lasts for 16 weeks and is open to responses from the general public and not simply from the targeted addressees. In fact, it would be useful if the Minister could inform your Lordships who received this communication and how they were selected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="07121360000539"></a>I mentioned the Chinese community in the previous debate and I should interpolate a note on them here. I had a telephone message from them this afternoon saying that they were not in receipt of this consultation from the BIA, in spite of the fact that they were assured all the way through the proceedings on the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act that they would be fully consulted before any of these changes were introduced. I ask the Minister how on earth the department came to leave out Christine Lee of the Chinese Community Association, or how the BIA managed to do it on his behalf.</p>

<a name="71213-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="07121360000540"></a>The BIA says that licence fees for sponsors of tiers four and five will be set at or below cost-recovery level. That is welcome as far as it goes, but it threatens to make the charges for certificates higher to achieve a balance so that overall, presumably, the total cost is recovered. One way or another, institutions of higher education and others will have to raise their charges to overseas students. I should be grateful if the Minister could say whether it is the policy intention that universities should be allowed to increase their charges to cover the amounts that they have to pay under this order.</p>

<a name="71213-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="07121360000541"></a>Turning for a moment to the individuals covered by the order, they have no powerful advocates to represent their interests and, as we have seen, it is the people who are not going to make a loud noise who are likely to be picked on for overcharging under the 2006 Act regime. In the previous round, the total charges imposed on a spouse were more than doubled to more than &#163;2,000 by the time that he or she obtained citizenship. The fear is that similarly excessive amounts will be charged under this order, particularly for BIDs, that every migrant staying in the UK for six months or more will have to pay whether that person is a student, a worker or a relative coming for settlement. That will be on top of whatever the migrant has already paid to get into the country, and there are no exemptions, or even discounts, for a person coming from a poor family in a third-world country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="07121360000542"></a>In its November report on the results of the consultation on the prevention of illegal migrant working in the UK, the BIA said that it will be consulting shortly on the rollout of BIDs. Does that refer to the letter that I have already mentioned? As far as I am aware, no such consultation has been launched, and I would like to know what the target date would be. Is the consultation going to cover the charges, bearing in mind that in the previous consultation on the charging regime for immigration and nationality fees, no mention was made of BIDs? These documents are not being issued in order to endow the holder with any rights or privileges he did not already possess but in order to enable the authorities more readily to apprehend and remove those who are not entitled to be here. It is also avowedly being used as a trial run for national identity cards, as the Home Office&#146;s regulatory impact assessment on the UK Borders Act openly stated. It is surely unreasonable to load the start-up costs on to migrants who are less able to afford them than the settled population. In fairness, the initial capital expenditure should be apportioned over the total adult population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="07121360000543"></a>It is unfortunate that these orders are being slipped past us by the Home Office when we have only part of the picture, as it did with the previous set of charges in March. We understand why it is doing that; it is to minimise the criticism and to ensure that when the charges are specified in a subsequent order it will be too late for Parliament to have any influence on the charging regime. We say, as we did then, that the manner in which this is being done&#151;minimising the area of debate once we do get firm proposals on the timing and amounts&#151;is not transparent and is not consensual governance.</p>

Attracting overseas students is a highly competitive business between nations. For example, the Australian Government are very active in supporting their universities to attract overseas students at little cost to the universities. Germany is immensely active in this, and other countries are too. It would be helpful to know the extent to which this is a major source of overseas earnings and contributions to the Exchequer through indirect taxation, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said. Because of the value of this form of overseas earnings to the United Kingdom, I regard as a material issue the extra costs that will fall on the university community as a whole and on students from overseas.</p>

I thought that this was a modest and perhaps slightly boring order, but it has elicited more interest than I anticipated. That does not mean that these issues are not serious&#151;they are&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, always raises them in a courteous and proper way and asks many useful and valuable questions. I now have a wodge of answers, but if I cannot successfully thread them together this afternoon, I shall answer them in more detail in correspondence.</p>

<a name="71213-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="07121360000546"></a>I shall first deal with the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, about the legislative authority for this and the date at which we might bring forward a fee regime. The legislative provision for sponsorship appears in the immigration rules which we introduced under powers obtained by virtue of the Immigration Act 1971. No additional legislation is required to introduce a sponsorship scheme but we made clear at an earlier stage that that is what we were embarked upon. We believe that a sponsorship scheme will encourage responsibility among employers and those who seek to benefit from migrant workers coming here. It will also encourage greater responsibility in the education sector, where there have been examples of abuse. We need do much more to ensure that people who genuinely come here benefit from our education system.</p>

<a name="71213-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="07121360000547"></a>I recognise the noble Lord&#146;s point about the value to our education institutions of overseas students. The Government have been very proactive in this field because we recognise that we operate in an aggressive

I have a friend who does marketing for one of the Melbourne universities. He travels internationally to secure new students and does a good job in that regard. We know from the past experience of our inter-governmental work that we operate in an international marketplace. That means that our fee structure needs to be competitive and we need to ensure that we have the right offer.</p>

<a name="71213-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="07121360000548"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked about the date on which fees will be set next year. I cannot give a precise date. We are following parliamentary procedures and we must work within the legislative framework. We must have the power to set the fees early next year and we will make the regulations using any additional legislative powers necessary to set those fees. At that point there will be an appropriate opportunity for a full parliamentary scrutiny of the fee proposals. They will be subject, of course, to the affirmative procedure in both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="07121360000549"></a><b><a name="71213-0015.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07121360000833"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> My Lords, one of the main points I made was that because of the procedures involved in these orders, as with the previous ones that we debated in March&#151;I think the noble Lord replied to that debate as well&#151;the House has to agree, first, that the charging should be made and, secondly, that the order is produced which sets the level of the charges. By that time it is too late, is it not, for Parliament to do anything about it because it can only accept or reject an order which is presented to it under an affirmative resolution?</p>

<p><a name="st_130"></a>
<a name="07121360000550"></a><b><a name="71213-0015.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07121360000834"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, I accept the point that Parliament is guided by the procedure. Before we get to that point, of course, we endeavour to consult. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, made a strong pitch on the consultation issue. The consultation with stakeholders ran from 23 October until 9 November. A consultation document was sent to more than 493 people and stakeholder groups, including Universities UK, and I am more than happy to set out the details of that in correspondence. We received 132 written responses; 92 educational establishments, 17 employers and 23 arts and entertainments responses were received. We received a further 31 responses after the official closing date for the consultation. We took the pragmatic view and accepted those responses even though they were late.</p>

<a name="71213-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="07121360000551"></a>We also held a number of consultation events which were attended by representatives of the education, employment and arts and entertainments sectors. We are particularly mindful of the arts and entertainments sector because we have been advised in the past of the difficulties which festivals in particular can experience when putting together their programme with foreign performers coming to this country.</p>

<a name="71213-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="07121360000552"></a>I cannot accept the allegation made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that our visa regime and the cost-of-entry clearance put off genuine students, or that that regime damages our international competitiveness. The Home Office and UKvisas have done a great deal to support educational exports. Our visa provides working entitlements far more generous than those of competing study destinations such as Canada, Australia and the

The points-based system will continue to support the Prime Minister&#146;s initiative by making the system simpler for applicants, with its online assessment process and clear entry criteria putting sponsors at the heart of the system.</p>

<a name="71213-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="07121360000553"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord for drawing to my attention the Universities UK calculations on impact. We are working with key stakeholders, including Universities UK, to develop fees that are fair and proportionate. We shall continue that work, obviously to the point at which we bring forward our order.</p>

<a name="71213-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="07121360000554"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked whether there would be any changes to the visitor category requirements or other consequences for sponsorship for visitors. We will shortly publish a public consultation on visitors. That consultation will examine visitor routes in general, because that is something that the points-based system does not cover. It will include provisions relating to family visitors. Visitors will always need to satisfy the entry clearance officer of their intentions and their compliance with immigration laws at point of entry. We aim to keep migrant fees at broadly the same level as their comparative existing fees&#151;that is our policy. The aim is that people moving from the current system to the new points-based system should not ultimately see too big a change.</p>

<a name="71213-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="07121360000555"></a>The noble Lord also said that we had carte blanche to charge whatever we wished: I do not agree. Those fees are set out in regulations. Where they are above cost recovery, they must be debated fully in both Houses, so there is ample opportunity to challenge our approach. He also asked for some response to the Merits Committee and its desire to see more information on sponsorship. We have published a statement of intent on sponsorship with more detail, and copies are available in the Library and on the BIA website. The noble Lord made further points about consultation. I think that I should provide the noble Lord with more details, in particular on the consultation on bids and its implementation. I will set those out in correspondence to the noble Lord and provide them also to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham.</p>

<a name="71213-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="07121360000556"></a>The noble Lord also asked whether it was intended that universities should be able to increase their fees to cover sponsorship. Ultimately, it is a decision for the universities, particularly those that are mindful of their competitive position. They will decide how to set fees and whether to pass on costs. As I see it, the fees for students will be kept at a modest and moderate level&#151;that is certainly our intention.</p>

<a name="71213-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="07121360000557"></a>Some of the other, more complex issues that the noble Lord raised I will deal with through correspondence, because I am not confident that I have all the answers with me.</p>

<h5><a name="07121357000178"></a>2.06 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07121357000014"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07121357000186"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Legislative Reform (Local Authority Consent Requirements) (England and Wales) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000015"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am delighted to introduce the draft Legislative Reform (Local Authority Consent Requirements) (England and Wales) Order 2007. We are in pioneering territory and doing things for the first time often has its hazards. This is the first order to be made under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. It has been laid in draft and has been considered and reported on by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of your Lordships&#146; House and the House of Commons Regulatory Reform Committee.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000016"></a>The House of Commons committee suggested some small clarifying amendments to the footnotes and Explanatory Notes, but recommended that the draft order should proceed. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of your Lordships&#146; House made three main recommendations. The first, and perhaps most significant, is the recommendation that the procedure applying to this draft order should change from the proposed affirmative resolution to super-affirmative. Noble Lords stated in their report of 23 November that they made this recommendation because they needed to correspond further with the Government about the draft order and because they considered that they might wish to propose amendments. This has been done.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000017"></a>Their second recommendation is that the draft order should be amended so as not to include metropolitan district councils in the cancel-out provision, which I will discuss in further detail later. The final recommendation was a change to the recitals in the draft order&#151;that is; the statements at the beginning of the order&#151;where it was felt that the  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC176"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column GC176</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reference to consent of the National Assembly for Wales required some clarification in technical legal terms. As a result, I am now pleased to have the opportunity to invite Members of the Committee to consider the draft order so that my department may take account of these considerations in laying any future draft of the order.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000018"></a>I should like to say something about the background. The aim of the draft order is to assist in giving local authorities greater freedom to take local decisions to improve public services and provide better community leadership for local people. There are a number of activities carried out by local authorities which require the authority to seek consent from another body, which is usually, but not always, the Secretary of State, before the authority can take action within its own area. The draft order follows the Government&#146;s commitment made in 2002 to deregulate several local authority consent requirements.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000019"></a>In September 2002, the then Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced a programme of action to deregulate 84 of these consent requirements which had been identified. The four in this order were included in this programme of action, which was welcomed, because the Local Government Association said at the time:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121357000168"></a>&#147;The LGA welcomes this government announcement. We have been pressing the government for some time about progress on consent regimes powers. This announcement on progress and further repeal should result in significant time savings for local authorities&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121357000161"></a>There are no other available vehicles through which to deregulate the consent requirements covered in these proposals.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000020"></a>The draft order allows the Government to remove statutory burdens which would otherwise need to be addressed through primary legislation. This provides the quickest option for removal as well as the most effective use of parliamentary time. Removing these consent requirements clearly supports this Government&#146;s commitment to encourage simplification and deregulation. Of course, Members of the Committee will know, as we debated them fully in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, that a major step is the new local area agreements to be agreed by June next year. The new set of 198 national indicators is stripped down from the original 1,200. These arrangements are derived from the 2006 Local Government White Paper when we spoke about giving local people and government more influence over improving their local communities. The order now amends legislation to four consent regimes that at present require local authorities in England and Wales to gain formal consent from the relevant Secretary of State, the Welsh Assembly Government or, in one case, the Attorney-General, before taking certain actions.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000021"></a>Once the order is enforced, it will remove from Section 4 of the Cancer Act 1939 the requirement for local authorities to obtain the Attorney-General&#146;s consent before instituting prosecutions for publishing certain cancer treatment advertisements. Removing the reference to the Attorney-General might have suggested that there was no further discretion to prosecute. To make that clear, the amendment of the  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC177"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column GC177</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Cancer Act also makes it clear that specified local authorities will have the discretion whether to prosecute in any case.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000022"></a>Secondly, the order removes from the Local Government Act 1972 the need for a local authority to obtain consent from the Secretary of State for and the approval of the Welsh Assembly Government of a resolution allowing it to amalgamate taxing licensing zones. Thirdly, it will remove from the Local Government (Overseas Assistance) Act 1993 the need to obtain consent from the Secretary of State to provide assistance to bodies engaged overseas in carrying on any of the activities of local government. Finally, it removes from the Education Act 1996 the requirement on local education authorities to seek the Secretary of State&#146;s approval of their arrangements for dealing with complaints about the curriculum in pupil referral units. One provision to repeal Section 71(2) and (3) of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 is not included in final draft of the order, although it was the subject of consultation. The repeal will still be carried out, however, as Section 71(2) is in Part V of that Act, and provision is made for the repeal of the whole of Part 5 in Part 12 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000023"></a>The committee reported on the draft order in its first report of this Session, and it made two principal recommendations for changes. The first was made in relation to the proposed amendments to the Cancer Act 1939, which requires a little detailed explanation. The amendments are made in Article 2 of the order. Article 2(a) repeals Section 4(6) of the Cancer Act 1939, which is the requirement for obtaining the Attorney-General&#146;s consent before bringing proceedings. Article 2(b) goes on to substitute a new subsection (7) in Section 4, which says that any of the authorities listed may bring proceedings under that section.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000024"></a>One category of authority that is listed in new subsection (7) is a district council in England for an area without a county council&#151;in other words, a metropolitan district council. Noble Lords will know that there are six metropolitan districts&#151;Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands and West Yorkshire&#151;and 36 metropolitan district councils. At present, these councils have no duty at all to bring proceedings of this nature under the Cancer Act, even with the Attorney-General&#146;s consent, because of the complicated interaction between this legislation and the Local Government Act 1985, which changed local government structures and abolished the metropolitan county councils but sadly did not transfer the duty of prosecuting under the Cancer Act to metropolitan district councils.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000025"></a>The draft order sought to address the issue by extending the power to prosecute to metropolitan district councils, too. I am pleased to say that the committee agreed that the changes proposed in Article 2 of the order remove a burden from local authorities and from the Attorney-General, because the amendments remove the requirement on local authorities to obtain his consent before instituting proceedings, and remove the burden on the Attorney-General to provide such consent. Instead, local   


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC178"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column GC178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>authorities will exercise their own discretion whether to prosecute. We fully acknowledge that although the committee was convinced by the scope of the amendment, it did not feel that the power under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 to extend those changes to metropolitan district councils existed legally.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000026"></a>To explain further, my department and the Department of Health, which has primary responsibility for Cancer Act legislation, took the view that the extension of powers to metropolitan district councils could roughly be analysed as the removal of an administrative inconvenience for the purposes of Section 1(3)(b) of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. Under that section, the sort of burden that may be removed by a legislative reform order includes an administrative inconvenience.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000027"></a>The committee noted in paragraph 43 of its report that it may be sensible as a matter of policy to remove the small anomaly of the provisions not applying to metropolitan district councils. Sadly, perhaps, it did not agree that the absence of a power to prosecute was an administrative inconvenience within the definition of &#147;burden&#148; in the 2000 Act, and recommended that the draft order should be amended so that it did not extend the Cancer Act provisions to metropolitan district councils. My officials, and those in the Department of Health, which has primary responsibility for the Cancer Act legislation, have closely considered the committee's recommendation on that point, and are prepared to accept it on the basis that the Government will be able to address the issue relating to metropolitan district councils through another legislative vehicle.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000028"></a>I turn to the committee&#146;s other recommendation. This was a change to the recitals in the draft order, the statements at the beginning of the order, where it was felt that the reference to consent of the National Assembly for Wales required some clarification in technical and legal terms. It is correct that the consent of that Assembly was obtained, as recited in the draft order. However, that Assembly as it was constituted prior to the Government of Wales Act no longer exists. The Government of Wales Act came into force in May 2007, as the Committee will be aware. It transferred some functions of the National Assembly for Wales, as it was constituted prior to the Act, to Wales Ministers and made related transitional and other provisions. That accounts for changes in the terminology used in the preparation of the order after May. There are also some additional legislative implications that are being addressed by the Welsh Assembly Government and by the National Assembly, as constituted following the Government of Wales Act 2006.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000029"></a>I am content to accept the recommendation that the recitals in the draft order be clarified in that respect. My officials are engaging fully with their Welsh colleagues in order to finalise that. In conclusion, I am content to accept the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and invite any further recommendations in relation to the draft order 2007 to be made. <I></I>I beg to move.</p>

I very much welcome them. I still want to speak for a few minutes in this debate in my capacity as chairman of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform. I do so with the approval of the committee and am very pleased to see two members of the committee present this afternoon in what is otherwise a rather thin audience.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000032"></a>This is the first legislative reform order made under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006&#151;something of a tongue-twister; I will in future refer to it as the 2006 Act. It is appropriate for me to put on record and explain to the Committee how the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee intends to exercise its powers, and to explain how the general principles apply to the order. I do not expect that there will be a need for the chairman or another representative of the DPRR Committee to speak often on future occasions.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000033"></a>The first step for the committee is to decide which of the three procedures available under the 2006 Act it considers appropriate for the draft order: the negative resolution procedure under Section 16; the affirmative resolution procedure under Section 17; or the super-affirmative procedure under Section 18. The committee is unlikely frequently to accept a proposal that the negative resolution procedure should be applied. That is because legislative reform orders&#151;LROs&#151;will almost always involve changes to primary legislation; that involves the exercise of the Henry VIII power. Also, it is a well established principle that Henry VIII powers that are conferred by secondary legislation normally need the affirmative resolution procedure. There are occasional exceptions to this; no doubt there will be occasional cases in which a negative resolution procedure would be appropriate under the 2006 Act.</p>

<p><a name="07121357000034"></a>The affirmative resolution procedure is likely to be the standard procedure where the LRO is straightforward and is not likely to need or call for amendment. Where the committee believes that an amendment to the order may be required&#151;as in this case&#151;or that the House may wish to have an opportunity to amend the order, even if the committee does not press for that, it is likely to recommend the super-affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000035"></a>In this case, as the Minister pointed out, the order involves amendments to four unconnected Acts: the Cancer Act 1939, the Local Government Act 1972, the Local Government (Overseas Assistance )Act 1993 and the Education Act 1996. The Cancer Act involved two distinct points: the removal of the need for the consent of the Attorney-General for a prosecution, which does not, in our view, raise any difficulties; and the extension of the Act to areas in which there is currently no power for a local authority to prosecute. I do not know how many prosecutions are brought under this Act; I suspect not very many.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000036"></a>The committee needs to be satisfied, under Section 1 of the 2006 Act, first, that the purpose of the draft order is to remove burdens&#151;or a burden or to reduce a burden&#151;and, secondly, that the conditions specified in Section 3(2) can reasonably be regarded as being satisfied. When the draft came before the committee, we were concerned that some of the tests under subsection (2) might not be satisfied and we were concerned about the point about the Cancer Act 1939, which has already been mentioned. We therefore called, under Section 15(6) of the 2006 Act, for the super-affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000037"></a>Following further correspondence with the department, the committee was satisfied on all but one substantial point. I do not deal with the point about the amendment to the recitals, which is a minor and highly technical point. The only outstanding point of significance was whether the proposal about local authorities that do not now have the power of prosecution under the Cancer Act 1939 involved the removal of a burden.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000038"></a>The background to that has been explained. At the time of the 1939 Act, all parts of England and Wales were within either county councils or county borough councils. In 1985, following the abolition of metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985, that ceased to be the case. As a result of what was plainly an unintended oversight, powers under the Cancer Act were not transferred to the metropolitan district councils, so no power to prosecute for a crime under that Act can be prosecuted in that district.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000039"></a>Under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, which was repealed by the 2006 Act, there was a power by order not only to remove a burden but to correct an anomaly. The absence of the power, in some cases, to prosecute breaches of the Cancer Act was plainly an anomaly which could have been corrected under the 2001 Act had it still been in force. Unfortunately, however, there is no reference to anomalies in the 2006 Act, perhaps because the need for such a reference was overlooked in the course of making the extensive amendments to its Bill in its late stages.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000040"></a>The Government have therefore argued that the extension of the Cancer Act to operation in areas where it cannot now be operated could be the removal or reduction of a burden. A &#147;burden&#148; is defined in Section 1(3) of the 2006 Act, which says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121357000169"></a>&#147;In this section &#147;burden&#148; means any of the following&#151;</p>
</ul>(a) a financial cost;(b) an administrative inconvenience;(c) an obstacle to efficiency, productivity or profitability; or(d) a sanction, criminal or otherwise, which affects the carrying on of any lawful activity&#148;.
<p><a name="07121357000162"></a>The committee felt that the absence of a power for a local authority to do something which might confer a benefit on the residents but would involve additional work and expense for the local authority itself could not reasonably be regarded as a &#147;burden&#148; within the meaning of Section 1(3); nor could the creation of that power be regarded as a removal of the burden. Indeed, if the absence of a power to do something you would like to do is an &#147;administrative inconvenience&#148;, that would greatly expand the operation of the Bill&#151;which was the subject of considerable debate and substantial amendment, as I have already said.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000041"></a>Faced with this situation, the committee had options. One would have been to allow the draft order to go forward as it stood, leaving it for a judge to decide in future whether the amendment to Section 4(7) of the Cancer Act&#151;which extends the power of prosecution&#151;was intra vires. Leaving the decision ultimately to be taken by the judge might be a reasonable course of action in a case where there is doubt as to the vires of the changes to be made by the order but a good or at least reasonable chance that they would be held to be valid. In this case, the committee felt that it would be unlikely that an amendment to Section 4(7) could be regarded as the removal or reduction of a burden. We also had in mind that other courses of action appear available to correct this anomaly, particularly through the use of existing powers under the Local Government Act 1985 to make consequential amendments.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000042"></a>We therefore decided to recommend that the order should be amended to remove the extension of powers to prosecute under the Cancer Act. We do not question that an extension is desirable. However, that does not justify putting an unreasonably wide definition on the word &#147;burden&#148;. We are, as I originally said, grateful to the Government for accepting this view. We look forward to them duly correcting this anomaly by other means.</p>

<p><a name="07121357000043"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07121357000188"></a>Baroness Scott of Needham Market:</b> I congratulate the Minister and her department for being the first to come forward with an order under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006, and welcome the start of the process of removing some of the consent requirements from local authorities. It says something about the centralised state in which we live that we regard removing the need to have the Secretary of State&#146;s approval for hackney carriage licence changes as a step for devolution.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000044"></a>We must accept that the four changes proposed here are a fairly modest start. I would like to say that amending Section 1 of the Local Government (Overseas Assistance) Act 1993 is a hot topic in the pubs of Needham Market, but it is not. It is interesting to reflect on the fact that when you ask why on earth this is in statute, it was a reflection of a real concern at the time: that local authorities were spending vast quantities of taxpayers&#146; money swanning around all over the world. It was felt necessary to curb them by having primary legislation. I do not agree with that view, but nevertheless it is interesting to reflect that there always was a reason why the burdens were there in the first place.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000045"></a>Although I am no longer a member of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, I always feel comforted that it keeps a beady eye on these things to ensure that the original purpose is no longer required or that the matter is covered in some other way. Equally, I agree with my noble friend that it is important as a matter of principle that changes to primary legislation should be made by affirmative or super-affirmative procedure because many of these will have been hotly debated on the Floor of the House when the original legislation was going through. It is extraordinary that we can make changes with virtually no one being interested.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000046"></a>I wonder whether the noble Baroness can say something about the process. While I have no comments on the issues here&#151;certainly all the responses I have read have been in favour of these changes&#151;I am interested in how long it will take to work through the 84 that have been identified. I recognise that that is difficult because some of them will come through as amendments to primary legislation, and some will be taken through this procedure. Can she say how long it might take?</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000047"></a>Can she also say something about the process of the Government responding to other consent regimes which people bring to their attention? I note from the responses that local authorities have raised other parts of legislation that might helpfully be  removed.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000048"></a>Finally&#151;I say this more in hope than expectation&#151;I wonder whether we are as confident as we can be that when new legislation is passed we are not stacking up work for the successor of my noble friend, Lord Goodhart. I can see that there is a strong tendency to introduce central control and central measures. I can understand why; there is an old proverb that says if you have a hammer all problems look like nails. We tend to get rather a lot of that and I suspect that much of what we hotly debate in your Lordships&#146; House now will be deregulated in a few years&#146; time. How much better it would be if we did not have it in the first place.</p>

I am grateful that the noble Lord took the time and trouble to put the full reasoning of the committee on the record, because that is important. We have done this for the first time and it has shown in our department&#146;s response as well. I note from the correspondence that has gone back and forth between the department and the committee that&#151;I shall not say there was a certain acerbity, but it was an interesting process. As the process evolves, other departments will learn from our experience, which is as it should be.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000050"></a>The noble Lord raised the issue of the number of prosecutions, and I can confirm that there have been 11, which were not all successful, so he is right that there have been very few. He also referred to the potential of using other legislation to achieve the same effect, and mentioned the Local Government Act 1985. The jury is still out on which would be  the best vehicle, so the department is looking at it closely.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000051"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Scott, was tempted to have a much bigger debate. She opened the door just a crack on the issue of centralisation and burden. I am tempted to send her the 20 departmental simplification plans published on Tuesday 11 December&#151;no one can say they are not up to date&#151;showing how we can reduce burdens on business. For example, in the public sector there are 280 different ways with total net administrative savings of &#163;800 million. The order is an important step forward as a proportionate response in managing change, but it is only one of a number of instruments at our disposal. There is a lot going on, as the noble Baroness said.</p>

<p><a name="07121357000052"></a>In terms of what happens next, of the 84, 62 consents have been deregulated so far: most of them have been removed. There is the one that we have been debating today and there are four that have completed their consultation and are expected to be introduced to Parliament this Session. Looking at them, it is interesting how wide is the range of issues. They include changes to the individual voluntary arrangement, insolvency services, merger of the Health and Safety Commission and the Health and Safety Executive and second insolvency and individual voluntary arrangements. We are working through that list. I do not think that any of us could hazard how long it will take to get through them all, but that gives us a good idea.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000057"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am pleased to move the Motion for this order on enlargement of the European economic area to include Bulgaria and Romania. As the Committee is aware, the Government have put tremendous effort into ensuring that Bulgaria and Romania were able to join the European Union as scheduled on 1 January this year. The order is a formal step towards delivering the benefits of enlargement. The UK can be proud of the major part that it has played in ensuring that conditions were right for EU enlargement to happen. We will continue to promote and support reform in Bulgaria and Romania, helping those countries to fulfil their potential. Bulgaria and Romania are now important partners in tackling global challenges such as climate change, globalisation and security.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000058"></a>The subject of the order, the agreement signed in Brussels on 25 July 2007, together with four protocols that are not the subject of the order, allows the participation of Bulgaria and Romania in the European economic area. The EEA allows Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein to participate in the internal EU market, bringing benefits to them and us in trade and the free movement of people. It is important to bring the EEA agreement into line with the expanded EU, to create a single market that embraces Bulgaria and Romania, and Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein&#151;a single market encompassing 30 countries with a population of almost 500 million citizens.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC184"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column GC184</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000059"></a>Through the EEA enlargement agreement, Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein will make valuable financial contributions to economic and social reform in Bulgaria and Romania. Negotiations on the level of contributions to be made by the EEA states were the primary reason for the delay in Bulgaria and Romania's entry into the EEA, which should have been 1 January, the date of their EU accession. Under the terms of the agreement and four associated protocols, Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein will contribute &#8364;72 million from 1 January 2007 to 30 April 2009 to alleviate social and economic disparities in the enlarged EEA. Norway will also contribute &#8364;68 million as additional bilateral financial contributions over the same period.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000060"></a>In addition, the Community has signed two supplementary agreements, with Norway and Iceland respectively, governing additional market access commitments for certain fish projects from those two countries into the Community until 30 April 2009 in order to take account of the addition of Bulgaria and Romania to the single market.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000061"></a>I believe that this is a positive measure for the UK, ensuring effective free trade between European partners.

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000064"></a>The order will give parliamentary approval to an agreement on the enlargement of the European economic area. Specifically, the agreement, which the order ratifies, alters the EEA's arrangements to take account of the recent accession of Bulgaria and Romania into the enlarged EU. As paragraph 4 of the Explanatory Memorandum notes, under the heading &#147;Legislative Background&#148;:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121357000170"></a>&#147;The Agreement is concluded by the European Community and all its Member States, and must be ratified by each of those States as well as by the Community before it can come into force&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121357000164"></a>I am particularly happy to be speaking today on this order, having initiated and taken through the European Parliament all the preliminary Bulgaria-Europe agreements during the five years from 1989 to 1994, when I was a Member there.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000065"></a>If I may, I will mention that only the other day, the Speaker of the Bugarian Parliament, through the Bulgarian ambassador, honoured me with a special award.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC185"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column GC185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000066"></a>I have a few questions for the Minister on the order. As the Explanatory Memorandum states, the financial contributions and market access concessions that the agreement allows relate to the period from 1 January 2007 to 30 April 2009. As a result of negotiating delays, the agreement was not concluded until after it was due to come into force, so we are, in effect, being asked to approve it retrospectively. First, have any payments been made to date, particularly by the Norwegians, who are the major contributors under the agreement, or has no money changed hands? Secondly, the new agreement is due to expire on 30 Apri1 2009&#151;less than a year and a half from now; what happens thereafter? How will the money be spent and how will the project&#146;s success be evaluated? Fourthly, will this be done by the Norwegian financial mechanism office or by some other body&#151;and, if so, which one?</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000067"></a>These countries' accessions have naturally led to a strengthening of ties between these countries and others in the EU, including the UK. These ties will, I hope, encourage all countries to reach standards of environmental protection and good governance, as well as directing investment funds to the areas that need it most. I hope that these advantages will continue after the expiration date of this treaty.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000068"></a>These ties, of course, also extend to cultural and charitable sector exchanges. There are many excellent foundations and charities working between the UK, the EU and Bulgaria and Romania. For example, some deal with street children and orphanages, such as Karen Dom, which was started by the former Foreign Minister and Bulgarian Ambassador Ivan Stancioff. I also mention the all-important and influential Free Democratic Bulgarian Foundation, founded in 1991 privately by Yvonne and Dimi Panitza; it is dedicated to strengthening the democratisation of Bulgarian society. I should declare an interest as being involved with several charities in Bulgaria and Romania and as governor of the American University in Bulgaria. These cultural and social links are one of the great strengths of the EU, giving each country the chance to both help and benefit from each other.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000069"></a>Many more people than was the case a few years ago are involved with these foundations and are taking holidays and investing in these countries. What are the Government doing to encourage more people to be involved and to help with opportunities for young people? For example, young people in particular have the chance nowadays to spend a gap year learning more about both themselves and the world around them. Does the Minister agree that working with these and similar charities would be a worthwhile pursuit? This area is now no longer the forgotten Europe of pre-1990. This debate has, I hope, highlighted the founding principle of the EEA and the EU&#151;the importance of more than just the free market in establishing lasting bonds between countries that have too often found themselves opposing rather than supporting each other. I hope that the order has prompted the Minister to continue to press for the attainment of this principle in future.</p>

This side, too, very much welcome the accession of Bulgaria and Romania: may more of the western Balkans soon follow within a reasonable period. I also must congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, on her contribution, through that very noble institution of the European Parliament, towards this happy outcome. When I first saw this on the schedule of business, I thought that it would be fairly dry stuff, apart from the fact that it talks about important global issues. But one or two things come up.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000071"></a>First, clearly because of my misreading of statutory language, I was unaware that there had been a political union between Bulgaria and Romania. We seem to talk about the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania, but I presume that that is the way these things are written. I am particularly interested in the fact that the accession of the two republics to the EEA seems to have been after that to the European Union. I want to understand how that could happen. It suggests to me that these two republics, although having acceded to the EU, were not members of the EEA legally until this process had finished. I do not understand how that can be the case, so I would be interested in the Minister&#146;s comment on that and what implications it might have had in the interim, if any.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000072"></a>What particularly interests me is the language around the reason for the delay. The EFTA members&#151;particularly Norway and Iceland, important fisheries nations&#151;have obtained market access concessions within fisheries by, it seems to me, wheeler-dealing in terms of extra bilateral payments. I would be very interested indeed to understand what has been going on over the beer and sandwiches in Brussels to cause that. It seems a strange way to go about it. What extra concessions have those important fishing nations had in the European market in return for the&#151;this is obviously the wrong Scandinavian nation&#151;&#147;Danegeld&#148;? I am very interested to know what deal has been done in order to get aid&#151;I am sure that it is highly welcome bilateral additional aid&#151;to these welcome member states.</p>

I can think of nobody more appropriate to speak for the Opposition than the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, who has a strong record in this area. I warmly congratulate her on her award from the Bulgarians. I am also grateful for her exposition of the work of various charities in Bulgaria that strengthen the bonds between our countries. That is of course something we should support. The more soft co-operation we can have, the better.</p>

Negotiations will begin in 2008 to allow a new financial mechanism to take place in 2009 when this one expires. Payments will be monitored by the EEA Financial Mechanism Office in Brussels,

The Norwegian bilateral funding will be run by Innovation Norway on behalf on the Norwegian Government. The European Commission will also examine projects. I am assured that the evaluation will be rigorous.</p>

<p><a name="07121357000075"></a>On charities, the British embassy in Bulgaria is engaged with the Bulgarian Government and NGOs to encourage reform in, for example, child care institutions. EU funding is helping to tackle the problems.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000076"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, rightly queried the provisional application to date. The agreement has been provisionally applied by the European Community since its signing in July 2007. It is unfortunate that the agreement could not enter into force simultaneously with the EC accession. We wish to ensure that this does not happen with future accessions, but I am sure that it is absolutely legal. I do not appear to have a response to the noble Lord&#146;s important question about fisheries, but will write to him.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000077"></a>I have found two paragraphs. Bulgaria and Romania&#146;s EU accession on 1 January 2007 concluded the historic fifth wave of enlargement that saw east and west divided into a reunified Europe. The EEA enlargement agreement ensures that the internal market is extended, allowing Britain&#146;s goods, capital and services to be traded freely across a single market of 30 countries, giving British people and companies the right do business and set up businesses in those countries with minimal difficulty on a level playing field. The House of Lords overwhelmingly supported the legislation, ratifying EU enlargement in 2003, and supported the entry of Bulgaria and Romania into the EU on 1 January 2007. By approving this order on the EEA today, the Committee has an opportunity to reaffirm its support for the inclusion of Bulgaria and Romania in the process of building a competitive and effective Europe.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000078"></a>I can now respond to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, on fishery products and whether this would hit the UK fishing industry: a good question from the Member of the Committee from the south-west. The UK Government remain committed to free trade and would therefore prefer to see all forms of tariff quotas removed. These issues are of course being dealt with in the context of the World Trade Organisation discussions. The Government are working closely with the British fishing industry to ensure that it is able to compete in international markets. In principle, the level of tariff concessions on fisheries largely reflect existing trade patterns from the EEA states to Bulgaria and Romania in these projects.</p>

<h5><a name="07121357000181"></a>2.55 pm</h5>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000080"></a> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton) rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Financial Assistance Scheme (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2007.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC188"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column GC188</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000081"></a>The noble Lord said: As Members of the Committee will recall, the Financial Assistance Scheme, which I shall refer to as FAS hereafter, offers help to people who have lost out on their defined benefit occupational pension because their scheme was underfunded when it wound up and the employer is insolvent or no longer exists. The regulations extend this definition further, as I shall go on to explain.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000082"></a>In addition, FAS also provides assistance for surviving spouses and civil partners of qualifying members. It is funded by the taxpayer and administered by the Department for Work and Pensions via the FAS operational unit in York. Before discussing the regulations, I shall briefly mention the final report of the Young review, which has been the subject of much speculation over the past week. That review was charged with looking at whether better use could be made of the assets remaining in failed pension schemes to boost the level of FAS payments towards 90 per cent and whether some pension schemes, including those with employers which remain solvent and which are not covered by these or previous FAS regulations, should be admitted to the FAS.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000083"></a>I appreciate that your Lordships are keen to see the Young review&#146;s recommendations on these points, as are affected members. I confirm that the review&#146;s report is now complete and we are currently considering both its contents and our response. The full report will be published early next week but as the Prime Minister announced during yesterday&#146;s Prime Minister&#146;s Questions, we are confident that we will be able to provide a 90 per cent guarantee. We will make a more detailed statement of our intentions alongside the publication of the Young report early next week.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000084"></a>In the mean time the regulations will allow us to provide increased assistance to more members of more schemes while we bring forward changes arising from responses to the Young review&#146;s recommendations. Before explaining what the regulations cover, I think it useful to remind noble Lords that before this Government introduced the Pensions Protection Fund and the FAS as part of the Pensions Act 2004 there was no help available for those who had lost out on their pension because their scheme had wound up underfunded with an insolvent employer. It is true that the FAS, as originally constituted, helped only those within three years of their normal retirement age on 14 May 2004 but in December last, we extended this help to members of qualifying pension schemes who were within 15 years of their scheme normal retirement age on 14 May 2004.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000085"></a>This assistance was tapered depending on the member&#146;s distance from normal retirement age. To put the scope of today&#146;s regulations into context, I remind noble Lords that the original FAS would have helped just 15,000 people over its lifetime. Last year&#146;s extension to FAS boosted the number helped to around 40,000 people and increased total funding for the FAS from &#163;400 million to over &#163;2 billion in cash terms. The regulations being discussed today will bring about a further significant extension to the scope of the FAS while we consider the final findings  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC189"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column GC189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the Young review, and round off the package of FAS measures announced in and subsequent to the Budget in March.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000086"></a>This extension increases the Government&#146;s commitment to the FAS to more than &#163;8 billion in cash terms, and means that the FAS will now help about 130,000 people who have lost significant amounts of occupational pension due to employer insolvency. The regulations do away with tapers on assistance so that all qualifying members of qualifying schemes will be eligible for a top-up to 80 per cent of their expected core pension, subject to the cap at age 65. The regulations will get rid of the de minimis, which meant that FAS awards of less than &#163;520 a year were not payable. They raise the level of the cap on assistance from &#163;12,000 to &#163;26,000 a year.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000087"></a>On our plans for the cap, I am sure noble Lords will have recognised that, without indexation, the cap will mean that assistance due to members who will not reach 65 for some time will not retain value before coming into payment. The Government agree that it is not appropriate in the longer term for the FAS cap to remain static. On 21 May 2007, the Minister for Pensions Reform told the other place:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121357000171"></a>&#147;We intend to ensure that the cap retains its value, even where assessments are made for members who will not be eligible for payment until many years into the future&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 21/5/07; col. 1159W.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000088"></a>As relatively few members are affected by the increased cap, and as any significant effect of non-indexation will not bite for some time, it makes sense to defer associated changes to the cap to be considered alongside any other changes to the way in which assistance is calculated arising from the Young review of pension scheme assets. The amendments that we are proposing will also bring additional schemes, and their members, into the FAS.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000089"></a>Following discussions with affected schemes, we believe that it is right to extend the FAS to members of pension schemes where the trustees believed that it was in the best interests of their members to reach a compromise agreement with the employer. Under these agreements, schemes accepted a lower amount than the full debt owed by the employer on the winding-up of their scheme in order not to tip that employer into insolvency. The regulations ensure that the trustees and employers of such schemes who have acted reasonably in reaching a compromise agreement will be helped. We have yet to receive data for all the schemes that might benefit from this change, but we believe that up to 13,500 members may qualify for assistance. Following an approach by an affected scheme, we have also amended regulations to allow certain small self-administered schemes, which were previously excluded, to be considered qualifying schemes for the FAS.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000090"></a>The Committee will recognise the importance of preserving the assets in relevant schemes until we can bring forward regulations to implement changes arising from the Young review&#146;s final recommendations. We have already implemented some protective measures. The halting annuitisation regulations, which came into effect on 26 September, seek to protect the funds in affected schemes by preventing trustees from purchasing annuities for nine months, except where trustees already  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC190"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column GC190</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have a binding commitment to purchase annuities before the regulations came into force or where they have the approval of the scheme manager.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71213-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000091"></a>Today&#146;s regulations include a further protective measure to deter trustees who are allowed to purchase annuities from buying annuities with enhanced annual increases. Currently, the FAS calculates a top-up payable for life, based in most cases on the annuity rate that will come into payment at the member&#146;s normal retirement age. Thus, if an indexed annuity is secured that starts at a lower initial rate than a flat-rate annuity, the member will stand to receive a higher amount of assistance than he would have done had a flat-rate annuity been secured. Given the relatively low position that general indexation occupies in the priority order for non-pensioner members, we would not expect trustees in most circumstances to secure deferred annuities with annual increases. However, scheme rules may allow trustees broad discretion over purchasing increases, and we understand that trustees are not always bound to match the way in which assets have been allocated under the priority order when purchasing annuities. For these reasons, we do not believe that current legislative powers are sufficient to control selection against the FAS.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000092"></a>Allowing trustees to purchase generous indexation would increase the FAS assistance payable and increase the costs of the FAS as currently configured and therefore affect the capacity of the Government to deliver increased benefits in response to the Young review. Under the proposed change to the FAS, the scheme manager will be given the necessary powers to re-determine the annuity rate in cases where that annuity rate has been secured with annual increases that he considers to be unreasonable. We believe that this should deter trustees from playing the system and taking advantage of the money the taxpayer is committing through the FAS to secure unreasonable increases for their members. The regulations also introduce a number of amendments linked to the calculation of FAS payments, the recovery of overpayments and the provision of information. These are necessary to provide essential clarification of certain aspects of the FAS, and to ensure that it operates effectively.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000093"></a>Much criticism of the FAS has focused on the number of people whom we are currently paying. Too few commentators acknowledge that the main barrier to making more payments is not the Financial Assistance Scheme operational unit but getting the right information from trustees.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000094"></a>Despite those difficulties, the operational unit has received and dealt with almost 400 applications from pension schemes and, as of 7 December this year, 3,540 cases were in payment and a further 1,223 members had been assessed and are likely to become eligible for payment once they reach 65. Those payments are making a real difference to the lives of people, many of whom had given up any hope of enjoying the retirement for which they had saved.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000095"></a>I remind the Committee that, despite press criticism, FAS has received favourable comments from pension scheme members who had despaired of  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC191"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column GC191</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>seeing anything from their pensions and who can now look forward to their old age with increased certainty. I am sure that the Committee will be interested in some of the reactions that we have had from people who thought that they had lost everything. They illustrate a different side of the story to the one that we are accustomed to hearing from more vocal campaigners and their supporters. They say, for example:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121357000172"></a>&#147;After four long stressful years after retirement I can now look forward to the difference these payments will make to both my wife and I in our future every day needs&#148;.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121357000173"></a>&#147;It&#146;s good to know that your department exists to help those of us caught up in these types of problems&#148;.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121357000174"></a>&#147;I am highly delighted with the way FAS Operational Unit handled the communication side and very pleased about the forthcoming payments&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000096"></a>I acknowledge that, in its earliest days, legitimate questions were raised about whether FAS was delivering the outcomes we had hoped for. Those questions have now been scotched. I emphasise once again the professionalism and commitment of FAS operational unit staff in working with schemes that may have inadequate records and where members may have long since abandoned hope of seeing anything of their pension. I can assure the Committee that the operational unit is already working closely with trustees to ensure that schemes that benefit from changes to the rules relating to scheme eligibility can provide the necessary data and supporting information to the FAS operational unit as quickly as possible.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000097"></a>The regulations ensure that the FAS continues to operate effectively and provides assistance to more of those scheme members who face the most significant losses. In my view, the regulations are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, and I therefore commend them to the House. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000098"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Financial Assistance Scheme (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2007.

<p><a name="07121357000099"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07121357000194"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> The Grand Committee&#151;this very large Grand Committee&#151;will be grateful to the Minister for introducing the order, which gives effect to yet more changes to the FAS announced during the Budget in March this year.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000100"></a>Towards the end of his comments, the Minister told us of the grateful recipients of FAS money. We can all understand that, but we must remember that the Government set up FAS in the first place in response to a threatened rebellion from their Back Benchers in another place, who knew then that a large number of pensioners had been misadvised over many years to invest in a pension, only to find that their pension fund was bankrupt and that they would get nothing.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000101"></a>Added to that&#151;I cannot resist saying this, and I am sure the Minister expects it&#151;was the Prime Minister's first Budget, which removed &#163;5 billion a year from the pension savings of all pensioners. In the spirit that is supposed to surround Christmas, I am  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC192"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column GC192</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>well aware that the Government have never recognised that figure. I accept that. However, can the Minister put his hand on his heart and tell me that the removal of ACT made no difference whatsoever to those likely to be in the FAS or any others saving for a pension? To change the subject slightly, the Minister will know to what I am referring when I say that, unlike some of his ministerial colleagues, it takes only a very little gentle bullying from me for him to respond to my questions. I hope that he will give me an early Christmas present by answering that question.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000102"></a>When we were discussing what became the Pensions Act 2004, it was believed that about 66,000 people had lost all or most of their pensions. The Government inserted a new clause in that Act to cover members of qualifying defined benefit occupational pensions schemes which started to wind up between 1 January 1997 and 5 April 2005. All this, and the scheme as it has developed, is very well explained in the Explanatory Memorandum, so I will not weary the Committee with it. However, I would make the point that only &#163;400 million was originally set aside to pay the pensions in question, which would amount to only 80 per cent of the core pension, or &#163;12,000, whichever was the higher.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000103"></a>The term &#147;core pension&#148; was invented by the Government. It amounts to about 60 per cent of the money value of the expected pension. Since this has reduced to 80 per cent the net result is around half the expected final pension. Even if the money had been sufficient to achieve this, which it soon proved not to be, the amount of pension an individual would receive was to be far short of what they could expect had their scheme not wound up, and hence not fall within the remit of the financial assistance scheme. Over and above this, no payment would be made if the amount due was less than &#163;10 a week&#151;I assume for rather shaky administrative reasons. Why are they shaky? It is because state benefits often pay out less than &#163;10 a week. One thing that this order does is remove this de minimis amount, which begs a question. Of the current recipients&#151;I believe that the Minister gave the figure of 3,540&#151;how many get &#163;10 or less a week? While we are at it, I know that in February this year, payments were being made to only 950 people, so I congratulate the staff of the FAS on acting on information received from trustees at last in a prompt and proper manner.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000104"></a>I cannot help wondering whether doing away with the de minimis amount altogether is entirely sensible. The sum of &#163;10 will make a significant difference to the income of many of the pensioners involved, with which I am sure that the Minister would agree, but would 50p or &#163;1? I recall that everyone has complained about&#151;but no one has done anything about&#151;the 25p a week allowance for state pension recipients more than 80 years old. I am awaiting the Government&#146;s announcement on this, although I might die before I get it.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000105"></a>Be that as it may, my party said at the time that the original &#163;400 million over 20 years was not nearly enough. When a couple of years later it came to light that the number of potentially eligible payments under the FAS was more like 125,000, we were proved  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC193"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column GC193</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>right. All parties, not least the pensioners&#146; action committee, continued to press the Government for more, and the Government produced more&#151;surprise, surprise. They said that &#163;1.9 billion more, to be precise, would be found, bringing the total in the pot to &#163;2.3 billion in cash terms over 60 years. Even though the time limits of eligibility were increased from being within three years of pension age to 15 years, this was still not seen as enough. This was incorporated in last year&#146;s FAS order.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000106"></a>Over the past two years pressure has continued to grow. In his last Budget, the Chancellor announced yet another increase in the FAS pot; another &#163;5.7 billion over the new 60-year life of the scheme. These figures are my appreciation, because I cannot work out whether it has become a cumulative amount or whether there is another method of calculation. I am sure that the Minister, having a background as an accountant, will be able to answer me on that. Whatever the amount is&#151;I expect, with a bit of luck, that we will get the answer soon&#151;this total pot would be spent on giving all qualifying members a maximum of 80 per cent of their core expected pension or &#163;26,000 a year indexed, as we have just heard, to today&#146;s cash value. This is very curious terminology.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000107"></a>People do not expect the core, but they will get it none the less. Even after the Budget announcement, we have seen angry, naked pensioners demonstrating about this. As the Minister knows, they want 90 per cent of their pension, so that it would equate with pensions paid out under the Pension Protection Fund where there is no core pension arrangement. The Budget announcement, and now this order, constitute a ratcheting up of the FAS pot. The &#163;400 million to be spent over 20 years does not stand up in comparison with &#163;1.9 billion over 60 years, both in cash terms. None the less it is not much&#151;averaging out at just over &#163;31.5 million a year at today&#146;s  prices.</p>
<h5><a name="07121357000182"></a>3.15 pm</h5>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000108"></a>During our discussions on this year&#146;s Pensions Bill, Ministers conceded that yet more money could be found by means of the better use of assets of the failed schemes, and if that transpired, the Government would match these amounts pound for pound. They set up, as the noble Lord said, the Young review to investigate. The Minister has commented on the press reports in the past 10 days or so. I am delighted to find out that within the next four or five days&#151;anyway, by close of play on Tuesday, I assume&#151;the Young report will be published, and we will see what truth there was in the press that a row has been going on over the matching of the funding.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000109"></a>Lastly, I have to go back to the &#147;core&#148; and &#147;expected&#148; pension because the Explanatory Notes both confuse and conflict the two terms. I should be grateful to have definitions for both terms on the record. Having said all that, I welcome the order, as do tens of thousands of pensioners, but I must warn the Minister that he will be brought to the Dispatch Box again, no doubt kicking and screaming, to produce an even fairer version of the FAS. For how long will we have this annual ritual?</p>

<p><a name="07121357000111"></a>First, there has been a great deal of talk&#151;let us be clear that it is a con trick&#151;about the concept of a core pension that has been invented by the Government. Whether it is 80 per cent or 90 per cent of this entirely fictional figure, can I ask the Minister straight out what is the difference between core pension, as the Government define it and the level of benefits to which pensioners would be entitled under the PPF, which is the policy that we on these Benches put forward clearly in our manifesto at the previous election? We are still putting that forward, and would like to know what typically, on average, the difference is. If the Minister is talking about 80 per cent or 90 per cent of core pension, what percentage is that typically of PPF benefits? The debate will be much more honest and open if we can all agree on a definition of that.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000112"></a>Secondly, my colleague, Danny Alexander from the Commons and I were at the vigil outside Downing Street the other night, as I know was the Minister responsible for pensions reform. The people who were there are disgusted by the treatment they have received from this Government. They were kind enough to give me a T-shirt as I passed yesterday. I am glad that I did not have to wear it outside Downing Street on that cold night. I was a little tempted to wear it here today, but my Chief Whip dissuaded me. The Minister should be under no illusions about the deep disgust felt not just by pensioners but by many of us on these Benches.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000113"></a>It is welcome news that the Young report is about to be dragged kicking and screaming into the light. Following the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, what does early next week mean? Will the report be published by Tuesday, before the House breaks up? Will there be an opportunity for a debate or a Statement? Surely by now, after the Prime Minister spoke yesterday, the Government have decided what they will do and how that will be properly discussed.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000114"></a>On the administration of the payments, surely by now the Government can see that it makes much more sense to let the PPF, which is a highly efficient, well organised and well established operation, administer the payments under the FAS. We on these Benches argued right at the beginning in 2004, when the Bill was going through the House, how much simpler it would have been if that had been done. It is not too late to do it now. The PPF management has confirmed to my colleague Danny Alexander and me that it is fully able and willing to do that. Will the

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000115"></a>In the Commons, the Minister for Pension Reform sneered at the Sunday Torygraph, as he called it. We have had a few cheap cracks at the expense of the press today. The <I>Sunday Telegraph</I>, among other newspapers, has run a splendid campaign under the editorship of Patience Wheatcroft, who is sadly no longer there, and Liam Halligan. Both have great expertise in these matters and a very strong interest and feeling for the pensioners who have been done. It ill becomes the Government to sneer at newspapers that have exposed the Government&#146;s really very sad record on this issue. It would be better if the Government focused on getting payments and justice to these people rather than sniping in that way.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000116"></a>We look forward to the report next week, I hope, before we break up. Again, the Minister in the Commons said that he would be happy to have discussions with members of other parties about whether we should say something over Christmas or whether it would be better to wait until the House returned. We would prefer it to be done next week, and if more money can be found, that money should get through to members as soon as possible.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000117"></a>I have a simple question for the Minister, because he was kind enough to give me a Parliamentary Answer a few months ago to the effect that, in the next 10 years, simply bringing up FAS benefits to PPF levels would cost between &#163;15 million and &#163;20 million a year. What is his latest update on those figures? On that basis, how many minutes&#151;I use the word &#147;minutes&#148; advisedly&#151;of taxpayers&#146; funds pouring down the Northern Rock plughole would it take to give the FAS pensioners PPF-level benefits?</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000118"></a>I end by asking the Minister whether he has read the excellent publication, <I>Pensions Week</I>, this week? On the front page, under the heading &#147;ABI calls for saver trusts in government&#148;, Maggie Craig, the director of life and savings at the Association of British Insurers, was quoted as saying that,</p>
<ul><a name="07121357000177"></a>&#147;the government must instil higher levels of confidence in a new generation of savers&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07121357000165"></a>This is clearly in the context of the new Pensions Bill personal accounts. She was also quoted as saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121357000175"></a>&#147;Establishing trust is going to be central if this is to be successful. In particular, there is a lack of trust in government when it comes to pension provision&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121357000166"></a>The article continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07121357000176"></a>&#147;Drawing on research conducted for the Department for Work and Pensions, that found 51% of people did not trust the government on pensions, Craig said a huge amount of work needed to be done to improve understanding and confidence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07121357000167"></a>Frankly, given the way in which the Government have treated the members of the FAS and the robbed pensioners there, I am amazed that nearly half of them have some trust in the Government. I would have thought that the figure would have been much lower, and the Government should accept at last that when they are trying to bring in a scheme to enrol vast numbers of people in this country into saving for a pension, they should at least give justice to the people who have been waiting and sort this problem out once and for all.</p>

<p><a name="07121357000119"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07121357000196"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I think I detected a welcome for the regulations in both those contributions, even though there were some reiterated concerns about what has gone before and what may or may not follow.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000120"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked about the withdrawal of payable tax credits from pension schemes and what impact I thought that that would have on failed pension schemes. We have debated this endlessly, as the noble Lord knows. The reality is that that change to the tax system was accompanied by other structural changes to corporation tax, including the reduction of the main rate by 2 per cent and, subsequently, 1 per cent. It looks as though the noble Lord is&#151;</p>

<p><a name="07121357000121"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07121357000197"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I was waiting for the Minister to finish his point.</p>

<p><a name="07121357000122"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07121357000198"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Okay. That structural change in the tax system was particularly focused on the regime which existed before the change, which in effect encouraged dividends rather than retention&#151;one of the issues around an imputation system. It was therefore part of a package of measures to generally create more stability and a better structure for the UK corporate regime. That was part of building stability for the economy as a whole, and part of building a successful framework for corporate Britain. If you look at it in the round, that was the right decision. That reduction in corporation tax in itself gave companies a greater capacity to fund contributions to pension schemes.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000123"></a>I also remind the noble Lord that that structural change was partly something which his Government had done previously. The rate of imputation was always linked to the basic rate of tax and, as that changed, the imputation credit progressively reduced. Therefore, pension schemes under his Government had a progressively smaller payable tax credit to recover for their assets. That was done without any accompanying change in the rate of corporation tax. What really affected pension schemes, as we know&#151;the Turner commission has emphasised and validated this&#151;was growing longevity. The phrase of the noble Lord, Lord Turner, was the &#147;fool&#146;s paradise&#148; of living with assumptions of asset returns which were not realistic in the long term. That was not helped by the regime which limited the extent to which surpluses could be built in funds, and gave rise to a whole raft of pension holidays under the regime which his Government set in train. A combination of issues affected defined benefit schemes. The experience of the UK is no different to what has happened elsewhere in the world. The demise of defined benefits schemes has been at an accelerated rate in the US compared to the UK. Does the noble Lord wish to intervene?</p>

Is the Minister saying that the whole package&#151;I accept that it was a package&#151;made no difference to the income stream of pension

The noble Lord also had a little political go at the sins, as he sees them, of my forebears as Ministers in a Conservative Government. Of course, the Chancellor&#146;s mistake was to suddenly chop it all off at its roots rather than continuing a gradual decline.</p>

<p><a name="07121357000125"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07121357000200"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Whether it made any difference would depend on which timescale you made the judgment over. Clearly, when you move into an altered regime where the structure of the tax system is different, with lower rates but without the imputation repayable tax credits, all the various components of that would not necessarily have had the pluses and minuses for outcomes at the same point in time. If you look over a period, it was the right decision, and would therefore not have had any significant impact on the assets of pension schemes overall. If you looked at any particular year, whether it did or did not would depend on which year you chose. I do not believe that pursuing that point is genuinely productive in trying to fully understand what happened to schemes. That is very clear from the impressive Turner report which gave us the basis for the key changes that we made this year and will make next year. That was his judgment and the judgment of others as well.</p>
<h5><a name="07121357000183"></a>3.30 pm</h5>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000126"></a>On whether it is done progressively or not, the change made in 1997 was accompanied by a change in the rate of corporation tax. That effectively did not happen when the changes and reductions undertaken by his party took place generally, apart from one exception, with which I will not bore the Committee, when there was a change in the rate of corporation tax because there was a change in the rate of first-year allowances.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000127"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, noted the demise of the de minimis &#163;10 and asked whether we should have a de minimis at all. In considering any detailed implementation of proposals we expect to stem from the Young review, we can consider whether it makes sense to make small payments in the form of regular payments or in some other way. The administrative issue that the noble Lord raises is reasonable. On the number of people who are currently being paid &#163;10 or below, the de minimis has already been lifted for initial payments. We debated that in the Pensions Bill 2007. Significant numbers may already be receiving less than that amount, but I do not have a number. If we can readily obtain one, I would be more than happy to provide that information to the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000128"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, referred to the 25p for the over-80s. If I were a betting man, I would bet that that will be gone before the noble Lord reaches his entitlement to it, but who knows? He also asked about the cost to date. Two figures are always used: a net present value figure, which is associated with the basis on which these things are reported and the resource accounts; and the cash figure, which is just the sum total of the cash amount over the whole life of the scheme. I do not have right up-to-date cost  


<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC198"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column GC198</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>estimates, but I do not think that there is any significant difference. In the previous cost estimates, the cash figure is a smidgeon under &#163;8 billion, which is a cumulative figure that takes us to where we are, including the provisions in these regulations. The net present value of that is &#163;1.86 billion.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000129"></a>Both noble Lords made reference to the 90 per cent figure of entitlement. As was made clear previously, and was emphasised by the Prime Minister at Question Time, the extra value that we believe is possible from the Young review, together with matching funds, would take us towards 90 per cent. On the basis of the Prime Minister&#146;s announcement, that 90 per cent is now guaranteed. We have to await publication of the Young review to see quite how the extra assets are&#151;</p>

<p><a name="07121357000130"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07121357000201"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> I did not hear the answer to the question, which was very specific from me and, I believe, fairly specific from the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. On the 90 per cent of core pension, what percentage typically of PPF-level benefits would that be? It is a very simple question. What is the answer please?</p>

<p><a name="07121357000131"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07121357000202"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> It is a very simple question. I was coming to core pension. It would be wrong of me to pre-empt what is in that review. The 90 per cent figure&#151;as we have previously discussed and was the aspiration that we talked about when we looked at the interim Young review&#151;was of core pension.</p>

<p><a name="07121357000132"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07121357000203"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> I am sorry. This has been going on for some months now. The campaigners have made it clear that they believe that the figure is of the order of 50 per cent or 60 per cent. I cannot see in any way how we need to wait for the Young review. If the Minister does not know, will he please give us an undertaking that he will immediately calculate that? This calculation must have been done in the DWP, given how much pressure there has been on it. If he does not know the figure, it is a disgrace. Will he promise to produce it next week?</p>

<p><a name="07121357000133"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07121357000204"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> When we previously discussed the figure of 90 per cent we were referring to 90 per cent of core pension. I shall come to what that means in a minute. As to what may or may not be in the review, I ask the noble Lord to bear with us for a few more days.</p>

Will the Minister undertake that next week, when the review is published, at the same time the DWP will give figures on the 90 per cent core pension, and what percentage that is of the benefits that people would be entitled to under the PPF? That is all we are asking for. The Government must know the figures, but if they do not know them now will they please publish them next week?</p>

The noble Lord will have to bear with us until it is published, which may or may not satisfy his quite proper detailed inquiry. To the extent that it does not, I shall undertake to be more specific on outstanding residual issues. I hope that that satisfies the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000136"></a>Both noble Lords touched on the issue of the amount conceived by the Government to put into the scheme and the difference between core pension and what otherwise would have been pension entitlement. We should be clear that it was never conceived as a pension scheme; it was an income replacement proposal to deal with the challenges that individuals faced. There are difficult judgments within that, such as the net present value and total cost figures of where we are today, which are considerable sums of public expenditure. Those are the sorts of difficult judgments that being in government have to be faced and analysed.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000137"></a>I have a feeling that I have answered most of the questions of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, but doubtless he will remind me if I have not. The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, referred to the vigil. I know that my colleague Mike O&#146;Brien was there. I am pleased that the noble Lord has the T-shirt.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000138"></a>I reiterate that whatever anger has been generated, the Government have always had great sympathy with the plight of individuals who have lost their pensions. In a sense it is easy to do that; it is just words. The challenge has been deciding what goes in place to support those people. That is the journey we have been on, and I hope that what comes out next week will be the end of that journey. The noble Lord asked about the difference between the 80 per cent and 90 per cent rate and what that would mean per year, and he referred to previous correspondence between us. In light of what the Prime Minister said at Question Time, it will be best to wait until next week. If it is not clear from that, certainly I can write further to the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000139"></a>He asked whether I read <I>Pensions Week</I>. The answer is no but I shall put it on my reading list. I am still ploughing through the 1974 Second Reading of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act when Michael Foot was Secretary of State, as part of my understanding of my ministerial responsibilities.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000140"></a>The noble Lord asked about administration and why it could not be dealt with by the PPF. There was a review last year of FAS administration, which looked explicitly at whether the PPF should administer FAS, and concluded that it should not. We need to look at that again to see how it can best be administered in the light of the Young report. I have not answered when next week it will happen; it is not within my gift. The usual channels have an influence on this, but it is not unreasonable that it will happen before the House rises. I do not think I am on my brief in saying that, but that would be reasonable and what we would want to achieve.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000141"></a>Going back to the issue of administration, there have been challenges&#151;certainly on cost. For the first year, which we are only part of the way through, we

It took time to build up the IT infrastructure to get the systems in place to last us over many decades. It is now clear that the annual costs of that are way below the annual amounts that have been paid out.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000142"></a>I hope that I have dealt with each of the questions that have been asked. There was a reference to Northern Rock and how quickly the Government acted. There is no parallel. For a start, the funding that went into Northern Rock was a loan and not a payment or inevitably a call on taxpayers&#146; money. However, the judgment was that the Government acted to avert a threat to the very stability of the financial system, which is why they acted as they did and with the speed with which they did. It is therefore not right to make that parallel.</p>

<p><a name="07121357000144"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0004.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07121357000208"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> That is not right. Schemes that have become insolvent and are being wound up do of course present challenges for pensioners who were in danger of losing out, but it was this Government who put in place the protection fund and the financial assistance scheme. Indeed, this is the only Government who have acted to seek to protect pensioners in a changing environment. Other reforms that are being made to the state pension, which we dealt with earlier this year, and the plan for the second Bill, which is now in the Commons and aims to build greater trust and engagement in the occupational pension scheme, take us in the other direction. The thrust is to encourage and to help people to understand how important it is to save for their retirement and the importance of pension schemes as a key component of that.</p>

I am quite prepared for the Minister to respond by saying that this is not the time to give them. However, the time has come to have it written down in the <I>Official Report</I>. Will the Minister therefore undertake to make a Written Statement on that subject? If he does not, we shall be forced to table joint Questions for Written Answer.</p>

I know that the Minister is very good about putting copies of his letters in the Library, but quite honestly this has got to the point where, irrespective of what is in the Young report next week, these terms really must be defined much more publicly than simply in a letter to the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, and me.</p>

Perhaps I can undertake to provide noble Lords with a copy of those regulations so that the terms are clear to them. We did touch on some core pension issues: a core pension obviously excludes some of the provisions; a routine pension might survive benefits; the extent to which there will continue to be uprating; and lump sum payments. The core pension does not typically cover that, but there is a definition in regulations and I will undertake to ensure that they are brought to the attention of Members of the Committee. If that proves insufficient, they can come back and we will find another way to make it absolutely clear to the wider world what these definitions are. But we are not trying to hide or cover up anything on this, particularly as I am reminded that it is already there in the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="07121357000150"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0004.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="07121357000214"></a>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay:</b> I am sorry to labour the point, but we are both asking a specific question. We can read the regulations, but we want to know what the DWP&#146;s assessment is of the percentage that core pensions will be of benefits that people will be entitled to under the PPF. That is the question we continue to ask.</p>

<p><a name="07121357000151"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0004.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="07121357000215"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Well&#151;</p>

The Minister has done his level best to produce an answer. He is probably right that there is a definition of the term &#147;core pension&#148; buried somewhere in regulations. I do not think that there has ever been a definition of &#147;expected pension&#148;. I know what I think it means: what the pension&#146;s contract actually said that it would be. But then we have this extraordinary conflation of &#147;core expected pension&#148;. That is certainly where my confusion comes in&#151;and, if I may speak, for once, for the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, perhaps it is where his confusion comes in.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000153"></a>We await next week. I promise the Minister that if he thinks that he has had hell now, he has not had half of what he is going to get next week.</p>

<p><a name="07121357000154"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0004.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="07121357000217"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I look forward to next week. We can be clear on the definition. Expected pensions will differ depending upon the nature of provision in the individual schemes, but it is perfectly possible to be clear on the definition and what &#147;core pension&#148; is. The basis of assessment of FAS support would be clear; we will set that down. If Members of the Committee are not satisfied by the time the review is published, then we will find a means, in a robust way and as transparently as possible, to ensure that those definitions are with Members of the Committee and shared with their colleagues. I cannot more specific than that.</p>

<p><a name="07121357000155"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0004.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="07121357000218"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> No, indeed. &#147;We&#146;ll meet again&#148;, as the song goes.</p>

<p><a name="07121357000156"></a><b><a name="71213-gc0004.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="07121357000219"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I thought you were going to ask a question about prisons there.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000157"></a>We have heard further criticism of the way in which FAS operates and the speed at which it has been making payments, but I remind Members of the Committee that the operational unit has paid out more than &#163;11 million. It is making real progress, and will continue to work closely with schemes to obtain the necessary data to enable us to pay affected members as soon as we are able. We are making steady progress on payment numbers. I should have quoted numbers earlier: we expect to reach around 4,000 payments by the end of this year subject to confirmation of personal details.</p>

<a name="71213-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07121357000158"></a>I hope that Members of the Committee will therefore join me in supporting the aims of the FAS to provide help to those people most affected by pension losses. I understand that many Members of the Committee are frustrated at not being able to examine the final recommendations of the Young review and the Government&#146;s response before this debate. While I sympathise with such feelings, I hope that, whatever our conflicting views on the overall policy, we can today make progress towards getting assistance to more people as quickly as possible, and these regulations are ours to do that. I therefore commend them to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="07121359000024"></a><b><a name="71213-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07121359000800"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Identity (Meg Hillier) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="07121359000025"></a>I am pleased to inform the House that I have today placed in the Library the annual report of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate for 2006. This is the third annual report published by the inspectorate.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="07121359000026"></a>Publication of the report honours a commitment given by the Government in response to a recommendation of the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures in July 2002 that more information should be made available about the work of the inspectorate.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07121359000027"></a>The inspectorate&#146;s third annual report, published today, explains what the inspectors do and how they do it. It also provides details of the inspectorate&#146;s staffing and structure, ways of working, professional background and skills, and training and development.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="07121359000028"></a>The report explains the inspectorate&#146;s role in assessing, and advising Home Office Ministers and officials on, applications for personal and project licences and certificates of designation under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. It also provides details of the inspection system, through which compliance with licence authorities granted under the 1986 Act is monitored, and of visiting patterns and practice and the number of visits carried out during the year.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="07121359000029"></a>The report explains the important role of inspectors in gathering and transmitting information on good practice and provides examples of the many events and initiatives to which the inspectorate made significant contributions during the year. In addition, this year&#146;s report contains special features on scientific work conducted outside the laboratory setting and on poultry, and contains a report on a survey of local ethical review processes. I commend the report to the attention of Members.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="07121359000030"></a><b><a name="71213-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07121359000801"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Des Browne) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="07121359000031"></a>I told the House on 4 December that, following the board of inquiry&#146;s report about the loss of Nimrod XV230, I would establish an independent review by a senior Queen&#146;s Counsel into a range of broader issues that were outside the scope of the BOI&#146;s investigation. I am now able to set out the details of that review.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS44"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column WS44</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="07121359000032"></a>The review will be conducted by Charles Haddon-Cave QC. Mr Haddon-Cave has wide experience of aviation and safety matters, having been instructed in all the major aviation and marine inquiries in England in the last 20 years. His report will be published in full, subject to considerations of operational security, together with my response to it.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="07121359000033"></a>The terms of reference for the review, in the light of the board of inquiry report, are as follows:</p>
to examine the arrangements for assuring the airworthiness and safe operation of the Nimrod MR2 in the period from its introduction in 1979 to the accident on 2 September 2006, including hazard analysis, the safety case completed in 2005, maintenance arrangements, and responses to any earlier incidents that might have highlighted the risk and led to corrective action;to assess where responsibility lies for any failures and what lessons are to be learnt;to assess more broadly the process for compiling safety cases, taking account of best practice in the civilian and military world; and to make recommendations to the Secretary of State as soon as practicable, if necessary by way of interim reports.
<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="07121359000034"></a>Appropriate technical expertise will be made available to the reviewer. The reviewer will be able to recommend a public inquiry if he considers this necessary.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="07121359000035"></a>The review will have the full support of the Ministry of Defence. All relevant papers will be made available and everyone who can assist the review will be instructed to do so. In order to encourage openness, evidence given during the course of the review will not be used in disciplinary proceedings against the individual who gave it unless there is evidence of gross misconduct. The MoD will also provide Mr Haddon-Cave, at his request, with a secretariat for the review.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="07121359000036"></a>BAE Systems and QinetiQ have confirmed that  Mr Haddon-Cave will have their full co-operation. The MoD and the companies are committed to ensuring that the review has available to it all the technical expertise that it will require. I would expect any other companies whose assistance may be required to follow suit.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="07121359000037"></a>Mr Haddon-Cave will ensure that the families are kept informed of the progress of the review.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="07121359000038"></a>It is of the utmost importance that an authoritative and independent analysis is conducted of the background circumstances to the loss of Nimrod XV230. The task that Mr Haddon-Cave has undertaken will be complex but I have asked him to ensure that information that would assist our understanding of this tragic loss is published without undue delay.</p>

<a name="07121359000039"></a><b><a name="71213-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="07121359000802"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Malloch-Brown):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (David Miliband) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS45"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column WS45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="07121359000040"></a>The Russian authorities announced yesterday that they planned to shut down the British Council&#146;s offices in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg on 1 January 2008.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="07121359000041"></a>Russia&#146;s threatened actions are illegal. The British Council&#146;s presence in Russia is entirely consistent with international law, including the Vienna conventions. Its presence and activities are also specifically sanctioned by a 1994 UK-Russia agreement on co-operation in education, science and culture, which was signed by Russia and which binds both the UK and Russia. The British Council is the designated agent of the British Government for the implementation of the agreement. For the past nine years, the UK has been keen to conclude a further cultural centres agreement with Russia. Pending such an agreement being reached, the 1994 agreement remains in force.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="07121359000042"></a>For Russia to carry out its threat would therefore constitute a serious attack against the legitimate cultural agent of the British Government, show a disregard for the rule of law and only damage Russia&#146;s reputation around the world.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="07121359000043"></a>Damage will also be done to EU-Russia cultural co-operation. We are discussing with partners (including the EU and the G7) the implications of Russia&#146;s threat. I am grateful to the European Commission for expressing its concern to Russia about the situation facing the British Council.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="07121359000044"></a>Overall, Russia&#146;s threats set back bilateral and multilateral efforts to improve cultural links, severely affect large numbers of Russians who benefit from the British Council&#146;s presence, and damage Russia&#146;s reputation around the world. We are urging the Russian authorities to reconsider. At the same time, we are working closely with the British Council to ensure the welfare of its staff.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="07121359000045"></a>I will keep the House informed of developments.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="07121359000047"></a>I announced to the House on 7 November 2007 that the Government have decided to delay final implementation of the Companies Act 2006 until October 2009, in the light of advice from the Registrar of Companies that he cannot be absolutely confident of implementing the necessary changes to Companies House systems and processes by October 2008. I also explained that we would consult key stakeholders about the commencement date for provisions due to be commenced in October 2008 that do not necessitate changes to Companies House systems and processes.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="07121359000048"></a>In the light of our discussions and meetings with key stakeholders, the Government have decided that the following provisions, listed in my earlier Statement, should be commenced with effect from 1 October 2008:</p>




<notus-date day="13" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS46"></a><b>13 Dec 2007 : Column WS46</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Sections 69 to 74: objection to company names;Sections 82 to 85: trading disclosures;Sections 155 to 159: provisions relating to corporate directors and underage directors;Sections 175 to 177: general duties of directors in respect of conflicts of interest;Sections 182 to 187: declaration by a director of an interest in an existing transaction or arrangement; andrepeal of the restrictions under the Companies  Act 1985 on financial assistance for acquisition of shares in private companies, including the &#147;whitewash&#148; procedure.
<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="07121359000049"></a>In view of the strength of business representations and of further advice from the Registrar of Companies, the Government have decided in addition to commence with effect from 1 October 2008:</p>
the new procedure for private companies to make capital reductions supported by a solvency statement instead of by a court order.
<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="07121359000050"></a>Stakeholders highlighted the major benefit to business of implementation in 2008 of this new procedure. The Government had originally not proposed this, because it would require some changes to Companies House systems and processes. We have looked at this again in the light of the points made by business and I am pleased to say that the Registrar of Companies believes that the necessary changes can be made by October 2008.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="07121359000051"></a>There are also two sets of provisions that we have decided to commence with effect from 6 April 2008:</p>
Sections 121 and 128: register of members&#151;removal of entries relating to former members; andSections 811(4), 812 and 814: inspection of register of interests in a company's shares.
<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="07121359000052"></a>I aim to make before Christmas a commencement order in respect of all provisions to be commenced in 2008, other than those relating to capital reduction supported by a solvency statement and the removal of special provisions about accounts and audit for charitable companies. The capital reduction provisions (including Section 654 on distributions of reserves arising from a capital reduction) will be commenced through a separate commencement order to be laid in draft in 2008. There will also be a separate commencement order on the audit of small charitable companies.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="07121359000064"></a>Earlier this year my honourable friend the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Gerry Sutcliffe) outlined the Government&#146;s intention to review the Forum for Preventing Deaths in Custody as one aspect of its continued commitment to bring about real changes and improvements to reduce deaths of people being held in our custodial care and to report on progress to the House within six months (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 16/5/07; col. 662).</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="07121359000065"></a>I am pleased to report that the Government&#146;s review of the forum is nearing its conclusion. A person entirely independent of the forum&#151;Robert Fulton, a former Home Office director&#151;is conducting the review and Ministers anticipate that he will deliver conclusions and recommendations by the end of the year. A further announcement will be made as soon as is practicable

The review has broad terms of reference and is taking into account other relevant organisational models, the forum&#146;s independence from government, its interaction with Ministers through the Ministerial Roundtable on Suicide, which I chair, its membership, powers, resources and capacity, and its collective and individual accountabilities.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="07121359000066"></a>The review is making good progress. Mr Fulton, whose conclusions and recommendations will be made publicly available, has already seen a wide range of people with a close interest in this subject area and has researched other relevant organisational models. I understand that he is likely to recommend substantial changes to the current arrangements with respect both to the forum and to the Ministerial Roundtable on Suicide. Ministers will look at Mr Fulton&#146;s recommendations quickly and sympathetically with a view to strengthening the current arrangements within available resources.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="07121359000068"></a>I notified the House on 23 October that the European Court of Justice has decided that, for the purposes of European law, three benefits&#151;disability living allowance (care component), attendance allowance and carer&#146;s allowance&#151;are incorrectly classified as special non-contributory benefits.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="07121359000069"></a>As a result of the judgment, these benefits are in certain circumstances exportable within the European economic area (EAA) and Switzerland. Customers will, of course, have to meet existing entitlement criteria to receive the benefits. Department officials recently met officials from the European Commission to clarify the extent of the Government&#146;s responsibilities following this judgment and discussions are continuing on this complex area of European legislation.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="07121359000070"></a>The Disability and Carers Service is currently preparing new guidance for staff and making arrangements to handle cases from abroad. In particular, proper controls must be put in place to gather medical evidence from abroad to ensure that UK decision-makers are properly able to assess claims. We expect to provide full details on eligibility criteria on <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk">www.direct.gov.uk</a> by 5 April 2008.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="07121359000072"></a>The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council was held on 5 December in Brussels. I represented the UK, except for the items on the working time directive and the agency workers directive, on which the UK was represented by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (John Hutton). Health and consumer affairs issues were taken on 6 December.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="07121359000073"></a>The council failed to reach an agreement on the worker mobility directive on supplementary pensions. The area of concern for other delegations was the maximum period before a worker&#146;s pension rights become unconditional. This will be taken forward by a future presidency.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="07121359000074"></a>There was also no agreement on the working time or temporary workers directives. The prospects for moving forward on these were discussed over lunch. Mr Hutton said that the current working time text was a significant improvement on previous versions and, while the UK still had reservations, he believed that agreement was close. On agency workers, the presidency concluded, and member states agreed, that the text needed more work. The UK made it clear that it stood ready to support the presidency in future work to address outstanding issues.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="07121359000075"></a>The European Commission said that it would consider withdrawing both directives but this suggestion was opposed by most member states including the UK. The presidency concluded that progress had been made but that further in-depth discussion was needed on both directives, with the aim of an early and broad consensus.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="07121359000076"></a>Agreement was reached on parts of an implementing regulation for social security co-ordination regulation 883/04, specifically on the chapters covering administration of unemployment and family benefits and the corresponding parts of an annexe to the regulation.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="07121359000077"></a>The council had a policy debate based on the recent Commission communication on services of general interest. I stressed, as did the majority of others, that social services were important, both to individuals and more widely, and that quality was crucial. I also emphasised the need for subsidiarity and local and flexible delivery. While there was some common ground, the debate identified great diversity of situation and approach within and between member states and Ministers stressed the need for subsidiarity and exchange of experience and best practice. It was concluded that further work was needed in this area.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="07121359000078"></a>The council adopted conclusions on flexicurity and endorsed a joint opinion of the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee on the subject. It also adopted conclusions and endorsed an Employment Committee opinion on future prospects for the European employment strategy in the context of the new cycle of the Lisbon strategy. The council also adopted conclusions on active inclusion of people furthest from the labour market, women and poverty, as part of the Beijing platform, and on balanced roles for women and men, as well as

<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="07121359000085"></a>Over lunch, there was an informal discussion on health services, on which Commission proposals are expected shortly. Ministers urged caution: it is important to avoid creating inequalities through a system that allows a few to shop around for care. The proposals should not go further than the ECJ jurisprudence and member states should be able to use prior authorisation systems for hospital care.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="07121359000101"></a>The House will be aware that, with the agreement of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary, I wrote to US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on 7 August to request the release from Guantanamo Bay and return to the UK of five men who, while not UK nationals, had been legally resident in the UK prior to their detention. These are the only individuals now at Guantanamo who have been identified as having been given leave to enter or remain in the UK under the Immigration Acts.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="07121359000102"></a>My right honourable friend the Home Secretary and I decided to seek the release of the five in light of work by the US Government to reduce the number of those detained at Guantanamo and our wish to offer practical and concrete support to those efforts. In reaching this decision, we gave full consideration to the need to maintain national security and the Government&#146;s overriding responsibilities in this regard.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="07121359000103"></a>Detailed and constructive discussions have since taken place between the British and US Governments, considering the circumstances of each individual case. The US agreed on 10 December that three of the five men&#151;Mr Jamil El Banna, Mr Omar Deghayes and Mr Abdennour Sameur&#151;will be returned to the UK shortly, as soon as the practical arrangements can be made. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been in contact with the families and legal representatives of Mr El Banna, Mr Deghayes and Mr Sameur to let them know of this decision.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_73"></a><a name="07121359000112"></a>The Government&#146;s commitment to provide decent final salary pensions for those employed by local authorities and other organisations associated with local government is matched by the need to ensure that members&#146; pensions are secure, affordable and viable, as well as fair to taxpayers, who guarantee their security.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_74"></a><a name="07121359000113"></a>The Government see it as critical to maintain stability of costs in the scheme over the years ahead, particularly in the new-look local government pension scheme (LGPS) in England and Wales from 1 April 2008. The intention remains to ensure that no additional costs are imposed on taxpayers or employers. This objective is central to any considerations involving amendments to the scheme&#146;s regulatory framework.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_75"></a><a name="07121359000114"></a>A statutory consultation with all scheme stakeholders in England and Wales on proposals to extend the current levels of protection in the scheme for older employees began on 5 July 2007 and ended on 1 October 2007. The protections were originally introduced by the Local Government Pension Scheme (Amendment) Regulations 2006 and the Local Government Pension Scheme (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2006 and took effect from 1 October 2006. The draft proposals would involve amending the regulations to provide a full, rather than a tapered, protection for the period 2016 to 2020, together with appropriate off-setting savings for the estimated cost of this benefit improvement.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a><a name="07121359000115"></a>To ensure the continuing solvency of the scheme and to meet the Government&#146;s standing policy on ensuring no adverse effects on taxpayers, the costs of implementing any scheme amendments to improve the level of protections would need to be provided from within the scheme.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"></a><a name="07121359000116"></a>The costings for the additional rule of 85 protections were provided by the Government Actuary&#146;s Department (GAD), based on the data provided for the 2004 LGPS actuarial valuation exercise. GAD estimated that the capital cost of removing the current tapered protections between 2016 and 2020 was some &#163;0.35 billion to &#163;0.4 billion. In payroll terms, this equates to about 0.1 per cent or some &#163;25 million annually for 20 years.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_78"></a><a name="07121359000117"></a>If no agreed means of providing the necessary resources to extend the proposed level of protection emerge from the consultation, it will be necessary to retain the present level of protection.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_79"></a><a name="07121359000118"></a>The responses received to the recent consultation exercise have been considered carefully and analysed against agreed criteria regarding affordability and legality, as set out in the department&#146;s consultation letter of 5 July.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_80"></a><a name="07121359000119"></a>The consultation has demonstrated strong views from all stakeholders in terms of both the level of protections and affordability. I wish, however, to be clear about the most recent position in the scheme regarding costs, the likely numbers of potentially affected older scheme members and the range of other cost-influencing variables.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_81"></a><a name="07121359000120"></a>In the light of these representations, I have taken no final decision on the outcome of the statutory consultation exercise and, in view of the data from the 2007 LGPS actuarial valuations, which are due to become available early in the new year, I have decided to ask the Local Government Pension Scheme Policy Review Group, with the assistance of GAD, to undertake a fresh costings exercise using emerging data from the 2007 LGPS actuarial valuations. This will allow a new

<a name="71213-wms0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a><a name="07121359000121"></a>The exercise for the updating of costs is expected to be completed early in the new year. A final decision on the proposed amendment, within the policy parameters of affordability and legality, will then  be made, taking full account of any further representations that may be made by stakeholders.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a><a name="07121359000123"></a>The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has today launched its strategy for creating greater innovation within the defence supply chain. The MoD innovation strategy builds on the defence industrial strategy (DIS) published in 2005 as a defence White Paper (Cm 6697). The DIS set out a commitment to achieve a better understanding of the innovation process within the defence supply chain.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a><a name="07121359000124"></a>The new innovation strategy identifies the main challenges to innovation in delivery of our defence capability. It expresses actions to address these challenges in terms of five distinct pillars. These pillars show our intent to articulate our capability needs better, provide transparency in how we translate these needs and aspirations through to delivery of capability, highlight our commitment to open architectures, which will in turn foster insertion of new or improved technology, demonstrate our commitment to new business models that provide incentives for both customers and suppliers to achieve greater innovation and communicate our desire to maintain the pace of the MoD&#146;s acquisition processes.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a><a name="07121359000126"></a>This Statement follows on from that made by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence on 3 July 2006 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 28WS), which covered the intent to close RAF Brampton. Once DE&amp;S units have vacated the site, the Programme to Rationalise and Integrate the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) Estate (PRIDE) will relocate those remaining to RAF Wyton. The programme&#146;s aim is to collocate a number of Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) departments to one state-of-the-art purpose-built facility at RAF Wyton. New service accommodation will be constructed at RAF Wyton in order to accommodate those moving to the base.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_86"></a><a name="07121359000127"></a>In order to maximise the benefits of DIS collocation at RAF Wyton, PRIDE increment 2 will move the Joint Aeronautical and Geospatial Organisation headquarters and elements of 42 Engineer Regiment (Geographic) currently based at Hermitage, west Berkshire, to join the Intelligence Collection Group headquarters and Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre at RAF Wyton. The Royal School of Military Survey, currently at Hermitage, will assimilate with other training elements at the DIS site at Chicksands. Our intention is that these moves will lead to the disposal of the Hermitage site, subject to continued value for money being proven.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_87"></a><a name="07121359000128"></a>The move will directly result in the loss of approximately 30 posts currently based at Hermitage, mostly in the support roles. MoD will work to minimise the impact to those affected by providing all the help that it can, relocating personnel and avoiding compulsory redundancies where possible.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_88"></a><a name="07121359000130"></a>I am pleased to announce today the 2008-09 revenue allocations for primary care trusts (PCTs) and the NHS operating framework for 2008-09.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_89"></a><a name="07121359000131"></a>All primary care trusts will receive a cash increase of 5.5 per cent, a total cash increase of &#163;3.8 billion, bringing the total revenue allocations to &#163;74 billion. In addition, &#163;1.7 billion of non-recurrent budgets are being issued, meaning that 82 per cent of the total NHS revenue budget will be issued direct to primary care trusts compared to 72 per cent in 1996-97. Overall, we have trebled investment in the NHS from &#163;35 billion to &#163;110 billion by 2010-11.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_90"></a><a name="07121359000132"></a>I am keen to continue to raise the transparency and accountability of the NHS and, consequently, I have written individually to all honourable Members in England detailing their relevant PCT allocations for 2008-09 and I have noted how their current allocations compare to those for 2007-08. I have also included with this Written Statement a table detailing 2008-09 PCT allocations.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_91"></a><a name="07121359000133"></a>As I announced on 22 November, the revenue allocations will be for 2008-09 only, as the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) has asked for additional time to finish its review of the current resource allocation formula. ACRA will complete its work shortly and we intend to announce allocations for 2009-10 and 2010-11 by summer 2008.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_92"></a><a name="07121359000134"></a>As the House will recognise, the NHS has made substantial progress over the past 10 years of investment and reform. Patients wait no more than four hours in accident and emergency, the health service has more doctors and nurses than ever before and we have witnessed the largest hospital building programme since the NHS was founded.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_93"></a><a name="07121359000135"></a>As the NHS enters its 60th year, we must continue to drive forward with ever greater determination, and so for the year ahead the NHS has five principal priorities:</p>
first, improving standards of cleanliness and tackling healthcare-associated infections;secondly, improving access to care through the achievement of the 18-week referral-to-treatment pledge and improving access to GP services, including at evenings and weekends;thirdly, ensuring that adults and children are well, improving their health and reducing inequalities, by focusing on improving care for cancer and stroke and paying particular attention to children&#146;s health, particularly in the most deprived areas of the country;fourthly, improving patient experience, staff satisfaction and engagement; andfifthly, preparing to respond in a state of emergency, such as an outbreak of pandemic influenza.
<a name="71213-wms0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_94"></a><a name="07121359000136"></a>In addition to the national priorities, PCTs need to continue to improve at understanding the particular needs of their local populations and to take concrete steps to address them. In order to meet their own local needs, PCTs will need to work in step with local government through local area agreements that focus on improving health and well-being.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_95"></a><a name="07121359000137"></a>Local priorities will build on evidence about current PCT performance and regional variation and they will plan for the future by incorporating work being done in local service reviews. Whether it is reducing mixed-sex accommodation, personalising services for patients with leaning disabilities or responding to the Healthcare Commission&#146;s recommendations, local services need to respond to local needs.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_96"></a><a name="07121359000138"></a>Over the past 18 months, the NHS has continued to drive up the quality of care delivered to patients. This has been made possible by two significant achievements: bringing the NHS to financial balance and going on to deliver a surplus; and embedding patient choice, practice-based commissioning, payment by results and foundation trusts, which all lead to better patient care.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_97"></a><a name="07121359000139"></a>In order to support this year's NHS operating framework, we must continue to develop the necessary structures and leadership in order to enable world-class commissioning.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_98"></a><a name="07121359000140"></a>The NHS must meet the needs of its patients and their families, the expectations of the public and the aspirations of its staff. At all times, the NHS must be safe, effective, personalised and fair. The more responsive and personalised the NHS gets, the better the care it will provide and the more confidence the health service will inspire.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_734"></a><a name="07121359000778"></a>The Government regret the unilateral decision by the Russian Federation to cease compliance with its obligations under the conventional forces in Europe treaty (CFE) from 12 December. Russia has sought to explain this decision principally on the grounds that members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) have not ratified the adapted version of the CFE treaty. Together with our NATO allies, the United Kingdom has made a public statement (<a href="http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/2007/p07-139e.html">www.nato.int/docu/pr/2007/p07-139e.html</a>).</p>

But it remains right that Russia should in parallel honour its own commitments, made at the 1999 Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe summit in Istanbul, to regularise the status of its forces and equipment in Georgia and Moldova. The principle that host nation consent is required for the stationing of foreign forces is central to effective security and stability in Europe. NATO has engaged intensively with the Russian Federation to seek ways of overcoming differences over how to ensure that both these sets of commitments are delivered.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_736"></a><a name="07121359000780"></a>The Government also consider that the Russian Federation&#146;s &#147;suspension&#148; of its obligations cannot be justified either under the provisions of the CFE treaty or on the grounds set out in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Accordingly, on 11 December, we sent a note verbale, via the treaty depository, to all CFE states parties, making this clear.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_737"></a><a name="07121359000781"></a>We judge, however, that European security is not fundamentally or immediately threatened by this Russian action. In the short term, we understand that Russia will stop exchanging data or sending notifications on the whereabouts and composition of its conventional forces and will refuse to allow verification inspections. However, if Russia were to persist in this course of action, in the longer term that would erode the transparency and predictability that the CFE regime contributes to overall stability in Europe.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_738"></a><a name="07121359000782"></a>To help to maintain that stability, the United Kingdom will until further notice, along with its NATO allies, continue to honour all our obligations under the CFE treaty, including towards the Russian Federation. We will assess the impact of any non-compliance by the Russian Federation and consult NATO allies on a further joint response. With NATO allies, we will also continue to promote engagement with the Russian Federation with a view to reaching an agreed way forward.</p>

Those rewards go far beyond financial independence, important as that is, because work is inherently good for people of all ages: good for their health, good for families and good for communities.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_745"></a><a name="07121359000791"></a>Today Britain is recognised by the international community as a leader in promoting employment and tackling disadvantage in the labour market. However, there are still too many people living on benefits who could work if they were given the right support. Our response will be to move to a new system of active rather than passive benefits.</p>

<a name="71213-wms0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_746"></a><a name="07121359000792"></a>We want to see an employment rate of 80 per cent, up from the current baseline of 74.5 per cent, putting full employment at the heart of our anti-poverty strategy and enabling Britain to seize the opportunities afforded by a dynamic global economy. In a new and radical approach, we will therefore increasingly look to move people from being spectators on the margins isolated at home, as recipients of passive benefits, to becoming participants, actively seeking and preparing for work with access to training and job-focused activity.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_747"></a><a name="07121359000793"></a>We also want to ensure that benefit claimants can train and improve their skills so that they are not only helped into jobs but also helped to stay and progress in work. Currently, benefit rules prevent JSA customers from studying full time for more than 16 hours per week for more than two weeks per year. We will reform this. As I announced in November, we will put in place the funding arrangements to ensure that

We will also remove the 16-hour rule in housing benefit completely for short-term recipients of incapacity benefit so that they, like long-term claimants, will always be able to take up training to enable them to return to work.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_14"></a><a name="07121358000057"></a>The definition of high flood risk areas used by Communities and Local Government is the high-risk zone mapped by the Environment Agency as being at a probability of flooding, excluding the presence of flood defences, of at least one in 100 each year for river flooding and at least one in 200 for coastal flooding. High flood risk areas account for about  10 per cent of land in England, including parts of major cities such as London.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_15"></a><a name="07121358000058"></a>Flood risk is a major factor in the location of new development and the Government&#146;s aim is to avoid inappropriate development in such areas. Planning policy statement 25 (PPS25) ensures that flood risk must be taken into account at all stages of the planning process. Development that would not be safe in the higher flood risk areas should be directed to areas of lower risk wherever this is practicable.</p>
