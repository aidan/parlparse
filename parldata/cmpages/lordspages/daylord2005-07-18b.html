</p>

<a name="50718-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>It is my privilege to pay tribute to a remarkable parliamentarian, Sir Edward Heath. Born Edward Richard George Heath in 1917, Sir Edward grew up in Broadstairs, the son of a carpenter. He attended a state grammar school in Ramsgate, Chatham House, and then went up to Balliol College, Oxford, where he won the college&#039;s organ scholarship in his first term.

</p>

<a name="50718-01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>Sir Edward showed his political independence early on in life. In 1938, he actively opposed the policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany pursued by Neville Chamberlain. In the Oxford by-election, just after Chamberlain&#039;s deal with Hitler in Munich at the   end of September, Sir Edward campaigned for A.D. Lindsay, the Master of Balliol, who stood as an   anti-appeasement candidate against the official Conservative candidate and later Lord Chancellor, Quintin Hogg. Later that autumn, he was elected President of the Oxford Union.
</p>

<a name="50718-01_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>Ted Heath, as he was to everyone, was of that generation of Prime Ministers who experienced active service. During World War II he served in the Royal Artillery. His pre-war and wartime experiences were important in shaping his views about Europe and the need to prevent future conflict.

</p>

<a name="50718-01_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>After serving in the Army, Ted Heath worked in the Ministry of Civil Aviation. He went on to become editor of the <i>Church Times </i>before going into merchant banking.

</p>

<a name="50718-01_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>In 1950, he entered Parliament, narrowly winning the seat of Bexley. He went on to hold the seat until his retirement in 2001. His maiden speech in the House of Commons concerned European unity, a theme to which he would return throughout his long career. In February 1951, he became an assistant Whip. After a succession of posts in the Whips&#039; Office, he was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and Chief Whip under Anthony Eden in December 1955. He served in the role of Chief Whip between 1955 and 1959, and is widely credited with holding the Conservative Party together during the Suez crisis. He went on to be appointed Minister for Labour, later Lord Privy Seal, and then President of the Board of Trade. His competence and success in these roles helped his prospects for the leadership, which he won in 1965, aged 49. He was the first Conservative leader to be elected by his fellow MPs, defeating Reginald Maudling and Enoch Powell for the post. In 1970, he unexpectedly led his party to victory and held office as Prime Minister for just under four years.

</p>

<a name="50718-01_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>Ted Heath was a man of enormous integrity. I will remember him particularly for three things: first, his firm   stance against capital punishment; secondly, his commitment to one-nation politics, which was shown when he decided that Enoch Powell, after a speech in the West Midlands, could no longer continue on the Conservative Front Bench. It was a brave decision which I remember my parents applauding at the time. I shall remember him, thirdly, for his commitment to Europe, demonstrated in his winning French acceptance of British entry into the European Economic Community. He later played a leading role in the campaign to secure a &quot;Yes&quot; vote in the referendum on our membership.

</p>

<a name="50718-01_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>In office, Ted Heath had to face the crisis of violent conflict in Northern Ireland, over which he imposed direct rule from Westminster in 1972. He was unable, however, to deal with Britain&#039;s mounting economic problems. Hoping to win a new mandate, he called a   general election during the miners&#039; strike in February 1974, and the Conservatives lost seats to Labour. Failing to form a coalition government, he was succeeded as Prime Minister by Harold Wilson in March. Defeated again in another general election in October, he was replaced as party leader by Margaret Thatcher in 1975.

</p>

<a name="50718-01_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>Ted Heath remained active in Parliament, making interventions, particularly in support of the pro-European cause, and representing his constituents. He went on to become Father of the House before retiring from Parliament more than half a century after first entering. It is this House&#039;s loss that he did not become a Member here.
</p>

<a name="50718-01_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>Outside politics, Sir Edward pursued his interests, sailing and music, with the same passion and dedication that he demonstrated in his parliamentary life. He was a keen sailor. Despite having taken up yachting relatively late in life, he won the Sydney to Hobart race in his yacht, &quot;Morning Cloud&quot;, in 1969. Later, in 1971, as Prime Minister, he skippered Britain&#039;s Admiral&#039;s Cup-winning boat.
</p>

<a name="50718-01_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>Sir Edward Heath is well known for taking his grand piano with him to No. 10 Downing Street&#151;and I am   told that he continued to conduct the annual <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="50718-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Strathclyde: </b>   My Lords, I rise to support the noble Baroness the Leader of the House in the Motion that she has put before us. Today we mourn the death of Sir Edward Heath, and it is a privilege to follow the noble Baroness in her just tribute.

</p>

<a name="50718-01_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>We have lost another link with the 20th century, especially that link with the war years. Sir Edward Heath was the last Conservative leader to see active service in war; he served with distinction, being mentioned in dispatches in the closing stages of the Second World War, for which he was awarded the MBE (Military Division). As a result of his wartime experience, he vowed to do all that he could to avoid it ever happening again.
</p>

<a name="50718-01_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>Elected to another place in 1950, he was appointed a Whip by Churchill the following year and was rapidly promoted to Deputy Chief Whip and, subsequently, Chief Whip. His powers of persuasion must have been unrivalled. In that role he rendered invaluable service to the country during the Suez crisis in keeping the government and his party together.

</p>

<a name="50718-01_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>In 1960, Macmillan appointed Ted Heath as Lord   Privy Seal, responsible for negotiating Britain&#039;s entry into the EEC. He led a superb negotiating team   whose successful efforts foundered because of de   Gaulle&#039;s surprise repudiation of Britain&#039;s application in 1963. Later on, he was Secretary of State for Trade, Industry and Development, and an early deregulator&#151;not without controversy in the case of resale price maintenance. But it was on Sir Alec Douglas-Hume&#039;s resignation in 1965 that he achieved the leadership of the Conservative Party in the first election for the post, rather surprisingly defeating Reggie Maudling. He presided in opposition over a period of strenuous policy rethinking and so-called &quot;preparation for government&quot;.
</p>

<a name="50718-01_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>In 1970, Sir Edward became Prime Minister&#151;an outcome that the polls at the start of the campaign had indicated was practically impossible. He inherited a challenging economic situation and struggled to find a way forward. His term of office was characterised by difficult challenges, two of which were especially crippling. The first was the tragic early death of Iain Macleod, his Chancellor of the Exchequer and one of the most brilliant members of his Cabinet. The second was the oil crisis of 1973, which sent huge inflationary shockwaves throughout the world economy. But it was his attempt to control the spiralling might of the   trade unions which ultimately destroyed his government and set the tone for industrial relations and legislation over the next 15 years. It was a terrible <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1342"></a>

<b>18 Jul 2005 : Column 1342</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

time for the nation. However, on a small and personal note, as a schoolboy in the early 1970s I remember well that feeling of anticipation that the lights might go out so that there would be a perfect excuse not to have studied the conjugation of irregular Latin verbs. In 1974 he lost that crisis election in terms of seats in spite of a lead in the popular vote.
</p>

<a name="50718-01_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>In good times and in bad he conducted himself with integrity, never more perhaps than when he was forced to suspend Stormont and transfer the government of Northern Ireland to Westminster. The Sunningdale agreement of 1973, short lived though it was, was a bold and imaginative precursor of the Belfast agreement more than 25 years later.
</p>

<a name="50718-01_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>Sir Edward served as an MP for more than half a century and was a wise and well regarded Father of the House until his retirement in 2001. He took the decision not to join our Benches here&#151;something I regret and we are surely all the poorer for that. However, his heart belonged utterly to another place. His life was dominated by service and in particular service to his constituents, fellow MPs and the nation. He was a man of the Commons.
</p>

<a name="50718-01_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>There is no doubt that we have lost a political giant and the world of politics is today a duller place. Sir   Edward Heath will largely be remembered as the man who led Britain into the European Economic Community&#151;an achievement of which he was deservedly proud, and which at the time was very widely supported by those who were tired of Britain&#039;s failures and saw our European neighbours pulling far ahead. He was a man of great principle and these principles guided him in everything he did. He was an old school politician. Not for him the modern spin machine or the insincere charm offensive. He was brusque and honest. He did not curry favour with colleagues, often to his detriment, or with opponents. One always knew where one stood. After losing office he continued his international work and famously led a mission to Baghdad in 1990, which successfully secured the release of 33 hostages.
</p>

<a name="50718-01_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>There is one further aspect of Ted Heath&#039;s life that is worth mentioning. One never felt that he really overcame his ousting as Prime Minister, and certainly was never entirely reconciled to those he felt were responsible. He rarely saw good in what followed him and refused to come to terms with the changing nature of the Conservative Party and, indeed, of Europe and the world at large. That must have been a sad weight to bear.

</p>

<a name="50718-01_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>However, he also combined high office with great achievements in the world beyond politics. He had a real hinterland. His life-long passion for music, and skills at making it, led to his conducting orchestras all over the world. And he was a yachtsman of real distinction, winning the Sydney-Hobart race in 1969 and captaining Britain&#039;s victorious Admiral&#039;s Cup team in 1971. It seems incredible now that only 35 years ago a leader of the opposition and subsequently a Prime Minister could take so much time to take part in such events. There is perhaps a lesson for us all in that.

</p>

<a name="50718-01_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Ted Heath was a man who understood the word &quot;duty&quot; and all that it meant. He led by example in putting the interests of the nation first and foremost, a statesman in every sense of the word. People will argue for years about his political legacy, particularly that on Europe, but what is certain is that the nature of his commitment and contribution to our island&#039;s story will remain unchallenged.

<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="50718-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McNally: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord   Strathclyde, is quite right. We seem to be living through a period almost like the end of an epic play where the characters we have grown accustomed to quietly take their leave of us&#151;that generation of civilians who turned themselves into soldiers to defeat Nazism in Europe and whose victory more than 60 years ago we all celebrated very recently.

</p>

<a name="50718-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>They returned with a mood of &quot;never again&quot; and a determination to win the peace that took them into public life in all parties. Recently I was supposed to address the European movement veterans group at a lecture that had been given last year by Sir Edward Heath. As part of my research for that I looked up his lecture. He talked very much of the life changing visit he made in 1939 with his friend Madron Serligman to Nazi Germany and other parts of Europe. Along with the war, that experience certainly shaped the rest of his political life.
</p>

<a name="50718-02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>The only other matter that I would mention from my research is that Mr Serligman was extremely irritated during that trip by Ted Heath&#039;s insistence on playing &quot;Colonel Bogey&quot; on a penny whistle at every opportunity. Considering that they were travelling through Germany at that time, it demonstrated a strain of recklessness that we do not usually associate with him.
</p>

<a name="50718-02_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>I can also vouch for the surprise at his 1970 victory, as I was standing in Transport House when those first results came in.
</p>

<a name="50718-02_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>What is interesting about his commitment to Europe, which has been mentioned, was that it was never simply based on an economic decision. This is not the time to re-run that debate, but a recent documentary on the BBC about the 1975 referendum campaign showed Ted Heath, in all his pomp and vigour, speaking at a rally in Trafalgar Square. His twin themes were peace and prosperity&#151;the political aims of Europe to which he was consistent throughout his long life.

</p>

<a name="50718-02_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>Coupled with that consistency was his considerable courage when he had to face other decisions&#151;the decision to hold the Conservative Party to a strong line   on Rhodesia at the time of UDI, when many Conservatives, including the influential Lord Salisbury, were trying to take the party in another direction; the sacking of Enoch Powell has already been referred to; and the third example of courage, of which my noble friend Lord Dholakia reminded me, was the decision to admit the Ugandan Asians. None of those were soft options for a party leader.
</p>

<a name="50718-02_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>My own contacts with Ted Heath were spasmodic. I remember attending a small, select dinner party in the City, in the late 1980s, at which he was the star. He <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_1344"></a>

<b>18 Jul 2005 : Column 1344</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

divided his contributions into two halves&#151;an absolute condemnation of Thatcherism and all its works and a prediction that China was the coming country to which we should give our attention. I can assure noble Lords that he spoke about both with equal passion.
</p>

<a name="50718-02_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Also, rather bizarrely, he once invited me to speak at the Bexley Conservatives&#039; supper club. I have never quite worked out whether he wanted to expose Bexley Conservatives to fresh ideas or to demonstrate to them the grim alternative.
</p>

<a name="50718-02_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>I suspect that, like another ex-Prime Minister, of whom he often reminds me, Sir Robert Peel, history will be kinder and warmer to him than some of his contemporaries. Perhaps his country and his party might have used him better over the past 30 years. Nevertheless, what an achievement&#151;he was a scholar, a soldier, a statesman, Father of the House and one of the great House of Commons men of this and any generation.
</p>

<a name="50718-02_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, said, he had a massive hinterland. He was a musician of talent, an international yachtsman and a prolific and successful author. He almost pioneered the idea of book signings by politicians. I remember that Harold Wilson, rather enviously and sourly, told me that it was the unsigned copies of Ted&#039;s books which had rarity value.
</p>

<a name="50718-02_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>In what he stood for and in what he fought for, he was a man for all seasons. We on these Benches pay tribute to a great European and a great Englishman who fully understood that the two were perfectly and, indeed, essentially compatible.

<a name="50718-02_spnew1"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Worcester: </b>   My Lords, it is a privilege, on behalf of the Lords Spiritual, to join in this tribute. Politicians face a very demanding vocation and vocation it certainly is. At a time like this, those of us on the sidelines, who reserve our right to make constant critical comments about politicians, should at least remember.
</p>

<a name="50718-02_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>Among the most demanding aspects of that vocation is its capacity to squeeze out the joyful and abundant things of life. It is good that we should recall a politician who managed to avoid that. I wonder what public cares and anxieties were blown away by the wind, or gathered up in the profound experience of music. Both activities require total concentration and in the leaders&#151;the skipper, the conductor&#151;require the capacity to bring others to the same degree of concentration, something which must have delighted Sir Edward enormously.

</p>

<a name="50718-02_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>We should be glad that we can remember a politician who did not allow his politics to squeeze life out of his   life. We should pray and hope that politics may, once   again, be an arena enriched by the possibility of politicians holding to life within their demanding calling. That would not just be good for them, but also good for our politics.
</p>

<a name="50718-02_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>As to the conflicts that are credited with bringing about his loss of power, perhaps, in time, we might judge that those conflicts were coming over the horizon anyway and that they would have to be faced <br>&nbsp;<br>

by whichever politician happened to be in power at the time. If we come to that conclusion, perhaps history will judge Sir Edward less harshly than it might at the moment.
</p>

<a name="50718-02_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>Above all, as I have said, it is for his spiritual contribution to politics and for his refusal to allow it to squeeze life out of his life that I particularly wish to be grateful and for which I hope he will continue to be remembered.

Principally, he will be remembered for his four years as Prime Minister&#151;stirring years for the country&#151;for brave decisions and   for his long, long period as a parliamentarian. We also want to remember that he held office as Minister of   Labour, Lord Privy Seal with Foreign Office responsibilities and as Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and Regional Development.

</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>Sometimes it may be forgotten that he was a politician who believed in a fairer distribution of wealth and opportunities among the population and I appreciate that.

of   Britain was profoundly bound up with the development of Europe and of his enthusiasm which drove forward the negotiations for UK membership of the European Community. I remember that very well, and I particularly remember his French accent. His belief in the European Community and in Britain&#039;s role within it remained with him throughout his life. I remember it most recently, when I met him, which was not long ago. He had not changed at all.

</p>

<a name="50718-02_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>In this House we know there are divided views on the European Union, but United Kingdom membership is indeed Edward Heath&#039;s legacy. His career and interests outside politics have already been mentioned: an impressive and winning yachtsman and an outstanding conductor with a number of his orchestral works recorded and still available in the shops. He was chairman of the London Symphony Orchestra Trust;   he was vice-president of the Bach Choir; he was   president of the European Community Youth Orchestra; and had many other musical interests. The title of his book <i>Music: A joy for life</i>, certainly reflected the spirit of his musical life. He was always very happy with music and in Salisbury; where he reprimanded my wife on one occasion very loudly for referring to his house in the Cathedral guard whereas in fact it is in the Cathedral Close.

<a name="50718-03_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  Following the Tsunami in the Indian Ocean on 26   December 2004, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) launched its largest ever operation to provide consular assistance to British nationals. The FCO provided an immediate and targeted response, with excellent commitment from staff but, given the sheer scale of the incident&#151;triggered by the second largest earthquake on record&#151;and the number of countries affected, FCO resources were stretched. In a relatively small number of cases, British nationals did not receive the level of service that we would normally have wished to provide.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>The conclusions of the internal review are set out in the form of a short summary of findings and a list of urgent and other recommendations copies of which the Foreign Secretary has today arranged to be placed in the Library of the House.

</p>

<a name="50718-03_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>The recommendations are for both the Consular Directorate in London and for our posts overseas. The purpose of the internal review was to examine the FCO&#039;s overall response to the tsunami and identify those areas where better structures, equipment or preparation would have helped us to react more effectively. The review focused on the immediate response to the tsunami and dealt with the work of only the FCO and not of other government departments. The National Audit Office is currently examining the overall governmental response to the tsunami crisis, including the role of the FCO, in their review of consular services, due to be published by the end of the year.

<a name="50718-03_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Audit Regulation: Annual Reports </h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="50718-03_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Alan Johnson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.

</p>

<a name="50718-03_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>I have received the annual reports for the year 2004 from the five recognised supervisory bodies for company auditors: a combined report from the Institutes of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland, and one each from the Association of Certified Chartered Accountants and the Association of Authorised Public Accountants. Copies of the reports have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
</p>

<a name="50718-03_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>Schedule 11 of the Companies Act 1989 sets out the requirements which a body must meet to be eligible for recognised supervisory body status. These include requirements to have adequate arrangements for monitoring and enforcing compliance with its rules relating to membership and eligibility (for example holding an appropriate qualification, being a fit and proper person, working to technical and ethical standards, maintaining competence), discipline and investigation of complaints. In these reports, the recognised bodies inform the Government about their activities in relation to these arrangements.
</p>

<a name="50718-03_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a>In January 2003, we announced a number of changes to the regulatory regime of the accountancy and audit professions, including the establishment of a new independent inspection unit, located within the   Financial Reporting Council, and a Professional Oversight Board for Accountancy (POBA), to take over, from this department, my functions under Part II of the Companies Act 1989 in respect of the recognised supervisory bodies. I am pleased to report that these bodies are now established and in operation. The delegation of these powers is dependent on legislation being passed by Parliament, a process that has been delayed due to other pressures on parliamentary time. Legislation will be laid before Parliament before the Summer Recess. In the mean time my department continues to have responsibility for oversight of the recognised supervisory bodies.

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="50718-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The British Council, although not a government department, receives a substantial grant-in-aid from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The council regularly organises or sponsors exhibitions overseas of works of art loaned from national galleries and private collections in the United Kingdom. It provides certain assurances or guarantees in respect of loss or damage while these works are on loan.

</p>

<a name="50718-03_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>In the six months ending on 30 March 2005, the British Council provided such assurances to eight national lenders and undertakings to 85 private lenders. The value of the contingent liabilities outstanding on 30 March 2005 in respect of private lenders was &#163;18,830,698. No liabilities to national galleries existed at that date.

<a name="50718-03_head3"></a><h3 align=center>Consular Fees Order 2005</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="50718-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has recently undertaken a review of the fees charged for visa and consular services overseas. On 7 June 2005 Her Majesty in Council approved the Consular Fees Order 2005. This revokes and replaces the Consular Fees Order (No 2) 1999. The Government are today announcing new fees to be charged under this order with effect from 1 July 2005.
</p>

<a name="50718-03_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a>The order consolidates and re-categorises some of the fees that have previously been charged. It increases fees for notarial services, estate administration, attendances, matters undertaken relating to legal proceedings and repatriation and financial assistance. It raises fees for consular assistance in births, deaths, marriages and shipping, seamen and kindred matters. The order also increases fees for certain passports and visas and for certain searches undertaken by consular officials.

</p>

<a name="50718-03_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>Where consular fees have been raised then, in most   cases, these fees have been increased by between 10   per cent and 20 per cent. Overseas passport fees are raised from &#163;56.50 to &#163;69 (standard passport for those 16   years or over), from &#163;36.50 to &#163;45 (standard passports for those under 16) and from &#163;67.70 to &#163;82 (48 page passport). The fee for amending an existing passport abroad will be increased from &#163;46.90 to &#163;57. The order also raises the fee for issuing emergency passports from &#163;35.50 to &#163;43.50 and temporary passport fees are increased from &#163;45.60 to &#163;55.

</p>

<a name="50718-03_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>Fees for multiple entry visas valid for between one and 10 years that ranged from between &#163;60 and &#163;150 have been consolidated in the order to one fee of &#163;85. The order increases the fees for transit visas from &#163;27 to &#163;30 and for six-month multiple entry visas from &#163;36 to &#163;50. The order also raises previously anomalous fees for returning residents, working holiday-makers, students, au pairs and those in employment or self-employed for under six months from &#163;36 to &#163;85. The fee for receiving an application for entry clearance (other than to the United Kingdom or the Crown Dependencies) is raised from &#163;22 to &#163;30.
</p>

<a name="50718-03_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>The order reduces the fees for a certificate of entitlement to right of abode from &#163;110 to &#163;85. Following the introduction of photo vignette visas the fee for a declaration of identity became obsolete and has been removed. This order also deletes provision for gratis visas to be issued to citizens of the former Soviet Union following the abrogation of a bilateral agreement with former Soviet Union states.

<b>18 Jul 2005 : Column WS58</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50718-03_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>In setting the new visa fees we have taken account of the views of those in the education sector, for whom the increase in the visa fee for students will be unwelcome. We recognise that international students bring significant economic and social benefits to the UK. UKvisas is committed to working closely with the education sector in the context of IND&#039;s new Joint Education Task Force to ensure that we have a genuine and informed dialogue with the education sector about immigration matters and develop better capacity to improve the evidence base on international students.
</p>

<a name="50718-03_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>But it is right that those who benefit from consular and visa services should meet the cost of them, rather than the UK taxpayer. The new fees represent the full economic cost of what we do, and will ensure that British missions overseas continue to provide a high standard of service to visa and consular customers. They will also enable further investment in improvements to service delivery and the effectiveness of immigration control, as set out in the five-year strategy for immigration and asylum, and in consular services, as set out in the 2004 consular strategy.
</p>

<a name="50718-03_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a>Copies of tables detailing the new fees have been placed in the Library of the House.

<p><a name="wms_st_7"></a>
<a name="50718-04_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   With the support of Her Majesty&#039;s Government, the United Nations Security Council on 18 April 2005 adopted Resolution 1596, which extends the arms embargo on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the entire territory of the DRC with conditioned exemptions for the new Congolese army,   the UN organisation mission in the DRC and non-lethal military equipment for humanitarian or protective use.
</p>

<a name="50718-04_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>Resolution 1596 (2005) also provides for an assets freeze and a travel ban, with conditioned exemptions, on persons or entities acting in violation of the arms embargo on the DRC, to be designated by a committee of the Security Council. The resolution also requests the UN Secretary-General to re-establish the group of experts, tasked with monitoring the implementation and enforcement of the measures, for a period expiring on 31 July 2005 with the addition of a fifth expert for financial issues.

<p><a name="wms_st_8"></a>
<a name="50718-04_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The Government have decided upon a new approach to provide better and more timely information to both Parliament and the European scrutiny committees about the agendas and outcomes of EU Council of Ministers meetings.

</p>

<a name="50718-04_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>The new system should promote a greater transparency of EU business within both Houses. The principal elements of the new system, which will take immediate effect in order to capture the first councils of our presidency, are:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_0"></a>scrutiny focused material will, as before, continue to be provided to the clerks of the two scrutiny committees as early as possible before Council of Ministers meetings;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_1"></a>Written Ministerial Statements will be provided to Parliament no later than the day before a formal Council to provide as much information about the items on the agenda, why they are on the agenda, and what the UK as holder of the EU presidency hopes the Council will achieve. After the presidency, the Statements will revert to setting out the national stance on each item. Written Statements will not be produced before informal Councils. A copy of the Statement will be sent to the Chairmen of both scrutiny committees;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_2"></a>Written Ministerial Statements will be produced within five working days of each Council. During the UK&#039;s presidency, Statements on formal Councils will set out what the UK as presidency has delivered, and will replace, in the Commons and Lords respectively, the current system involving a Parliamentary Question and ministerial letter. Only after the presidency will the Statements revert to setting out what the UK stance was in discussions. When reporting after an informal Council the Statement will be of a more general nature and will not highlight member states&#039; positions, including the UK&#039;s. A copy of each Statement will be sent to the chairmen of each scrutiny committee; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_3"></a>during parliamentary recesses, Ministers will revert to writing to the Chairmen of both committees in place of Written Statements and arrange for copies of the letters to be sent to the Libraries of each House.

<a name="50718-04_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   I have today placed in the Library a copy of the second annual report by Fiona Lindsley, the Independent Monitor for Entry Clearance Refusals without the Right of Appeal.

<a name="50718-04_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>Decisions taken in the calendar year 2003 were under review. Ms Lindsley&#039;s report raises a number of interesting proposals as to how we may improve our entry clearance operation world-wide and we are committed to doing this.

<p><a name="wms_st_11"></a>
<a name="50718-04_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   When the King of Nepal dismissed the multi-party government and assumed direct power on 1   February this year, the UK expressed grave concern, saying that these moves would increase the risk of instability in Nepal and undermine the institutions of democracy and constitutional monarchy in the country. We also said we would be assessing the impact of the move on our security and developmental assistance.

</p>

<a name="50718-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>Three months on we remain concerned about the continued detention of a number of political and civil society activists and ongoing restrictions on the press. We acknowledge the King lifting the state of emergency and releasing a number of political leaders from detention. We welcome agreement to the establishment of an Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights office in Nepal. We also welcome the publication by the political parties of a joint position on 8 May. We hope the King will respond to these efforts by engaging in a renewed dialogue with them. However, there is still a long way for the King to go in restoring representative government and democratic freedoms. This includes releasing the remaining political prisoners detained since 1 February, the easing of restrictions on the media and efforts to reintegrate the parties back into the political process. The Royal Nepalese Army also has a long way to go in improving its human rights record, tackling the culture of impunity and co-operating with human rights organisations. Our objective remains to see the restoration of basic civil and political freedoms. We will continue to co-operate with our key international partners in working towards this objective and will be monitoring the situation on the ground with close attention.

</p>

<a name="50718-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary said in a Statement on 22 February that we would review the impact of the King&#039;s actions. Against the background of recent developments, we are continuing to keep our security assistance to Nepal under review but now intend to provide a package of bomb disposal equipment, which we had previously planned to gift. The Ministry of Defence is today laying before the House a Parliamentary Minute which gives the details of the proposed package.

<p><a name="wms_st_12"></a>
<a name="50718-04_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My right honourable friend the Minster of State (Jane Kennedy) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.

<a name="50718-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>The report of the committee of inquiry into how the   National Health Service handled allegations about the conduct of William Kerr and Michael Haslem, two former psychiatrists who practised in Yorkshire [Cm 6640] is being published today. Copies have been placed in the Library. This is one of the three inquiries announced in June 2001 by the then Secretary of State for Health (Alan Milburn). The reports of the other two inquiries, to consider how the NHS handled allegations about the conduct of Richard Neale, a former gynaecologist; and Clifford Ayling, a former general practitioner, were published last September.
</p>

<a name="50718-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>The Government would like to thank Nigel Pleming, the chairman of the inquiry, and the two members of his panel, Ros Aistead and Ruth Lesirge, for their thorough and thoughtful handling of undoubtedly sensitive issues. The Government are also grateful to those former patients of William Kerr and Michael Haslam who came forward and provided evidence to the inquiry which must, at times, have been very difficult and painful.

</p>

<a name="50718-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a>We will consider the conclusions and recommendations of this report very carefully together with those of the fifth Shipman report, the Clifford Ayling report and the Richard Neale report and will provide our response to them all later this year.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a>This Statement announces three new planning policy documents which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) is publishing today;

</ul>
<a name="50718-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a>ODPM is also publishing today research on the use of planning obligations to deliver affordable housing.

</p>

<a name="50718-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a>Alongside these documents ODPM is also publishing, jointly with HM Treasury, a document setting out the importance of the Government&#039;s housing agenda for achieving the UK&#039;s social and economic priorities and for delivering stability and opportunity.
</p>

<a name="50718-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a>Copies of these documents are being placed in the Libraries of the House.

<a name="50718-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><i>Planning for Housing Provision</i>
</p>

<a name="50718-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a>In April 2003 the Government commissioned Kate Barker to carry out a review of issues underlying the lack of supply and responsiveness of housing supply in the UK. Demand for housing has increased over the past 30 years, driven by demographic trends and rising incomes. Yet the supply of new housing has fallen by 30 per cent compared to 30 years ago.

</p>

<a name="50718-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a>The Barker review of housing supply report, <i>Delivering stability: Securing our future housing needs</i>, published in March 2004, made a number of recommendations relevant to the planning system, in particular, its ability to release appropriate land for housing in an effective and timely manner. Planning was seen as a key constraint on the delivery of housing. The revision of current policy on planning for housing, set out in planning policy guidance note 3: Housing (PPG3), was regarded as a priority, in order to improve delivery of sufficient homes and to achieve housing targets more effectively.

</p>

<a name="50718-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a>The Government agree with the Barker review proposition that the planning system must be able to deliver sufficient land, in the right places, to meet need and be more responsive to demand. If plans fail to deliver appropriate land for housing, house prices will continue to increase, there will continue to be worsening affordability, and key workers will continue to seek in vain for homes near their jobs. Equally, if the planning system fails to address low demand, the difficulties faced by communities, in terms of abandonment and crime, will increase.
</p>

<a name="50718-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a>The challenge for the planning system is to find the right way to respond flexibly to housing market pressures, in order to achieve social justice, and sustainable development. The Government believe that consideration of housing market pressures must be part of the planning system, so that it can operate swiftly and effectively, in the public interest.

</p>

<a name="50718-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a>ODPM is therefore publishing today a consultation paper <i>Planning for Housing Provision</i> which sets out the Government&#039;s objectives for delivering a better supply of housing through the planning system. Improving <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS63"></a>

<b>18 Jul 2005 : Column WS63</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

housing supply and access to housing is critical to improving affordability in the long term and securing the wider benefits that housing brings to the   economy and society. The consultation paper proposes a new policy approach to ensuring that appropriate land is allocated in plans to meet the need for housing, respond more effectively to changes in demand, and promote consumer choice. It also continues the priority given to   brownfield development. It provides for different approaches in areas such as the Thames Gateway which are designated for high levels of housing growth compared to other areas where the level of new housing needs to be carefully managed. It promotes longer term planning as well as much more rapid reviews of plans where demand changes. The Government will respond to the other recommendations of the Barker review by the end of the year.
</p>

<a name="50718-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a>This consultation will be an important input to a new planning policy statement on planning for housing (PPS3). In the autumn government will consult on a new draft PPS3 which will set out the broad national policy framework for planning for housing The aim will be to ensure that the planning system is used to its maximum effect to ensure that everyone has the opportunity of a decent home, which they can afford, within a community which is sustainable and in which they want to live and work.
</p>

<a name="50718-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a>The new draft PPS3 will also draw on the consultation paper <i>Planning for Mixed Communities </i>published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in January 2005, and the responses to it.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><i>Consultation Draft of a New Green Belt Direction</i>

</p>

<a name="50718-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a>The Government recognise the need to protect the green belt in taking forward new development. It has set a target for each region to maintain or increase the area of green belt designated in local plans. As a demonstration of the continuing importance the Government attach to the protection of the openness of the green belt, and to the prevention of urban sprawl, the ODPM is also publishing today a consultation paper on a proposed new town and country planning (green belt) direction.

</p>

<a name="50718-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a>This new direction would, for the first time, specifically require that planning applications for inappropriate development of certain types and scale in the green belt, which local planning authorities are minded to approve, should be referred to the First Secretary of State. While the Secretary of State would continue to use his powers of intervention selectively, the new direction would ensure that he has the opportunity to consider whether to call in for a public inquiry and his own determination, the more significant and potentially most harmful development proposals in the green belt.

<a name="50718-05_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><i>Planning Obligations</i>
</p>

<a name="50718-05_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a>The system of planning obligations is important in delivering essential infrastructure and other matters necessary to ensure all new development is sustainable in planning terms. However, planning obligations have in the past been responsible for delays in the system. The ODPM is today publishing a new circular <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS64"></a>

<b>18 Jul 2005 : Column WS64</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on planning obligations&#151;Circular 05/2005&#151;aimed at speeding up the system, so as to support the delivery of development, including new housing.

</p>

<a name="50718-05_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a>In November 2004 the ODPM published a draft revised circular on planning obligations. This led to a very fruitful consultation period in which 279 respondents contributed their views in writing and discussions were held in regional seminars and bilateral meetings.

</p>

<a name="50718-05_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a>The overarching aims of the new circular are to increase transparency, predictability, accountability and speed in the negotiation of planning obligations, and to promote the good practice that already exists in many local authorities. It also brings planning obligations into   line with the new arrangements established by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, and provides a firmer policy basis for the provision of affordable housing through planning obligations.

</p>

<a name="50718-05_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a>The final version of the circular makes a number of changes from the draft for the sake of clarity and precision, and introduces some new procedural guidance but the policy scope of planning obligations remains the same.
</p>

<a name="50718-05_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a>The circular will be supported by the publication of good practice guidance on the use of planning obligations later this year. A standard legal document for planning agreements and unilateral undertakings will accompany this guidance.
</p>

<a name="50718-05_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a>The revision of planning obligations policy is intended to improve the existing system. In the meantime, the Government are continuing to examine Kate Barker&#039;s recommendations for a planning-gain supplement and associated changes to the system of planning obligations, made in the final report of her review of housing supply. The Government will announce their full response to the Barker report by the end of the year.

</p>

<a name="50718-05_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><i>Value for Money of Delivering Affordable Housing through Section 106 Agreements</i>
</p>

<a name="50718-05_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a>In November 2003, ODPM commissioned the University of Cambridge to undertake a study on the value for money of delivering affordable housing through the planning system, i.e. through Section 106 agreements. The aim was to provide evidence on how much affordable housing is being delivered through planning obligations and how it is being funded. The study also examined how far providing affordable housing in this way contributes to mixed communities.

</p>

<a name="50718-05_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a>The study confirms the importance of using planning obligations in the delivery of affordable housing. The research indicates that as developers and local authorities are becoming more familiar with using planning obligations, the system is improving. The study also found that delivering affordable housing in this way makes a valuable contribution to the Government&#039;s aims of mixed communities, in particular by providing access to land in high-value areas.
</p>

<a name="50718-05_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a>However, the research also suggests that there is room for improvement. The main drawbacks of the current system are perceived to be the delays in negotiation and the resulting costs. The new circular on planning obligations aims to address some of these issues.

The eastern Caribbean is a key transit point for cocaine from Latin America destined for the UK; through UKSAT, we are seeking further to develop our law enforcement co-operation and effectiveness in the region.

</p>

<a name="50718-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a>UKSAT will work in partnership with the regional security system (RSS) and the UK Caribbean overseas territories (COTs) to enhance law enforcement capacity in the RSS countries and the COTs. This will be achieved through training, advice and mentoring to strengthen actions against drug trafficking and other organised criminal groups operating in the Caribbean.
</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a>The team will evolve over the next three years to consist of 14 personnel based in RSS countries: eight UK staff will include officers from H M Revenue and Customs and the Royal Navy and six recruited regionally.

<a name="50718-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a>The Green Paper <i>Youth Matters</i> has today been laid before Parliament.

<a name="wms_st_20"></a></p>

<a name="50718-06_para11"></a>
<p><i>Youth Matters</i> addresses key issues relating to the way in which we provide opportunities, challenge and support to our teenagers.

</p>

<a name="50718-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a>We should not lose sight of the fact that most young people are doing well, achieving more at school and going on to further study.

</p>

<a name="50718-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a>We also want to provide a wider choice of positive activities for young people to do when they are not in school, college or work and we want to encourage more young people to get involved in volunteering. It is a fundamental part of our proposals that young people and their parents should have a greater influence over the things that are provided for them   locally. Proposals include supporting local authorities to develop a card for young people which will give them discounts on activities and could be credited with amounts that young people can spend on their choice of sports and other constructive activities. We also propose a new Youth Opportunity Fund to be spent at young people&#039;s discretion on projects to improve things to do and places to go in their area.

</p>

<a name="50718-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a>We want to improve the way in which we support young people with specific needs and problems, including providing them with a nominated lead professional who will be a single point of contact and making sure that support is provided in a co-ordinated, convenient and integrated way.
</p>

<a name="50718-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a>But we should also recognise that some young people have problems and some get involved in anti-social behaviour and crime. This can have a negative impact on their life chances and affects the view the wider community has of all young people. Those who fail to behave well should be supported in improving their behaviour but should not benefit from the proposed discount card until they do so.

<p><a name="wms_st_21"></a>
<a name="50718-06_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   The most recent events in Zimbabwe are of grave concern. Zimbabweans are deprived of their democratic and human rights, facing the consequences of chronic economic misrule and grappling with severe food shortages. Over the past three weeks the Mugabe regime has launched a brutal crackdown on some of the most vulnerable Zimbabweans, including inhabitants of urban shanty settlements and informal traders.

</p>

<a name="50718-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a>Over 30,000 have been arrested, with over 40,000 households&#151;approximately 200,000 people&#151;affected with their homes and businesses callously destroyed. People suffering from AIDS are among the worst affected. Many chronically ill people have been driven from their homes. HIV prevention and home-based care programmes have been severely disrupted. We are also very concerned about the welfare of children. Infants have been forced to sleep outside in the middle of winter. There are also reports of children being detained in <br>&nbsp;<br>

prison and separated from their parents. The crackdown continues to spread across the country to many urban and some rural areas. Armed police have swiftly crushed any resistance with teargas. This action has receivedwidespread international condemnation. The UN&#039;s Special Representative on the Right to Adequate Housing called this &quot;a new form of apartheid&quot;.

</p>

<a name="50718-06_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a>In response, we have joined our EU partners in demanding that the government of Zimbabwe end this crackdown, in a statement on 7 June. Our ambassador in Harare has raised our strong concerns, directly to the   government of Zimbabwe, in meetings with the Vice-President and the Minister of State for National Security. I summoned the Zimbabwean charge d&#039;affaires on 13 June to protest at the continuing human rights abuses under the ongoing crackdown. We remain in close contact with our EU partners, with whom I raised Zimbabwe at the 13 June General Affairs and External Relations Council. We also continue to work with other international partners to maximise the pressure on Zimbabwe to end this brutality and are discussing these and other human rights abuses in Zimbabwe, with neighbouring African states and regional African bodies.
</p>

<a name="50718-06_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a>DfID is already responding to this man-made disaster, providing $400,000 so far towards humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable mainly through the UN and International Organisation for Migration. A further contribution is imminent. To date, over 5,000 families have been reached with food, blankets, soap and other forms of assistance. Where appropriate transport and emergency water and sanitation has been provided.
</p>

<a name="50718-06_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a>Since 2002 the European Union has imposed targeted sanctions on Zimbabwe; an arms embargo on the country and a travel ban and asset freeze on President Mugabe and leading regime figures. The EU&#039;s common position is kept under regular review. Together with our EU partners we have recently reassessed the situation in Zimbabwe following the March parliamentary elections. We agreed yesterday in the light of that assessment to extend the list of those regime figures caught by the travel ban and asset freeze, from 95 to 120 names. The new list includes all the senior members of the new government and politburo, and senior figures involved in manipulating the election.
</p>

<a name="50718-06_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_73"></a>This decision emphasises the EU&#039;s continued concerns about the lack of democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law that exists in Zimbabwe, and the failure of Mugabe and his regime to respond to international calls for reform.
</p>

<a name="50718-06_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_74"></a>Her Majesty&#039;s Government will continue to work with the European Union and our other international partners to restore democratic governance, human rights and the rule of law to Zimbabwe.

<p><a name="wa_st_2"></a>
<a name="50718w01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Drayson): </b>  The rules of the Armed Forces compensation scheme do not prevent an individual placing an award in a personal injury trust. It is for the individual in receipt of an award to decide how he or she wishes to use it. Such an award, whether or not it is placed in a trust fund, does not affect entitlement to either the care component or the mobility component of disability living allowance. In addition, capital in trust funds that derives from payment in compensation for personal injury may be disregarded for the purposes of assessing entitlement to income-related benefits. However, the detailed application of the relevant rules is a matter on which the individual should seek advice from the Department for Work and Pensions or from one of the ex-service organisations which can assist on such matters.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>To maintain current manning levels at the required establishment the Army has a training output target to   the infantry of 2,835 personnel for the financial year 2005&#150;06. Research has shown that high employment, attractive alternatives in further education and negative portrayal of the Army in the media will mean that achieving this target will prove challenging. Although an increase in marketing effort has produced a high level of interest, the impact on recruiting has yet to show.

The EU, for example, has agreed a regulation on the incorporation of both facial image and fingerprints into the EU common format passport. Passports and identity cards fulfil different functions, although identity cards are in some cases accepted as travel documents, as in the case with EU nationals travelling on identity cards issued by their respective member states which are accepted for travel within the EU. (The plans to introduce identity cards in   the United Kingdom are not dependent on the development of new technology for passports.) However, because we intend to link the issue of identity cards to the issue of passports, we have given the indicative cost of the two documents together in the regulatory impact assessment for the Identity Cards Bill. Most of the cost will be due to the increased cost of enhanced security features in passports. The regulatory impact assessment explains the relationship between the costs of biometric passports and the costs of identity cards.

<p><a name="wa_st_12"></a>

The UK Passport Service intends to introduce passports (ePassports) that include a contactless chip that is to contain the same biometric identifiers in a format laid down and agreed by ICAO&#039;s New Technology Working Group (NTWG). There is a clear determination for countries to apply the ICAO standards consistently and we are actively participating in activities to ensure this is the case. The interoperability of ePassports has been strongly considered and a number of trials have been held with a further trial expected later this year.

<p><a name="wa_st_16"></a>

These have included trials held in Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the United States of America. Such fora are intended to give those countries planning to issue biometric passports the opportunity to test the passports they have developed and for manufacturers to test their technology. This approach has encouraged manufacturers to develop technology designed to offer both future-proofing to support prospective developments in this field and interoperability between systems. EU member states participating in the biometric visa regulation are awaiting the results of a project run by the French and Belgians. The results of this will inform further developments of biometrics in this area.

No government have ever been able to produce an accurate figure for the number of people who are in the country illegally. By its very nature it is impossible to quantify accurately, and that remains the case. Although it is impossible to determine accurately how many people are in the UK illegally, on 30 June 2005 the Home Office published a report which included an estimate of the size of the illegal migrant population in the UK in 2001. It should be noted that the report included an estimate, not an accurate or definitive figure. As mentioned in the report, the only method to estimate the size of the unauthorised migrant population in the UK that currently can sensibly be applied is the residual method. As the method relies on data from the Census of the Population undertaken every 10   years, it is not possible to produce an estimate for   a more recent year.

Last year NISCC assisted various departments in dealing with 25 incidents of compromise. Of these incidents, 14 were malicious software infections, four were denial of service attacks, and seven were website defacements. However, departments also handled a range of incidents themselves, without direct assistance from NISCC. Details of the size of individual networks are not held by NISCC.

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_49"></a>What plans they have to increase investment in research and development from its current level of 1.8 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) to the European Union average of 2 per cent of GDP.   [HL1066]</p></ul>

</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_50"></a>Whether they will publish the evidence that led the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to approve the permanent closure of the Robin Hood Gate of Richmond Park by the Royal Parks Agency; and  [HL467]

</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_51"></a>What representations were received from the three elected local authorities which surround Richmond Park in respect of the closure of the Robin Hood Gate of Richmond Park; and whether those representations were for or against the closure of the gate; and  [HL468]

<p><a name="wa_st_91"></a>
<a name="50718w05_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   The decision to approve the permanent closure of Robin Hood Gate was based on the final report of the trial closure, produced by the Royal Parks Agency&#039;s traffic consultants Peter Brett Associates. It was published in December 2004 and is available on the   agency&#039;s website at www.royalparks.gov.uk. I am arranging for copies of the report to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
</p>

<a name="50718w05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_20"></a>Following the publication of the report we received representations from Wandsworth and Kingston borough councils opposing the continued closure of Robin Hood Gate because of the effect they claimed it was having on local traffic. Although the closure had a negligible effect on their roads, Richmond council also opposed the continued closure of the gate.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_21"></a>The then Minister for Media and Heritage, my right honourable friend the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, met elected representatives of the three local boroughs in question on 1 February 2005. A range of issues were discussed surrounding traffic management in the park. The minutes of the meetings are not being placed in the Library because to do so might inhibit the free and frank discussion at future meetings between Ministers and representatives of local authorities and prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs.

<p><a name="wa_st_93"></a>
<a name="50718w06_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </b>   The Government do not hold the detailed information requested by the noble Lord. In the early stages of the &quot;Adam&quot; case, the Metropolitan Police (MPS) wrote to educational welfare officers at each of the London boroughs asking for information on black males between the ages of four and seven years who had not turned up for the autumn term. Around 300 possible names were notified to the MPS and further inquiries by individual officers were pursued in respect of 161 boys. Officers found no evidence that any of these boys had come to any harm.
