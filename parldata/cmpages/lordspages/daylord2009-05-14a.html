There is also the importance of consultation with stakeholders; we have a good record of engaging with stakeholders involved with disabled people. There has been some criticism that perhaps we were not as robust in this case as we might have been; I think that that is part of the learning, as well.

Specifically, we are proposing to amend Schedule 7A to the 1988 Act to allow these universities to determine the size and membership of their governing bodies, as other universities are able to do.

Will he further tell us how far the Labour Government, which in their past espoused the stakeholder model of governance, are supporting the new concept of governance? If they are, why do they need to revise the schedule, which gives universities considerable flexibility over their size and membership, in terms of a membership of between 12 and 24 members, and states that they may, not must, have staff and student representation?</p>

As the noble Baroness rightly said, in the current regulation it is not mandatory; it is &#147;may&#148; rather than &#147;must&#148;.

I trust he will agree that the poor countries, and the poorest people in the poor countries, will be hit the earliest and the hardest by climate change. Indeed, they are already being hit. They are the least responsible for the big rise in concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the past half-century.

Therefore I trust that the Minister agrees that the following are required. In addition to cuts of at least 80 per cent in greenhouse gases, there should be strong support for processes where developing countries take a lead, financial and technical support for action plans, and support for China, Brazil and India.</p>

I recall that I told the noble Lord yesterday that we work very closely with our colleagues in DfID on these matters. I do not recognise the approach which the noble Lord has suggested is the Government&#146;s approach to the agreement and discussions that must take place between developing and developed countries. He is really suggesting what is sometimes called conditionality. I see it as a mutual coming together. There are huge benefits for developing countries in there being agreement in Copenhagen.

Some climate change is inevitable. We will try to mitigate the rise in temperatures generally, but this country, as well as developing countries, will also have to adapt to the inevitability of climate change.

The noble Lord, Lord Clark, asked about deforestation. Has the Minister seen reports of the dumping of substantial amounts of toxic waste on countries such as the Ivory Coast which are quite incapable of dealing with it?

Essentially, we want financial mechanisms that encourage&#151;not force, but encourage&#151;the poorer developing countries to wish to move to a low-emitting economy, which, in itself, will help them develop in a sustainable way.</p>

This week, the  HCA has released &#163;126 million specifically for MyChoiceHomeBuy to help a further 3,000 households.</p>

As she probably knows, this is an enormously popular scheme, with 200 applications a week, yet in the whole of the past year only 400 to 800 sales went through. Some people were promised money before the cash ran out and before the immediate release of new money. People who have been promised money have entered into contracts with surveyors and solicitors and have made mortgage arrangements; they are now out of pocket because they were refused money, having been told that they would get it. What will be done to help those people? I understand that they can now proceed with their purchase if the new money is available. However, if their house has already been sold, what will be done to help them?</p>

This is a popular, generous scheme, for which there is a lot of demand. I have to make it clear that everyone who was interested in the MyChoiceHomeBuy scheme would have been told that they should not spend any money on surveys or solicitors, for example, until the funding was approved. Where the funding has been approved, we have released funding and people will get their equity loans. Now we are considering what we should do in terms of next steps and funding for the affordable housing programme as a whole.</p>

The underlying problem is the acute shortage of homes compared with the number of new households formed each year. Does she accept the conclusion this month of the independent National Housing and Planning Advice Unit that, unless we substantially increase the supply of new homes to rent as well as to buy, after the recession we will face much higher house prices and much more acute shortages than we have had so far?</p>

As the noble Lord will know, we provided &#163;200 million towards bringing forward unsold stock for social rented homes and, in the Budget, &#163;400 million of kick-start for the stalled construction industry.

The noble Baroness is absolutely right: it is not just about home ownership but also about social rented homes. That is why we made &#163;200 million available for unsold stock to be brought forward from developers for the housing associations. We have given &#163;100 million to local authorities to stimulate their own housebuilding programmes. We have to meet diverse needs, including those of aspiring home owners. We need to reduce waiting lists for those who need help in accessing social rented housing. We also need to help people who are in difficulties with their mortgages, which is why we have mortgage rescue and mortgage support schemes. We are trying to do all that while stimulating the housebuilding industry.</p>

Eight of those are members of the CHASE consortium and are equity loan providers. The housing associations are spread across the country&#151;one in every region&#151;and people who are interested in these sorts of products go to those housing associations, which help them through the process to see whether they are eligible and to find them a suitable property.</p>

For example, the HomeBuy Direct scheme has &#163;300 million available but, amazingly, according to <I>Hansard</I>, as at the end of March no transactions had taken place. It is therefore heartening to hear from the Minister that, at last, the extra funds will be made available to MyChoice. Will she tell the House when this cash will be available for use? Would it not be better to have one pot for all the HomeBuy funds, so that money is made available as and when it is necessary and none of the schemes will run out of money again?</p>

I know that this is no substitute but, because the terminology of some of these projects overlaps&#151;HomeBuy Direct, Social HomeBuy, HomeBuy and so on&#151;I propose to put a document in the Library that sets out the different schemes and the different forms of funding, which should help noble Lords. I am afraid that I do not recognise the figure of &#163;300 million for HomeBuy Direct. What we have provided is &#163;400 million to kick-start new land and new homes. HomeBuy Direct, which is the scheme where equity is shared with developers, may be funded from that, which might be what the noble Lord was thinking about.</p>

<a name="09051453000069"></a><b><a name="90514-0002.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="09051453000656"></a>Baroness Massey of Darwen:</b> My Lords, it is a great pleasure to be introducing this debate in anticipation of contributions by so many distinguished colleagues. In your Lordships&#146; House there are, and have been, many champions of children and families, and I pay tribute to them all. I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Laming, who sadly cannot be here today, the much lamented Lord Dearing, and of course the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock.</p>

<a name="90514-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09051453000070"></a>I declare an interest as chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children, several of whose members are here today, together with others who have great expertise and commitment. I have said before, and I will say it again, that when we debate children&#146;s issues in this House, the concern is about children and only secondarily about party politics. This is not only refreshing, it has also enabled us to change legislation significantly on a number of occasions.</p>

<a name="90514-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09051453000071"></a>I hope that this debate will give the Minister arguments which may be incorporated into future legislation. I know that she will carry them back to the DCSF and other relevant ministries, as she is very conscientious and has the well-being of children and families at heart. I thank the Library in the House of Lords for its assiduous research on this topic and for its excellent briefing, which all noble Lords have received. I also pay tribute to the vigorous and tenacious voluntary sector for children, and the Office of the Children&#146;s Commissioner, not only for their briefings, but for discussing issues with me and for being so supportive to all of us. I know that they are well respected and listened to by Government.</p>

<a name="90514-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09051453000072"></a>One colleague from the voluntary sector asked me if the debate today would be a sort of report card on government progress. I suppose that is what, cumulatively, it will be. I am sure that we have all, at some time in our school careers, had report comments such as &#147;enthusiastic&#148;, &#147;attentive&#148;, &#147;diligent&#148;, &#147;average&#148;, &#147;inconsistent&#148;, &#147;poor&#148;, &#147;more effort needed&#148;, and so on. There is a large spectrum of achievement, from brilliant to awful. One of the most damning comments I ever had was from a domestic science teacher. In this subject we handled things such as knitting needles and hot ovens, and I was deemed to be &#147;dangerously incompetent&#148;. There was not much emphasis on self-esteem in children in those days.</p>

<a name="90514-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09051453000073"></a>On the spectrum of achievement, I would put the Government&#146;s record on children and families very high. I wonder how other noble Lords will judge it. No one can deny the immense focus that this Government have placed on children and families. No other country&#151;</p>

<a name="09051453000074"></a><b><a name="90514-0002.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="09051453000657"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> My Lords, this is extraordinary, but if I might interrupt my noble friend, it seems that the microphone to which she is speaking is defective. Therefore I urge her to move to another microphone, with the leave of the House.</p>

<a name="90514-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09051453000076"></a>I was talking about the Government&#146;s immense focus on children&#146;s issues. The Children&#146;s Commissioner has said publicly that more has happened for children in the past 10 years than in the previous 50. These achievements are, regretfully, too often unsung. The vision for children, reflecting <I>Every Child Matters</I>, the Children&#146;s Plan, and many other reports and legislation, genuinely seeks to make Britain a good place for children.</p>

<a name="90514-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09051453000077"></a>Listening to the voice of a child has become much more prevalent. Investment in outdoor play facilities, children&#146;s centres and Sure Start, increased funding for schools, investment in mental health and child health, and reviews of social care all point to a Government who care deeply about children. There are some contradictions and disappointments, for example in the child poverty targets. Nevertheless, real progress has been made&#151;we have a Minister for Children and commissioners for children. We have had reform of children&#146;s services, which is ongoing. Commitment to improvement has been visionary and consistent.</p>

<a name="90514-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09051453000078"></a>I have no intention of going through all the reports and legislation on children and families over the past 10 years or of quoting lots of statistics. Noble Lords are very good at statistics. I will single out some areas that concern me, and to which there have been some government responses. I will do this very briefly on each area&#151;other noble Lords will no doubt comment more extensively. I will then go into more detail on two initiatives which demonstrate, in different ways, a commitment to improving life for children and families.</p>

<a name="90514-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09051453000079"></a>Four things stand out for me as essential to the well-being of children and families: good parenting, a good workforce dealing with children and families, good co-ordinated systems for children and families, and listening to the voice of the child.</p>

<a name="90514-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09051453000080"></a>There are some areas of concern. There are too many children in the criminal justice system, especially in custody. Damaged children are being damaged further. This is expensive and counterproductive, and only re-emphasises the cycle of deprivation. In particular, children with special needs suffer. It is a difficult area. I am glad that youth justice has become part of DCSF, working with the Youth Justice Board, and I hope that this will change the emphasis to be more rehabilitative than punishing.</p>

<a name="90514-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09051453000081"></a>I welcome the introduction of education initiatives for young people in the criminal justice system in the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill. Children in care are also at risk, and, given the small number of such children, we should be able to improve the system.</p>

<a name="90514-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09051453000082"></a>Indeed, there are steps in place to do that. I recently visited a centre for very difficult children, Tanglewood in Wiltshire, based on the therapeutic community  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1111"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>model. As one member of staff said to me, &#147;Such children need consistency, clear boundaries and security in order to combat their low self-esteem and feelings of victimisation and powerlessness&#148;. Yet, on average, most of those young people have moved from one setting to another every six months. Therefore, a child of 13 who has been in care for seven years will have been moved 14 times as a looked-after child. Of course they have problems with attachment. Such children need intensive programmes but, alas, there are too few. Some children will be from families where substance misuse is common, while sexual abuse and domestic violence may also be common.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90514-0003.htm"/>


<a name="90514-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09051453000083"></a>Recent reports and statements emphasise protecting children, and I am glad that the Government have accepted the recommendations made by the noble Lord, Lord Laming. I am glad that the Children and Young People Act 2008 emphasised the need for better educational attainment for those in care. Social care needs high-calibre staff. The Government have recently announced extra money to recruit both departed and new social workers, a move welcomed by the LGA. The system needs an overhaul.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09051453000084"></a>My third concern is with young people&#146;s health. Young people&#146;s sexual health initiatives illustrate the dilemma. Young people&#146;s sexual health in some areas of the country has shown dramatic improvement, particularly the teenage pregnancy rates. It is clear that where this has happened, services for teenagers, such as in school, surgeries and clinics, have collaborated. The same needs to happen across all young people&#146;s health services. They need a sympathetic, confidential approach, and they need collaboration between agencies. The news that personal, social and health education is to be statutory in schools is welcome, but I wish it had happened earlier.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09051453000085"></a>My fourth concern is about the importance of play and too early an emphasis on formal learning. We have a play strategy, we have increased the time for physical activity in schools and we have had the sensible proposals of the Rose review recommending the removal of SATs at key stage 3. Young children need the chance to be creative, be it in sport, music, art, drama or whatever. Creativity is the bedrock of all real learning. Education is not training to pass exams or passive experience on a computer. The Government have invested considerably in education and in improving standards and attainment&#151;for example, the Narrowing the Gap initiative, 21st Century Schools and the gifted and talented programme. There has also been investment in improving outcomes for children with special education needs.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09051453000086"></a>I said earlier that a vital foundation for well-being in children and families is good parenting. Most children are wonderful and not the depraved monsters depicted in the media and perceived as such by many adults. I believe that some 70 per cent of stories about children in the media are negative, a shocking indictment. The experience of children in families is all-important, and the Government are to be congratulated on their support to families by way of tax credits and other initiatives, as well as by parenting support through Sure Start and family intervention programmes, which I shall say more about in a minute. The Government  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1112"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have recognised that disability in families requires special support. Welfare reform policies will help more people into work, the best route out of poverty.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09051453000087"></a>Sadly, some families fail children. I am chair of the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse. I am proud of the progress made on drug treatment over the past eight years, due largely to dramatically increased government funding support. I see the impact of parental substance misuse, usually of drugs and alcohol, on children who may end up as victims, either as young carers or removed into care, or simply suffering. Thankfully, some are picked up by family and friends, particularly by grandparents. I am glad to say that the Government have responded in part to the needs of such grandparents by regularising their national insurance contributions, although there is still some way to go in ensuring that such family carers have adequate financial and other support. When families are failing, that needs to be spotted early and measures taken. Support must be built in and superb care systems are required, otherwise negative and vicious cycles will continue. The Government have recognised that.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09051453000088"></a>Time is needed for policies to become embedded and for good practice to spread. More joint working across government and across services at a local level is needed to deliver the desired outcomes. I know the Government are working hard on this, but the breakdown of silos may take longer than was anticipated. Perhaps the Minister can give some examples of good practice in collaboration at national and local levels.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09051453000089"></a>I end by referring to two recent initiatives that demonstrate aspects of working with children and families in positive ways. The first example encourages young people to become activists on environmental issues, something that young people are interested in. The Health Protection Agency defines sustainable development as a way of linking together recommendations in UK strategy for children&#146;s environment and health. Small steps to a sustainable future, a project funded by the DCSF sustainable development team, works in collaboration with the National Children&#146;s Bureau. It will involve local authorities and vulnerable young people to develop a young person&#146;s vision for sustainable development. The NCB is also a founding member of children in a changing climate, a global advocacy and learning programme aiming to motivate children, young people and their families, to influence climate change. The Government have set up the development of a sustainable schools programme, Defra has led a third sector task force on climate change and environment, and youth climate change champions were appointed in 2008. This timely action involves young people and families directly, and works across government and agencies.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09051453000090"></a>The second initiative is the family interventions project, which works with challenging families to tackle anti-social behaviour, prevent homelessness and tackle social disadvantage. There are 67 of these projects across England, and they will be expanded to every local authority targeted in the youth crime action plan. More than half the projects are being run by local authorities, through for example, community safety, youth offending, children&#146;s services or housing  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1113"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1113</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>departments. The remainder are run by the voluntary sector, such as the National Children&#146;s Home and other organisations.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09051453000091"></a>The projects have a key worker, who will help the family identify problems, co-ordinate services to support the family and agree steps to motivate change. They have proved very successful, and evidence suggests that they save money. It is estimated that a family with severe problems could cost between &#163;250,000 and &#163;300,000 a year, without such interventions. Again these projects involve families in solutions to problems, and have multi-agency collaboration. It is not just doing things to people, which can be demotivating and create dependency.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09051453000092"></a>I have tried to demonstrate that vision and determination can make a difference. Parents, a good workforce, co-ordinated systems of delivery and listening to and involving children and families are all key. This Government have shown vision and determination. We all know that governments cannot do it all&#151;visionary and determined people in the systems are what ultimately count. However governments can set an agenda. There are of course still issues to be addressed, but children and families deserve governments who help them thrive. I hope that whatever the next election brings, and whichever political party is in power, it will not lose sight of the need to act on behalf of every child and every family.</p>

I too came close to being dangerously incompetent in domestic science, although my husband probably thinks I still am. In the short time I have, I will focus on just a couple of issues; first, the increasing perception that our children are less fulfilled and happy than they once were, and, secondly, the threat to family life in all its forms. I do not believe it is too controversial to suggest that the two are closely linked.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09051453000094"></a>It was more than two years ago, in February 2007, that UNICEF&#151;I declare an interest as a trustee of UNICEF UK&#151;produced its damning report on the state of childhood in Britain. The findings were profoundly worrying, and although most noble Lords will be familiar with them, the main headline deserves to be highlighted. The UK was rated at the bottom of the table overall for children&#146;s well-being, scoring the lowest of the 21 industrialised countries studied&#151;not near the bottom, but at the very bottom. Even after two years I think that conclusion has lost none of its power to shock.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09051453000095"></a>The significance of the UNICEF report was that it found that neither national wealth nor household wealth in the countries concerned was the determining factor in whether children were happy. By definition, the countries studied were developed and affluent but there was still evidence of poverty in the quality of the childhood experience. A detailed look at the report shows that family breakdown is more prevalent in the  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1114"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1114</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>UK, with fewer children living with both parents than in any other country except the United States. But the most shocking findings were those on children&#146;s behaviour, with the UK leading the tables on the percentage of young people indulging in &#147;risk&#148; behaviour such as drunkenness and under-age sex.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09051453000096"></a>Just a few months after the UNICEF report, the Children&#146;s Commissioner, Sir Al Aynsley-Green, warned of a</p>
<ul><a name="09051453000526"></a>&#147;crisis at the heart of our society&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051453000484"></a>Sadly, this grim picture has been reinforced again in the recent report compiled last month by the University of York for the Child Poverty Action Group. Although it shows the UK placed slightly higher than in the previous UNICEF study, it is only slightly better, at 24th out of 29 countries. Germany comes out in eighth place, with Scandinavian countries at the top of the table. Overall, it looks depressingly like the scoreboard of the Eurovision Song Contest over recent years. Let us hope we have a better result in that this weekend, but I fear that solving the complex problems of childhood will be beyond even the ability of my noble friend Lord Lloyd-Webber.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09051453000097"></a>I acknowledge that, following the UNICEF report, the Government published the Children's Plan and the Department for Children, Schools and Families was born. Of course, change does not happen overnight, but it seems as if we keep debating the same issues, passing more pieces of legislation and getting the same outcomes. One area where this is most obvious is children in care, the system now known in local government by the awful title of &#147;corporate parenting&#148;. We learnt last month that the attainment gap for looked-after children has widened. As Natasha Finlayson, the chief executive of the Who Cares? Trust said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="09051453000502"></a>&#147;Achieving a level of good GCSE grades is the absolute minimum to ensure children get access to employment and a good start in life. It is a major concern that progress is so slow and the gap between those in care and not in care is widening&#148;.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09051453000098"></a>But it does not have to be that way. During our deliberations on the Children and Young Persons Bill and in previous debates I drew attention to Barnet Council, where each child in the care of the council has been twinned with an employee of the council. They do not meet them or mentor them but they are that &#147;pushy&#148; parent that all children need, asking the awkward questions. The result is a dramatic improvement in educational achievements. That does not require money or an all singing and dancing piece of legislation; it is simply something that works.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09051453000099"></a>Similarly, we are now in the middle of a debate on whether more children should be taken into care or whether we should spend more time and resources on early intervention. Again in Kent&#151;I make no apologies for referring to this once more&#151;the authorities spend a good deal of their precious resources on working with families and the extended family to try to reach a solution which keeps the family together. Only when that has failed do they take a child into care, and then move swiftly to adoption so that a child receives the stability and consistency that is so vital to the well-being of which the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, spoke&#151;and it saves money. So my question to the Minister is, what happens to best practice? Rather than always trying to

Why do we always have to have shiny plans and countless new pieces of legislation?</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09051453000100"></a>In conclusion, alongside providing our children with the best possible education with rigorous standards, we must support families and help them to stay together wherever possible. Unless we address the root cause of family breakdown, or in many cases the absence of a family structure at all, I fear that the Government's well-intentioned policies will fail to deliver the quality of life and opportunities that so many of our children and young people deserve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09051453000105"></a>Families these days come in all shapes and sizes. They may consist of two people or myriad people, one child or more, one parent or more&#151;maybe male and female or same sex&#151;birth parents and foster or adoptive parents. They may be made up of two, three, even four generations. There is diversity in ethnicity, faith, health and wealth. In short, there is no such thing as a standard family and no pat solutions for ensuring universal well-being. Today&#146;s tolerance of diverse families should have reaped positive benefits.

Often a single case can make a more powerful point than all the general statistics put together. The film follows an 11 year-old child, as seen through her eyes, as she is moved away from her drunken father to a children&#146;s home. She is surrounded by well meaning but often inadequate adults, trying to cope in the most difficult circumstances with young people in need.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09051453000107"></a>The film is a dramatisation, but with the detail of a documentary. It conveys the lack of security, warmth or engagement between adults and children. It portrays the powerlessness of a child taken into care, her isolation and the basic wish to be with a parent, to be part of a family unit. We witness young people reaching out for communication, recognition from another child or an adult, with brief moments of friendship, happiness and love, which give hope of a better life.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09051453000108"></a>Reports from UNICEF, Barnardo&#146;s and other children&#146;s organisations indicate that such a depiction of vulnerable, disadvantaged children is sadly only too real. Children in care have so much disproportionately poorer prospects of success, educationally or socially. The levels of child poverty in this country are still much too high, given our wealth as a nation. In raising awareness, there should be a concerted effort to use the expertise and advice from children&#146;s organisations to target funding where it can be most effective and to encourage people to train and to work in social care. Adverse publicity about tragic cases has accelerated moves to ensure better safety for vulnerable children, but too many laws and regulations may have unintended consequences. There is a real danger that good people will be deterred from becoming social workers and fewer people will come forward. They work in some of the most difficult and dangerous areas of the community, often under stress, often undervalued and underpaid, but with some of the greatest rewards in turning around disadvantaged lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09051453000109"></a>This debate comes shortly before your Lordships' House considers the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill, which will have an impact on children&#146;s well-being. Education has a key part to play in ensuring that young people grow into responsible and confident adults, better equipped to be caring parents. To that end, we, too, welcome the Government&#146;s commitment to making PSHE a compulsory part of the curriculum as one step toward giving them the confidence and skills to build good relationships.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09051453000110"></a>The well-being and safeguarding of children should be the responsibility of us all&#151;of parents, certainly, but with the support of friends and neighbours, and of professionals in schools and health services. We look forward to hearing from the Minister how the Government will take forward the issues raised in the debate to provide opportunities and quality of life for those who need them most.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09051453000112"></a>I want to address a relatively narrow issue, but one to which I know the Government, to their great credit, are committed: the improvement of children&#146;s linguistic abilities. I think of it as linguistic deprivation; it has also been spoken of as language poverty. The Government have taken good note of the 2008 Bercow report, and doubtlessly of Sir Jim Rose&#146;s recent remarks in his curriculum review on speech and language needs. Nothing is more important to a child&#146;s future well-being than confident communication.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09051453000113"></a>Some time ago, I visited a primary school on the outskirts of Birmingham, an area of acute poverty and squalor where most of the children were of single mothers, living in blocks of flats quite apparently in need of demolition. A nursery school had only recently been opened at the school as a result of intense lobbying by the local GP.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09051453000114"></a>The average vocabulary of the children, aged about three when they started, was five words, at least two of which were expletives. The difficulty that the teachers faced was largely that of engaging the attention of the children, who had never had a conversation in their lives. Their mothers, many of whom had relatively short-stay boyfriends, had no time or inclination to talk. When they went out, it was usually in a pushchair facing firmly away from their mother; at home, they sat in front of the television.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09051453000115"></a>I heard from the teachers, and could see for myself, that one of the most important things that those children began to learn was to do things together in a regular, indeed a rhythmic, sequence, such as playing ring a ring o&#146; roses, saying rhymes together or singing songs. They were drawn in to such activities and began to enjoy all the repetitions, jokes and actions. All this was confirmed in last year&#146;s departmental national strategy publication, <I>Every Child a Talker</I>, which is full of ideas for nursery and primary school teachers and for parents. But there is one thing that I would like to factor in to this programme: radio.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09051453000116"></a>I must declare an interest as acting chairman of a broadcasting group called Sound Start, which for three years ran a highly successful children&#146;s radio station in London as a privately funded pilot&#151;the group is actively campaigning for children&#146;s radio and hopes to collaborate with the BBC. As noble Lords will know, the BBC will next week bring to an end its only readily accessible radio programme for young children.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09051453000117"></a>This seems to be a genuine abrogation of the duty of public service broadcasting. The BBC is, sadly, moving increasingly further away from what it used to do so brilliantly in schools&#146; radio programmes, which were useful, not only at school but at home. The need for this good programming is even greater, now that there are more children in our primary and nursery schools for whom English is not the first language.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09051453000118"></a>The BBC has turned its back on an enormous service that it used to perform. It shares the totally unfounded belief that small children are not interested in radio and that the only radio they need is the sort of wall-to-wall pop that they can listen to while they are doing something else. This belief is completely and profoundly mistaken, as the BBC could have a profound input into making children take part in what I think of  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1118"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as genuine conversation. Radio also used to be amazingly useful for schools which lacked a teacher with the confidence or ability to teach music, movement, singing, rhymes, poetry and literature. There are schools where teachers could easily learn from the input of radio.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09051453000119"></a>I come back to the concept of linguistic deprivation, which is one of the most serious kinds of deprivation that a child can possibly suffer. I firmly believe that radio can teach children not only to talk and to sing, but to listen. Television is no substitute, because it tends on the whole to distract a child from listening and to limit a child&#146;s imagination. After all, the imagination of children is the foundation of their future education, well-being and ability to live lives that they will think are worth living.</p>

<a name="90514-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09051453000120"></a>I therefore ask the Minister to assure the House that subsidising children&#146;s radio will form part of the speech, language and communication action plan under which the Government are committed, I am glad to say, to spending several million pounds over the next few years. I greatly welcome the action plan, but beg the Minister to consider the place that radio may have in school and, perhaps above all, at home, where children and parents together can benefit and learn&#151;learn the power of listening and talking&#151;as a way of properly engaging with the world.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="09051453000503"></a>&#147;the reader to ask what we have in the &#145;bank&#146; of mind and spirit in our culture that reinforces love and fidelity and offers some robust account of what long-term human welfare looks like and what it demands&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051453000485"></a>I want briefly to say something about what well-being looks like and something about what it demands.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90514-0004.htm"/>


<a name="90514-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09051453000123"></a>There are at present no universally agreed ways of defining and measuring well-being. In terms of children, ideas about well-being have often been transferred directly from concepts which apply to adults, with inadequate reference to children themselves. In addition, there has been a tendency to focus more on children&#146;s future well-being or &#147;well-becoming&#148; as adults than on their experience of childhood, and to measure child well-being in terms of the absence of negative indicators, such as substance abuse, rather than the presence of positive ones. How do we attend wisely to the views of children themselves on these matters?</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09051453000124"></a>This year, for example, the Get Ready for Change! project saw a group of children and young people carrying out a major children&#146;s rights investigation and submitting their own report to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva to inform its examination of the United Kingdom. Such projects fall far short of a systematic attempt to monitor  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1119"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and assess the experiences of children over time. For that reason, the Children&#146;s Society is developing a well-being framework based on a consultation exercise with Ipsos MORI. The first phase of the survey, a representative sample of over 7,000 children, in years six, eight and 10, was completed in July 2008. The findings are due to be published this summer. This will be a major part of identifying well-being among different subgroups of children, leading to the development and testing of a new index of child well-being. Some of the themes are already clear, even predictable. The family is clearly of paramount importance. When children and young people were asked to choose between love, respect, support and freedom, in terms of their importance in family relationships, 70 per cent chose love.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09051453000125"></a>We can begin to see where this message is getting through in the recent Children, Schools and Families Select Committee report on looked-after children, which concluded,</p>
<ul><a name="09051453000527"></a>&#147;the greatest gains in reforming our care system are to be made in identifying and removing whatever barriers are obstructing the development of good personal relationships, and putting in place all possible means of supporting such relationships where they occur&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051453000486"></a>I want briefly to focus on child poverty, for it is clear that the well-being of children demands a fundamental change in our approach to inequalities and a renewed political determination to deliver on the targets for child poverty eradication. I hope that we shall hear from the Minister on the subject, because if there is a golden thread linking all the policies around child well-being, this is it.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09051453000126"></a>The financial crisis offers us a chance to rethink our public values; to evaluate the collective social, political and economic costs of our present inequalities, as the Joseph Rowntree Foundation&#146;s recent research has clearly revealed. Living in poverty has an immediate and enduring impact on children&#146;s lives. In my own diocese, in some of the inner city schools, 85 per cent of children are on free school meals; one school has children speaking 40 different languages. Here we see powerfully the impact of poverty and multiple disadvantage and we realise that those forms of inequality demand focus and sustained attention on the alleviation of poverty. It was therefore a serious disappointment that in the Budget the Government were not able to prioritise spending in that area, putting only &#163;20 extra per child per year on tax credit, or merely 38p per child per week. Will the Minister commit today to doing everything possible to ensure that the pre-Budget report in the autumn gets the Government back on track to reach the 700,000 children who need to be taken out of poverty if the 2010 target is to be achieved?</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09051453000127"></a>The well-being of children focuses our attention on the central task of a civilised society: the task of inducting children into responsible and fulfilling lives. That is a challenge at every point of government policy but especially in facing with real, enduring courage the challenge of the toxic combination of inequality, high child poverty and low social mobility in this country, relative to many European comparators and illustrated by the UNICEF report to which reference has already been made. If we are to move beyond what

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09051453000129"></a>I say that this debate is timely because we are about to embark on a legislative marathon, including the Coroners and Justice Bill, the Welfare Reform Bill, the Policing and Crime Bill, the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill and the Equality Bill, all of which contain clauses relevant to children. Therefore, it is very timely to be reminded of their needs and problems as we approach that process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09051453000130"></a>I want to focus on one aspect only&#151;children in custody&#151;and take as my text the excellent joint report of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons and the Youth Justice Board entitled <I>Children and Young People in Custody</I><I> 2006-2008</I>, which was published recently. I shall cite two passages from it, one from the text and one from the conclusions, because I could not put what is said better and they are relevant for the House. Talking about the whole survey, the report states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="09051453000504"></a>&#147;The results ... show, in general, a steady improvement in terms of young people's experience of the custodial environment&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09051453000487"></a>which is to be welcomed&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09051453000505"></a>&#147;But there is less encouraging news in relation to what the effect on them will be. Ease of contact with family and friends had deteriorated both for young men and young women ... only a third of them said that it was easy for their families to visit, and in some establishments this figure was as low as a quarter (for young men) or 13% (for young women). Over a quarter of young women and nearly one in five young men said they had no visits at all. This must reflect the distance from home of some young people. In some establishments, a significant proportion also said they had problems contacting their families by telephone or mail.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09051453000506"></a>There had also been deterioration, for young men, in some other important resettlement areas. Fewer young men said they could see their training plan, or had been contacted by a youth offending team or social worker or probation officer while in custody. There was still only a minority of young men&#151;around four out of 10&#151;who believed that they had done anything in custody that would help them not to offend again; though this rose to nearly eight out of 10 among sentenced young people in the one open unit (which has now been closed)&#148;.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09051453000131"></a>In conclusion, the report states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="09051453000507"></a>&#147;There are some key messages ... from these surveys. First, there is considerable variation in young people&#146;s experiences and opportunities between different establishments ... there are also variations which are not inexplicable ... where culture, management or history seem to play a part. It also remains troubling that overall so many young people have felt unsafe ... the experience  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1121"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of black and minority ethnic young men remains significantly more negative ... Third, and most importantly, the experience of custody is only a part of these young lives, and it must be of concern that links with families and, for young men, with support services outside prison, seem to have loosened&#148;.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09051453000132"></a>Those are serious and worrying words. They reflect something that I have been saying now for more than 10 years: until and unless someone, some person, is responsible and accountable for consistent direction of what happens to children in custody, we will continue to have uneven performance. We will continue to have the ridiculous situation that incoming governors and directors of establishments are not required to carry on from where their predecessor left off but can do what they like in relation to the targets and performance indicators that they have been given.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09051453000133"></a>As has been mentioned, there is a disconnect between what happens in young offender establishments, run by the Prison Service, secure training centres, which are run by private companies on contract to the Youth Justice Board, local authority secure homes, some of which are run by local authorities and some by the private sector. In this context, I deplore, as I have many times in this House, the abolition of the Commission for Social Care Inspection, which focused entirely on issues such as safeguarding, which the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester just mentioned. Until and unless something is done to improve the overall direction of what happens, we will still go on having to read this depressing catalogue of avoidable failure, which is damaging the young people whose interests all of us in this nation must have at heart. I beg the Government to do something serious to overcome this deficiency.</p>

Therefore, I will focus on just one aspect, sport, which I firmly believe ranks with equal importance to apparently more serious areas being covered today. For who can deny the part that sport plays in our society, whether as a fan, an aspiring player or an occasional participant in a huge variety of sport? All that against the increasing awareness of an epidemic of obesity among both young and old and the anger and frustration we feel at not having access or opportunity to take part in our favoured sports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09051453000138"></a>When I reflect on the Government&#146;s policies today, I have to remember the starting point in the 1990s. School sport was reduced to a token. Curriculum expansion had almost pushed PE off the timetable. Heads were more concerned with academic league tables and made flimsy defence of sport. Not only that, but extra-curricula activities in state schools had bitten the dust, thanks, in no small part, to the noble Lord, Lord Baker of Dorking&#151;as a fallout of his confrontation with teachers.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09051453000139"></a>What has been done to repair the damage&#151;frankly, an enormous amount. The Government have set up a delivery framework&#151;Sport England, UK Sport and the Youth Sport Trust&#151;which has built up a positive rapport with all the governing bodies of sport in the United Kingdom. Huge amounts of money have been channelled into sport, &#163;2.4 billion, divided equally between sport in schools and the community, the development of young players and encouraging families to return to active sport.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09051453000140"></a>What has been the result? Well, a transformation. Sport in schools, from having virtually no time in the timetable, is now five hours for primary schools and three hours for secondary schools. Extra-curricular sport is flourishing. Clubs, teams and groups are in competition. Competitive sport has regained its proper place in society. There is a genuine broad offer of sport for all with schools and colleges. Volunteering, officiating, running clubs and being coaches are being promoted. All these are essential if we are to build for the future and staff the London Olympics in 2012.

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09051453000141"></a>Links between schools and clubs are essential. Three years ago, the Government created community amateur sports clubs. That is part of the answer, but that bridge is not yet completed. Clubs must change and become less exclusive. Community sports clubs have an inducement of rate reduction. Governing bodies are putting in place a matrix of link officials who work with schools to publicise sport in their area and help identify sports that students can take part in&#151;all this against the alarming rising figures of obesity. Sport not only helps counter that but adds to the social inclusion of many youngsters in society; and it is fun and lifelong. If only noble Lords had come along to watch the match at the Lords and Commons tennis club this Thursday, they would have witnessed extraordinary scenes of aging players thoroughly enjoying themselves, albeit a trifle creaky the following day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09051453000142"></a>The Government are playing their part and must be determined to continue with a high level of support. The credit crunch puts pressure on all budgets, but this budget line is surely one that must be protected at whatever cost. We cannot slip back to the dark days of the 1990s. I very much hope that the Minister will assure us of that. If I speak with unusual passion, that might be because I spent part of my childhood in care. Sport played a crucial part in helping me to find new friends within the community of sport.</p>

If they resort to that old chestnut of dark evenings being dangerous, I hope they will quote this month&#146;s report from the National Audit Office saying that child pedestrians are most at risk from 3 pm to 7 pm, especially in the weeks after the end of British summertime.</p>

I would like to take advantage of this valuable debate introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, to raise a specific issue about well-being: access to justice for those children whose future is decided in the courts.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09051453000146"></a>As has been said, one of the most vulnerable groups are those children who are in care and those who are the subject of care proceedings with the possibility of permanent removal from their families. All such children committed to care have to have an order, either of a judge or of magistrates, and they have to go through court proceedings. Many such children have been physically or sexually abused or seriously neglected and all have been emotionally abused. Allegations have to be proved and medical and social worker evidence has to be tested to assist the court to decide whether the case for a care order is proved.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09051453000147"></a><I>Every Child Matters: Next Steps</I> refers to the importance of the family justice system for children. Family lawyers, the Family Law Bar Association, family solicitors such as Resolution and the Association of Lawyers for Children spend long hours preparing these cases with voluminous evidence and difficult and often insoluble problems where their expertise and experience are of great help to family judges, which, as your Lordships will appreciate, was what I was at one time. The work of these lawyers, of barristers in particular, often makes a real difference to the outcome. However, contrary to public belief, family lawyers are not particularly well paid under this legal aid system.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09051453000148"></a>I recently co-chaired a meeting for the Family Law Bar Association with the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, to learn about the Legal Services Commission&#146;s proposals to restructure the package of payments to family barristers in the longer cases. Because of a marked reduction in those cases, there will be a most damaging effect on the availability of experienced family practitioners in those cases. There will be fewer family lawyers prepared to do this work. They will vote with their feet and there will be a great disincentive for young barristers coming into family work. As a former family judge, I already advise Bar students not to do family work. Following the Legal Services Commission&#146;s proposals, there is about to be a serious and irreparable loss of the pool of expertise.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09051453000149"></a>My concern is not at all for the lawyers; it is for children and the parents who must be represented. The legal aid changes raise issues about the rights and welfare of children. They involve Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and Articles 6 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. There will be a lack of access to justice and a lack of adequate representation of children and of the parents who may be unfairly accused of misbehaviour and may lose their children for ever. Much more important is the grave danger of the loss for children of their parents if these cases are not properly tested.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09051453000150"></a>I cannot overemphasise the potential damage to these extremely vulnerable groups of children. It is worrying that the Legal Services Commission does not recognise children among its stakeholders. I should make it clear that the family Bar is asking not for more money but for a more sensible redistribution of the money that the Legal Services Commission and the Ministry of Justice say will be available. I appreciate that I am taking the Minister by surprise, but I ask the Government to recognise the damage that will be done if the Family Law Bar Association&#146;s proposals are not taken seriously. Those proposals should be looked at again. A failure to do so would undermine all the Government&#146;s other good policies, which I so very much support.</p>

I shall focus on the interconnectedness between educational achievement, family and community support, and the importance of aspiration and self-belief in our young people. When the Prime Minister announced the creation of the new Department for Children, Schools and Families in 2007, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="09051453000508"></a>&#147;Children and families are the bedrock of our society. The Government&#146;s aim is to ensure that every child gets the best possible start in life, receiving the ongoing support and protection that they&#151;and their families&#151;need to allow them to fulfil their potential&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/7/07; col. <I>WS 82</I>.]</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09051453000152"></a>Today, I shall focus on one initiative, Trailblazers, which I have supported for the past four years and which aims to deliver some of these goals in a practical way and to link strongly to the <I>Every Child Matters</I> agenda. Trailblazers was started in 2004 by the Learning Trust, which runs educational services in Hackney. I declare an interest in that my sister works for the Learning Trust in Hackney. Hackney is an inner-city borough, with all the attendant challenges. It is the third most ethnically diverse local authority in the United Kingdom, with a dynamic and constantly changing population and high levels of poverty. It has formidable educational challenges, with young people facing significant pressures to engage in behaviour that makes them vulnerable to harm. As a consequence, the borough suffers from negative stereotyping about its schools, its young people and the wider community.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09051453000153"></a>In focus groups and consultations, students said that their achievements should be celebrated and recognised by the local community. This was in line with the trust&#146;s own objective to raise awareness of the  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1125"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>positive achievements of young people in the borough, and so the Trailblazers initiative was born. Its objectives were publicly to celebrate the achievements of the young people in the borough, to combat negative stereotypes of Hackney schools, to give examples of excellence, to attract the recognition of the community, to inspire students to reach their full potential through education and to improve GCSE results.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09051453000154"></a>The trust began by identifying young people who had achieved across a range of different areas. Importantly, it looked not only at young people who were academic but at those who were making significant progress in other areas, including behaviour. The early stage of the campaign included an advertising campaign on buses and billboards that asked Hackney citizens to support Hackney children. The campaign was entitled &#147;Hackney is with you all the way&#148;, and was run just before the children&#146;s exams. Hackney residents could not miss it.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09051453000155"></a>What a success it has been. To date, more than  600 super-achieving students have been nominated by secondary schools as trailblazers across the categories of academic achievement, sports, creative arts, musical excellence and personal development. They have become the voice and role models for Hackney youth. All Hackney secondary schools have participated in the campaign. Trailblazers became the model for the London Challenge&#151;the London-wide schools recognition programme. A student was sponsored to attend Gordonstoun School, five university students have been sponsored and revision publications have been used by students and parents across the borough.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09051453000156"></a>A head teacher said: &#147;People need to look behind the headlines declaring that Hackney schools are failing their children, and you will see a totally different story&#148;. A young woman said: &#147;Hackney students are tired of being considered second-class citizens. We want everyone to know that we are achieving excellence&#148;. The then chair of the Learning Trust said: &#147;In Hackney, we are no longer happy with mediocrity but genuinely aspire to excellence&#148;.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09051453000157"></a>Students have achieved the highest marks in GSCEs in the county. Their talents are endless. The campaign was a simple idea that was driven by the passion of students in Hackney. All its materials featured students or their work and led to spin-off activities in schools. It has captured the imagination of local people and acted as a call to action that was accepted by students and the teaching community. The success of this programme rests on its co-ordinated approach. It engages students, parents, teachers, administrators and the whole community in recognising that we all have potential and that there is a need to nurture and support talent and to celebrate achievement. I have been privileged to host an annual event for Trailblazers in this House, which has been supported by other noble Lords.</p>

<a name="90514-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09051453000158"></a>I ask the Minister to tell the House what initiatives the Government have supported to promote community support for educational achievement and to live up to the department&#146;s ambition to promote the wider contribution of young people to their communities.</p>

She is a tireless advocate for children and their families and I can testify to the fact that she also encourages other Members of this House.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09051453000160"></a>Families come in all shapes and sizes and, although we all hope that every child can be brought up in a stable environment, we know that family breakdown happens. Most parents manage to make good arrangements for the care of their children when divorce or separation occurs, but for the 10 per cent who fail to come to an agreement the family courts must help and intervene.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09051453000161"></a>I shall spend my few minutes this afternoon talking about the children and family courts system and about the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service and the social workers who try to help the families who come before it. CAFCASS is a non-departmental public body that comes within the framework of the Department of Children, Schools and Families; it is therefore part of the government framework. I declare an interest as its present chair and previous deputy chair for five years.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09051453000162"></a>It is no secret that CAFCASS has had a difficult journey and that we still have much to do. However, we have consolidated 113 organisations into one national CAFCASS and we have built a corporate identity as a service provider and an employer. We have much to do in the areas of standards, but we are working on it. We must remind ourselves that we have a statutory responsibility to ensure that children and young people are put first in family proceedings, that their voices are heard properly, that the decisions made about them by the courts are in their interests and that they and their families are supported throughout the process.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09051453000163"></a>As such, the organisation plays a key role in family life within the legislative framework set by Parliament. We are involved with some 80,000 children a year and have a staff of around 2,000, most of them social workers. Care and separation proceedings are fraught with conflict. For many, it is about winning a battle where the children have been either the victims or weary bystanders. Much of our work is about helping families to see the conflict through the eyes of the child and to seek a resolution.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09051453000164"></a>In private law, divorce and separation start with the presumption that it is in the child&#146;s best interests to maintain contact with both parents, unless there are good reasons to the contrary, such as domestic violence or neglect. We must remind ourselves, particularly this week, of the importance of protecting women and children from domestic violence. There is a view, however, that the law treats non-resident parents unreasonably in the family courts. This view has led in part to the opening up of the courts to the press. The Government&#146;s own research, however, and our most recent gender outcomes statistics show that there is,</p>
<ul><a name="09051453000528"></a>&#147;no evidence that non resident parents as a group are systematically unreasonably treated by the family courts&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051453000165"></a>On the contrary, it looks as though fathers are taking more part in the lives of children. We in CAFCASS work closely with support groups such as Families

Of course, there is a small minority of cases where a parent is determined to continue the relationship battle whatever the detriment to the child. Ending contact in these cases can save that child from emotional harm.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09051453000166"></a>In public law, where children are likely to be removed from both parents for care reasons, CAFCASS carries out some of its most high-profile work, as the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, mentioned. Key to this, as in all our work, is the role of safeguarding&#151;ensuring that children are properly protected. In the aftermath of the case of the murder of Baby P, the number of care applications has escalated sharply. The trend continues. It represents a shift in intervention threshold by local authorities. We have found that there is an increase in the number of cases coming to court of children who are already known to local authorities and where chronic neglect is the main feature.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09051453000167"></a>Each child and family needs intensive help, clear assessment and decisive plans. My concern is that none of the agencies is meeting this requirement at the present time, as reflected in the second report of the noble Lord, Lord Laming. Work with chaotic, disordered families, where there is poverty linked with alcohol or drug abuse, or both, and where parents have limited emotional ability, requires the highest-skilled workers, either to keep the family at home or to make the difficult decision to remove the child. One thing is certain: the social worker who will undertake this task on behalf of us all will be damned if they do and damned if they don&#146;t.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09051453000168"></a>The Secretary of State has made a commitment to supporting social workers and I hope to hear the Minister today reiterate her support. We have to come through this crisis of backlogs and difficulties. We have to come to the point where we can find other ways of helping families and their children. The debate introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, is a useful way of focusing on many ways forward. Government policy and the <I>Every Child Matters</I> agenda must mean every child because, as my chief executive Anthony Douglas put it:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="09051453000509"></a>&#147;Each child is not a statistic but a person with complex and long-term needs which the State has a duty of care to meet&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051453000169"></a>In these difficult times, I know that the Minister and the Government will do everything possible to meet those needs; we in CAFCASS will do everything in our power to play our part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09051453000171"></a>We need to go back 100 years, to Lloyd George&#146;s introduction of national insurance. He refused to accept that sickness, unemployment, old age and so on were a lack of moral fibre to be dealt with by charity. He would have preferred universal provision and a decent poor law but the stigma of that was unacceptable. So he went for contributory national insurance for the head of the household&#151;for the working man. That  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1128"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>kept out the rough and the idle, and women. His principles were continued by Beveridge, who worked for Lloyd George. As long as the man held on to his 40-year job and his wife held on to him, they were okay. National insurance, revamped poor law, filled in the gaps for the uninsurable, the lone parent, the widow. The bones of that system&#151;contributory national insurance for men underpinned by means-tested benefits for women&#151;still scaffold our welfare state, wrongly in my view. Why is it wrong? Because it has continuously discriminated against women.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09051453000172"></a>Let us think about it. Benefits assume that you are either in full-time work or out of it. That is fine for men but impossible for most women, who can manage only part-time work. What about pensions&#151;save for 40 years, save early, save enough, do not touch it? That is fine for men, because pensions depend on full-time work, but impossible for most women. Economics and demographics have rendered this model of Lloyd George and Beveridge pretty much obsolete. Yet we still expect women to get their benefit and pension cover either from husbands, even though half of women in their 50s or 60s are not married, or, if they are without a husband, to behave like men even though most will have children, grandchildren or elderly parents to  care for.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09051453000173"></a>All Governments have recognised the problem and sought to tweak the system. Since 1997, the Government&#146;s record has been admirable. They have made it possible for mothers, particularly lone parents, to work. The minimum wage, the tenth anniversary of which was yesterday, has benefited a million people, mostly women. Tax credits, childcare provision and the right to request flexible working have made work possible and work pay. As we all know, the only way to address child poverty is to bring up the child in a working family.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09051453000174"></a>As for pensions, five years ago 90 per cent of men, but generally only 20 per cent of women, could retire with a full basic state pension. As a result of the great work of James Purnell, the number of years required for a basic state pension is down to 30. Those caring for older people and, to my delight, those caring for grandchildren for more than 20 hours a week will receive a national insurance credit. This is a real recognition of family values and the dependence of one family generation on another. Above all&#151;thanks to your Lordships&#151;the Government have allowed people, mainly women, to fill in their pension gap through the buy-back of missing national insurance years. One hopes that within the next decade or so both women and men will have similar coverage, perhaps of 85 or 90 per cent, in their pensions.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09051453000175"></a>We have travelled a long way. And yet, why keep the state pension contributory if fairly soon almost all will be covered but in unnecessarily complicated ways? Why not go for a universal state pension based, say, on 20 years&#146; residence? This would be simple, popular, inexpensive and save 3,000 jobs administering a redundant system. Why continue to police a contributory system to keep people out when, on the other hand, we then use credits to bring them back in again?</p>

Given that three-quarters of unemployed men voluntarily return to work within six months, JSA&#146;s tough conditionality has been designed for the 22-year-old who is reluctant to get up in the morning. That is fine: a 22 year-old can be expected to work under JSA rules and to travel an hour and a half to seek work. But a job that starts at 9 am and is an hour and a half away is not fine for a lone parent with two children whose school opens at 8.45 am. The JSA has financial sanctions for the 22 year-old; but apply those to the lone parent and you also sanction the child. You can pressure the 22 year-old into full-time work, but often all that the lone parent can manage is a patchwork of mini-jobs of, say, 12 hours a week. As her benefit is deducted pound for pound it may not be worth working, so either she will not work or she will not declare it. And yet those mini-jobs may be the best preparation for her to go into full-time work when her children are older. We make her fit the benefit regime of the 22 year-old instead of devising a benefit regime that fits the realities of her life, which requires a tapered approach to benefit rather than the male model of being in work or out of it.</p>

I am most grateful to her, and to other noble Lords, including the right reverend Prelate, for speaking at length today about the needs of children in care. As vice-chair of All-Party Group on Children and Young People in Care, perhaps I may advise the House that, on Wednesday 20 May, there will be a meeting of the group at which the Children&#146;s Legal Centre will discuss its advocacy for children and young people in care. I would be grateful for your Lordships&#146; support for that meeting. I declare my interest as a trustee of TACT, a not-for-profit foster agency, and the Michael Sieff Foundation, a child welfare organisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09051453000179"></a>I thank the Minister for the attention that she has increasingly been giving to the children's workforce, especially child and family social workers. I am grateful for the establishment of the social work taskforce and look forward very much to its recommendations this autumn. Moira Gibb, chief executive of Camden local authority, has been appointed to lead the taskforce and is highly regarded by all the professionals I have spoken to. As the vacancy rate for child and family social workers in London is 20 per cent we know that her work is vital. I also thank the Minister and her colleagues for the recent additional investment of &#163;58 million in child and family social work. However, given the concerns that we all continue to have about children's social care, I hope the Minister will continue to give thought to the need to ring-fence and increase the funding for these services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09051453000180"></a>I shall speak about access to mental health services for the carers of young people in care, for young people in care and for care leavers. On Tuesday I had  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1130"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1130</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the privilege of attending a discussion at which the Minister spoke. In the audience were a number of care leavers, foster carers, social workers and adoptive parents. Channel Four showed excerpts from its documentary &#147;Lost in Care&#148;&#151;which was referred to earlier in the debate&#151;in which care leavers spoke about having 15, 20 or 30 different placements while in care. That was not a representative sample. However, the trauma that children experience prior to entering care, which is sometimes compounded by trauma experienced while in the care system, gives rise to high rates of mental disorders within this group.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09051453000181"></a>In its 2002 survey, the Office for National Statistics put disorder rates as high as 45 per cent for children in foster care and 72 per cent for children in residential care. As they are children, they may recover quickly. However, if their needs are not met, these disorders may harden into adult personality disorders which can be very hard to treat. Often the best treatment for such childhood disorders is a warm and stable relationship with a caring adult, as the right reverend Prelate so elegantly said. It is therefore absolutely right that the Minister places such high value on stability and that the Government have set a target for placement stability. At the same meeting on Tuesday, Stuart Hannah, a child psychotherapist at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, drew attention to the important work of therapeutic children's homes such as the Mulberry Bush School. Key to the success of such facilities is ongoing consultation by a child psychotherapist or appropriately skilled clinical psychologist or psychiatrist with the staff group.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09051453000182"></a>Children who have been traumatised may often sabotage future relationships with adults and avoid intimacy and love at all costs because of the pain that it has given them in the past. Given these children&#146;s resistance to forming stable relationships with carers it is essential that residential child care workers should be supported in their task by the best mental health professionals in the field. It is deeply regrettable, given the level of need and the inexperience of those working in the front line, that all children's home staff do not enjoy ongoing support from these kinds of consultants.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09051453000183"></a>There needs to be appropriate high quality mental health provision throughout residential care. Consideration also needs to be given to providing such support to adoptive parents, child and family social workers, foster carers and GPs. The very best services already provide this. Kids Company, which was also referred to at our meeting on Tuesday, forges relationships of trust with our most neglected children. Staff do so while receiving regular support themselves from child psychotherapists. Such support was once a regular feature of child and family social work, as I think my noble friend Lady Howarth may be able to attest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09051453000184"></a>The final report of the national CAMHS review, <I>Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service</I>, published last December, recommended increased integration of CAMHS services with other services and a push to educate the childcare workforce in child development.

Will the Minister consider meeting the board&#151;perhaps with her colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Darzi&#151;and me to

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09051453000185"></a>Given that improvements in public care are still at an early stage, what assessments and access to services are offered to care leavers who may have mental health issues arising from abuse prior to care or from instability in the care system? Is there an infrastructure of support for self-help groups for care leavers, perhaps facilitated by a mental health professional, so that care leavers can resolve earlier trauma? Is individual therapy for care leavers made available and promoted? I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

I am delighted to offer mine in the midst of expertise of a rare order, and I stand as a general practitioner in the midst of consultants. As a church minister, my daily work is to visit families in their homes, to climb the stairs of those inner-city dwellings and to sit and eat humble fare sometimes with such families. I allow my mind to see the two little children in this small one or two-bedroomed accommodation when they have grown up and their home will be bursting at the seams. I sometimes hear that a pregnancy will make it likely that there will be three children before very long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09051453000187"></a>I try to deal imaginatively with some of the problems that ensue. For example, I deal with inner-city schools which make provision for people who come from these sorts of homes. I am the minister of a flourishing church with more than 400 members. We have a large number of families from many ethnic groups. My only qualification for contributing to a debate like this is that I know and I visit those families. They matter to me and, through the way we organise our church, we try to offer safe space for children to have activities that enhance their well-being.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09051453000188"></a>I hope that it will not be thought to be a little tendentious or pedantic on my part to qualify the wording of the Motion before us. Although my awareness of child-centred government policy began with the Children Act 1989 and therefore goes well beyond the lifetime of this party&#146;s Administration, I want to congratulate the Government on much that has happened. Rather than call attention to the policies on,</p>

<p><a name="09051453000488"></a>I shall consider making provision for such well-being or to offer a legislative framework to enhance the well-being of children. Governments of course cannot and do not do it. It is those of us who live in communities and respond at ground level to the opportunities that legislative frameworks and systems of care offer who have to turn the good thinking, the lofty thinking, and the idealism of Governments into practice.</p>

<p><a name="09051453000489"></a>I am full of admiration for the children and young people whom I see day by day and week by week. I see the noble Lord, Lord Stewartby, almost in his place. His family trust helps us to achieve real funding for an effort in the borough of Haringey&#151;it is worth dwelling on the fact that it is Haringey&#151;where children are encouraged to play, to develop cultural ways of behaviour, to learn about each other&#146;s cultures through drama, and to enact responses to the burning issues of the day on the street. A young man, a member of my church&#151;I have known him since he was 10 and he is 23 now&#151;is funded by that trust. He organises workshops that look, for example, at substance abuse, the carrying of knives, gang activities on the streets, and so on. It is a brilliant piece of work.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09051453000189"></a>Another young man&#151;a big boy&#151;was passing by when a gang with baseball bats and knives were about to leave yet another victim on our streets. He simply went in and knocked a few heads together and knocked a few people out of the way, and they ran like scared rabbits. He will be presented, in church, at a suitable time, with one of the top awards that our Boys&#146; Brigade unit has to offer. He is about to undertake his A-levels.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09051453000190"></a>There is another young man, completing his degree&#151;he was 21 last Sunday&#151;who is the only male teacher in our Sunday school. Incidentally, I notice that there are six male participants in a debating list of 23 today, and that those organising this debate have bunched them together for solidarity, which I find very encouraging. So thank you very much.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09051453000191"></a>My admiration is unbounded for children and young people, and for families who courageously try to bring up their children with dignity, often in difficult and constraining circumstances, turning them out so well and wanting them to become responsible citizens. Because they arrived here from other places, these families often do not have many of the benefits they aspire to for their children. It really is imaginative and brilliant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09051453000192"></a>We were represented by one of my colleagues earlier this week at a faith forum in the borough of Islington. Members of faith communities advised social workers, doctors, nurses, those concerned with housing policy and its implementation, and people from the voluntary sector and the police, about how those who have faith&#151;or how the values that come from faith&#151;impact on some of the social problems that present. To have an opportunity for the voluntary sector and the sector of faith to have practical interaction with the providers of the services which legislation in this area makes possible seems to me to be very positive indeed.</p>

That report, to my mind, is the fruit of assiduous and thoughtful study. The Government have accepted all 58 recommendations and have set in train very many relevant and splendid initiatives.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09051453000195"></a>I want to make three general points. First, the inquiry of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, splendid though it is, has been on a rather narrow basis: that was the basis on which he was invited to report. He was asked to consider the systems in existence for the protection of children and to ask whether those systems were now operating as they should, and what the difficulties were. To my mind, there is justification&#151;and this will have to be attended to sooner rather than later&#151;for looking into whether the systems now in existence are relevant to the needs of the 21st century. I hope that the Government can give some assurance that that is a matter very much in the forefront of their mind.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09051453000196"></a>Secondly, tragic, ironic and shocking as was the case of Baby Peter, there was nothing unique nor, I am sorry to say, outstanding in the loss of that child&#146;s life. The statistics do not always tally, but taking a conservative view, one would come to the conclusion that about 100 children lose their lives every year, possibly as many as 150. In other words, two or three young children a week die of neglect or abuse.</p>

<a name="90514-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09051453000197"></a>My third point is closely tied up with the question of at-risk registers. The registers, on which there are the names of thousands of children in England and Wales, form some sort of a potential statutory shield of protection for those children. But it is a sad fact that 80 per cent of children who are killed or who die of neglect do not have their names on a register. How can we improve that situation?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09051453000198"></a>Care orders have been mentioned. I agree completely with everything said so eloquently by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. It is inevitable that there will now be what the chief executive of CAFCASS has described as a bulge in applications for care orders. In October of last year, the number of applications in England was 496, whereas in March of this year, that figure had risen to 733 and is bound to rise further.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09051453000199"></a>The point I wish to make&#151;and I do this, in common with all noble Lords, with the utmost regard for social workers and those who administer the care system&#151;is that there is an institutional failure here. It is failure in the sense that it has not been possible to bridge and narrow that gap between children in care and those not in care. That gap, if anything, is getting wider. The dismal statistics are known to all Members of this House&#151;how in every league of achievement they fail, and how, in every statistic of underachievement and dismality, they are overrepresented.</p>

A very high percentage of

They are educationally subnormal in almost all those cases. One can quote statistic after statistic suggesting that the situation is almost inevitable, but it is not. In Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands and Germany, the gap is being narrowed substantially, and we can do the same.

I thank and salute her for all her work as chair of the Children&#146;s Group and the NTA. My remarks concern the effects of addiction on families, in particular on children living in households where the parents take drugs and drink alcohol. I should like also to register my interest in that I am remunerated by and work with a national charity concerned with families. I have worked with vulnerable children and on child protection issues for much of my professional life, especially with children caught up in the midst of domestic violence, often directly as a result of parental substance and/or alcohol misuse. More recently, I have had the privilege of working with those who provide treatment and support to individuals and families trying to recover from their substance and alcohol addiction, and it is the lessons I have learnt from that experience that I should like to share.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09051453000203"></a>As has been recognised, there has been a dramatic increase in the variety of services available since the 2005 <I>Hidden Harm</I> report and the Government&#146;s subsequent report published in 2008 entitled <I>Drug Strategy</I>. It is recognised that the family needs to be at the heart of good practice. At least 1.3 million children in the UK are growing up in families where their mum, dad or both have chronic drug and alcohol problems. Concerns remain about the resources being directed at support for families beyond drug and alcohol misusers, even when there is the possibility of children being taken into care.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09051453000204"></a>In coming to the debate, I have spoken to a number of workers on the ground. They say that it is a simple but ignored truism that drugs have a big impact on families. The person who develops a problem with drugs or alcohol is also someone&#146;s son, daughter, brother or sister. It is also a fact that families dealing with substance misuse often live in an atmosphere of secrecy where children tend to bear much of the burden. Workers say that evidence suggests that angry, irritated, scared and bewildered children are shut out of rooms and often told to go away while unexplained  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1135"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>activities take place. Imagine a six year-old accidentally stumbling across syringes on top of the fridge or microwave as an ordinary occurrence. They say that children are reluctant to raise the subject of substance use for fear of causing more aggravation or tragedy in their already volatile environment either with other family members or in school, resulting in their further isolation. They also say that many children become carers responsible for their parents and siblings.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09051453000205"></a>That 1.3 million children are frequently denied regular education and the opportunity to take part in mundane childhood activities, that their good days and bad days are determined by how their parents behave under the effects of drug taking or drinking alcohol, means that many of these children feel different. Having been exposed to conversations about drugs, they feel guilty, worthless and often ignored by the actions of their parents. They often experience bullying both at home and at school. Research shows that children know far earlier and in more detail about drugs than their parents believe, and that some people are likely to engage in sexual activity earlier where there is inadequate parental involvement or support.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09051453000206"></a>These descriptions do not come from novels, they are the harsh reality of children&#146;s words. What is shocking is that they come from the experiences described by children once they become engaged with services. Tackling these problems is not the work of a magic wand. The parents and children I am referring to have complex, long-standing problems that need intensive intervention from a wide range of services. I agree with my noble friend Lady Massey that despite significant local and national initiatives, there remains a vast inconsistency between services for children caught up in these families. A family culture of denial and secrecy has major consequences for whether children seek services.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09051453000207"></a>All too often, the drug user&#146;s problem is seen as the cause of difficulties rather than as a symptom of a range of problems, each of which needs to be addressed before a parent can become capable of taking care of their children. Indeed, the frequent chaos of family life, coupled with the long-term nature of drug use and an atmosphere of denial, can mean that the work to stabilise one family may take a year or more. Yet despite these pressures, we know that less than 1 per cent of the drug treatment budget is currently spent on family support. Needless to say, the reality is that where family work is funded and available, many children need not be burdened with caring responsibilities and indeed may feel able to take advantage of support from a range of services, including from teachers and other welfare agencies. Work by leading organisations in the field shows that change is possible if there is a strong family focus when working with drug and alcohol misusers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09051453000208"></a>As a result of my current professional involvement in this work, I am aware of independent ongoing research that is looking at the impact of the work being done with over 300 families.

They are also more

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09051453000209"></a>It is true that drugs and alcohol are life choices for adults, but 1.3 million children have not chosen these parents.

<a name="09051453000210"></a><b><a name="90514-0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051453000674"></a>Baroness Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, I add my thanks to the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, securing this debate and, as other noble Lords have said, for the many valuable things she does for children. At a time when the economic situation is grim and the Government have had to drop their target for the elimination of child poverty by 2020, it makes every kind of sense to address the best way those of us speaking think the Government can achieve their many valuable plans for the well-being of children and families. I hope to concentrate my remarks on two areas where I believe that the Government could give an even higher priority.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09051453000211"></a>First is the need for more effort and resources for the early&#151;and I do mean early&#151;prevention of family breakdown. Secondly, if that fails and offending has meant imprisonment, far greater concentration needs to be placed on returning the offender, especially a young offender, to their community with maximum support plans in place to prevent any reoffending. In both these situations, it is for the local authority, indeed for the whole local community, to support these plans, their reward being that if the horrendous financial cost of keeping a child in care followed by a lifetime in prison is averted in even, say, 10 per cent of cases, substantial sums of money can be saved. But of greater importance is that if a family&#146;s &#147;cycle of deprivation&#148; has genuinely been broken, the result is that the individual&#146;s life and talents will benefit not just their own family, but also the whole community in which the family subsequently settles. If that happens, the five outcomes that children and young people themselves have identified as necessary for well-being in childhood and later life will have been achieved.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09051453000212"></a>First, early support and prevention with a known deprived or disadvantaged family. Once a pregnancy is known, planned support should begin. If a family is not already known to the authorities, then the statutory health visitor or midwife visiting after a child&#146;s birth may well be the first point of contact able to alert other authorities.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09051453000213"></a>I need hardly say, and others have mentioned, that social workers are an even more important community resource, but they are in dire straits. We all know the appalling history of Baby P, but we should acknowledge that social workers have taken the blame for much that is the shared responsibility of others, not least primary health trusts. It will take time before government plans  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1137"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for upgrading their pay status and training turn social work, once again, into a natural choice for graduates leaving university. A better approach to the problem, and resources to deal with it, must begin now. Equally, there are nothing like enough foster carers available when children need to be taken into care. Their training and involvement in an individual child&#146;s plan need upgrading.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09051453000214"></a>In today&#146;s world, there are other aspects that warrant extra attention if support and prevention of family breakdown are to be effective. One example is for more employers to offer flexible working for both sexes, which will enable parents, and I mean men as well as women, to work and share the practical side of bringing up the next generation to be well adjusted, responsible citizens. The Equality and Human Rights Commission has just published a report on this, entitled <I>Working Better</I>. Their research makes clear that men increasingly want these facilities as much as their partners do.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09051453000215"></a>Many other examples spring to mind about how to help today&#146;s families to combine the important roles of workers and parents, but time is limited and I want to turn to my second priority, which is where prevention has failed and imprisonment begins. The Corston report points to the immense danger done to families if a mother is imprisoned. With male overcrowding, women prisoners are housed well beyond the recommended 50 miles from their homes. Worse, with the family break-up and with all the children taken into care, the inevitable cycle of deprivation begins again.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09051453000216"></a>A limited form of Corston is under way, but it is essential that, except for really violent and dangerous offenders, all women should be helped, and treated for their drink, drug and often severe mental health problems, as the recent Bradley report recommended, within their local communities, while the local authority and third sector continue to support other measures necessary for the rehabilitation of the whole family.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09051453000217"></a>For those whom we have failed already, and who are now in prison, the Government&#146;s original end-to-end offender management may still have some potential if the plans are realistic. The Government&#146;s latest Education and Skills Act has, thankfully, placed responsibility for providing education for young offenders, up to the age of 18, firmly on the shoulders of the local education authority. No longer can the individual prison governor pay prisoners more for working in the kitchen than for attending those vital education classes.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09051453000218"></a>Many of them also have totally inadequate skills and qualifications. Thankfully, the new plans for 14 to 18 year-olds include a reinvigorated apprenticeship strategy, which could well start to begin within the young offender institution. Like my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham, if I had one wish that could be granted, it would be to persuade this or any future Government to test all children, at the very start of their schooling, for signs of dyslexia or other learning problems. The earlier a plan to deal with this is worked out, the sooner it is likely to be successful.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09051453000219"></a>For the future, and particularly for the priority group of young offenders, it is also vital to return them to the community with three essential elements

These are an educational plan, a safe and stable place in which to live, and a probation officer or, at the very least, a mentor, probably from the third sector, to help with the process of settling in. I believe that we will see real and measurable success from everyone involved if these plans are put in place.</p>

I thank my noble friend Lady Massey and I assure the House that her domestic science skills have improved since she was at school. Her report card showed that, despite difficulties, this is a topic on which the Government have a good story to tell, and it would be a terrible catastrophe for families, and in particular for children, if all the good work that has been achieved in the past decade were to be compromised in the next few years, blighting the life chances of a generation, as happened a generation ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09051453000222"></a>I will concentrate my remarks on the role of arts and culture on the well-being of children, and I will refer to two organisations with which I am connected: the Roundhouse in north London, and Artis, which is a small but perfectly formed business that recruits and trains performing artists to deliver specially developed programmes linked to the national curriculum and to the <I>Every Child Matters</I> agenda in primary schools and, more recently, in secondary schools.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09051453000223"></a>I am afraid that what I say will overlap significantly with the eloquent words of the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, and the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. I hope the House will forgive me. The noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, referred to the review of the primary curriculum by Sir Jim Rose, in which he referred to the necessity of emphasising the importance of speaking and listening. The review talks about the possibility of needing formal lessons in spoken English. Command of language is one of the most powerful tools we have. It can be used for good or, of course, for ill, but without it we are denied access to our imaginations, and to the expression of our most complex emotions. A child impoverished in this way will remain at a disadvantage throughout life.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09051453000224"></a>There are few more effective ways of developing language skills than through engagement with the arts, and I refer to a report that was published last month by the Culture and Learning Consortium, which is made up of a number of arts and cultural bodies. The report, <I>Get It</I><I>: The Power of Cultural </I><I>Learning</I>, is a compilation of feedback and recommendations from a wide public consultation among practitioners working in the cultural and learning sectors in England, directed toward a new approach to cultural learning. The report has an excellent set of recommendations focused on improving outcomes for children and young people. I was going to share with noble Lords some of the  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1139"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1139</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>marvellous quotations that are peppered throughout it, but as I am a bit afraid of the Whips, I will not do so. However, two jumped out at me. The first is from Sir Alan Ayckbourn, a great playwright, who said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="09051453000512"></a>&#147;When you are young, the arts afford you a glimpse of the world through the senses of others, while helping you to make sense of yourself&#148;.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09051453000225"></a>The second is almost my favourite. It is from Doreen, aged nine, and is a tribute to my noble friend Lady Massey. After a school visit to the Unicorn Theatre for Children she said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="09051453000513"></a>&#147;I am telling you, theatre is better than TV&#148;.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09051453000226"></a>Amen to that, say I, though of course I am biased, but I believe nothing beats participating in a live experience. The Government, to their enormous credit, are piloting the Find Your Talent initiative, which aims to ensure that all children and young people, no matter where they live or what their background, have the chance to participate in at least five hours per week of high quality culture, in and out of school. The key phrases are &#147;participate&#148; and &#147;high quality&#148;. To be candid, this is a very ambitious plan, but it is really important that the current economic situation does not result in such ambition being stifled. I hope that my noble friend, when she comes to reply, will be able to reinforce the Government&#146;s commitment to maintaining this initiative.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09051453000227"></a>The two organisations that I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, Roundhouse and Artis, are both contributing significantly in different ways to using arts and culture to develop skills and confidence in children and young people. Again, I would give examples of this but I am not going to because I want to raise one other point. I will say only that the quiet work that Artis does, which reaches 25,000 children a week in primary schools, and the rather noisier and more ebullient work that Roundhouse does in engaging with the young people who have come thorough its pioneering studio programmes, which resulted in it creating, producing, managing and delivering an entire weekend&#146;s worth of work at the Roundhouse last weekend, are important indicators of what can be achieved. There are many more, too, but we have some way to go before the benefits of learning through cultural experience are fully embraced in our educational and social policies. I hope that we shall not lose ground on this issue in the years ahead.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09051453000228"></a>I want to talk about radio. I am a lifelong radio addict. I started with the pirates and Radio 1, but now I am in the arms of Radios 3 and 4. That may conform to a very comfortable middle-class stereotype that suggests that this is not really what children and young people today are interested in, but I do not think that is true. What the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, said about the potential power of radio is important, and we should take it seriously. Speech radio for children is a medium that engages imagination and reinforces the power of language, and it encourages listening skills, which are essential to the development of complex language skills. I ask the Government, when they publish their Digital Britain report, to recognise the contribution of high-quality speech radio for young people and make sure that they encourage the BBC to reinvest in it.</p>

With her agreement, I am going to speak for a few minutes not so much about the Government&#146;s programme but about the way in which we in this House as a group try to influence their programme. I want to see whether my thoughts have any resonance with your Lordships.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09051453000230"></a>Those of us who are speaking today and those who are not but wish that they were&#151;perhaps those who often speak about children&#151;comprise a voice for disadvantaged children in this House. In effect, we are an informal lobby group for children and together we have an enormous reservoir of expertise. My concern is that, in spite of all this, we as a group may not be as effective as we might be in achieving change. An equally informal disabled lobby often seems to be more powerful in its advocacy and more successful in achieving change. An example that is fresh in my mind is the Second Reading of the Welfare Reform Bill last week, when five or even six speakers talked about the problems that the Bill would create for the disabled, whereas only one, who happened to be me, talked about the potential disadvantages for children.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09051453000231"></a>There are two principal ways in which we in this House bring our influence to bear on the Government: one is to chivvy them and the other is to amend their Bills. There is plenty of work to do on the chivvying front, of course; lots of things need to be addressed, such as shortages of staff in children&#146;s social services, the problems of looked-after children, children in prison and so on&#151;many things that noble Lords have mentioned today. But I shall concentrate on the revision of Bills.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09051453000232"></a>Among the members of the children&#146;s lobby there is no lack of dedication or knowledge. The problem is not a lack of dedication or enthusiasm but, in my view, a lack of organisation, co-ordination and support. The current position on support in this House is roughly as follows. We have an admirable research facility in the Library, but there are limits to what we can ask it to do. Sometimes it does the right thing but does not tell anyone; as we walked into the Chamber today, my noble friend Lady Howe told me that it had done a Library note on this debate. It would have been nice to have known a little sooner.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09051453000233"></a>Then there are the children&#146;s charities. They send some of us briefings, but most of those are focused on the particular interests that the charity has at that time, rather than on the broader implications of the Bill for children. Then, of course, there are the political parties. The parties have their own priorities, which often include the best interests of children, but I suggest that, although there is overlap, we should not have to rely on the Front Benches to lead us on children&#146;s issues.</p>

<a name="90514-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09051453000234"></a>There was a time when the National Children&#146;s Bureau was funded to undertake a series of child impact statements on all Bills. Its report was an elaborate legal statement; it was too expensive to produce, took too long to read and often came too late. Anyhow, that service funding has come to an end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09051453000235"></a>We need a part-time co-ordinator for the children&#146;s lobby whose job would be to scrutinise all likely Bills well in advance for their potential impact on children; to summarise the issues and circulate a note of no more than two pages to Members; to identify Members who were interested and who were able to be involved; to co-ordinate their inputs&#151;whether they were going to speak at Second Reading or in Committee or just vote, or do the lot; and, when necessary, to help with research. If any noble Lord agrees that such a service would be valuable and that these thoughts are worth pursuing, would they please contact the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, or me? If there is sufficient enthusiasm, we will try to pursue the idea.</p>

I also thank the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, for mentioning that the business of working, as well as the business of raising children, is affected by gender, and that the way in which policies are introduced often does not take into account the gender nature of work.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09051453000238"></a>I shall refer to my own experience. When I had my first child, it coincided with the time when nurseries were closed, parental leave was curtailed and so on, and I ended up having to pay for the care of my child while I was in full-time employment. After paying for domestic help&#151;I must admit that I had no training in domesticity, so I would have been very bad at it&#151;and all the childcare provision, as a full-time lecturer at a university I earned &#163;5 a week. It shows the triumph of hope over experience that I had a second child and continued working, but then we all suffer from various kinds of madness.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09051453000239"></a>I was enormously grateful to this Government for recognising the importance of childcare and for introducing measures to help with it. However, I was saddened to see that, when my daughter had her first child, she decided to give up working as the head of a faculty to go part-time in a primary school because she found out that to carry on would cost her more than she would earn. Her view was: why should she work so hard in order for someone else to enjoy her children? She decided to go part-time not least because she discovered that, because she had taken maternity leave for one year, her income was reduced every month. Had she as a teacher chosen to take leave for a year because of stress, she would have been paid full-time. Motherhood does not seem to be recognised, valued or rewarded; it is certainly not remunerated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09051453000240"></a>Recent research at the University of York&#146;s mother and babies unit says that middle-class women can afford at most the costs of childcare for one child and that childcare for two children becomes unaffordable. If professional women in full-time employment cannot afford good childcare, what happens to working-class women who have very few options?</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09051453000241"></a>I am worried about the proposed link between welfare and work. What kind of work, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, asked, can these mothers do  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1142"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when they are constrained by school hours? That is particularly a problem given that there is nothing so deskilling as motherhood; when you have been out of the workplace, you cannot get any work. Women who try to do flexible, part-time work experience difficulties. I have had quite a few e-mails from nurses whom I know telling me that it is all very well for us in the House of Lords to talk about the glass ceiling; they talk about the bedpan ceiling. If you happen to want to combine part-time, flexible work with childcare, you stay at the bottom rank. There is no movement anywhere for such mothers.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09051453000242"></a>Good children are raised in good families where there is support but also a bit of money. Of course, low incomes do not necessarily mean a poor childhood, but they have a connection. I ask the Minister whether it would be possible to give women on benefit, who stay at home, the funds that would otherwise be  spent on supporting their children. This would also valorise the work that women do. If this is not an alternative, we need to go much further down the route of providing good, high-quality childcare locally. I applaud the support that is offered by grandparents and by family, but there is a worry that that kind of support is not open to any kind of analysis or evaluation. Many grandparents are wonderful, but there is no  way of weeding out those who are not or who do not have the expertise. We need to work on those fronts and I wonder whether any of these ideas will go any further.</p>

This country&#146;s success in the world will depend on the quality of our people and we must invest in that. Therefore, anything that prevents our children from fulfilling their potential and leading happy, successful lives must be eradicated. Unfortunately, recent sad cases have demonstrated that we have not yet got it right for children. We are still not putting enough resources into their safeguarding, their mental and physical health or their education. That must change. These are cost-effective measures, as the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, emphasised. I accept that this Government have done more for children than any Government, but the numbers of needy children are rising and the complexity of the pressures on their lives is growing. None the less, many of the Government&#146;s policies are moving in the right direction. I particularly support the five principles and six objectives of the <I>Children</I><I>&#146;</I><I>s Plan</I>.</p>

The first of those is child poverty, as mentioned by the right revered Prelate the Bishop of Leicester. The Government made an ambitious commitment in 1999 to halve child poverty by 2010 and to eradicate it by 2020. Although progress has been made, I know that the Government are disappointed that they did not  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1143"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>meet their interim target of a 25 per cent cut by 2005. I suppose that that is not entirely surprising, since the ways and means of achieving it are very long term.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09051453000246"></a>Paying parents large amounts of benefit is neither affordable in the short term nor sustainable in the long term and, therefore, it is quite unrealistic. They say that it is far better to give a poor farmer a tractor and some seed than to give him a bag of grain to feed his family. On the other hand, if you do not give him a bag of grain as well as a tractor, his family will die of starvation before the crop can be harvested. I think that your Lordships will follow what I am saying, which is that the Government must address short-term poverty while at the same time putting into place those measures that will enable families to support their own children adequately in future.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09051453000247"></a>This is where we come, as the noble Baroness, Lady Garden of Frognal, mentioned, to the education of the parents, in particular the mother. In developing countries, funders know that the best way to help children is to educate their mothers so that they can bring up their children well. Even in this highly developed country, we know that a woman with a good education is more likely to have fewer children and a stable family structure and be able to get a job to help to support them. She is less likely to make poor health choices that will harm her children, such as smoking or drug and alcohol abuse, as the noble Baroness, Lady Uddin, mentioned, all of which can destroy children&#146;s lives as well as those of their parents. She is more likely to appreciate the importance of education and to do everything that she can to support her children&#146;s learning. In the mean time, her education will help her to feed them well without great expense, understand their health and social needs and learn from those who have found effective and positive ways of parenting without resorting to violence.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09051453000248"></a>So why has it taken the Government 10 years to agree to make personal, social, health and economic education a statutory part of the curriculum? Of course I welcome that, but they have wasted 10 years since Tony Blair made that commitment, without realising that such education would be one of the levers that would help the Government to achieve their child poverty target. Will the Minister tell us how the Government are getting on with the implementation of the new policy and with the training of the teachers and say whether parenting skills will be included in the curriculum?</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09051453000249"></a>Secondly, I should like to mention the importance of continuity for children, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, referred. Most families, rich and poor, are loving and caring, and the best continuity for the child is to leave it with its family. However, some families, as we have recently had brought home to us most sadly, are downright dangerous for the child. For those families, very difficult judgments have to be made by social workers, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said, as to whether the child&#146;s best interests are served by staying with the family, with support, or going into care.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09051453000250"></a>A couple of years ago, the cost to a local authority of taking care proceedings rocketed and the number of cases brought to the courts fell substantially. If that  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1144"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was because more families were being supported and it was safe to leave the children at home, that would have been a good thing. However, the fact that there has been a doubling in the number of cases since Baby Peter died suggests that that was not the reason. The implication is that many vulnerable children have been left in danger. I do not underestimate the cost and difficulty of taking these children into care. Many of them have been very damaged and need foster carers with very special skills and support. Sadly, most foster carers do not get either the training or the support that they need to do and carry on doing this very difficult job.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09051453000251"></a>Thirdly, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, has made the case brilliantly about the family courts. I agree with her wholeheartedly; it is a matter of the rights of children to be properly and independently represented and supported in court proceedings. However, the current proposals will discriminate against women and BME practitioners, just as the law was becoming more diverse. I think that that is very sad.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09051453000252"></a>Fourthly, I will say a word about speech and language difficulties. The noble Baronesses, Lady Warnock and Lady McIntosh, and the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, spoke most effectively about the benefits of helping children with these problems, especially, in the case of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, about those in young offender institutions, where there are rather a lot of them. It is vital&#151;and cost-effective&#151;that the service in custodial settings should be properly funded. However, prevention is better than cure. If more resources were put into communication problems in the early and primary years, that would probably avoid many of these young people getting into trouble in the first place and save us all a good deal of grief and money. Will the Minister say how the Government are getting on with the job of implementing the Bercow report?</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09051453000253"></a>Last week, the Government told all primary schools to place more importance on speaking and listening skills, following Sir Jim Rose&#146;s review of the primary curriculum. I have read about I CAN&#146;s primary talk project pilot in schools in Somerset, Bradford and Walsall, which accredits schools for creating &#147;communication-rich environments&#148;. Heads say that it is making a real difference, but the chief executive of I CAN said that she was frustrated over delays in implementing the Government&#146;s speech and language strategy. Can the Minister say what is being done to support such projects and implement the strategy?</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09051453000254"></a>Does the Minister also share with me and others a regret that the BBC has found it desirable to cut its budget for children&#146;s radio programmes such as &#147;Go4It&#148;, which is to be axed next week? I must declare an interest as a BBC pensioner. One of my earliest, happiest memories was of sitting in front of the fire with my mother after lunch and listening for that most familiar tune, which your Lordships of a certain age will recognise as the signature tune for &#147;Listen with Mother&#148;. If we are to give children every opportunity to improve their oracy, which must always come before literacy, surely children&#146;s radio must play its part. Last year the BBC spent &#163;460 million on radio, but only &#163;1.6 million went on young listeners. The numbers listening to children&#146;s programmes may not be large  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1145"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but they will be hooked on radio for ever and become dedicated radio-listening adults, so they deserve their space in the schedules. It is patronising to children to suggest that all they want is TV soaps and pop music. They do not. Just because fewer children choose to eat fruit and vegetables, we do not remove them from the menu in school canteens. Children&#146;s radio has an important place in our efforts to ensure that the next generation grows up able to communicate verbally as fluently as possible. I hope that something can be done to stop the rot.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09051453000255"></a>Finally, I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to child trafficking and the report published today by the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, which asks for more investment in police teams to track down victims and bring traffickers to justice. It says that immigration judges and border officials need to be better educated to recognise trafficking and that there needs to be more safe accommodation and psychological support for victims. The committee concludes that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="09051453000514"></a>&#147;In effect, traffickers may be using the care home system for vulnerable children as holding pens for their victims until they are ready to pick them up&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051453000490"></a>This must end. UNICEF, in which I declare an interest as a trustee, has for a very long time urged the Government to open their eyes to this abuse. I hope that this report will ensure that the Government do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09051453000257"></a>I have visited many schools, children&#146;s centres and local community groups, which has enabled me to meet remarkable parents, children and young people&#151;parents seeking to do the best for their children and children wanting to achieve their aspirations, excel and make the most of their lives. One of my most recent visits was to Shadwell children&#146;s centre in Tower Hamlets. Meena Hoque and her team work against a very challenging backdrop and need to be congratulated. Yet, sadly, for many families, while there is a desire to achieve aspirations, unfortunately, personal circumstances greatly reduce opportunity and choice. For some there are no children&#146;s centres or community groups.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09051453000258"></a>Many families have become institutionalised to state dependency, worklessness and poor or zero educational attainment. Children born in these circumstances face such enormous challenges that they often resign themselves to failure and the cycle continues. I join wholeheartedly with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester in arguing that the Government should look closely at inner cities, where problems are aggravated by language difficulties and lack of cultural knowledge.</p>

<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1146"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rates 24th out of 29 developed countries in the University of York&#146;s measurement of child well-being, produced in April 2009. My noble friend Lady Morris of Bolton referred to that report. Sadly, we are still failing our children. The Child Poverty Action Group found that countries with a higher GDP tend to have more children reporting high-quality life satisfaction. Britain is one of the exceptions to this rule. Despite a high national GDP, our children report a low level of life satisfaction. France, with a similar GDP, ranks nine places higher. Research into well-being shows us that as economic pressures increase well-being decreases. With Britain&#146;s poor track record of well-being, and the OECD predicting that unemployment in Britain will rise at a faster rate than in other G7 countries, it is crucial that the Government act robustly to slow down the added disadvantage facing struggling families.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09051453000260"></a>UNICEF defines well-being as being adequately clothed, housed, fed, supported, loved and protected and where families and children are not disadvantaged in that their circumstances do not prevent them participating fully in the world and opportunities around them. But well-being is not a list of qualities against which we can tick boxes; it is a matter with real long-term consequences for many people. My noble friend Lady Morris of Bolton passionately recorded the findings of the report. I agree with her that little has changed since it was published. Many children today cite themselves as unhappy, more children are showing signs of depression at an earlier age and the lack of participation in collective activities has brought isolation and created rising obesity.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09051453000261"></a>Through his excellent work with the Centre for Social Justice, my right honourable friend Iain Duncan Smith has shown us that society is becoming more and more broken, and that the state alone cannot hope to fix it without individuals being supported to take responsibility and play an active part in it. Time and time again we have been shown that children do better and are happier in stable family structures. They are more confident and are more likely to achieve better educational attainment. Therefore, it is vital that in supporting families we ensure that appropriate systems are in place to provide children with the outcomes that we all desire.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09051453000262"></a>Early year support is particularly important to parents and children. The Government plan to create a children&#146;s centre for every community by 2010. In 2007, the target for 2010 was 3,500 children&#146;s centres. Will the Minister say whether this target will be met? Will she also say how centres are being monitored to ensure that they are responding to the needs of the local community? Between 2003 and 2006, the proportion of privately-owned nurseries declined from 78 per cent to 65 per cent. The number of childminders has decreased by nearly 40 per cent since 1997. There has been a continued decline in childminders. Nursery closures arise as the Government have reduced funding to PVI nurseries. While maintained nurseries receive &#163;3,800 per pupil per year, the PVI sector receives just &#163;1,800 per pupil per year. Good quality early years provision is one of the most important steps in equipping families with the information and support they need to bring up their children and to give children the early opportunities to lead a happy and fulfilled childhood.  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1147"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is certain that if parents are to be encouraged into employment, affordable childcare places will have to be easier to access.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09051453000263"></a>I welcome the Government&#146;s play strategy launched in December 2008, which set out that the Government would invest &#163;235 million over 2008-09 to 2010-11 to develop play facilities for children of all ages. What progress has been made in developing the facilities? How many play facilities do the Government aim to develop by 2011? There are more children suffering on the well-being scale in Britain as British society is more unequal than ever before. This is visibly apparent in the education system. More than 3 million children have left primary school without the basics in maths, reading and writing since Labour came to power. Since 1998, the Government&#146;s expected level 4 in reading, writing and maths at key stage 2 has not been achieved by 3,114,000 children. Last year, almost 230,000 did not achieve this standard. Can the Minister say why she thinks that there has been so much prolonged failure? Will the Government reverse their wish for themed teaching and implement a primary curriculum that is rigorous and protects proper subject teaching.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09051453000264"></a>It is the most vulnerable who are worst affected by this unequal education system. Government figures released in April show that only one child in seven in care reached the Government&#146;s expected standard of educational achievement at the age of 16. The gap in educational achievement at GCSE between children in care and other children has risen again this year and has widened by more than a quarter since 2001. Will the Minister say what the Government are doing to improve the education of children in care? Will they take up the Conservative proposals to set up residential academies to help children in care to fulfil their potential?</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09051453000265"></a>Many of the hard-working and bright children I have met at under-performing schools and schools in deprived areas are working incredibly hard to achieve good marks in their GCSEs and A-levels. Teaching staff and head teachers dedicated to teaching their pupils still struggle against the cultures of poor outside experiences. If we wish to create equality, this is an area that needs real will and direction. Children need to have confidence to participate in activities that develop different skills.</p>

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09051453000266"></a>I turn briefly to the young people in, or on the edge of, care who are not getting the help they need. Part of this is due to high social worker vacancy rates and part due to excessive bureaucracy. According to figures from the Minister&#146;s own department, 34,000 new children were put on the child protection plan in 2008. Sadly, we tragically saw, with the case of baby Peter, how important it is that children do not get lost in a system mired in bureaucracy and poor training. The lessons of baby P must teach us that the Government must take an axe to social work red tape so that professionals can spend the bulk of their time with children in need, not tied to their desktops. Can the Minister say what the Government are doing to reduce bureaucracy and red tape in social care so that frontline staff are able to do face-to-face work? I put to the Government our suggestion that there should be in place a chief social worker. Will the Minister say whether there are discussions

<a name="90514-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09051453000267"></a>The 2009 Institute for Fiscal Studies report informs us that the Government would have to spend an additional &#163;4.2 billion to meet the 2010 targets for child poverty reduction. Currently, the Government are on course to miss the target by 600,000 children. Sadly, we in Great Britain have the highest rates in Western Europe of binge drinking, teenage pregnancy, drug abuse and sexually transmitted diseases among our young people. While we have increased in material wealth, we have increasingly become poorer in time and human contact. Children may have the latest hand-held gadget, plasma screen or designer wear, but the loss of family structures, extended families, neighbourhood activities and safe and secure streets constantly threaten the happiness and well-being of our children.</p>

My noble friends Lady Amos and Lord Griffiths of Burry Port brought to my mind a very important thing that we must all remember to do and that is to celebrate the success and the contribution of our young people in our society. They explained very eloquently the possibilities for communities to nurture and celebrate their young people. We should all do this and the Government should play their part in promoting this. I feel enormously encouraged by their words. I will make sure that when the department looks at plans to develop campaigns to change the perceptions of young people and to work with the children&#146;s commissioners and other stakeholders, it will take note of their words and the example, in particular, of Hackney.

The quality and contribution of children&#146;s radio is something that I would be very proud to celebrate. The Government very much support the principle of high-quality children&#146;s radio. We recognise the concern over provision. This has been raised by the independent regulator Ofcom and by the Government&#146;s own interim <I>Digital Britain</I> report, as my noble friend asked. The BBC has a duty, as part of its charter, to provide educational content for children. However, noble Lords are aware that it is up to the BBC to determine how this is provided.

A further &#163;40 million will support speaking and listening in  the early years; we have heard about the Every  Child a Talker programme today.

I reassure her that the Government have a very strong commitment to the provision of quality childcare, particularly for children in areas of deprivation. As of March 2009, there were more than 1.3 million registered childcare places, more than double the figure in 1997. In 1997 there was one registered childcare place for every eight children; now there is one for four children under the age of eight. Taking into account turnover, at August 2008, more than 664,000 new Ofsted registered places have been created since 1997.</p>

In particular, my noble friend Lady Massey, the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and, of course, the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, talked to us most forcefully and eloquently on this subject. We will have further debates on the Bill. Of course, custody for under-18s is a last resort for only the most serious and persistent offenders to prevent offending in the community and to protect the public. The Government have developed a range of non-custodial sentences to deal with young offenders, and we are working hard to reduce the size of the population of young people in custody. I want to put it on the record that we are committed to improving the safety and welfare of all children and young people in custody, and I hear very clearly the noble Lord&#146;s comments about the importance of accountability and responsibility. I look forward to working with him further on taking those thoughts forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09051453000276"></a>The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, spoke eloquently about the importance of getting family law right and about the changes to the legal aid system and its impact on children and families, and family lawyers. Child protection is the overriding priority and I am advised that our changes are about redirecting &#163;4.4 million to ensure that some 3,500 child protection cases will receive funding, that there are more than 3,000 family legal aid barristers and that we are confident that their services will not be significantly affected. But I heard loudly her caution&#151;I am very committed to working with family lawyers to make sure that we can make the system work in the best interests of children.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09051453000277"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, talked about the work going on in CAFCASS. I note very carefully her commitment to put children at the centre of its work and to work with both parents and fathers. However, I am watching very carefully the trends in the level of care proceedings cases and we will be working with all those in the system to see how, as the noble Lord, Lord Laming, recommended, we can reduce delays in the system and deliver the best possible outcomes for children who are potentially to be taken into care.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09051453000278"></a>Many noble Lords talked about looked-after children, including my noble friend Lady Massey, the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, and of course the noble Baroness, Lady Garden of Frognal. I absolutely agree that stability is one of the most fundamental issues and we need to ensure that looked-after children can experience stability in their care placements. We have, as the Select Committee recently pointed out, a very comprehensive Care Matters programme which is looking at every aspect of the care system to ensure that we can achieve the best possible outcomes for looked-after children. Yes, the outcomes for them are improving in terms of stability, educational outcomes and the number of young people who leave the care system going into jobs and suitable accommodation. However, this is far from anything like enough. Much more needs to be done, and we are committed to doing that.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09051453000279"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, talked about child trafficking. I will look at the report published today and we will take it extremely seriously. It is a very worrying issue and, like her, it concerns me deeply.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09051453000280"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, talked about the importance of mental health services. We are issuing revised statutory guidance on promoting the health and well-being of looked-after children. This talks about CAMHS and we will be involved in a consultation.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09051453000281"></a>My noble friend Lady Uddin spoke about the impact of drugs and alcohol on families and children. We are extremely committed to tackling this. The family intervention projects that we promote are being significantly invested in and are creating some significant results. We hope that they can be more widely implemented across our communities.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09051453000282"></a>However, my noble friend Lady Massey started this debate by talking about a report card. This is something that as a department we are very interested in looking at. When we talk about looking at the results from our  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1151"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>schools and education system, I am very interested in how a report card could be used in the education system to take account of well-being. I hope that we will be able to debate that in the future.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09051453000283"></a>As many people have asked: what do children think and have to say about their experiences? The department&#146;s TellUs3 survey involving 150,000 children in England is a very sharp instrument for understanding what children think. It found that 69 per cent of young people say that they feel happy about life&#151;sometimes we can have a glass that is half full. Some 90 per cent agreed that England is a good place to grow up in. Sadly, I am talking just about England, although I am sure that Wales and Scotland would reflect a similar experience. Despite all the changes that have occurred in society over recent decades, a recent poll conducted by the BBC suggests that three-quarters of British families are optimistic about the future; that is 24 per cent higher than when the same question was asked in 1964. It is worth bearing that context in mind when we debate support for the family, children and child well-being.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09051453000284"></a>This House is very well aware that the Children&#146;s Plan puts children and families at the centre of everything that the Government do. It is the first of its kind. The plan is underpinned by the general principles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The plan aims to give every child the best chance in life and to make this country the best in the world to grow up in. As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, the plan is underpinned by the widely acclaimed <I>Every Child Matters</I> outcomes. These are about children being healthy, safe, enjoying and achieving, making a positive contribution, and achieving economic well-being, which has featured strongly in this debate. Those outcomes provide us with a means of measuring our progress towards that objective. It is important to remember that these aims reinforce each other. As my noble friend Lady Massey pointed out, it is about how all this meshes into improving the real experience of children. A child who is healthy is likely to do better at school; a child who enjoys life is likely to go on to make a positive contribution to the lives of others.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09051453000285"></a>We do not achieve our aims unless we can create a new culture that puts the child or young person at the centre of the process&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said as regards CAFCASS&#151;and giving them more say about issues that affect them. Listening and responding to what they tell us is important. That in turn will require everyone providing services for children and families to work more collaboratively by sharing information and operating across professional boundaries. That is an essential theme of our approach. That is what we are aiming to empower the children&#146;s workforce to do through our 2020 children&#146;s workforce strategy, which is all about helping to create common language and a social work profession that is empowered, knows its role and contribution, and is not tied up in red tape, as the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, suggested. That is how we will deliver on the commitments to our communities that we made in the Children&#146;s Plan.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09051453000286"></a>That is the approach we are taking on children&#146;s health, for example. Earlier this year we published the first ever children&#146;s health strategy; <I>Healthy Lives,  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1152"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Brighter Futures</I>, setting out the high-quality health services children and their families have a right to expect from birth through to the age of 19. We commissioned a review of child and adolescent mental health services, and have accepted the majority of the review&#146;s recommendations. We are working on all of them, including individualised care packages for vulnerable children, which I know the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, is very concerned about. We have also made &#163;60 million available to fund a programme of targeted mental health services in schools. That is about taking a universal service and making the most of helping child and young people access special mental health services.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09051453000287"></a>We are also working across Government to tackle obesity, which my noble friend Lady Billingham talked about and is one of the most pressing health concerns affecting young people. Since the publication of the Government&#146;s &#163;372 million <I>Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives</I> strategy in January 2008, we have introduced tough food standards in primary schools, and we are extending them to secondary and special schools in the autumn. We have highlighted and tightened up regulations on broadcast advertising of foods high in fat, salt and sugar. But we cannot act on obesity simply by looking at what children eat. We also need to encourage them to be more active, so our action on obesity goes hand in hand with our action on play and sport. As we have already heard, the Children&#146;s Plan announced the biggest ever investment in outdoor active play by the Government: &#163;235 million over three years. I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, that we have achieved 500 new or refurbished play schemes. We are on target to achieve the plan&#146;s results. That will allow every local authority to develop or improve play areas in line with local needs.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09051453000288"></a>We have also improved opportunities for high-quality sport and PE within schools, with 90 per cent of five to 16 year-olds now doing two hours a week. I cannot comment on the daylight robbery that my noble friend Lady Billingham spoke about, but I agree that sport is key. I do not wish to stray out of my knowledge or expertise, but this debate will be continued in the House of Lords. As I have seen during my time here, it raises passions.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09051453000289"></a>Everyone here will be familiar with the circumstances that led to the commissioning of the recent report by the noble Lord, Lord Laming, on safeguarding procedures. We are all extremely mindful of the tragedy and the tragic death of Baby Peter. We have promised to act swiftly to implement his recommendations. As the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, said, it is essential that all 58 recommendations are acted on swiftly, and we are committed to doing that.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09051453000290"></a>One of the noble Lord&#146;s most significant conclusions was that childcare professionals and everyone else with a safeguarding role must work more closely together if children are to be protected; again, the theme of my noble friend Lady Massey comes out across a number of issues. The noble Lord, Lord Laming, recommended that we have in place robust policies on which to build. He looked carefully at the policy foundation of <I>Every Child Matters</I> and recommended that there is a consensus among professionals and all those involved in safeguarding that the <I>Every Child Matters</I> reforms set the right  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1153"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1153</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>direction. However, while there is excellent practice in many areas of the country, in others the picture is less good. We recognise that, which is why we have taken action.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09051453000291"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, suggested, I am particularly glad to restate the Government&#146;s commitment to reforming the social work profession. We agree that we must move further and faster in order to make arrangements in this country for protecting children and to make sure that they are the best in the world. It is perhaps in the area of economic well-being that the benefits of working across boundaries are most obvious. Money is not the cure for all ills, but families with inadequate financial resources are likely to find the normal challenges of raising children even harder. As my noble friend Lady Hollis said, as eloquently as ever, we have made a commitment to eradicating child poverty within a generation, a target that has not been dropped. I am proud that we can show real progress, but we have much more to do. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester made clear the challenges that we face.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09051453000292"></a>The Child Poverty Unit is leading this work across Whitehall, and between 1998-99 and 2007-8, 600,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty. The measures announced in the 2007 Budget will lift a further 500,000 more children out of poverty. We will be receiving in this House a child poverty Bill, which I hope will make the ending of child poverty a goal of future UK Governments.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09051453000293"></a>In the economic downturn, our priority is to support all families and to protect jobs. Significant additional support for lower income families has been announced over the past year, including lower VAT, and a further &#163;25 tax cut for basic rate taxpayers. Those are contributions. Tax credits benefit around 6 million families and 10 million children. We have brought forward increases to Child Benefit, which is important to support all families across the UK.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09051453000294"></a>In many ways you could argue children have never lived so well, but we must recognise that there is an enormous amount more to do. This has been an extremely important debate. I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Massey for introducing it and for setting out her themes and making an important opportunity for the Government to receive some gentle chivvying, some important lessons and some contributions. I look forward to working with all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate to make sure that we can make this the best country in the world for children to grow up in.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09051453000296"></a>There has been great emphasis on vulnerable children and examples of success as well as of shortcomings. We should not forget that not all children are from chaotic backgrounds. We need to be concerned for all children. Those who have special needs clearly need special interventions. We have a duty to make sure that those interventions are fast and effective. We should also celebrate the achievements of our young people. I am glad that there has been an emphasis on language development, on creativity, including sport, on personal relationships, on equality including gender equality, and the experience of children in custody and in care. As I said earlier, the connections between services, systems and integration is vital, as is vision and commitment at a local level, which was well described by my noble friend Lady Amos.</p>

As I am the chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Tourism and was previously the shadow Minister for both sport and tourism for five years, I continue to have a major interest in the topic under discussion.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09051453000299"></a>By now many people have felt the effects of the crunch, but I think that most people recognise that the situation has little to do with the management of the UK economy and that it is a global problem. However, the purpose of this debate is to lift some of the doom and gloom that lingers around us and instead highlight opportunities for growth in the tourism industry and its greater contribution to sustainable economic growth. As your Lordships know, tourism is no small industry. Last year it was worth &#163;86 billion and constituted 8.7 per cent of the UK&#146;s GDP&#151;three times more than, say, the agricultural sector. It really does touch the parts that other industries do not reach. Every constituency, local authority, and region benefits from our visitor economy. The tourism industry creates jobs at all skill and wage levels. It regenerates communities, both urban and rural, and cannot be outsourced or transferred overseas.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09051453000300"></a>In the 18th century we had vast agricultural, wool and linen industries. Now tourism is the only one that has grown. In the 20th century we had vast manufacturing industries, such as coal and steel. Now tourism is the only one not in decline and which has grown. In the  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1155"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1155</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>past few decades we have seen our call centres, IT and technological industries grow here and then be outsourced overseas, but tourism remains here and grows here. With such a great legacy, it is no surprise that the tourism industry directly supports 1.4 million jobs and indirectly supports 2.7 million jobs, which is 8.5 per cent of the country's workforce.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09051453000301"></a>That is not to say that tourism has been immune from the effects of the downturn. However, recent research by VisitBritain and Visit London shows that despite the gloom and doom, British residents still want to take a holiday, increasingly in the UK. After all, we have great attractions here: great heritage, history, theatre, sport and, increasingly, world-class restaurants. We have never been more affordable to our potential overseas visitors. It is pleasing to read some good news from some financial experts. Steve Johnson, deputy editor of the <I>Financial Times</I>, stated recently that the Budget will give a boost in the City at the expense of the rival markets of Luxembourg, Dublin and the Cayman Islands. Only last week, the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> offered 10 good reasons for being more cheerful. Also, at the beginning of the month, the <I>Financial Times</I> published a survey that suggested that consumer confidence and optimism was at its highest all year.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09051453000302"></a>I urge the Government to capitalise on those sentiments, because domestic tourism accounts for 78 per cent of total UK tourism expenditure. The relative position of sterling against the world currencies means that this country represents better value than it has for years. We are 20 per cent less expensive for Americans than at this time last year and 37 per cent less expensive for Chinese and Japanese visitors.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09051453000303"></a>Let us not forget tourism in other forms. The UK generates foreign earnings of about &#163;1.5 billion from 500,000 students who study in this country. More importantly, there is strong evidence that previous students often return to the UK with friends and family, as tourists or on business. Travel business to the UK constitutes 24.5 per cent, or &#163;9.1 billion of total overnight tourism expenditure. Many businesses have begun to promote eco-friendly practices through water conservation, energy-efficiency, water management, biodiversity and recycling campaigns. Major hotel companies have introduced low carbon initiatives, which the Carbon Trust has estimated will have reduced CO2 emissions by between 6 per cent and 19 per cent.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09051453000304"></a>Those statistics are in themselves impressive, but the tourism industry as a whole could be in much better shape. It could create more jobs. It could deliver more revenue to the Exchequer from our overseas visitors. It could equip young people with skills and careers and generate more civic pride in more of our cities, as we had in Liverpool last year. If only the Government were to give it the support, the political and financial investment, that it deserves, we would be in a better state.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09051453000305"></a>The British tourism framework review, launched in February, revealed that the Government could create real jobs in all parts of the country, increase revenues to the Exchequer and obtain the highest return on investment available. They could achieve all that in weeks, not months, by increasing investment immediately  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1156"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the marketing of this country overseas. It must be remembered that VisitBritain was voted the best tourism board in the world by its peers and a panel of leading travel writers. It has representatives in 36 countries around the world and has expanded in India, China, eastern Europe and south-east Asia.</p>

<a name="90514-0008.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09051453000306"></a>Past examples have shown that there is much to gain from government investment. A very good example comes from the campaign implemented by VisitBritain after the foot and mouth disease outbreak and the 9/11 attacks, which significantly decrease tourism in 2001. The campaign consisted of &#163;20 million from Treasury reserve funding, match-funded by the industry to create a &#163;40 million campaign in Europe and north America. Within a year, the campaign had generated  1 million additional visitors, who spent &#163;500 million on goods and services in the United Kingdom. Those visitors maintained the jobs of about 12,000 British workers and returned an estimated &#163;90 million straight to the Exchequer.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90514-0009.htm"/>


<a name="90514-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09051453000307"></a>The willingness of the Government to invest was reflected in January, when they held a tourism summit in Liverpool to mark the end of the city of culture festival. At that summit, the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and the Minister for Tourism acknowledged that the Government needed to support the sector more and asked for the industry to supply the Government with a list of priorities. Immediately, the industry responded to that request and submitted its priorities, which included tactical marketing campaigns, greater co-operation in public expenditure on tourism, financial sensitivity to seasonal tourism, and the resolution of regulatory issues such as visa fees and air passenger duty. I urge the Government to review each of those recommendations without more ado.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09051453000308"></a>I end with a historical perspective. Forty years ago, a Labour Minister, the former Secretary of State, Anthony Crosland, recognised the importance of the tourism industry and its contribution to all parts of the economy, with the introduction of the Development of Tourism Act, which, incidentally, is the only tourism Act on the statute book to date. It brought into being the national tourism boards of the United Kingdom and established the framework under which tourism has grown. In the debate on tourism on 22 January in this House, no credit was given to Anthony Crosland for introducing the Act, and I am very pleased to put the record straight today. Forty years on, we have another opportunity to invest for success and growth, which will benefit all parts of our local, regional and national economies.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09051453000309"></a>We must seize this opportunity to support one of our most dynamic, sustainable and home-grown industries. Tourism must be taken more seriously by Governments. Admittedly, it is a difficult industry to represent itself, because it is so diverse, but it will need a strong Secretary of State to bang the Cabinet table on its behalf.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09051453000311"></a>I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Pendry, for introducing the debate because, sadly, I was unable to take part in the debate in January introduced by the noble Earl, Lord Glasgow, who will speak shortly. It was interesting that that debate concentrated on the lack of interest by government in tourism; that was highlighted quite strongly. Yesterday, we were discussing carbon emissions as part of the Climate Change Act orders. It occurred to me that when visitors come to Britain they need to come either by plane, by ferry or by train and that we are a long, thin island that requires a lot of travelling. It occurred to me that the Government were seeking to meet the targets on carbon emissions by reducing the funding for tourism, so that people would not come. Can the Minister confirm whether that is a hidden government policy?</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09051453000312"></a>This country has lost its traditional economic and industrial strengths. Even the one shining post-industrial light, financial services, has faded. The Government are now driving the wealth generators away from our shores, so increasingly, people will grasp at tourism as the new saviour. Sadly, the mentality generally matches that grasping: pack them in, stack them high and sell the brand quick. That may be right in some areas, but all the surveys that we have carried out in the north of Scotland show that people want exactly the opposite: quality, not quantity. Most of them go there because they cannot find what they want elsewhere.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09051453000313"></a>When discussing tourism in the UK, it is too simplistic&#151;but tempting&#151;to focus only on the main cities and prime destinations. To produce a solution for them and think that solves the problem for the whole of the UK is a road to ruin. Tourism is a multifaceted business that is international, national and regional. It encompasses large, medium and small-sized businesses, which, although often run by volunteers, form an important and too often neglected part of the mosaic, as they do not have a strong, united voice. It also covers hotels, bed and breakfasts and restaurants as well as visitor destinations. It is, as the noble Lord, Lord Pendry, has just said, very diverse.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09051453000314"></a>There need to be a number of solutions. To make them the success that they should be necessitates strong links and a common sense of direction between central government, local government, development agencies, statutory agencies and the private sector. Those links need to be flexible to accommodate the different requirements of the various sectors and allow the niche markets to play their full part. Regrettably, those links have become too fragmented. Consequently, the agencies have become much too rigid and inflexible and this is causing huge damage to the industry.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09051453000315"></a>Even though the average length of stay and spend per night by visitors is less in Scotland than in England, tourism is still hugely important, especially in the Highlands, where 14 per cent of all employment is tourist-related, compared with the Scottish average of 9 per cent. Thus, the further north one goes, the greater is the dependence on tourism, but the shorter is the tourist season. It is even more necessary to maximise the opportunities that we have. Due to the distinctive built heritage, culture, history, food and drink, each area is different and thus should be encouraged to create its own niche market, to which people would travel and pay to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09051453000316"></a>Let me take Caithness as an example. A recent survey showed that most people came for its iconic landscape and scenery. Furthermore, 33 per cent of our visitors said they had visited archaeological sites, compared with 17 per cent for the Highlands as a whole. In the past six years, the economy of the area has benefited from more than &#163;2 million, due to the archaeological work that has been carried out by the private sector.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09051453000317"></a>We have proved to the Highland Council that there is a good economic return from the preservation and proper presentation of our old stones. Indeed, there is still a huge potential to improve facilities so as to maximise the enjoyment of the visitor as well as to improve that economic return. However, it cannot be done by the private sector alone. Other agencies and the local authority must play their part. In particular, the local authority must remember that the many visitors who come to see the archaeological monuments in their natural setting will not come to see them if they are beside a wind farm or next to a modern kit-built house.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09051453000318"></a>Central government holds the key to a successful industry and needs to show its full commitment to improving tourism. Planning is one of its roles. It has to be even more mindful of the importance of tourism to rural areas as most of its members come from cities and towns. It also needs to work closely with local government to ensure that the appropriate travel infrastructure is in place so that visitors can access all parts of the country easily, which is not the case now.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09051453000319"></a>Turning to the other agencies involved in tourism, I noted that in his reply to the British tourism framework review report, <I>Achieving the Full Potential of the Visitor </I><I>Economy</I>, the Secretary of State says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="09051453000515"></a>&#147;Britain&#146;s national tourism agency will need to provide a core marketing capability for its strategic partners, including industry, the national tourism organisations in England, Scotland and Wales, VisitLondon and the RDAs, in addressing global markets&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051453000492"></a>The national tourism organisation for Scotland is VisitScotland. Unfortunately, many tourism organisations have lost faith in that agency and are doing their own thing because they feel that they have been paying a lot of money for no reward. This is a major problem. There needs to be a much better and closer working relationship between VisitScotland and the diverse local communities and tourist organisations if the Secretary of State&#146;s and the Tourism Minister&#146;s words are not to become just another sound bite.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09051453000320"></a>One example of where that co-operation, after a slow start, is now working well is the support VisitScotland is giving to the private sector, which is organising the largest get together of the Scottish diaspora, with the gathering to be held in Edinburgh, on the last weekend of July. Not since the visit of George IV in 1822 will Edinburgh see such a spectacle.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09051453000321"></a>VisitScotland has been amazed at the pull that ancestral tourism has and the gathering is expected to boost the economy by &#163;8 million, which is 20 per cent of the expected economic benefit of the whole year of the homecoming. The interest that has been shown from around the world has been generated not by digital marketing and associated e-commerce, as the Minister put it in the same reply I referred to earlier, but by the private sector getting out on the stump and  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1159"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>proactively marketing. Encouraging people to visit the UK is not done just by sitting in an office macro-managing tourism, but by getting out there and being physically where the markets are.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09051453000322"></a>Earlier I explained that archaeology and heritage can be an attractive and economically beneficial niche market. Another government agency that needs to look closely at its working methods is the Heritage Lottery Fund. It is not just that its budget has been slashed to help pay for, in some parts, the much resented and increasingly taxpayer funded London Olympics, but it does not appear to be interested in heritage anymore. It has become too inflexible in its requirements and criteria. Without its support, the best of our heritage, in the more remote parts of our island, will not be preserved. That, in turn, will have repercussions for tourism and the economy.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09051453000323"></a>What we need is a diverse tourism industry that puts a premium on taste, not tat; that leaves visitors feeling spoilt, not soiled; and that leaves a land that is fit, if not for heroes, then at least returnees. Too much of our tourism falls badly short of these basic criteria. I appreciate how difficult it is to pull all the sometimes competing strands of tourism together but unless a much more determined effort is made by all involved, with a strong lead given by the Government, Britain will continue to decline in importance as a tourist destination and our economy will be much the poorer.</p>

I will be endorsing much of what he said.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09051453000325"></a>Since our debate in January, VisitBritain has published its British tourism review, entitled, <I>Achieving the Full Potential of the Visitor </I><I>Economy</I>. This, again, was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Pendry. It was commissioned by the then Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, James Purnell, and is far and away the most comprehensive and objective report on the state of British tourism so far. Among many other things, the report regrets&#151;as I think we all probably do&#151;that successive governments have paid so little attention to tourism and, even now, are reducing VisitBritain&#146;s marketing budget. I would urge the Minister to take special note of this report, commissioned by one of his colleagues, and try to persuade the Government to take on board some of the report&#146;s considerations and recommendations.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09051453000326"></a>Three important facts emerge from the report which the Government must surely regard as significant. The first, which the noble Lord, Lord Pendry, has already mentioned, is that tourism is Britain&#146;s fourth largest industry&#151;it is Scotland&#146;s second. It employs 1.4 million people full time and another million or so part time, and contributes &#163;86 billion to the economy. This in itself is surely a good enough reason for the Government to take tourism seriously.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09051453000327"></a>Secondly, easily the largest number of small businesses that start up yearly come from the tourist industry. Some of these are very small, with turnovers of less  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1160"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>than &#163;100,000 a year, but in a time of high unemployment tourism offers a relatively cheap and practical way for budding entrepreneurs to start up a business on their own. Surely the Government should actively encourage this.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09051453000328"></a>Thirdly, a thriving tourist industry&#151;it looks as though the tourist industry will thrive this year and even benefit from the recession&#151;can absorb large numbers of the unemployed, if only on a seasonal basis. So often in this business, a cheerful and friendly disposition is far more valuable than a university degree. Yet despite these important facts, successive Governments have allowed our tourist industry to fall further and further behind our competition&#151;other countries. Relative to the size of their populations, far more people go to Ireland and New Zealand than to Britain. You would expect Britain to have as many, if not more, attractions than either of those two countries, but no: it is because the Irish and New Zealand Governments believe tourism to be important to their economies, and they are prepared to spend money promoting themselves and making certain that the visitor has a good experience when he gets there.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09051453000329"></a>In this time of recession, with a weaker pound and fewer Britons going abroad for their holidays, this is the ideal time for our Government to invest in their tourist industry, not cutting its budget. Apart from increasing VisitBritain&#146;s budget so that it can more effectively market Britain throughout the world, the Government should also through their various agencies encourage and assist new small businesses to start up&#151;new craft shops, new cafes, specialist tourist operators, coach services, local museums, farmhouse bed and breakfasts and all sorts of new visitor attractions and sporting activities.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09051453000330"></a>What we most lack in comparison with other countries are tourist information centres. This is one of my hobbyhorses; I feel very strongly about it. There are so few of them now, which is particularly noticeable at gateways to the country, particularly airports. A tourist information centre is very much more than a place where you can pick up a brochure and ask for train times. It should proclaim to the world: &#147;You are welcome here. We want you to learn more about our country. We want you to get the most out of your visit here, and when you have more time we want you to come back again&#148;.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09051453000331"></a>In a recent survey by VisitBritain, Britain came 13th out of 14 countries that were tested in its reputation for friendliness to the visitor. This is very shaming. A handy visitor centre manned by efficient, knowledgeable and above all friendly staff could do more than almost anything else to improve our image. Yet more and more of the still existing TICs are being closed down. The reason that is given is that they are costly to run and usually located on expensive prime sites, although there is no point in having a TIC if it is hidden away. They are usually partly or largely financed by local authorities, which are being forced to cut their costs. Some argue that because everything is done on the internet nowadays, they are not as necessary as they once were, but this completely misses the point. Tourism is a people business. The visitor wants human contact and friendly help. He cannot get that from his computer:  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1161"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>at least, I do not think that he can. I ask the Minister to consider trying to find some way of helping local authorities to keep their TICs open and, where appropriate, to open new ones, starting of course with the airports.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09051453000332"></a>Finally, I shall quote from the excellent report to which I referred and which declares:</p>
<ul><a name="09051453000530"></a>&#147;a belief that it is time for tourism to be better recognised for what it is&#151;one of the dynamos of the British economy, reaching parts of the economy other industries cannot reach&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051453000493"></a>I hope that the Minister will seriously consider adopting some of the report&#146;s recommendations.</p>

He said that he had been speaking on tourism in this House for 50 years. I wish that he was speaking today as he has accumulated so much experience of tourism, both in Parliament and in his own successful ventures at Beaulieu. I have no pretension to follow him, except that I also seek to promote the potential of the south-west, in which he played such an outstanding role.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09051453000334"></a>The 2003 debate was held at a time of great uncertainty because of the effects of 9/11 and Iraq, the foot and mouth outbreak and SARS. It was held soon after the Government had announced the creation of VisitBritain. Yet most speakers agreed, as they seem to do now, that the Government were not giving enough support to one of their most important industries at a vulnerable time. Now we are in a recession and the same is true today. The words of the noble Lord, Lord Montagu, seem highly relevant. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="09051453000516"></a>&#147;Tourism has always been vulnerable to major disruptions, and the cost to our industry and to jobs can be enormous. We need an early commitment from the Government to be prepared to provide a long-term investment to help Britain to improve the tourism infrastructure and win its share of demand against ever-growing competition from other nations. More than ever before, we cannot afford to neglect our tourism potential. We do so at our peril&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 30/4/03; col. 746.]</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09051453000335"></a>The then Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Davies, who was here a moment ago, had no money to offer that day. His response was in kind. He pointed to the VisitBritain merger, the increased role of the regional development agencies and partnership with industry. It will be interesting to see whether our new Minister can provide anything more tangible. Meanwhile, the new flagship VisitBritain has itself had to endure an 18 per cent cut over three years and we have a diminishing share of the world market.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09051453000336"></a>Can we at least expect the Minister to reaffirm the Government&#146;s support for recommendations 5, 6 and 7 of the British Tourism Framework Review, which urge the raising of the profile of tourism in national policy? This seems to me essential considering how low the Government have allowed it to fall. The DCMS response is quite positive. The new advisory council and the cross-Whitehall group are obviously a step forward but results will have to come from political will power as much as from setting up new machinery.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1162"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09051453000337"></a>In a recession, the tourism industry will need to show a lot of ingenuity and I am pleased to say that in the south-west this is happening. The quiet corner of the west country where I live, a few miles from the sea, has woken up to a completely new concept of tourism, namely the Jurassic Coast, now declared a world heritage site. The entire west Dorset and east Devon coastline is fast becoming another wonder of the world&#151;a geological walk through time, spanning the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. I spend part of last Sunday in a newly discovered pub overlooking the Chesil Bank at Portland, sipping my Jurassic beer. The Olympic sailing events promised at Weymouth and Portland in 2010 will provide a huge opportunity for tourist attractions along this coastline and Dorset must make the most of it.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09051453000338"></a>The coast nearest to me beyond Bridport is apparently Lower Jurassic and 180 million years old. As a result, Lyme Regis and Charmouth have become great centres for old fossils, appropriately enough perhaps for my generation, and for many young people. The 630-mile-long south-west coast path from Poole to Minehead, assuming that it emerges unscathed from the Marine and Coastal Access Bill, is already more or less open to serious walkers.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09051453000339"></a>I remember driving foreign tourists as a student and feeling exasperated that they always wanted to go to the same places&#151;Stratford, Broadway, Bath. Perhaps it was the hall porter who used to make those decisions for them. I notice the VisitBritain website still takes you automatically to Bath on its west country map, and then straight across to Cornwall. If you persevere, however, and click on Jurassic, you will now virtually explore the gateway towns along the Dorset coast.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09051453000340"></a>I would like to hear how the Minister feels about the increased role of the RDAs. I confess I am suspicious that a lot of the regional idea is about strategy and partnership and not a lot about helping people in the tourist industry. For example, I find on the Partners for England website the following statement:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="09051453000517"></a>&#147;A national tourism strategy for England is a priority for Partners for England. One of the key outcomes of the British Tourism Framework Review is that VisitEngland should work with Partners for England to create and deliver a &#145;bottom-up&#146; national strategy&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051453000341"></a>And then it says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="09051453000518"></a>&#147;This area of the site will be expanded in due course to include information about strategy development&#148;.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09051453000342"></a>Why can we not read about real support for people involved in the business of tourism and not always about strategy? I sympathise with the comment of the noble Earl, Lord Glasgow, about the TICs. Tourism promotion support must be effective at local as well as regional and national level. We need new ideas which recognise the commitment of practitioners on the ground. I have my doubts whether the RDAs can achieve this. All the southern RDAs have suffered cuts this year and the south-west RDA is short of about &#163;50 million. It did allocate &#163;7.12 million to a project within the Jurassic Coast framework programme but announced in January that it will be withdrawing from some of that&#151;from proposed visitor centres in Exmouth and Seaton.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09051453000343"></a>In Dorset, we have severe communications and transport problems common to many rural communities, including poor mobile telephone and broadband coverage. Local authorities are not doing enough to overcome the delays and costs created by planning and listed building regulations, and all the obstacles which have blighted excellent new tourist initiatives, such as Destination Dorset. But there is a government responsibility here too. I know that the Minister is very familiar with this subject, but does he accept that there is a digital urban-rural divide and that communications failures are a new form of social deprivation? People are even moving house to find broadband.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09051453000344"></a>Historic houses in remote rural settings make an important contribution to the wider economy. I declare an interest as a member of the Historic Houses Association and the Country Land and Business Association, and I am the joint owner of a tourist attraction in west Dorset. When my wife and I took on an historic house 25 years ago we received a handful of visitors and we now receive about 10,000 each year. We were proud to be named by <I>Country Life</I> as the nation's finest manor house. We enjoy it and mostly it works well, but we do it at some personal cost. Managing a property like this, along with all the undertakings that we have to give, is extremely hard work. The Government could help us by imposing the minimum of restrictions. Historic houses now receive some 16 million visitors per annum, and more than four in five visitors to the UK are likely to see an historic building. Yet the Government insist on tighter regulation of this sector. Licensing fees, permissions for special events and temporary structures, form-filling, questionnaires, and changing the trading regime for bed and breakfast accommodation, which is hitting a lot of people, are all of concern to members of the HHA and the CLA like us.</p>

<a name="90514-0009.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09051453000345"></a>In conclusion, my concern in entering this debate is that the Government should think harder about the people involved in tourism and remove some of the negative effects of their wider fiscal and economic policies. Tourism is the public face of our nation: it is the face we are proud to put on. Support for tourism should not be all about coastal gateways, showcases and visitor centres, but also should encourage the individuals who meet tourists every day in their own homes, the small businesses and the attractions that make up the fabric of our national life.</p>

This framework review on British tourism has, as has already been mentioned, information and statistics greater than I can possibly express in this debate, but I recommend it as a reading for your Lordships. As we should all be aware, tourism is vital to the economy of the United Kingdom. Last year, spending by overseas visitors was estimated to be more than &#163;16 billion, which came from the 32 million people who visited this country. With the decline of the value of the pound, Britain is likely to remain a major tourist destination even during the recession.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1164"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90514-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09051453000347"></a>This year, domestic tourism is also likely to grow. More and more, the evidence is that Britons will turn away from expensive foreign holidays and will look to holidaying at home. A recent survey by VisitEngland found that 21 per cent of people who went on holiday abroad in 2008 would consider looking to the United Kingdom for a break in 2009 to save money. This is a golden opportunity for the domestic British tourist industry. As we know, the whole economy benefits from a successful tourist industry. It benefits the local and national transport operators as most tourists do not take or use their own transport when on holiday. It benefits the local food manufacturers who produce goods that are either sold in the locality or used directly by hotels and restaurants in the tourist areas. It also benefits the distribution companies, which transport the goods and services needed in the various tourist locations up and down the country.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09051453000348"></a>Retailing in particular is both a major beneficiary of tourism and vital to its success, whether it is food or non-food items for self-catering holidays, or simply a whole variety of things associated with being on holiday. One thing is certain: when people are on holiday, they spend a lot of money in the local shops. It is estimated at 15 per cent of the total holiday spend. In fact, the whole shopping experience is often an integral part of the overall holiday itself. Retail and tourism are clearly closely linked, and it is true to say that, without a vibrant retail sector underpinning it, the tourist destination could fail.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09051453000349"></a>Tourism is also a major source of employment. Directly, as has been said, it employs around 1.5 million people. When one adds on those jobs indirectly linked to tourism, such as shop staff, the figure is considerably more. This is almost 10 per cent of all people in employment, and it is growing in a developing sector.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09051453000350"></a>Look at how it has changed in our lifetime. Not only have the standard and variety of accommodation greatly improved, but there have been many other developments. We have seen the arrival of large theme parks such as Alton Towers, which has become one of the best theme parks in the world. With an international reputation, it has become a must-visit attraction for young, domestic and overseas tourists.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09051453000351"></a>We have seen museums changed beyond all recognition, with many becoming hands-on attractions, with lots to do and explore. Many innovative ideas have been developed and come into practice, such as Legoland. Whole parts of run-down cities have been transformed to reflect the display and heritage of the city itself, such as the Albert Dock development in Liverpool, with its museums, shops and other attractions.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09051453000352"></a>However, there still remains great potential for the tourist sector. As technology develops, new things will be possible that we are unaware of today. In the mean time, we have a tourist opportunity just around the corner. I am, of course, referring to the Olympic Games, to be held in London in 2012. It is a chance to show the world the attractions not just of London, but of the whole of the United Kingdom as well. The Olympic Games could be a massive boost to the UK tourist industry and the economy itself; if successfully sold, they could bring benefits for years to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09051453000353"></a>Tourism is vital for this country. It is a major employer; it boosts many sectors of the economy. Therefore, it is an industry that we should do all that we can to support and advance for the benefit of the whole of the economy. As I live in the north west, I trust that I will have the indulgence of your Lordships to be somewhat parochial in drawing attention to Manchester&#146;s contribution to tourism.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09051453000354"></a>Tourism continues to play a vital role in the success of the Manchester city region. The latest industry figures have revealed that it generated &#163;5.6 billion for the Greater Manchester economy in 2007. The Office for National Statistics has confirmed that during the same period, Manchester remained the third most popular destination in the United Kingdom with 971,000 international visitors, a growth of 6 per cent on the previous year. The significant investment made in Manchester airport has played a key role in this success, and together with the North West Regional Development Agency, the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities, and strong private sector partnerships nurtured over the past 10 years, Manchester is now well placed to improve its position.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09051453000355"></a>Manchester can make a strong cultural offering. The second Manchester Festival takes place this summer and the city is building on its strong sporting tradition. It was home to the very successful Great Britain cycling team at last year&#146;s Beijing Olympics. Manchester United and Manchester City football teams feature strongly in what the city region has to offer, and the city has built a world-class sporting events programme which covers events from the UEFA cup final, the FINA world short course swimming championships and the UCI world track cycling championships.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09051453000356"></a>Finally, I hope that the Government will take what has been expressed in this debate into serious consideration. As president of the Manchester East County Scout Council, I have a long-standing commitment early this evening in the north-west, and therefore I hope your Lordships will forgive me for not remaining until the end of this debate. But I will read <I>Hansard</I> thoroughly on Monday.</p>

This has been a wide-ranging debate and our general thanks are due to the noble Lord, Lord Pendry, for introducing it so comprehensively. As he pointed out, tourism is a vast industry generating great economic activity and much needed foreign exchange. It is very labour intensive and requires large long-term investment, especially in hotels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09051453000358"></a>We are all dependent to a certain extent&#151;I know that I am&#151;on the good information produced by the British Hospitality Association, which represents the entire hospitality industry and produces excellent background material. I have spoken in many tourism debates, including one held this time last year, but unfortunately not in the one in January that several noble Lords mentioned. I agree entirely with other speakers that the Government have done very little for tourism recently. This is especially curious in the current  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1166"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>economic situation, as the Prime Minister is always talking about spending our way out of recession. For example, the hotel industry has invested &#163;25 billion over the past five years, but last year the Government abolished the hotel building allowance and many other capital allowances. That seems to be rather a contradiction.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09051453000359"></a>In the shorter term, as other noble Lords have asked, why has there been no encouragement for people, both domestically and internationally, to spend their holidays in the UK in view of the pound&#146;s weakness against both the dollar and the euro? The noble Lord, Lord Pendry, mentioned a good example from several years ago. The Government invested a small amount of money which in a year generated 1 million tourists who spent over &#163;500 million.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09051453000360"></a>However, another example of muddled thinking is the fact that the reduction of VAT to 15 per cent coincided with an increase in excise duty on beer, which meant that the counter price in public houses was completely unaffected but the administrative burden vastly increased. Whenever I can, I take the opportunity to spend time walking in the countryside. In the middle of the walk, I often stop at a pub, which is usually run by a small team, frequently a husband and wife. The result of the Government&#146;s policy, as we have seen in the press, has been frequent closures of what are in fact social gathering centres for local communities. A great deal needs to be done.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09051453000361"></a>Another strong recommendation from the BHA is to introduce daylight savings, which it suggests would increase tourism and leisure expenditure by &#163;3.5 billion per year as well as impacting on road safety and CO2 emissions. This has been suggested many times in this House&#151;Bills have been introduced and I have spoken on it a huge number of times&#151;but the Government have always ducked it.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09051453000362"></a>Generally, as other noble Lords have said, we need to reduce bureaucratic expenditure and the very numerous bureaucratic rules and get people back into productive work. Restaurants and hospitality present a huge job-creating opportunity. The Government should pay more attention to this and to the excellent and regular reports and recommendations of the BHA.</p>

As we have heard, the number of people deemed to be employed in the tourism industry depends on what activities are considered to be part of the industry, which is why figures quoted often differ considerably. The Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee in the other place said in its report last year that the tourism industry employed between 1.4 million and 2.1 million people in the UK, depending on what was recognised as falling within the scope of the sector. According to the Select Committee, there is a lack of adequate data about the tourism sector on which to base strategic and management decisions, although some progress is being made to improve the situation.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09051453000364"></a>For the most part, the industry is not well paid, except for those at the top end. Seasonal labour and part-time working are key features. Its employees will be among those who have benefited most from the  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1167"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1167</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>introduction of the minimum wage and they will also benefit from the recent change in relation to tips. Labour turnover is 30 per cent and costs the sector, it is estimated, nearly &#163;900 million a year.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09051453000365"></a>One would like to think that a key priority for the industry as a whole is to find ways of improving levels of remuneration and creating better pay and career structures, although I accept that that is a more difficult change to make for a labour-intensive industry than for one where labour costs are less significant. Around 60 per cent of the workforce in the hospitality sector nationwide is from overseas; in London, the figure is around 80 per cent. I hope that a further priority in this sector will be to take steps to encourage the locally unemployed to take up positions in the sector as they arise.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09051453000366"></a>Tourism is an industry that has seen considerable change in recent years in some areas, with the consolidation of smaller organisations into major tour companies directly offering the full range of tourism services: bookings, tours, hotels, airline services, foreign exchange and coaches. Most organisations in the tourism sector in the UK, however, are small and medium-sized businesses. Obviously this has its upsides, but a downside appears to be that very few small businesses, which account for 45 per cent of the industry&#146;s workforce, access the funding that is available to them for developing staff skills. This is significant, since the UK is still perceived to offer poor levels of service and not to be very welcoming. Language can be a barrier and as a nation we do not put great emphasis on learning other languages, which may be affecting us adversely in the field of tourism.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09051453000367"></a>There has been little growth over the past 10 years in the domestic tourism sector&#151;tourism within the UK&#151;which accounts for 80 per cent of the value of the industry. Inbound tourism into the UK from overseas accounts for the remaining 20 per cent. In inbound tourism, the UK, despite growth between 2004 and 2006, has underperformed in comparison to the world average and it is projected that the UK&#146;s global share of this highly competitive market will continue to fall, although the recent decline in the value of the pound against other currencies may affect the situation.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09051453000368"></a>As noble Lords have said, last year there were 32 million visits to the UK by overseas residents, who spent nearly &#163;16.5 billion, while UK residents made nearly 69 million trips abroad, spending &#163;36.6 billion. Calculations from a survey suggest that, over the last 10 years, expenditure by UK citizens visiting other countries has risen in percentage terms three times more than expenditure by overseas residents visiting the UK. Although there were 32 million visits to the UK by residents from overseas last year, this was a 2.3 per cent decrease from the previous year, with the decrease being greatest in the last quarter of 2008. It is forecast that inbound tourism will fall by 0.7 per cent this year, although, as has been commented, there is evidence from surveys and company bookings that more UK citizens may choose to holiday in this country in 2009.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09051453000369"></a>The Government have done a great deal over the past decade to encourage visitors to come to Britain, through VisitBritain and the regional development  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1168"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>agencies, through support for arts and culture and our heritage, through investment in the Olympics and Paralympic Games, through free museums, through improving skills within the tourism and hospitality sector and through investment in our tourism infrastructure and the product on offer to visitors. Public sector funding of tourism stands at about &#163;350 million channelled through a variety of organisations and there is further investment of &#163;500 million a year in improving the industry&#146;s skills base. This represents a level of public sector investment in the industry substantially higher than it was in 1997.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="09051453000370"></a>Although I do not have any figures, simply travelling around this country makes one aware of the increase in the number of tourist attractions and venues compared with even a few years ago. The tourism industry represents value for money for the country as a whole. Not only is it a major employer but there is evidence that money spent by VisitBritain on promoting and marketing Britain to potential visitors from abroad brings considerable extra income into the country. VisitBritain has exceeded its return-on-investment target of a ratio of 30:1, set by DCMS in the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review, which indicates that money spent on marketing our country provides a real benefit to the UK economy for a relatively low cost.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="09051453000371"></a>Most visitors to the UK come from Europe and the United States. However, we also need to look to the future and the fact that, as the economies of countries such as Brazil, India, Russia and China grow and expand and their citizens&#146; standard of living rises, an increasing number of those citizens will be in a position financially to travel abroad. We need to ensure that we are providing the resources to tap into that potentially very large market for new visitors to the UK, including ensuring that the cost of obtaining a visa to visit the UK does not act as a deterrent compared with our competitor countries.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09051453000372"></a>We also need to ensure, particularly at present, that the necessary resources are being provided to extol the virtues and attractions of the UK to our own citizens to encourage more of them to take holidays and short breaks in this country rather than abroad. That would be a further way in which the tourism industry can deliver for the economy at this difficult time, bearing in mind the gap between the amount of money spent by overseas visitors to the UK and that spent by UK citizens travelling abroad.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09051453000373"></a>I hope that, when my noble friend the Minister responds, he will be able to say how the Government intend to assist the tourism sector to develop still further, building on the already substantially increased investment over the last dozen years. The sector has much to offer the economy of this country in terms of both jobs and income. With tourism around the world set to increase, we need to ensure that we are geared towards attracting a significant share of this expanding market to the United Kingdom as well as encouraging growth in tourism within the UK.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09051453000375"></a>I join previous speakers in calling the Government&#146;s attention to the importance of tourism to our economy. It supports something like 2.5 million jobs in Britain; certainly in London the leisure, retail and hospitality sector accounts for one in five private-sector jobs, and, in our current economic circumstances, jobs matter. Tourism is one of the few economic sectors to have held up remarkably well this year in the face of the recession which is biting into so many other industries. London, for example, continues to attract more visitors annually than Paris and New York combined. With the pound&#146;s exchange rate at historic lows against both the dollar and the euro, there has never been a better time for overseas tourists to get excellent value for money from their visit to the UK. However, to get full advantage for our economy while the pound remains so competitive, we need to get the message that the UK is now surprisingly affordable to a much wider audience of people across the world, and as quickly as possible.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09051453000376"></a>As other noble Lords have suggested, experience has shown that investing in tourism marketing in this environment generates a return of at least &#163;15 in visitor spending in the UK for every &#163;1 we spend on promotion. So I am delighted that the Mayor of London, in co-operation with a number of boroughs, has seized the opportunity and committed &#163;2.5 million to the Only in London tourism campaign. I am also encouraged by the tremendous response from London&#146;s consumer-facing businesses, with innovative deals, eye-catching PR and real investment in their product, many of them linking to the Only in London theme. My personal favourite project, the revitalisation of Marble Arch, will only add to London's attractiveness for visitors and locals, thanks to the efforts of Westminster Council's leader.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09051453000377"></a>However, we could do so much more to reinforce success. London First, together with other major business organisations, has written to the Secretary of State, calling for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to provide further investment of relatively small sums&#151;for government&#151;in this campaign. I am speaking only of a few millions in this context, not the billions that we have come to see as a normal financial measure in our discussions about the problems of the financial services sector. Surely a few millions committed with a return of 15:1 for the economy is money well spent on taxpayers&#146; behalf. Supporting employment in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors is more efficient than endeavouring to create new jobs in other sectors.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09051453000378"></a>I make this point in relation to London but it is no less valid for the rest of the UK. I very much hope that the noble Lord, Lord Carter, will press his colleagues in government for an urgent response on this point.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09051453000379"></a>While for ice-cream licking retail tourists we already top the league in London, perhaps I may now turn to another undoubted opportunity for tourism growth, both for the capital and for the UK as a whole&#151;the market for large-scale conferences and conventions. This sector is often known as business tourism, but as  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1170"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we all know, international meetings are a feature of life for professionals and managers in every walk of life&#151;civil servants, academics, medics and, dare I say, even politicians.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09051453000380"></a>Overseas visitors to conferences and conventions&#151;perhaps I can characterise them as Burberry-buying business tourists&#151;also contribute substantially to our economy, over &#163;1.5 billion a year in London alone. However, in this sector we are by no means world-beaters. In the 1970s, London was the number one destination city internationally for conferences and conventions, but we now rank a lowly 17th behind Barcelona and even Vienna. Essentially the problem lies in our infrastructure&#151;a familiar British disease, some might say. We lack a modern, large-scale, purpose-built convention centre and hotel complex that could house a typical world-wide conference of, say, 10,000 specialist orthopaedic surgeons, together with their partners and supporting staff. More than 100,000 delegate days of large-scale conferences are turned away from London each year, because our venues and accommodation are inadequate for these types of event. Meanwhile Paris with its Palais des Congr&#233;s, Barcelona with its business tourist facilities, developed to exploit the international profile from its Olympic Games, and even Vienna, with not one but three large-scale convention centres, all profit at our expense.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09051453000381"></a>Repeated studies&#151;most recently by KPMG in 2006&#151;show that a publicly funded convention centre in London along the lines that I describe would provide substantial positive return on investment to our whole economy. Now the costs of both development land and construction are lower than they were a year or two ago, making the numbers even more persuasive. The potential is well illustrated by ExCeL in east London, the site of the recent G20 conference, which is already investing in increased conference space to house an additional 5,000 delegates, funded by its owner in Abu Dhabi. What is needed now is political and financial commitment from government and mayor to the creation of a purpose-built landmark convention centre.</p>

<a name="90514-0010.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09051453000382"></a>Talk of nearly half a billion pounds of investment may send some running for cover. It is a substantial sum, but the prospective returns are at least as substantial. It is an investment with tangible financial payback and represents real value for money. I call upon the Government to work with the mayor and the capital&#146;s business community to bring this project to reality, to attract conference visitors away from the more established venues in Europe and elsewhere, and to provide a lasting major contributor to the UK economy. I know that the mayor has written to the Prime Minister signalling his readiness to proceed. I call upon the Prime Minister to respond in equally positive terms.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09051453000384"></a>I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Pendry, on securing the debate and support virtually everything that he said in his opening remarks. This debate follows relatively closely that initiated by my noble friend Lord Glasgow on 22 January, which gives me the opportunity to challenge some of the points that the noble Lord, Lord Carter, made in responding to that debate. Much was made in the debate of the tourism summit in Liverpool, which was positively dripping with Ministers from the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State at DCMS, the Tourism Minister. However, in that debate I expressed cynicism. I said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051453000531"></a>&#147;the test will be what action the Government take. Will they take tourism seriously for the first time, because, at a time of rapidly rising unemployment, a very worrying economic situation and a weak pound, perhaps tourism&#146;s time has come?&#148;&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/1/09; col. 1815.]</ul>
<p><a name="09051453000494"></a>What has happened since that much hyped summit? It is true that the Tourism Advisory Council has been established, which I believe met on 30 April. When does it next intend to meet and how frequently will it meet? However, there has been no new funding for VisitBritain and no new funding for the Olympics, despite pleas, whereas billions of pounds have been spent bailing out our banks.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09051453000385"></a>There was no mention of tourism in the Budget. However, buried deep in the Budget was the removal of a special tax break for holiday lets, which encouraged many to accommodate tourists. So much for the Government taking tourism seriously. I wrote to the Secretary of State on 27 April, asking whether the DCMS had been consulted before that decision was taken by the Treasury. I got a reply today which dodged that question.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09051453000386"></a>I should like to challenge some of the points that the Minister made in winding-up the debate on 22 January. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="09051453000519"></a>&#147;I felt that a number of noble Lords rather flippantly criticised the Government for not including &#145;tourism&#146; in the title of the department&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/1/09; col. 1830.]</p>

<p><a name="09051453000495"></a>He then rather flippantly himself made a rather weak joke about the length of business cards or the time taken to answer the telephone if everything for which the department was responsible was included in its title. I assure him that there was nothing flippant in my or the industry&#146;s anger that tourism&#151;our fifth largest industry&#151;is not included in the title. There is deep resentment about that.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09051453000387"></a>The noble Lord referred to a joint ministerial committee that would look at issues that touched multiple departments. There is nothing original in that concept. Indeed, when I was Tourism Minister, we had just such a committee 20 years ago. But the problem is that that committee has to be chaired by a very senior Minister. It is not good enough to have it chaired by the Tourism Minister. I speak from experience. Will the noble Lord tell us the date of the next ministerial meeting on tourism and the frequency of future meetings?</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09051453000388"></a>I challenge the noble Lord on the whole question of double summer time, for which I and others strongly argue. Nothing would give a bigger boost to tourism than double summer time. The noble Lord said that,</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1172"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="09051453000532"></a>&#147;we are aware ... that while the tourist industry may favour this change, many sectors in our communities are strongly opposed&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/1/09; col. 1834.]</ul>
<p><a name="09051453000496"></a>Certainly, many bodies are in favour, as was said earlier; for example, those representing tourism, road safety and sport. Can he please list for me today, or perhaps subsequently in writing, the many sectors, which are strongly opposed?</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09051453000389"></a>As a massive supporter of UK tourism, I have been fortunate, over 50 years as a holiday maker, Member of Parliament and Minister, to travel the length and breadth of the country. Since we debated tourism in January, I have stayed in England, Scotland and Wales on short holidays, in many excellent hotels of quality. I agree so much with what the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, said about quality and about the rising quality of our industry to which the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, referred a little earlier. In England I stayed for a long weekend in the Yorkshire Dales at the Traddock Country House Hotel in Austwick near Settle, which gave an absolutely outstanding level of comfort, food and service. In Scotland, during a salmon-fishing week, I stayed at the Ednam House Hotel in Kelso, a magnificent location on the River Tweed and a very friendly, traditional, sporting hotel. Finally, over Easter, in Wales, I stayed at the St Brides Spa Hotel at Saundersfoot, which overlooks the harbour and has had &#163;6 million of investment go into it. There was an outstanding welcome from the staff and an opportunity to walk the wonderful Pembrokeshire coastal paths.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09051453000390"></a>It should be a very good year for domestic tourism in 2009, with the weaker pound and our economic situation. A great summer could put icing on the cake or, perhaps, sausages on the barbecue. Last week, I was reading an article that talked about the resurgence of the great British picnic. Yesterday, ALVA, the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, had its council meeting. We had a reception at the Tower of London, a Thames boat trip down to the Olympic site and a dinner at Waterman&#146;s Hall, hosted by two of our members, the Historic Royal Palaces and British Waterways.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09051453000391"></a>Many members reported welcome growth in visitors this year. English Heritage was up 12 per cent. The National Gallery was up 23 per cent. The Portsmouth Historic Dockyard was up 20 per cent and the National Maritime Museum up 16 per cent. Many reported an excellent Easter but that there was a negative on the corporate entertaining front, which is very difficult at the present time. Interestingly, the Natural History Museum found, in a recent survey, that 50 per cent of the public did not appreciate that admission was actually free. There is much to do here. The Olympic site was a hive of activity. There is considerable optimism that it will be completed something like a year before 2012. We hope that this does come to pass. It is obviously a great pity that the Government are not seizing the opportunity and putting more marketing spend behind the Olympics.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09051453000392"></a>What would the industry like to see from Government? We would like to see greater funding for VisitBritain. I am pleased to say that we have a Lib Dem commitment to increase funding for VisitBritain. I should like to congratulate Sandie Dawe on becoming chief executive of VisitBritain. I wish her every success. We need  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1173"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1173</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>greater co-ordination of public expenditure on tourism by our national tourist boards, by the RDAs and local authorities. VisitEngland&#151;which I welcome&#151;has a role to play here. I very much support what my friend and colleague Lord Glasgow said a little bit earlier about the tourist information centres.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09051453000393"></a>We need to review the increase in air passenger duty, which presents a barrier to travel within the United Kingdom. We should review the phased withdrawal of the hotel buildings allowance that was referred to by the noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery, a little earlier. The Government should also tackle the expense and inconvenience of visas by introducing, on a trial basis, a Schengen plus scheme, or a bolt-on visa, in our core overseas markets so that visitors from these countries, who have already obtained a Schengen visa, can then apply for a UK visa at a reduced price.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09051453000394"></a>A reduction in VAT should be considered as well. The UK is one of only five EU members that levy VAT at the standard rate on visitor accommodations. With regard to visitor attractions, the standard rate applied in the UK is significantly above the EU average. I also very much support the plea by the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, for a major convention centre in London. We sadly miss this.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09051453000395"></a>Finally, with 81 per cent of people who are likely to visit the United Kingdom saying that they are likely to visit an historic house or castle, the Government should acknowledge the work of the HHA. I pay tribute to the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, for his work with it. There is something like a &#163;1 billion backlog of outstanding repairs at listed places of worship. Charitable and privately owned heritage could play a major role if it had the resource. The Government should restore English Heritage&#146;s grant in aid to 1997 levels and introduce fiscal incentives for maintenance.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09051453000396"></a>I conclude with the words of the Tourism Alliance: </p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="09051453000520"></a>&#147;The Government can either continue to make spurious claims that it is supporting tourism and squander this current opportunity, or it can take tourism seriously by developing and implementing a strategy that reduces the regulatory burdens, removes barriers to overseas visitors and provides the funding required for the national tourist boards to successfully compete in this global market&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051453000497"></a>Dialogue with the industry is not enough; we want action.</p>

As a number of your Lordships have pointed out, tourism is one of the major industries in this country, so it is appropriate that such an important subject is debated in this House. I must declare an interest as the owner of a tourist attraction which has between 30,000 and 40,000 visitors a year.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09051453000398"></a>Predictably, there have been calls during this debate for more support to be given to tourism, with attention being drawn to its decline. I have some sympathy with the argument put forward by Her Majesty&#146;s Government on a previous occasion that one of the causes of the decline is the market becoming more competitive, as other countries increase efforts to attract visitors. Cheap airline travel induces more Britons to choose to take holidays abroad, making further inroads into our tourist industry.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1174"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1174</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90514-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="09051453000399"></a>While recognising that that there are certain things that for practical purposes may best be done by Government&#151;for example, advertising and marketing the attractions of this country overseas to promote inward tourism, the success of which has been commented on today&#151;I believe that there would be enormous benefits for the industry in removing some or all of the government-created impediments to tourism. Her Majesty's Government should look at what can be done to further this.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09051453000400"></a>For example, as has been mentioned today, the cost of a visa to visit the United Kingdom is &#163;80. For &#163;20, you can visit 12 European countries. I am told that in Russia, China and India applications for visas must be in English. Given the number of languages available when one applies for state benefits, it would surely be an easy exercise to provide visa forms in local languages. A simple action such as this does not cost anything but can make a big difference to potential visitors&#146; perception of the welcome that they will receive in this country.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="09051453000401"></a>When tourists, both from abroad and within this country, make their holiday plans, the first thing that they look at, and the deciding factor in the great majority of cases, is the cost of travel and accommodation. Her Majesty's Government should look at whether steps can be taken to influence people at this crucial stage of the decision-making process to plan their holidays in Great Britain.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09051453000402"></a>Another matter that Her Majesty&#146;s Government might consider is taking a better and longer look at promoting more consultation and co-ordination between different government departments. Little consideration seems to be given to the knock-on effect on our fifth largest industry&#151;I heard it stated earlier today that it is our third largest industry, but I have also read that it is our sixth largest industry: whichever it may be, it is big&#151;of the continuing stream of regulations that this Government are so fond of imposing. For small, and even large, providers of facilities for tourists the full focus should be on ensuring their visitors&#146; enjoyment. Several noble Lords, including the noble Earls, Lord Glasgow and Lord Sandwich, and the noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery of Alamein, alluded to this. Those providers should be looking after their visitors, rather than filling in forms to assist in promoting politically correct agendas.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="09051453000403"></a>For all the fuss made about cool Britannia and being modem, the anchor for our tourism, the main attraction, is, as my noble friend Lord Caithness pointed out, our superb and unrivalled heritage which gives Great Britain a huge advantage over other destinations. Any Government wishing to assist tourism should surely do their best to maintain to the highest standards that great lure for visitors to come to this country. It is regrettable that government support for English Heritage over the past 10 years has been reduced in real terms by &#163;110 million at a time when the costs that English Heritage incurs, because of its extensive use of highly skilled labour, have increased way above the rate of inflation.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09051453000404"></a>Sporting tourism is another important aspect of the industry but the tax treatment of overseas sportsmen performing in this country is a serious deterrent to top-class athletes coming here. It is the sporting stars  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1175"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1175</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>who bring the crowds and generate the resulting revenues. In spite of the tax disadvantage, major sporting events such as Wimbledon continue to attract the great players; but for how long will they manage to do this when, even if the players win substantial prize money, they can still be out of pocket after Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs has stuck its hands in their pockets?</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="09051453000405"></a>The big names avoid the smaller events, which are the ones which need the star attractions to bring in the crowds. If Tiger Woods plays in a golf tournament the attendance multiplies, but the stars will not wish to come here if the penalty is ending up with a tax bill in excess of any prize money or winnings. A significant impediment to England attracting major football competitions is the reluctance of those organising the events to push players into being sucked into a tax net which can then attack their world-wide earnings.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09051453000406"></a>With the present rate of exchange for sterling there is, as has already been pointed out by noble Lords, a superb opportunity for British tourism; but it may not always be thus. While we all enjoy contemplating the enormous advantage that has been given to Great Britain of not being in the single currency, I urge the Minister to use what, in spite of the reductions, still remains a substantial budget to maintain the competitive edge which the exchange rate has provided by addressing some of the impediments to the initial decision to take a holiday in Great Britain.</p>

The contributions made today and back in January have all been eloquent and absorbing. As I think we all know, the world continues to change at a sometimes rather alarming and challenging pace. I would like to join other noble Lords in congratulating my noble friend Lord Pendry on securing this important debate. I know from my day job as a sectoral Minister how challenging it can be to ensure that a sector&#146;s perspective is heard across government. Debates such as this one help to air the issues in a very constructive fashion.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09051453000408"></a>Britain, like many countries, continues to battle the effects of the economic downturn, but the outbreak of swine flu and the associated media coverage reminds us all that the economy is not the only factor influencing the prospects for tourism in 2009 and beyond. 2009 is a very important year as the effects of the downturn become fully evident and today&#146;s debate is a timely reminder that tourism&#151;whether it is the third, fourth, fifth or sixth largest industry&#151;is integral to the British economy and its recovery.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09051453000409"></a>My noble friend highlighted that this year marks the 40th anniversary of the Development of Tourism Act 1969, and he rightly took the opportunity to underscore Anthony Crosland&#146;s contribution in that legislation. This debate therefore presents an ideal opportunity to take stock of the developments in tourism over the past four decades and to see what lessons we have learnt and what more we need to do.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1176"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1176</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90514-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="09051453000410"></a>I confess to being slightly chastised by the noble Lord, Lord Lee, on my flippancy in responding to the previous debate. But in listening to some of the contributions today I was reminded of Bill Bryson&#146;s description of national character. He certainly knows more about travel and tourism than I do. When asked what the difference was between the United States and the United Kingdom, he said: &#147;When you wander round the United States and ask people how they&#146;re doing, they say, &#145;Pretty good, thanks&#146;. When you wander round the United Kingdom and ask people how they&#146;re doing, they say, &#145;Mustn&#146;t grumble&#146;&#148;. The consensus view in today&#146;s contributions has been that the Government have done little or nothing for this industry; that it is in a woeful position; that there is a crisis of marketing investment; and that something must be done to avoid a clear and present crisis. There were some exceptions to that consensus, such as the speech of my noble friend Lord Rosser. I was also reassured by the knowledgeable contribution from the noble Baroness, Lady Valentine, about the resilience of the tourism industry and the commitment and performance from London.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="09051453000411"></a>A number of noble Lords have outlined the contribution that tourism and hospitality make to the national economy: around 8 to 9 per cent of our GDP and 2.7 million direct and indirect jobs, some 8.2 per cent of the workforce. Those are remarkable figures. We have a world-class tourism product and that quality is now available, as many noble Lords have highlighted, for significantly less given the value&#151;or competitiveness, depending on your perspective&#151;of the pound abroad. As a number of noble Lords have highlighted, that product includes breathtaking scenery; our dramatic coastline; increasingly outstanding food and drink; our incomparable history and heritage; our museums; and our hosting of major sporting events, both currently and over the forthcoming decade, such as the Olympics and the Champions League.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="09051453000412"></a>It is right to say, as the noble Lord opposite did, that the tourism customer is growing ever more sophisticated and has ever more choices. The competition from overseas&#151;notwithstanding the current position of sterling&#151;and cheaper travel have developed a demand for a higher quality product and greater value for money. VisitBritain is responsible for promoting Britain as a world-class tourist destination. It has representatives in over 36 countries around the world and has recently expanded into India and China and throughout eastern Europe and south-east Asia.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="09051453000413"></a>Provisional figures for 2008 indicate that overseas residents made 32 million visits to the United Kingdom, down by just 2 per cent on 2007. But they spent &#163;16.5 billion, which, before adjusting for inflation, is 3 per cent up on 2007. As a number of noble Lords have commented, when times are good, tourism is easy to ignore, and we sometimes take our successes in tourism for granted. Times are now immensely challenging for the industry, and despite the weakness of the pound, the latest figures that I have seen, from March this year, show that the number of visitors from the United States, the euro zone countries and the rest of world was decreasing comparatively, therefore increasing the importance of the domestic market.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1177"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1177</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90514-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="09051453000414"></a>However, as my noble friend Lord Davies has highlighted, there are encouraging signs for the summer of 2009 that people will choose to holiday at home. Anecdotal evidence suggests that, for example, the holiday park sector is going to do well this year following indications of good visitor numbers in the attractions sector over the Easter period. So, all is not doom and gloom. The standard of our hotels and bed-and-breakfasts continues to improve apace, and the wealth of attractions that the British brand offers is second to none, but there are challenges. I know that many tourism businesses across the United Kingdom are doing outstanding work trying to compete in and combat the economic downturn. The Government understand that that is not easy, particularly as we face up to what will be a difficult fiscal period.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="09051453000415"></a>How should we combat those challenges and what is the role of the Government? In the first instance, effective management of Britain's tourism industry resources will help us emerge from the downturn in good shape, ready to take advantage of the recovery when it comes. As discussed during our previous debate and again today&#151;I was pleased to hear the noble Earl, Lord Glasgow, endorse this&#151;following the Comprehensive Spending Review, the DCMS asked VisitBritain to carry out a strategic review of British tourism. Strategic reviews often come in for a bad name, but I share the noble Earl&#146;s view that that was a quality piece of work to ensure better co-ordination of funding, strategy and implementation of our approach to tourism as a sectoral industry and to try to identify ways of improving efficiency and effectiveness where the public sector touches the private sector for tourism.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="09051453000416"></a>That was published by VisitBritain on 11 February and set out recommendations aimed at better co-ordination of the significant public investments made centrally, regionally and locally. The review proposals also involve the fundamental restructuring of VisitBritain and developing the role of Visit England, which will market England in a more focused partnership at national, local and regional levels. In welcoming the review's findings, the Government emphasise their determination to forge a closer partnership with the tourism industry to minimise the impact of the downturn and to try to ensure that we are better positioned to exploit the opportunities offered by the recovery, when it comes. I am glad that the review proposed many things that the Government are already doing, and a number of things that we have subsequently implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="09051453000417"></a>If I am allowed two observations, there seems to be an excessive, if understandable, focus on the unwillingness to move on the financing of marketing. As I said, in my day job, I am the sectoral Minister for broadcasting and the media. This will not come as a surprise to any noble Lord, but I can tell the House that for much of the past year, I have spent my life in meetings with media companies who tell me that today, advertising and marketing prices are cheaper than they were in 1992, and that the advertising and media market is currently suffering between a 30 per cent and a 45 per cent reduction, depending on which form of media you are buying. The value that you can extract from the marketing pound has never been more attractive, if you are a buyer, and less attractive, if you are a seller.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="09051453000418"></a>On the specific question asked by the noble Earl about the digital divide&#151;a subject about which he is right to observe that I have some knowledge and feel passionate&#151;the Government have already committed to delivering a universal broadband service for the entire country, have already identified a universal service fund, and seek to deliver that by 2012, making us the leading country in the world in delivery of universal access to broadband at average-speed rates of 2 megabytes and above, which are attractive both to the domestic user and to the small to medium-sized enterprise looking to offer home or domestic-based connectivity and promotional opportunities.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="09051453000419"></a>To turn to the things that we are doing, the Tourism Advisory Council has recently been formed as part of the Government's commitment to support the UK's fifth largest industry. The noble Lord, Lord Lee, was right to say that the tourism summit in Liverpool was dripping with Ministers&#151;although, I must confess, not me. The Prime Minister made it clear at the summit that he was extremely keen for a strengthened partnership between the Government and the tourism industry. That is why we set that group up. It will meet three to four times a year. I will be delighted to provide the noble Lord in writing with details of the forthcoming dates of those meetings.</p>

<a name="90514-0011.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="09051453000420"></a>The remit and purpose of the advisory council is to ensure that, during these times, we can receive timely and accurate information directly from leading tourism businesses so that we can identify areas that need action and highlight ways to move forward. As the noble Lord and others will know, the council is deliberately formed of a group of high-level industry executives, including members of organisations such as Virgin Atlantic, Eurostar, Travelodge and Center Parcs. The group is designed to provide direct and regular input into government and to identify how Ministers can support the sector.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="09051453000421"></a>The Tourism Advisory Council is only one of a number of regular groups giving the industry access to government. Other regular meetings include meeting the Tourism Alliance, the Tourism 2012 ministerial advisory group, the skills implementation group and the tourism leads at each of the RDAs.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="09051453000422"></a>Another recommendation from the tourism summit was the creation of an interdepartmental group of Ministers. I defer to the noble Lord&#146;s comments on the challenges of interdepartmental ministerial groups being delivery vehicles rather than merely discussion events. This group first met at the beginning of May&#151;so, relatively recently&#151;and will meet four times a year. He is correct to identify that this group will be chaired by the Minister for Tourism in another place. I hope that my honourable friend will not be offended if I describe her as a forceful presence in the chair. So, notwithstanding her Whitehall ministerial status, I do not believe that her occupancy of the chair is a limit on that interdepartmental group&#146;s ability to deliver. As a number of noble Lords have highlighted, tourism is often dependent on a range of government departments not making negative decisions as well as making positive ones.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="09051453000423"></a>The future success of Visit England will largely depend on its capability to form and maintain partnerships with regional development agencies and local authorities.  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1179"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1179</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The evolution of Partners for England is vital to that end. The Government welcome the group&#146;s progress so far and its future aims. We are confident that these arrangements will make for strengthened leadership and better representation of private and public sector stakeholders and provide a more robust and more responsive vehicle to grow and sustain the industry in the long term.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="09051453000424"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery, made a point about marketing England domestically. Despite a tough Comprehensive Spending Review round, the Government are committed to providing &#163;130 million between 2008 and 2012 for marketing Britain overseas and England to the British. In addition, between &#163;3.3 million and &#163;3.5 million is provided annually to the regional development agencies for tourism support.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="09051453000425"></a>Again, as my noble friend Lord Davies highlighted, this industry has a vertical contribution to make to jobs. For that reason, the Government have also made a significant investment in skills in relation to the tourism industry. Last year, we announced that we would focus an additional &#163;210 million on the sector through the Train to Gain scheme and through learners who will be going through programmes approved by the National Skills Academy for Hospitality. In addition to this, the Government have committed &#163;350 million to help small businesses to get the training that they need to get through the economic downturn. This is an investment across the country.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="09051453000426"></a>London, as the noble Baroness highlighted, is central to the visitor economy as a destination in its own right and, indeed, as a gateway route to the rest of the country. I recognise that there has been concern about the DCMS&#146;s decision to discontinue its bilateral funding agreement with the GLA. This is, for the record, no reflection on the work of Visit London or the LDA, which we respect and value greatly. It is a matter of simple financial constraint and the requirement to make difficult choices, which our London partners have also encountered. We informed the then London mayor, Ken Livingstone, of this possibility last March, in order to give the GLA at least a glide path of more than a year to prepare for this eventuality.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="09051453000427"></a>We are not disinvesting from tourism. We will be reinvesting this money to support the recommendations of the British tourism framework review and to maximise potential national benefits. Indeed, as I said in the last debate&#151;as I recall, I was asked to clarify the source of these funds&#151;VisitBritain and VisitEngland are currently running a major &#163;6.5 million marketing campaign focusing on England and Britain as high-quality, value-for-money destinations, which will naturally benefit London.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="09051453000428"></a>In response to the question asked by the noble Earl, Lord Glasgow, about cuts and whether we would revisit that issue, I have to say no. Following the Comprehensive Spending Review in 2007, the DCMS was required to engage with its sponsored bodies and to seek to achieve value-for-money savings. Our funding decisions are final. The department then commissioned a review of public sector support for tourism, which we have discussed, and we agreed with VisitBritain that, pending the outcome of the strategic review, we  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1180"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1180</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would have a one-year provisional funding agreement for 2008-09. As I say, &#163;350 million a year is being invested in tourism at national, regional and local levels. That is a significant commitment.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="09051453000429"></a>In line with the Prime Minister&#146;s vision, which was outlined in the summit on improved partnership that was referred to, central government has increased its profile in relation to tourism in recent months. DCMS Ministers and tourism industry representatives attended a number of events during British Tourism Week, which ran from 23 to 29 March, both in London and the regions, to highlight the importance of tourism to the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="09051453000430"></a>The DCMS has continued to pursue its advocacy role across government and it is fair to say that this is producing tangible results for the industry, including some more tourism-friendly strategic planning advice for local authorities&#151;although perhaps not as much as the noble Earl would wish&#151;as a result of intensive DCMS-led discussions with the DCLG, the Tourism Alliance and other organisations over 2004. I have another day job as the Minister for Regulation and will respond in writing to the noble Earl on his question about historic houses and the appropriateness of the religious application of regulation, as I have some sympathy with his view.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="09051453000431"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, asked about sustainability. One issue that is increasingly significant as we look to the future is the importance of a sustainable approach to tourism. Sustainability has never been so important as we face up to the impact of climate change. We all know that we have a clear and present responsibility to make sure that we act in an environmentally friendly way; tourism, given its size, can be no exception. Many tourism businesses across the UK are already doing outstanding work under the green agenda, but more need to do so and soon if we are to protect and value the world of the future. This will not be easy, particularly as we face up to difficult economic times. However, by adopting a more environmentally friendly approach to the management of resources, Britain&#146;s tourism industry will be able to emerge stronger and more globally as well as domestically competitive.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="09051453000432"></a>When the Government published the tourism 2012 strategy, we committed to developing a framework in conjunction with the tourism industry, which we published in March. It sets out six key points. First, we must minimise waste. Secondly, we must address the impact of tourism transport. Most holiday trips, as noble Lords know, are by car and plane, so we must address the attractiveness of convenience and cost by advertising special offers and making people aware of alternative forms of transportation. Thirdly, we must ensure quality and making holidays accessible to all. Fourthly, we need to improve the quality of tourism jobs, as the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, said. Fifthly, we need to improve the perceptions of the tourism industry and make it more attractive to new and more diverse, talented and skilled people so that they view careers in the industry as long term rather than just temporary. Sixthly, a healthy and sustainable tourism industry can help to maintain and enhance community prosperity and quality of life, so we must try to reduce the

A version of this framework document, <I>Sustainable Tourism in England: A Framework for Action</I>, has been sent to the House Library.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="09051453000433"></a>Our national tourism strategy will therefore continue to focus on delivering a first-class welcome for our domestic and international visitors, providing high-quality product and accommodation for people to enjoy and improving the skills of the workforce, particularly in customer service and management. However, we cannot make headway in delivering these aims and a real and meaningful legacy from the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games without real commitment from the whole country and every region and without increasingly effective co-ordination with the RDAs and local authorities in particular.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="09051453000434"></a>There is a real momentum right across central government. These debates are material to improving the importance of tourism in the policy discussions in government and there is an increasing and effective working relationship between the Department of Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Communities and Local Government. We now have an unprecedented set of conditions and ideas knitting together to show what our sector can deliver to the local economy and to local communities. That is now being made clear in a commercial way as well as in a policy way. The Government intend to maintain a constructive dialogue with the regions, focused, as two of the contributions this afternoon highlighted, on delivery rather than just on discussion.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="09051453000435"></a>I sense from the majority of the contributions this afternoon that there is not a unanimous view of the Government&#146;s confidence in and optimism about the future of the visitor economy or about the Government&#146;s programme of commitment. I recognise that, as indeed does my colleague in the other place. I would like to reassure noble Lords that neither in the Department of Culture, Media and Sport nor in government as a whole do we lack either vision or commitment to the importance of powerful industry sectors. The Government recognise that they need to concentrate on positioning the industry for recovery and exploiting future opportunities over the next decade.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="09051453000436"></a>There are real issues, some of which have been raised in this afternoon&#146;s debate. There are questions around better co-ordination across government. There are legitimate questions around the application of the planning and regulatory regime to tourism industries. There are undoubtedly questions over how fast we can deploy the improvements in our transportation networks that we know we need to make.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="09051453000437"></a>I would say to noble Lords, however, that there has been significant progress. Institutional and organisational co-ordination is better than it has been. I genuinely believe that the overfocus on, verging on obsession with, the marketing budget is out of tune with the times and with the reality of what can be achieved with the money that is on the table and in the budgets of individual organisations. Last but not least, there is the significant capital, operating and marketing investment in the Olympic Games and the associated events. These are real opportunities. As I wander around this

It is a short and relatively simple point, which I will not labour too much by repetition. The short point is that it seems to me to be a matter of plain justice and fair dealing that the members of Bomber Command who served in the war should be recognised on the same basis as those who were members of other services.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="09051453000442"></a>I approach this issue with very few preconceptions and with no particular ties to the Air Force. I did not serve in it, neither did my father. The only connections that my family have had with the services are two uncles who served on the Somme, who by some miracle survived, and a brief period a long time ago when I

I do not come to this debate as someone who is committed to a particular service.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="09051453000443"></a>It seemed to me when I first looked at this matter, and it seems to me now, to be a matter of basic equity and fairness. I do not think that many people would question the huge support given by Bomber Command to the war effort. Nor do I think that anyone would dispute or quarrel with the statistics, a few of which I shall give the House because they are important in this respect. During the war, a total of 120,000 air crew carried out no fewer than 366,000 sorties of which 297 were by night. During those long and dangerous occupations, 55,573 pilots and crew were killed&#151;a ratio of 1:2. Every other member of Bomber Command who flew was killed. One Member of this House, our noble friend Lord Mackie, was a pilot in Bomber Command. I am told that he went on no fewer than 70 sorties and was much decorated as a result for his bravery. He is still waiting, as are the others, for proper recognition of that valiant career.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="09051453000444"></a>When we are looking at the figures, it is also worth remembering the countries from which the total figure was made up. These are the realities of that dreadful time. The 55,000 members of Bomber Command who died while on duty included 38,500 Britons, 9,980 Canadians&#151;no less than 58 per cent of Canadians who flew with Bomber Command were killed&#151;4,000 Australians, 1,700 New Zealanders, 977 Poles, 480 Czechs, 218 Free French, 188 members who were then known as Rhodesians, 68 Americans who were attached to Bomber Command from the United States Army Air Force, 34 Norwegians, 12 South Africans and three Indians, as well as 1,479 ground crew and 91 members of the Women&#146;s Auxiliary Air Force. Those figures have been slightly revised upwards, not downwards; but, no matter, the argument still stands. The casualties were huge whatever the difference may be in the statistics.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="09051453000445"></a>In addition to those who were killed, 8,403 members of Bomber Command were wounded in action. Nearly 11,000 were taken prisoner. They spent the rest of the war in German captivity and faced the harsh forced marches of the last months of the war. As many as 1,000 evaded capture after being shot down, most of whom made their way back to Britain to fly again. In all, Bomber Command was awarded 19 Victoria Crosses, nine of them posthumously. Two members of the Advanced Air Striking Force also received the Victoria Cross posthumously for a bombing raid on 12 May 1940 on a bridge being used by the Germany Army to advance into Belgium. They were Flying Officer Donald Edward Garland, aged 21, who was the first of four brothers killed in the war, and his observer, Sergeant Thomas Gray, aged 26.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="09051453000446"></a>As well as the war on land, the war at sea called for the attentions and exertions of Bomber Command, which carried out the mine-laying at sea. It sank German warships and bombed dockyards. It attacked submarine bases. It carried out the sustained bombing of Germany&#146;s military forces, stores and supply lines on all the war fronts, striking at the German V1 and V2 sites, whose missiles were aimed specifically at Britain. That, too, was a Bomber Command task.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="09051453000448"></a>The scale of the achievement of the brave men who carried out these wide-ranging essential tasks was expressed by Sir Winston Churchill, when he wrote at the end of the war to Sir Arthur Harris, Air Officer Commander-in-Chief, Bomber Command:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="09051453000521"></a>&#147;All your operations were planned with great care and skill. They were executed in the face of desperate opposition and appalling hazards. They made a decisive contribution to Germany&#146;s final defeat. The conduct of the operation has demonstrated the fiery gallant spirit which animated your air crews and the high sense of duty of all ranks under your command. I believe that the massive achievements of Bomber Command will long be remembered as an example of duty nobly done&#148;.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="09051453000449"></a>Today, there are approximately 30,000 pilots in the air crew of Bomber Command who are still alive. They and the next of kin of those who were killed in action, or who have died since the war, are still waiting for their campaign medal. It really is high time that justice was done for these brave men and women.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="09051453000450"></a>I have been trying, in anticipation of this debate, to anticipate the arguments that the Government might use for continuing to refuse this request. I have to say that I cannot think of any that stand up to very close examination. Let me dispose, first, of the bureaucratic argument. It has been said on a number of occasions that, because the Honours, Awards and Decorations Committee had considered this issue in 1946, and then rejected it, it is no longer open to review. I would refute that. There is absolutely no reason I can see why the matter could not now be sent back to the committee for further consideration, or, alternatively, why the Government could not take the decision, thereby acknowledging that the 1946 decision was wrong. Certainly, a decision of that committee cannot be considered irreversible. It really would be a nonsense to hold that a decision made in 1946 is permanently binding, no matter what change there is in circumstances.

<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="09051453000451"></a>The Early Day Motion put down by my honourable friend Austin Mitchell in another place has now attracted more than 200 signatures. The Canadian Senate, by unanimous resolution, has asked that Britain be approached formally to give,</p>
<ul><a name="09051453000533"></a>&#147;belated recognition to the effort and sacrifice made by Bomber Command&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051453000498"></a>So there is an increasing political realisation that this anomaly should be corrected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="09051453000454"></a>More recently while serving in Australia, I became aware that 20,000 Australians served with the Bomber Command of the Royal Air Force during the war. Under what was then called the Empire Air Training Scheme, the Royal Air Force in 1941 was, as the noble Lord, Lord Richard, said, recruiting approximately 20 per cent of its pilots from Commonwealth countries. I am advised that Australian casualties in Bomber Command were 3,486 dead and 246 injured, and after the war, 750 Australian air crew were released from German prisoner of war camps.</p>

<a name="90514-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="09051453000455"></a>The first Australians to see action with Bomber Command were Australian-born Regular Royal Air Force officers, some of whom like Group Captain Hughie Edwards, who was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1941, had trained with the Royal Australian Air Force. Australians continued to fly with Bomber Command until the end of the war, as did Canadians, New Zealanders and citizens of the other countries mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Richard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="09051453000456"></a>Memorials may be dismissed by some as mere tablets of stone. To most they are a tangible and continuing reminder of the heroism and sacrifice of a generation which helped to secure the liberties that we now take for granted. They are a reminder and, for some, an inspiration for the present. The Minister has visited Australia and other countries whose men and women fought in Bomber Command and she knows as well as anybody in Parliament the importance with which our military and other links are still regarded both publicly and privately in those countries. I hope that she may be able to give some positive support to the Question put by the noble Lord, Lord Richard, and that recognition and gratitude will be accorded in tangible form to those who fought in Bomber Command.</p>

First, however much we may now regret having had to reduce so many German cities to ruins, there is no doubt that the bomber offensive by night by Bomber Command and by day by the US Eighth Air Force made a major contribution to writing down the German war effort, making it difficult for the Germans to go on sustaining their armed forces against the Soviet Union and latterly against the forces they faced from the west. That shortened the war because Hitler would never have surrendered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="09051453000459"></a>More than that, because those offensives put so much pressure on the Luftwaffe to counter them, by 1944 the Luftwaffe as a potential weapon of war had virtually ceased to exist, which as much as anything

Finally, against that background, and bearing in mind that statistically service as air crew in Bomber Command during the war years was by far the most dangerous assignment for the armed services who served in the front line, it seems more than appropriate that they should have special recognition, perhaps in the form of a special rosette on their Air Crew Europe medal.</p>

I would not fancy being in a line of 10 with those odds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="09051453000461"></a>The casualty rate was immense. I had better say outright that there has also been historical controversy about whether these young men&#146;s sacrifice was used in the most productive way. Questions have been raised about that. The fact is that we were in total war and those young people who were manning those air crews did not make the decisions. Damn the generals if you like, or the air marshals in this case, and the politicians who gave them their permission, but do not try to condemn the memory of those who suffered out there.</p>

He could not be here today. I asked him for anything he would like to be said and remember that my noble friend is in his 90th<sup></sup>year, though young in spirit. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="09051453000522"></a>&#147;Remember, I was a grizzled, hard, veteran squadron leader&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09051453000463"></a>and he was a navigator, by the way, &#147;of 24&#148;. He was one who had survived beyond late teen age, beyond his 21st birthday, in a large, fragile aircraft, and had to fly through walls of red hot bits of metal flying through the aircraft and tearing people apart. Luck and judgment would have helped people get through this, but they were the most exposed part of our Air Force.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="09051453000464"></a>I had prepared other things to say, but we come back to a point that was touched on on Tuesday, when I suggested that we should start being slightly better at remembering those who survive conflict. That was in relation to the two surviving veterans of the First World War. We should remember this.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="09051453000465"></a>My noble friend Lord Mackie said to me that he was not too bothered about the medal but about there being somewhere where people could possibly see the list of all the names, some monument on the level of 55,000 names and ages. That would help bring it home to those who are fortunately too young to have served in a conflict of this level. I do not have to tell the noble Baroness, Lady Taylor, who has that unenviable task in this House of reading out the names of those who die on active service, that 55,000 died taking on a job that was not only dangerous but has become politically unacceptable in certain sectors of our society. Surely we should remember them and honour their memory at all levels and at the first opportunity. Let us not wait until we have the last handful left. Let us do something now, because time is not on our side, and these things

It is a subject which has caused controversy since 1945 and will continue to do so until formal recognition is granted to the immensely brave men and women who died for our freedom.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="09051453000467"></a>On 31 May 1992, Her Majesty the Queen Mother dedicated a statue of Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Arthur Harris. Her Majesty reminded her audience that western Europe had been at peace for over 45 years, as it had been then, but that it was right that we should not forget those dark days of war, when we were in such grave danger and Bomber Command gave us hope and the means of salvation. Arthur Harris, as we all know, followed a strategy of area bombing, which has provoked immense controversy, as noble Lords mentioned. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, gave us some of the amazing figures involved, so I will not repeat them. The campaign inevitably caused vast destruction and loss of life among civilian war workers, German and slave labour, and the military. As we have heard, more than 55,000 British air crew died producing this destruction, yet we cannot say how many lives were saved by the area bombing strategy, which continually disrupted the German military industry, thus contributing enormously to Allied successes in France, Italy and Russia. The great Russian campaigns were greatly helped by the German need to divert a large number of their new fighters that were coming through, and of course their air crews, to defend against Allied bombers flying from Britain, thus, I believe, shortening the war considerably.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="09051453000468"></a>All the men who flew with Bomber Command were volunteers and their average age was just 22. As has been said before, they included thousands of men from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the other Allied and Commonwealth countries. My noble friend Lord Goodlad emphasised that point. In recent years the Battle of Britain Flight has, rightly, become extremely popular in this country. It includes various Spitfires and Hurricanes and one precious Lancaster bomber. Would it not be appropriate to rename it the &#147;Battle of Britain and Bomber Command Flight&#148;? Lancasters were undoubtedly the best of the heavy bombers involved, but of course there were also Halifaxes, Stirlings, Wellingtons, Hampdens, Blenheims and, not least, the extremely effective Mosquitoes. All of these, and maybe others, should be mentioned on the memorial that I am sure will eventually be built.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="09051453000469"></a>Bomber Command also had other activities, which have been mentioned. There were the pathfinders, whose activities, highly expensive in terms of lives, made sure that the bombers eventually arrived at the right place to drop their bombs. There was mine-laying, which again disrupted the movement of troops and supplies east from Germany into Russia. It is right that, included with the incomparable air crew, we remember the indomitable ground crew and engineers who maintained these aircraft and kept them flying.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="09051453000470"></a>It is good to recall that that bombing campaign in Europe also included the great efforts of the 8th and 9th United States Air Forces, with their &#147;flying fortresses&#148;. They also lost many lives in the combined day and night offensives. Incidentally, from 1943 to 1945 I lived one mile from the end of a runway; I remember the flying fortresses flying in and out, and they were marvellous.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="09051453000471"></a>It is on record that Arthur Harris always got on well with his American colleagues, and that reminds us once again of the importance of maintaining a close relationship with our greatest allies. What recent discussions have the Government had with representatives of the Bomber Command Memorial Campaign? Do the Government have any views about the construction of a memorial to the many non-UK service personnel who served and died with Bomber Command?</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="09051453000472"></a>After the war Sir Arthur Harris said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="09051453000523"></a>&#147;There are no words with which I can do justice to the aircrew who fought under my command. There is no parallel in warfare to such courage and determination in the face of danger over so prolonged a period, of danger which, at times, was so great that scarcely one man in three could expect to survive his tour of operations&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051453000499"></a>The Conservative defence team remains very supportive of the Bomber Command Association&#146;s campaign for a proper memorial and continues to be in close touch with the association to see whether it can assist its fund-raising endeavours.</p>

I invite the House to join me in offering condolences to the family and friends of Lieutenant Mark Evison from 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, who died earlier this week from injuries that he sustained a few days ago on operations in Afghanistan. This is a salutary reminder of the dangers that are faced daily by our troops who are on operations now, working to sustain our security in the same way as those who fought in the Second World War, with very heavy losses; they did so bravely, as do those on operations now.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="09051453000474"></a>I am pleased that we have had this debate, however brief. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Richard, on securing this Question for Short Debate, which is one of the House&#146;s useful procedures to give an airing to a topic that might otherwise get squeezed out of other debates that come up from time to time. One theme of unity throughout the speeches of all who have been able to contribute is that nobody&#151;but nobody at all&#151;disputes the fantastic contribution of Bomber Command or the fact that Bomber Command was very important in securing our future and making such a difference in the Second World War. Its was an historic contribution. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, who knows far more about these things than I do, gave his assessment that it without doubt shortened the war. Hitler&#146;s Armaments Minister, Albert Speer, who knew more than most people about the impact of Bomber Command, said:</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1189"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="09051453000524"></a>&#147;It made every square metre of Germany a front. For us, it was the greatest lost battle of the war&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051453000500"></a>That sums up some of what people have been trying to say today about the very significant contribution of Bomber Command.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="09051453000475"></a>However, as others have pointed out, that very significant contribution came at a terrible cost. More than 8,000 aircraft were lost and, out of 125,000 pilots and crew, 55,573 were killed. Mention has been made of those who came from the Commonwealth&#151;25 per cent of the pilots and crew. It is right that, when we think about how we should remember Bomber Command, we should take into account their feelings as well. It is important to remember that people from Commonwealth countries and from Britain worked closely together during that time and it is good that the bonds, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad said, with Australia, but also with Canada, New Zealand and other Commonwealth countries, are still so strong today. So there was a terrible cost.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="09051453000476"></a>Statistically&#151;this is one of the most salutary facts&#151;a Bomber Command crew member had a worse chance of survival than an infantry officer during the First World War. That shows the scale of the challenge that they took on and why people are so concerned that they should get recognition. As the noble Lord, Lord Richard, said, 19 members of Bomber Command received Victoria Crosses, nine of them posthumously. Their contribution was very significant indeed.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="09051453000477"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, mentioned the noble Lord, Lord Mackie, who participated in a debate that originated with a Question from the noble Lord, Lord Selkirk, in March of last year. The whole House was silent when they realised that he had that direct experience and therefore was entitled to talk about these issues in a way that others could not. I assured the House at the time of the deep appreciation of this Government for the courage and indeed the sacrifice of those who served in Bomber Command during the Second World War. That certainly remains the case. We owe them a great deal.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="09051453000478"></a>The age of those who flew on operations has also been mentioned&#151;the average age was only 22. The dangers were clearly many: night fighters; anti-aircraft fire; the development of new aircraft; mechanical failure; navigational challenges; the prospect of imprisonment if you managed to bail out; and sorties that could take eight or nine hours and brought with them a mental as well as a physical strain and ordeal&#151;an experience that could rarely be matched. We should not forget the contribution made by all those who died, were injured or were taken prisoner.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="09051453000479"></a>I, of course, include in that the absolutely crucial role of the ground crew and the in-flight engineers. Without them, Bomber Command would not have been able to carry out hundreds of thousands of sorties, drop more than a million bombs and tie up vast amounts of scarce German resources that would otherwise have been used elsewhere against Allied forces, as the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, said. Many of the ground crew also suffered. I was glad that we heard mention of the many women in the   


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1190"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column 1190</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ground crew support teams who made a very significant contribution. Night after night these brave volunteers&#151; noble Lords have stressed that these were volunteers and it is important to remember that&#151;risked their lives and, as I said, many gave them. There has never been any doubt about the bravery and integrity of those who took part.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="09051453000480"></a>All speakers have said that that there should be appropriate recognition of that contribution. Given the extraordinary service that these people gave, there is, indeed, a very strong case for that. People understandably ask for that recognition. As has been said, those who served in Bomber Command during the Second World War were eligible for one of the stars instituted for campaign service&#151;for example, the 1939-45 Star. In addition, a series of campaign stars were created for participants in particularly hazardous campaigns and many Bomber Command personnel qualified for the much prized Air Crew Europe Star or the France and Germany Star.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="09051453000481"></a>Noble Lords have said that this issue should be revisited to consider awarding extra recognition. The case for a specific Bomber Command recognition medal was considered by the relevant committee at the time but it was not considered appropriate at that stage. That was not just the situation for Bomber Command; it applied also to Fighter Command and others. The committee&#146;s long-standing policy has been that retrospective consideration of awards and medals for service performed many years earlier should not be given and that remains the case. Ministers do not interfere in the working of the HD Committee&#151;the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Richard, will recognise, from his experience as a Minister in the department, that many problems would arise if Ministers interfered in the allocation of medals.</p>

<a name="90514-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="09051453000482"></a>As regards noble Lords&#146; suggestions about creating a memorial and the campaign to erect a memorial to recognise those associated with Bomber Command, we are actively supporting the Bomber Command Association in its efforts to establish a national memorial for Bomber Command that will pay tribute to all those who died serving in Bomber Command. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, said that the noble Lord, Lord Mackie, was concerned that the names of those who died should be recorded. I understand where he is coming from. The actual design of a memorial has not yet been determined but I am sure that any suggestions coming from the Bomber Command Association or veterans of the campaign will be taken into account. The House will know that a Bomber Command memorial funding campaign was launched last year, to which the noble Lord, Lord Luke, referred. I understand that the fundraising is going extremely well, which is good to know. The Ministry of Defence chairs the Bomber Command memorial committee, which is looking at locations in London. I understand that good progress is being made about possible locations; discussions, however, have not been finalised. I undertake to come back and inform the House once a decision has been made.</p>

The dedication and sacrifice of those who were part of Bomber Command is absolutely unquestioned. This debate is about how best to recognise that contribution and how to move the situation forward.

<p><a name="09051462000003"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051462000354"></a>Lord Livsey of Talgarth:</b> The debate which I am fortunate enough to introduce today is about the withdrawal of public and private services from rural areas. I owe Members an apology, because this debate should have taken place before Easter. Unfortunately, the husband of our Lord Lieutenant, Bill Legge Bourke, died, and I was unable to come to the debate on that date because of his memorial service. I happen to be a deputy lieutenant in the county of Powys.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000004"></a>The market town of Talgarth, where I was brought up, was a busy place. Its population in the days of the Second World War and later was around 2,000. Apart from the livestock market, many worked in one of its two hospitals. Others worked on the railway; an artery which joined north with south Wales, mid-Wales with Hereford and Oswestry and beyond, to say nothing of lines to Merthyr Tydfil and Swansea. Indeed, you could travel to London and back in a day from my home town. Situated in the then county of Breconshire in the heart of the Black Mountains on the Welsh borders, it was very well connected, transport-wise.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000005"></a>There were 45 retail and business premises, mainly shops, including three banks, two garages, a bus and haulage company, two branches of farmers&#146; co-ops, and a police station with three policemen. When I returned after working for ICI and other businesses for 25 years, I found the following in comparison: there were 16 retail premises, no railway after the Beeching cuts, one slimmed-down hospital, one bank, no bus company, one garage, no farmers&#146; co-ops, no police station and no policemen. There was one councillor, instead of the previous two. The town seemed to have been partly abandoned, with a massive loss of services. This sort of demise has hit rural communities all over the UK, and that is why I feel so strongly about it and want to see the Government provide the means and

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000006"></a>At this point, I must declare interests. First, I am vice-president of the Brecknock Federation of Young Farmers Clubs, at the younger end of the local community. Secondly, I am an adviser to the board of the Prince of Wales outfit called Prime Cymru, a Prince&#146;s Trust charity that enables over-50 year-olds into business start-ups in Wales. We have started 1,500 new businesses as a result of that over the past five years. Thirdly, I am a member of the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales. I will later demonstrate how some of these bodies help to regenerate rural communities.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000007"></a>At the start, I am duty-bound to describe and identify the degree of devastation that has hit many of our rural areas through the withdrawal of both public and private services. Rural areas have often suffered most from the closure of local shops, services and facilities, which also act as the hub of a community. These services also create local jobs for the communities that they serve and are a vital part of vibrant, sustainable communities. Local communities are suffering from the following: the closure of local independent shops; the closure of local post offices; the closure of local bank branches; the decline of local street markets; the closure of local pubs; the closure of local services, such as health centres; green spaces being built on; more traffic, and fewer people walking on the streets; and fewer public transport services.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000008"></a>The impact of all that can be quantified as follows: 70 per cent of rural parishes have no general store; 75 per cent have no daily bus service; 83 per cent have no general practitioner; and 43 per cent have no post office. That information has been supplied by the Countryside Agency. Some 3,700 post offices have closed&#151;a 21 per cent decline; 8,000 independent grocery stores have closed&#151;a 25 per cent decline; 3,757 bank branches have closed&#151;a 23 per cent decline; and 13,000 independent newsagents have closed.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000009"></a>I realise that I am already running against the clock, but my colleague Tim Farron MP, in his role as Liberal Democrat spokesman on this subject in the House of Commons, has quantified the following. Under the Conservative Government, rural post offices shut at a rate of up to 200 a year. Since Labour came to power, the relentless pace of closures has continued, with 1,200 axed since the millennium. There is a crisis in affordable rural housing and, indeed, there is unfair competition in relation to food prices, with a continuing decline in the agricultural industry and in the number of rural shops. Fuel poverty is twice as bad in rural areas as in urban areas. When one starts to compare all those facts with the situation in metropolitan areas, one can see a huge imbalance between the two. Less than half of the residents in villages and hamlets live within 13 minutes of their nearest bus stop, for example, and there are other statistics of that kind that one can pray in aid in setting out the impact of the reduction of services on rural areas.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000010"></a>I have far too much material here, so I am motoring through it. There are a number of factors which I should like to underline regarding how we might be able to tackle some of these issues, but I know from personal experience that it is very hard going. One of  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC457"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC457</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the latest things to have happened is that HMRC has decided to close a large number of tax offices. That is causing a lot of hardship for small businesses in rural areas and is quite a problem.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000011"></a>What do we have to do to try to tackle these problems? I can tell noble Lords what we have done in my local community. For the past 20 years, we have had to lobby for a relief road because the lorries were literally knocking down the shops, and we have finally got it. We have had to restore retail shops, as there is no provision for this, and we have managed to scrape together &#163;2,500 to paint them and make them more attractive. We had to make video films of traffic congestion and lorries to convince the powers that be that we needed a relief road&#151;not a bypass, just a relief road. We have had to create a regeneration group, of which I can claim to be the first chairman. We have also had to acquire business starter units, some of which have been successful. However, we have very few funds, although we now have a project to convert a mill for electricity generation from the river that runs through the town, and somehow or other we have managed to find &#163;60,000 for that from various grant-making sources.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000012"></a>The problem is that the situation is very uneven. Some rural communities seem to get support, while others are in the doldrums. In our area, I have been involved in the start-up of the Hay Festival, which is coming up soon and in past years has been very successful. I have been chairman of the Brecon jazz festival, which also has been very successful.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000013"></a>However, my poor old hometown does not seem to have the sparkle because there is a lack of active people who can fill in forms in a professional way and lobby. We have had to do a number of extraordinary things in the area. We were threatened with a bank branch closure in Llandrindod Wells and the only way we saved it was to take a busload of residents down to Cardiff to the regional board meeting and hammer home the fact that it was the only bank branch within 14 miles and we saved it. We had to take 200 people to the regional health authority 50 miles away to save eight community hospitals. Recently we have had to come to HMRC in London to try to save 140 jobs in our tax office. As we have an almost non-existent bus service, we have set up a dial-a-ride service and it does 100,000 miles a year with five buses. We have managed to do all those things in our community, but the latest thing to hit us is that they want to close our local voluntary centre for want of &#163;1,000 to promote tourism, for example.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000014"></a>How will the Minister join up government and ensure that sufficient money and panache, particularly entrepreneurial panache, are put into local areas to increase employment? The Home Office has come down on us like a ton of bricks because it wants to close as many of the magistrates' courts as possible. Six have already been closed in the past seven years and it wants to close the one in Llandrindod. We have had a seven-year campaign, including debates in the House of Commons and lobbying of the Minister to save one magistrates&#146; court. The next one is 40 miles away and witnesses cannot travel there because there is no proper public transport.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000015"></a>I have explained the impact which we face in rural areas. We need an enormous amount of help in such areas, where the GDP per head is only three-quarters of the UK average. The need for young people, and indeed older people who are the majority of the population, is immense. A little money would go a long way.</p>
<h5><a name="09051462000325"></a>2.12 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09051462000016"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09051462000355"></a>Lord Roberts of Llandudno:</b> I am privileged to follow my noble friend Lord Livsey. Much the same story will emerge. We are both from Wales and so this could be considered the upper House of the Welsh Senedd; perhaps they should form one. As we are the House of Lords for the whole of the UK we can, at least, venture into Welsh territory.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000017"></a>This problem relates to the background of the past century and a half. I have been looking at the census records. We have an increasing concentration of population in urban areas. In 1851, just over half the population, 50.2 per cent, lived in urban areas; in 1951, 80.7 per cent of the population lived in urban areas. We have seen a decline from nearly half the population living in rural areas to just one in five today. Urbanisation continues and it is against that background that we have the problems which we face.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000018"></a>My noble friend Lord Livsey has mentioned Talgarth in mid-Wales and adjoining towns. I want to take you to a valley in north Wales which is composed of two little villages, one larger than the other. Over the past 50 years, something has happened there: there were two quarries and both have closed; there was a woollen mill and that has gone; and we are chapel-going people in Wales and there were six chapels and now there is only one, which is not particularly well attended. Both the churches have gone and the Church in Wales premises have gone. One was the most historic in Wales because it was near there that the Bible was translated into Welsh in 1588. One of the two schools has gone and the present school is threatened: it has only 20 pupils. Forty years ago, 120 people attended the Sunday school, but that has gone completely. This is a spiral of decline.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000019"></a>One of the two pubs has gone. One remains, but that is run by volunteers and we are not sure how much longer that can continue. These villages are at the end of the valley. It is a cul-de-sac so there is no passing trade and there are probably more attractive premises in the renowned tourist villages in that locality. The fish and chip shop has gone. It was run by one of my family, so I feel very sad about that. Both post offices have gone and now 39 shops have gone. In those villages where there were 39 shops 30 years ago, today there is no post office and no shop at all. There is no minister or vicar. There is no doctor's surgery. There is no policeman. There is no football team or band or choir. The hills are no longer alive with the sound of music.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000020"></a>This spiral of decline affects us in so many ways. We cannot reclaim yesterday, but with the emphasis on a need for vibrant communities, it is vital that we support and maintain the villages that we do have. In the cities now we hear about dreadful crimes such as knife crimes and so forth in parts of London and we say  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC459"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC459</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that what we need are good communities. In the villages in the valleys and rural areas of the UK we have those communities. They need more support than they are getting at the present time.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000021"></a>I was looking at the police statistics in Wales. The most law-abiding places are the most rural places, where there is a sense of community. We now need to look at a way of stopping that decline. First of all, communities need people who are active members of their local community. We welcome visitors who come and stay for a weekend or even a couple of months in the summer, but we need locally based people to run the community councils. We need people to be in charge of the parochial councils. Communities need people with a wide range of ages and interests.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000022"></a>People need affordable housing. That is one of the main problems. I was speaking only half an hour ago to the leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Welsh Assembly, Kirsty Williams. She was telling me that they were still trying to get&#151;we might see it happening here before very long&#151;the right for the Welsh Assembly Government not to sell housing if they see that areas are in special need. I am sure that when the measure comes before the House, we will be able to support that particular measure to keep people within their villages. Housing is crucial. With housing comes families, and with families come children, and with children come schools. The circle does not have to be a downward spiral: it can be an upward spiral.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000023"></a>Even though we would like to, we cannot justify the retention of all village schools. There is a limit when there are only half a dozen children and you cannot justify it. But with the proposed growth in the number of housing schemes for local families we might see changes in the population of young people in the near future. I suggest a halt in many places on the closure of village schools to see how the future develops. That might mean extra money from somewhere&#151;as education is a devolved matter I have an idea that that will be from Cardiff&#151;to maintain those schools through their education authorities for the foreseeable future.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000024"></a>We also need to experiment with different proposals to keep the commercial life of the community going. The Prince of Wales started a scheme to &#147;make the pub a hub&#148;. As a teetotaller, I was not sure how to support it, but I do support it, because if we can use one building for postal services, as a village shop and for use by the community, we will restore facilities in places where they have been in decline for many years.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000025"></a>Let us encourage pilot schemes and request local communities and parish councils to bring forward schemes of their own that can be embraced by the larger council and even in some way by ourselves. We need new vision. We need to be people with a bit of venture in our souls to bring new life to many of our rural communities.</p>
<h5><a name="09051462000326"></a>2.20 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09051462000026"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09051462000356"></a>Lord Burnett:</b> I refer noble Lords to my declaration of interests on the Register. My law firm has a large planning practice that serves rural areas in the West Country, particularly in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Dorset. I pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Livsey for securing this debate; it is high time that we had a chance to debate the problems of rural England.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC460"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC460</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000027"></a>There is a frequently held misconception that all rural areas are affluent. It is apparent that the Government hold that view in the way that they allocate central government spending. However, the Government can see for themselves in the statistics that they gather that there is considerable poverty in rural areas and that has increased over recent years.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000028"></a>In my former constituency of Torridge and West Devon, there were areas in north-west Devon in and around Bideford that contained some of the poorest wards in the country. The official indices of deprivation for those wards showed greater poverty than in the major cities in the north-east and north-west of England. It is, unfortunately, unlikely that this Government, in probably their last year of office, will do anything to change that.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000029"></a>The briefing for this debate by the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England refers to the specific protection given to post offices in urban deprived areas. The briefing goes on to say that the Government have neglected to introduce similar provisions for rural deprived areas. Will the Minister, when responding to the debate, justify that appalling discrimination? The Government should understand that for many in rural areas, as my noble friend Lord Livsey eloquently stated, the post office is a lifeline. Many people in villages and country parishes do not have cars and need a post office to access their pensions and other services. In addition, post offices are a focal point for rural villages and parishes and often provide an essential retail function for both convenience and comparison goods.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000030"></a>I should like to dwell in this debate, and seize this opportunity to concentrate on, affordable rural housing. The problems have been eloquently described by both my noble friends Lord Livsey and Lord Roberts. David Orr, the chief executive of the National Housing Federation, has stated that waiting lists for affordable housing in rural areas have risen by 40 per cent in the past five years. The waiting lists now comprise 700,000 people. That is a colossal number of individuals and the figure disguises considerable sadness and unhappiness. The National Housing Federation predicts that 103,000 people aged between 24 and 35 are now expected to migrate from the rural areas to towns and cities over the next three years. Without young people and young families, the heart will be removed from country villages and parishes. Schools will close, much parish activity will diminish and there will not be a pool of workers for all the necessary rural jobs, including agriculture and horticulture.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000031"></a>This exodus should be reversed, and it requires urgent action. It would be helpful if the Minister, in winding up, would provide details of national house-building starts for 2006, 2007 and 2008, together with a breakdown of how many of these starts were in rural areas. It would also be interesting to have a similar breakdown for the first quarters of 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. The first quarter of 2009 should now be available. I believe that these figures will throw up a huge contraction in house-building&#151;and house-building in rural areas&#151;in recent months and over this past year.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000032"></a>It is no good the Minister saying that this is all a matter for local planning authorities. The Government give guidance to those authorities and create considerable  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC461"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC461</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and needless further bureaucracy and administration in planning matters. I make one suggestion in an endeavour to alleviate the problem of the shortage of affordable housing in rural areas. There used to be, and probably still is, an exceptions policy. It was possible to promote a site for affordable rural residential property on the outskirts of villages. It was the sort of site that would in no other circumstances get planning permission for any open market residential development. The Government could give planning guidance to local authorities to the effect that there was a presumption to grant planning permission in certain circumstances, and these could be as follows.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000033"></a>First, it would be only for affordable housing, conditioned under Section 106 of the Planning Act to that effect. Secondly, it must be over an area of land as near as possible to the centre of a village, or even a hamlet. A sequential test would be relatively easy to devise. Thirdly, the amount of housing consented should reasonably accord with an affordable housing needs survey, conducted on behalf of the promoter and agreed with the local authority. There may, of course, be other conditions relating to topography, highways, and so on. Nevertheless, the Government could make these ambitions clear to local authorities and, effectively, give them the green light to start to reverse this decline in rural affordable housing. The Government should not just sit back and wait for something to happen. The Government should take the lead and empower local authorities to regenerate their villages and parishes. There is much work to be done.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000034"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09051462000357"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, for securing this debate and, indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, who, along with his namesake, the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, guarantees that the Welsh voice is rarely silent in our House. I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Burnett, for his contribution. In talking about rural housing, he hits on one of the major issues that any policy on rural communities needs to address. I am delighted to have by my side the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, and I am sorry that her engagements meant that she could not participate in this debate. All noble Lords will know that she is a champion of this issue.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000035"></a>I declare an interest; I am a farmer and grower. I come from a place called Holbeach, where I was born, and I live in the house that I was brought up in, so I have a sense of place. When we talk about changes in rural communities, I know of what I speak because it is my life experience. My wife has been a county councillor for Holbeach for the past 20 years, although she is not seeking re-election; I think she wants to enjoy life in London while I am here during the week. It certainly means that I am reasonably informed about the politics of local communities.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000036"></a>I have been involved in a project. When Holbeach Hospital closed, 20 years ago, a group of friends and colleagues formed a charitable trust. I was chairman of that hospital for 18 years, running it as a community hospital with a contract with the National Health

There are practical ways in which communities can still cover deficiencies which occur simply because of government policies.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000037"></a>I will not pretend that this problem has arisen just because there is a Labour Government now, or that there were no problems under Conservative Governments. That is not the tenor of this debate. The phenomenon of which we talk is a process of change that has been fairly relentless. We need to find a consensus on how we can address it. We who live in rural areas do so in very changed communities. Not all the changes are negative; we must remember that. We are all better off, but the differentials remain, and those between urban facilities and affluence, and rural facilities and affluence, are growing rather than diminishing. I come from the district of South Holland. With its neighbour, the Fenland District Council, it is pretty low down any measure of general education attainment, healthcare standards and all the rest of it; it is always low on those indices.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000038"></a>Of course, the biggest change has perhaps been one of the reasons that has accelerated the decline: the increased number of car owners in rural areas. Car owning is a mixed blessing. One in three households in rural areas have two cars&#151;it is only one in 12 in an urban area&#151;but that is not surprising. If both husband and wife are working, they both need a car to get to work. In fact, a car has become essential in rural areas. There was a local garage that specialised in buying cars from hire car companies and selling them, because they were so heavily discounted, to people in my part of the world. They were not old bangers, but they were on the way to becoming old bangers. They are essential: you need a pair of wheels to keep your job, to go shopping and to access services.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000039"></a>As soon as that happens, you create the mobility that can lead to the decline of services because people are capable of moving. We have the peculiar contrast that petrol stations in rural areas are in decline and yet there are more cars in rural areas than ever before. Why is that? It is because people are going to the supermarket pump in the out-of-town shopping centre rather than shopping and buying their petrol at the garage where it is that much more expensive. It may not be that much more expensive, but it is sufficient for people to go elsewhere.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000040"></a>I will talk later about those who are left behind. A lot of the problems with rural communities stem not from the people with the cars, but those without them. However, it has proved to be the death knell of the village shop, post office and many other rural services now that people commute from villages to towns and, indeed, from market towns to the cities for their shopping and services.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000041"></a>There is a changed pattern of employment in rural areas. The number of people employed in agriculture in the field has declined enormously. Most people engaged in rural employment and occupations now work in pack houses. The crops are harvested mechanically&#151;their processing and marketing actually provide the new employment.</p>

The whole business of finding rural housing at a reasonable price and securing it for indigenous people is complex and not easy.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000043"></a>In addition, of course, affluence has meant that people have different ways of spending their leisure time. The decline of the rural pub is perhaps only partially due to Chancellors taxing beer; it is more likely due to the fact that people have other things to do with their leisure time. They do not necessarily want to spend their evenings in the village pub; there may be other things on which they wish to spend their time.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000044"></a>I hesitate to mention this point because it might sound party political&#151;I hope noble Lords appreciate that I am not approaching this debate from a party political point of view&#151;but one of the difficulties the Government have had in their relationship with rural areas is that the new Labour project failed to engage with rural England. It is one of the items on the agenda that was never fulfilled and it has been damaging to rural England and agriculture.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000045"></a>In particular, in rural communities the Labour Party effectively has no locus; there are very few Labour Party activists and the NUAW&#151;which, when I was young, was a power in the land, along with the NFU&#151;has more or less disappeared, subsumed by the Transport and General Workers Union, now part of Unite. There is no longer that sense whereby the Labour Party feels that it has a political locus in the countryside. That has given the impression on occasions that rural communities perhaps do not matter as much as they might do. I hesitate to make that point because I do not want to destroy the consensus I might be building, but it is a valid observation on one of the difficulties that we have had recently.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000046"></a>All parties need to make a conscious effort to listen to and act on the concerns of the rural population. I think we would all agree with that. The appointment of Dr Stuart Burgess has been a positive development and, as rural advocate, he has used the commission&#146;s resources to evidence the challenges that the Government face in these areas and has utilised his contacts with local authorities to maintain critical services and access to them. The current crisis is hitting rural communities particularly hard. What assessment have the Government made of the impact that the recession might have on rural communities?</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000047"></a>The Commission for Rural Communities report into the state of the countryside noted how access to services such as banks, job centres and petrol stations, which I have mentioned before, is becoming increasingly difficult. We can all think of post offices, village shops, schools and healthcare facilities which are, in many cases, directly affected by government policies. What assessment do the Government make of the impact of policy decisions on rural services?</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000048"></a>Finally, the InterConnect system in Lincolnshire, which I know Stuart Burgess has looked at, is being funded by the Government. It is a successful system which works in partnership with Lincolnshire County Council, and I have made clear my interest. This system ensures that there is now a transport system for

Even people with cars sometimes cannot drive them when they get older, and they need an alternative method of getting to services. That is never going to come cheap&#151;we have to appreciate that it is bound to be a cost on the community as a whole&#151;but it is essential if we are not to see a proportion of our rural population with no access to the vital services they need. It is beholden on all parties and political activists to look, listen and act with rural communities in mind.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000049"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09051462000358"></a>The Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change &amp; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> I, too, welcome the opportunity to debate rural affairs and I thank the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, for initiating the debate and for the breadth of his opening speech, which was very helpful. It gave a very interesting insight into the challenges and changes in rural Wales which he has experienced over the years.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000050"></a>I was also impressed by the work that he and his colleagues have done in his local community. He seems to have been very active and very successful. If one were to draw conclusions on what could be done to help rural communities to develop in the future, they could do very much worse than to follow his example. I found some of the initiatives which he spoke about extremely interesting.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000051"></a>As someone who lives in Birmingham and works in London, it might be thought that I am not the best person to comment on issues concerning rurality, particularly when all other noble Lords in the Grand Committee today clearly have a great deal of experience. Birmingham is very close to Warwickshire, which is an outstanding county and one with which we enjoy very good relationships. Like many Brummies, we always spend our holidays in mid-Wales. The noble Lord talked about the lack of access to services, but it is quite remarkable that at any time of the year in Aberdyfi one can always get a copy of the <I>Birmingham Post</I>,<I></I>which says something.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000052"></a>I am responding to the debate because Defra has the lead responsibility within the Government for rural issues and monitoring rural affairs, and that situation also applies to England. I know that the noble Lords, Lord Livsey and Lord Roberts, made the point that although they were mainly talking about the situation in Wales, their points are applicable to the rest of the UK. My department has very good contacts with the devolved Administrations and on a number of occasions during the year we discuss rural issues. I shall ensure that the contents of this debate are shared with colleagues, particularly those in the Welsh Assembly, so that they have an understanding of the points that we have discussed.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000053"></a>Clearly, because of food and farming issues, Defra has a major area of work within rural affairs, but its other area of work is to monitor and co-ordinate the work of other government departments. If I take a message from the debate, it is that noble Lords are saying that the department needs to ensure that it is making the most of that co-ordinating role. I fully accept that it is important that we take it seriously, and  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC465"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC465</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we cannot be complacent. Of course, we have to monitor progress on rural issues across government in order to meet one of our most important departmental strategic objectives.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000054"></a>When looking at the outcomes, it is interesting to see that, in general, fewer people live in poverty in rural areas; there are fewer victims of crime in rural areas; and proportionately more people in rural areas are employed than in urban areas. Quite remarkable statistics which I have been given show&#151;I assume this is from polling&#151;that of people living in the countryside, 89 per cent would prefer to continue to do so, whereas 21 per cent of those living in inner cities would prefer to continue living there. Although we have heard some very apposite comments about some of the challenges and problems of maintaining rural communities, none the less, many people see living in rural areas as an asset and very much to be desired.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000055"></a>The problem that we face is the dispersed nature of rural communities and the greater distances between settlements and services. I suppose that is the root cause of why service-deliverers in rural areas have considerable challenges. Each of the public services that noble Lords have mentioned faces that particular problem. I was very interested in what the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, had to say about the closure of rural services, including post offices, pubs, shops and petrol stations. I do not think that he mentioned job centres, but that is obviously an example of where there has been some consolidation. Then there are doctors&#146; surgeries and even tax offices&#151;although I suspect that not everyone is as concerned about that as they are about the loss of other services.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000056"></a>I do not seek to ignore those issues or to deny them. There is no doubt that there is a tension between the drive to make public service provision more efficient, which is with us and ever present, and the issue of how you do that&#151;by forcing collocation of services and increasing the distances that people have to travel, which has been a feature of many of our public services. Magistrates&#146; courts are another example. In my previous role as Minister responsible for legal aid, it was a concern raised by some groups concerned about legal aid services that it was more difficult for rural solicitors to win legal aid contracts, resulting in it being difficult sometimes for people in rural areas to gain access to legal aid services.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000057"></a>There are many examples of particular problems being faced, but it is not a totally bleak picture. Although the number of banks and building societies in rural areas has decreased by 2.6 per cent in 2007-08, the number of rural people living within four kilometres of a cashpoint is increasing and now stands at 90 per cent. The number of job centres in rural areas has fallen by nearly 20 per cent, but the number of rural supermarkets, dentists and pubs&#151;interestingly enough, in view of what the noble Lord said&#151;has increased over that period. Those are statistics from the <I>State of the Countryside</I> report from the Commission for Rural Communities, so I think they are pretty authoritative.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000058"></a>To come on to post offices, the number of rural post offices declined in that year by a smaller percentage than the number of urban ones. The number of rural  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC466"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC466</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people within four kilometres of GP surgeries and secondary schools has stayed roughly the same, as has the number of rural people living within two kilometres of primary schools. The percentage of rural households within 30 minutes of an hourly or better bus service has increased significantly since 1997. There are some positive signs amid the general problem that we are discussing.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000059"></a>The Post Office is an important issue. We are seeing investment of considerable sums of money to support restructuring and modernisation of the network. In the proposals that have nearly left your Lordships' House, or will soon be going, we are guaranteeing the integrity of the network as a whole, which is a very important component of post office services. On the point raised about access criteria and the potential discrimination against rural issues, my understanding is that the criteria that the Government designed were to allow Post Office Limited the necessary freedom to modernise service delivery. Ninety-five per cent of the total rural population throughout the UK must be within three miles of the nearest post office outlet and, to protect the population in isolated and sparsely populated areas, 95 per cent of the population of every postcode district must be within six miles of the nearest post office outlet. In drawing up implementation plans, Post Office Ltd was required to take into account any obvious geographical constraints that could prevent the spirit of the access criteria being applied. I do not think that there is evidence of discrimination against rural areas.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000060"></a>On transport, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, made the point that for many people, if they live in the countryside, having a car is essential. That has reduced the viability of public transport services.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000061"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051462000359"></a>Lord Burnett:</b> I am extremely grateful to the Minister for giving way. Is he, in his point on post offices, contradicting the brief, from which I am now reading and to which I refer, from the Campaign to Protect Rural England? It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000297"></a>&#147;The Government criteria have given specific protection to post offices in urban deprived areas, but they neglected to introduce a similar provision for rural deprived areas&#148;.</p>

I will certainly look into it and respond. My point is that, from the access criteria that the Government have laid down for Post Office Ltd, the requirements that I have read out make it clear that, in general policy, the Government have sought to protect the rural network of post offices. I am very happy to respond to the noble Lord in detail on the specific point that he raises.</p>

A neighbouring village might be three miles away, but your village only has a facility for two hours&#146; post office services every week. Does the Minister really think that that is a satisfactory criterion?</p>

It is better for it to be open for a limited time than not at all. One has to be realistic. I readily acknowledge that there will be concerns about access to public services in rural areas. Equally, it has to be accepted that any solution must be imaginative. We must make the best use of our resources.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000066"></a>I make another point, coming back to the question of legal aid. One of the matters that we were discussing at the Ministry of Justice was the question of using video facilities so that people can have communication and probably set it up in the pub. I agree with the noble Lord about the use of the pub and other community areas. With some imagination, it is perfectly easy to set up video conferencing facilities, which can then enable people in rural areas to communicate with different public services. I do not know the details of the two-hour post office, but if it is a sign of flexibility and imagination, I am all for it. There is a balance here. It is clear that no Government could afford to provide an all-singing, all-dancing network of public services, open at all times, in each part of the rural economy. Equally, we need to make sure that, as far as possible, people have appropriate access. We need to be imaginative, just as we need to be about transport.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000067"></a>Of course, we have put more money into rural transport. It is fair to say that local transport authorities are responsible for ensuring that there is a network of rural transport services. It is the same with health, which is something that I know a little more about than rural areas. There is a tension in health, where the trend over 20 or 30 years has been towards a greater concentration of services. The reason for that is very clear. The evidence from health professionals is that health outcomes and clinical effectiveness are better where there is greater co-ordination and centralisation of health services. Again, the test here is being imaginative in solutions.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000068"></a>I think that my time is coming to an end, but I want to turn to the issue of housing. I agree with the noble Lords, Lord Burnett and Lord Roberts, about the importance of housing and social housing in rural areas. I accept what the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, said about an &#147;upward cycle&#148;, which was a very good way of putting it. If young people have access to housing in rural areas, that inevitably leads to babies and children and a demand for schools.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000069"></a>We have a target of 10,300 affordable homes being provided in settlements of less than 3,000 inhabitants between 2008 and 2011. In our response to the Taylor review of the rural economy and affordable housing, we made it clear that we understood that the long-term gap between supply and demand had led to an affordability problem. We referred to the need to increase the supply housing, and we also said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000298"></a>&#147;The downturn does not fundamentally affect our analysis of why the demand for housing will continue to rise&#148;.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000070"></a>I am very happy to pass the noble Lord&#146;s interesting suggestions on planning consent to the relevant government department. It is worth noting that new proposals for a planning policy statement were issued for consultation last week. I do not know whether the

As I said, I should be very happy to ensure that the point that he raised is considered.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000071"></a>Obviously I cannot commit my noble friend Lady Andrews, but I shall certainly talk to her about the idea of a debate on rural housing because it seems that there would be a great deal of interest in it. I am sure she will be ever-anxious to come to your Lordships&#146; House to debate those matters.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000072"></a>I was asked by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, and others to comment on rural poverty. I shall be happy to write to noble Lords with the information that I have but, in the one minute that I have left, I can say that our understanding is that the impacts of the current recession on rural areas are very similar to those in urban areas.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000073"></a>In conclusion, this has been a very interesting debate and a lot of very good ideas have been put forward. The Government are not complacent on this matter; we have put more resources into our support for rural areas. However, because this issue embraces many government departments, I shall ensure that the points raised are put to the relevant Ministers. I am sure that we are all grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, for instituting the debate and for the excellence of his contribution.</p>

In doing so, I declare my interest in the subject as a former Chief Inspector of Prisons. During my time in office, I worked closely with Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Probation conducting two joint thematic reviews, one on life sentence prisoners and one on resettlement, as well as our being members of an unofficial criminal justice system group of inspectors, who took part in joint inspections of particular aspects on a mix and match basis.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000076"></a>In early 2000, the then Home Secretary, now the Secretary of State for Justice, informed us both that he was thinking of merging our two inspectorates in line with a study that was being conducted in the Home Office on the possible merger of the prison and probation services. Fortunately, the study found that that was not appropriate, which was not to deny that close working between them was essential. In November of that year  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC469"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC469</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Secretary of State announced to us and to the House of Commons that he was not going to merge the inspectorates either.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000077"></a>Both of us had urged very strongly that merger between such different organisations with such different operational purposes was inappropriate for a whole variety of reasons. In particular, the Prison Service was responsible for the treatment and conditions of approaching 50,000 people in custody, of whom about 10,000 would come into the hands of the probation service on release for the community part of their sentences. The probation service on the other hand, which for almost 100 years had had rehabilitation at the heart of its purpose and ethos, had to care for some 250,000 offenders in the community and work very closely with that community, the courts and the police on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000078"></a>Furthermore, it was at that time not a national but a county service working within specific geographic boundaries&#151;something that changed very soon after I retired from the post when the National Probation Service was created with a reduced number of chief officers of probation remaining responsible for the management of realigned geographic areas. However, the Government&#146;s intentions were made clear when at the same time the prison and probation services were brought together under a commissioner of corrections, while retaining their own director-general and national director respectively. Furthermore, under the first national director of probation, the ethos of the service was changed by putting punishment as its first task and relegating rehabilitation to subordinate status&#151;to the horror and alarm of all those who knew what was required of it if offenders were to be helped to live useful and law-abiding lives in the community.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000079"></a>However, this situation, too, was short lived because in January 2004, following acceptance of recommendations by the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, the two were joined together into the National Offender Management Service. But, from the outset, confusion reigned; no one in either service knew whether they had been merged, were to be merged or what was to happen, because there was no consultation, even with their own directors, before the formation of NOMS was announced. I mention this because it highlights the concern which is at the heart of my question: namely, whether those responsible for the introduction of NOMS fully appreciated that those serving in operational services need to be professionally led and cannot be managed like commodities.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000080"></a>NOMS has had a chequered career since then, which I do not intend to rehearse. Suffice to say that it got off to a shaky start because it was designed to create an offender management system but persisted in pretending that it was one service when in fact it was an association of two with entirely different operational purposes. Now that, too, has metamorphosed into the National Offender Management Service agency, into which the prison and probation services have been subsumed. No longer is there a director-general of Her Majesty&#146;s Prison Service or a director of the National Probation Service, but a chief executive of the agency, which has become a vast bureaucracy numbering 4,270 staff, although I must admit to being

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000081"></a>Worryingly&#151;and I venture to say disgracefully&#151;there appear to be no senior probation staff in any of the executive posts at the head of the various departments of the agency. Without their presence, I wonder who is providing professional probation advice to the Secretary of State and his Ministers; to the agency chief executive, who comes from the Prison Service, as does his deputy; and to the hordes of civil servants who have no experience at all of the management of offenders on the ground. The old probation organisations, in which boards were responsible for assisting chief officers, are being superseded by trusts responsible for purchasing probation services, which is an entirely impersonal way of conducting an intensely personal requirement, because probation is all about people&#151;staff, offenders and the public.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000082"></a>All this has been brought about by the Government despite strong opposition during the consultancies that first the Home Office and then the Ministry of Justice conducted. Unfortunately, no notice appears to have been taken during these consultancies of any dissenting view, in favour of pressing ahead with ministerial intention. But the fact that so many announced intentions have either failed or come to nothing should surely alert the Government to the folly of this approach.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000083"></a>It reminds me of the attempt by the Canadians to merge their navy, army and air force into one service during the 1960s, despite pleading and advice from many people who warned that it would weaken individual operational performance if the inevitable compromises were enforced. Within a year, common sense prevailed and the three returned to their separate tasks. Canada, too, has tried to merge its prison and probation services into one correctional service. Inevitably, as practitioners warned would happen, the position of probation has been subordinated to that of prisons, despite their totally different operational purposes, because of their higher profile.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000084"></a>During a lifetime in an operational service&#151;the Army&#151;I was conscious of the importance and value of having a professional head representing the service at the heart of government, who was able to ensure that its needs and best interests received constant attention. I would not feel the same way if I was a member of the probation service today. It has an operational purpose, as the Army does, but it does not have a professional head or even senior and experienced staff ensuring that their experience and expertise are represented at the heart of government. In proceeding like this, the Government give the impression that probation provision is regarded as being solely about the purchase of services. It is not. It is also about the people who deliver those services, who need to be selected, trained, motivated and led. If they are not, the service will die, because operational people who are not properly led become a confused and disorganised rabble.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000085"></a>My first question to the Minister is, therefore, whether the Government intend to show the same good sense that they have done in abandoning Titan prisons by

That begs a second question. Will the Minister explain who is regarded as the professional head today? Who is the professional adviser to Ministers and within &#147;NOMSA&#148;? How does he or she exercise that leadership throughout the probation service, which I presume is still an operational entity that people can join?</p>
<h5><a name="09051462000331"></a>3.10 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09051462000086"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051462000365"></a>Lord Dholakia:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, for this short debate. This is not simply about whether the Government propose to reappoint a director of the National Probation Service, but my arguments focus on why they should. The noble Lord&#146;s argument for the reappointment of a national post of director of probation is a powerful one, for several reasons. Let me spell them out. First, there is a relative lack of probation service experience at senior levels in the National Offender Management Service. I am not surprised; we have tried so many permutations of the probation organisation in the past that it gives an impression of a lack of strategic thinking about the probation service as a whole.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000087"></a>I draw attention to that lack of experience to contrast the situation with that of the strong Prison Service experience amid senior staff at NOMS, its headquarters. Most of the regional directors of NOMS have a Prison Service background. Yet the number of offenders under supervision by the probation service at any one time is much higher than the number of offenders in prison, and all offenders who have served prison sentences of 12 months or more are supervised by the probation service. That shows, in view of the service&#146;s crucial importance to the reduction of reoffending, that there is a strong case for a senior specialist role at national level with a remit to promote high standards in national probation practices.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000088"></a>Secondly, inspections by the probation inspectorate have found variable standards from one probation area to another. Following the move towards probation trusts, similar inconsistency in standards of delivery could persist from one trust area to another. A director of probation post at a senior level in NOMS could provide clear specialist direction and promote consistency and high quality across the country&#146;s probation areas.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000089"></a>Thirdly, the probation service, like other public services, is faced with the need to make spending cuts, and its resources are severely stretched. This makes it even more important to ensure that the service gives priority to the most important areas of work. This will be more likely if a national director of probation sets clear national priorities which directors of offender management can then incorporate into their contracts with probation trusts.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000090"></a>Fourthly, there is considerable variation in probation areas&#146; readiness to enter into partnerships with other organisations, particularly in voluntary agencies. These organisations provide key services in areas such as accommodation, education, employment, addictions, mental health and mentoring, which can make a key difference to the likelihood of reoffending. A national director of probation could set strong national expectations that probation trusts in every area of the  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC472"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC472</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>country should make maximum use of such partnerships to improve the prospects of successful rehabilitation of offenders.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000091"></a>Fifthly, the probation service has had considerable success in ensuring that planning by local authorities&#146; Supporting People commissioning forums takes into account the need for supported accommodation places for offenders. The Government are proposing to remove the ring-fence around Supporting People funding, which means that in future funding for supported housing will have to compete with other priorities for funding in local authority areas. A national director of probation could press the need for offender accommodation in discussions with other government departments and reduce the risk that they will be sidelined or marginalised when the Supporting People ring-fence is removed.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000092"></a>Finally, a director of offender management could be a powerful advocate for the probation service in policy discussions at national level. He or she could represent the service by speaking and arguing on its behalf in discussions with the heads of other national criminal justice agencies, with Ministers and with senior officials in other government departments. In short, a director of probation could both help to ensure high standards in service delivery by probation areas and also ensure that the interests of the service are not overlooked in policy-making at national level.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000093"></a>The Government could continue to justify the resource allocation to the probation service, but the fact remains that the service is stretched beyond its limits in some areas of the country. Those of us who have been involved in the criminal justice system&#151;I declare my interest as the president of the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, Nacro&#151;have seen the decline of the probation service over the past two decades. Staff morale is poor. Napo and the probation service organisations have repeatedly complained about the lack of a clear strategic approach to probation work.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000094"></a>I make a plea to the Minister. The probation service stands between an individual&#146;s path to criminality or a way away from crime. It offers ways and means to deal with offending behaviour. Over the years, irrespective of what the policy-makers tell us, there has been a serious concern that the service itself has been undermined. We need a champion at the highest level to buck this trend. Let us hope that there is no delay in appointing a director of the National Probation Service.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000096"></a>My noble friend Lord Dholakia, whose long and distinguished record in the criminal justice system is justly recognised in his current role as president of Nacro, is entirely right in saying that the probation service stands between an individual&#146;s path to criminality in the case of offenders or a way away from crime. He has clearly and succinctly identified why we need a

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000097"></a>Underlying the debate is the overall question of what happens to ex-offenders as they near the end of their sentence and attempt to re-enter the community. This has two elements: the first is in a way more mundane&#151;the inability of the men and women in the probation system to carry out their responsibilities when the system is so starved of resources so as to come under strain. We know that prison numbers have gone up over the time of this Government&#146;s tenure in office, but we also know that they are projected to go up considerably more, by 96,000 by 2012.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000098"></a>I do not want to distract from the specific issue in hand today, but I just want to point out that, at the same time, cuts are being imposed which have serious implications for the management of ex-offenders. Napo, the trade union and professional association for family court and probation staff, told my colleague in the other place, the Member for Cambridge, that of the 400 trainee probation officers who will have qualified by this autumn, at least 50 per cent would be unable to take up posts or were likely only to be offered temporary placements. This is due to the probation service&#146;s budget cuts for the period 2009-12. We know that it costs some &#163;100,000 to train a probation officer, so on these figures it could result in a cost to the taxpayer in unutilised resources of some &#163;20 million at a time when the need is overwhelming. Napo has provided a detailed list by region of staff numbers where the cuts will fall, and I am extremely happy to provide it to the Minister, should he not have seen it.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000099"></a>I now turn to the bigger picture of bringing down the number of offenders who end up in prison in the first place. We know that the rate has been more or less stable over the past decade&#151;stable at an extremely high rate. We recognise that the amalgamation of the different interfaces into NOMS&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, covered that ground beautifully today&#151;has been less successful than was envisaged at its establishment. For the specifics of flawed IT systems, the lack of strategic leadership and inconsistency of standards, the big unanswered question for society remains: how can we ensure that fewer people go to prison in the first place?</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000100"></a>I hope that noble Lords will allow me to move away from the specific topic of this debate briefly to address that wider question. I want to focus on what works in terms of restorative justice&#151;both in rehabilitating offenders and benefiting victims. The Ministry of Justice&#146;s research, in Professor Joanna Shapland&#146;s fourth and final report, concluded that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000299"></a>&#147;Offenders who participated in restorative justice committed statistically significantly fewer offences (in terms of reconvictions) in the subsequent two years than offenders in the control group ... All groups (summed together) showed a lower cost of convictions versus a control group. Costs of convictions included the costs to potential future victims and criminal justice costs&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000279"></a>It also showed:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000300"></a>&#147;Very high levels of satisfaction with restorative justice ... from almost all victims and offenders throughout all three schemes&#148;.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000101"></a>Although the Government have focused on this issue from the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, we on these Benches are disappointed that their approach has been either piecemeal or inconsistent. We know that record numbers of young people are locked up&#151;nearly 11,000 under-21s at the moment&#151;and it is in this group more than any other that restorative justice works best. I wonder whether the Minister will be able to tell us when the Government will roll out restorative justice schemes across the board in England and Wales.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000102"></a>In concluding, I want to highlight that, even where there is an optimal environment and even where funds are plentiful, the trends are moving in the right direction and reoffending can be prioritised, there will nevertheless be a need for a strategic overview, a need for an operational senior leadership team and a need for a visible figure with the clout to deliver the outcomes that are so badly needed. We hope that the Minister will be able to satisfy the Grand Committee today that he is moving towards that end.</p>

The Committee will be grateful to him on three counts. First, we have a former Chief Inspector of Prisons before us&#151;one who more than anyone knows the difference between the Prison Service and the probation service. They are two completely different animals and they do two completely different things. Secondly, we have before us a former, very senior Army officer who knows just a thing or two about leadership. The lack of leadership that we now see in the probation service formed a major part of his remarks.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000104"></a>Thirdly, I am particularly grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, for reminding us yet again of the failure of the Government to take much notice of any of their so-called consultations. It might be useful for the noble Lord, Lord Bach, to come back here after the end of this debate to attend the fourth debate today, in the name of my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth, to ask Her Majesty&#146;s Government what plans they have to ensure that public consultations by government departments follow best practice. We have become cynical over the past 11 years and have a sneaking feeling that an awful lot of consultations do not follow best practice and, even if they do, the Government do not take much notice of what comes out of them. I offer that advice to the noble Lord if he has any spare time in his diary. The debate begins at 5 o&#146;clock, so he will have time for a sandwich or tea between the end of this debate and the next, and he can then listen to his colleague respond to the debate.</p>

Having offered that little tease to the noble Lord&#151;no doubt he will have other things to do&#151;perhaps I may move to my substantive remarks.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000107"></a>We in this party, both here and, particularly, in another place, have frequently highlighted the failure of management in the NOMS scheme. This failure could have been undone with a separation of authority and accountability in the prison and probation sectors and by the appointment of a new, independent-of-NOMS director of the National Probation Service. There is no clear accountability for the rehabilitation of prisoners and these issues, in particular, have shown the problems caused by reshuffling power in the prison and probation sectors. We have seen three reorganisations of the Prison Service, greatly increased bureaucracy&#151;an issue to which I shall return when I put some questions to the Minister&#151;a lack of strategic leadership and a lack of prison capacity. I was able to put this issue to the noble Lord only yesterday; the prisons are bursting at the seams and the Government do not know what to do. However, we are grateful that they have at least abandoned the Titan prisons, even if they are to be replaced by something not much different, what I refer to as the mini-Titans. We have also seen severe overstretch in the probation service.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000108"></a>In March this year, my honourable friend the shadow Minister for Justice in another place, Edward Garnier, made clear that, in his view:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000301"></a>&#147;Not only has the Government re-organised the Probation Service three times in the last eight years to no obvious public benefit, they have created a cash-eating monster&#148;</p>

<p><a name="09051462000280"></a>I shall come back to that when I ask my questions. He continued:</p>
<ul><a name="09051462000315"></a>&#147;The National Offender Management Service has done nothing but increase unnecessary bureaucracy in Whitehall at vast expense&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000109"></a>I hope the noble Lord is aware of, and familiar with, our policy paper, <I>Prisons with a Purpose</I>. If he is not, I shall make sure that he has a copy of it and he can study it in due course. There we have set out our plans for a rehabilitation revolution. We plan to make the people who run the prisons directly responsible for reducing their prisoners&#146; reoffending, bringing two stages&#151;prisons and probation&#151;together and opening up the market in offender management to the volunteer and private sectors. <I>Prisons with a Purpose</I> states that, instead of drawing together prisons and probation, the Government created in NOMS an inflated bureaucratic monster that sat above the Prison and Probation Services and did little to facilitate co-ordination. It sucked resources to the order of &#163;1.5 billion a year&#151;more than the entire budget of the National Probation Service&#151;from those available for offender management.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000110"></a>I come now to the three specific questions that I want to put to the noble Lord. I hope that he will take some care in replying and I hope that he will reply today, rather than in writing. First, would the noble Lord agree that the introduction of NOMS, at the cost of the independence of the National Probation Service, has been flawed; that the bureaucratic drawing together of the prison and probation services has sucked in resources and cost something over &#163;1.5 billion a year;  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC476"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC476</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and that there has been no discernible lowering of crime as a result? I would be very grateful for some acknowledgement of that &#163;1.5 billion a year from the Government.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000111"></a>Secondly, would the Minister accept that depriving the National Probation Service of a director to act as a figurehead of accountability, implement changes and be responsible for advising the Secretary of State based on first-hand experience of the probation service, has severely reduced this country&#146;s capability to deal with the rehabilitation of offenders? Thirdly, I would also be grateful for a direct reply, specifically, to this question. The headquarters of NOMS alone cost, we are advised, something like &#163;1.5 billion. That could be enough to fund another 7,000 prison places. It is more than 50 times the amount spent, for example, on drug rehabilitation in prison each year. Not only is that cost &#163;1 billion, but we have now seen that some &#163;900 million is being cut from the Ministry of Justice budget. Does the noble Lord believe that that money could have been better spent, especially under a system of individual accountability for the National Probation Service and the prison system?</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000112"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will be able to provide answers to those questions and I very much hope that he can provide them today. If he cannot, no doubt he will tell me that he will write to me, but they are questions that deserve a public response, rather than a response by letter.</p>
<h5><a name="09051462000334"></a>3.32 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09051462000113"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09051462000370"></a>Lord Bach:</b> In my turn, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham for giving us the opportunity to debate the new management structure of the National Offender Management Service. Given the impact that these changes will have on both prisons and probation, it is absolutely right that the House should be kept fully informed of their purpose and nature. I will set out some of the backdrop to this debate. Frankly, there has been major investment in the probation service. Since 1997 the probation resource budget has increased by nearly 70 per cent. In real terms, that means 7,000 more probation staff than in 1997. The probation service now receives &#163;900 million of taxpayers&#146; money each year. Of course, it is essential that that money is put to good use.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000114"></a>There is significant scope for savings in the probation service, particularly by reducing unnecessary management layers, streamlining changes and cutting bureaucracy. That potential for saving has been verified externally. Too much of a probation officer&#146;s time is spent in front of a computer. It is not acceptable that probation officers should spend only a quarter of their time working with offenders. We need to be sure that the taxpayers&#146; money that we spend on the probation service is spent on managing offenders; and that resources are targeted on the highest-risk offenders and those offenders who are most likely to reoffend. Of course, we have set challenging targets for probation areas that want to become trusts.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000115"></a>I was asked about finances. In 2009-10, probation is required to make savings of &#163;20 million out of a budget of &#163;914 million, which is 2.2 per cent. Current provisional figures show that probation areas under-spent  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC477"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC477</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by at least &#163;17 million in 2008-09. That may demonstrate that the savings, which we need to make because of the overall cut in the budget of the Ministry of Justice, are completely realistic. I remind the Committee that there was a one-off payment by the Government of &#163;40 million to the probation service in the last financial year. I set that on the record because, although we have heard some very expert speeches today in this important debate, none of those facts has been put forward until now.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000116"></a>In April 2008, the Government created the new delivery agency, NOMS, bringing together the probation and prison services. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, as early as February 2008 was asking questions of my predecessor, my noble friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. The noble Lord&#146;s typically direct question was,</p>
<ul><a name="09051462000316"></a>&#147;what is the National Offender Management Service&#151;what does it do and what is it there to do?&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="09051462000281"></a>My noble friend&#146;s answer was that NOMS,</p>
<ul><a name="09051462000317"></a>&#147;is there to assist and ensure operational integration&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 5/2/09; cols. 951-52.]</ul>
<p><a name="09051462000282"></a>Today our discussion can go slightly wider than just that definition.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000117"></a>NOMS is not a merger of the probation and prison services. Both will remain as individual delivery services, with their own different governance and employment structures. Prison staff are civil servants and probation staff are employed by boards and trusts. NOMS restructuring is not a prison take-over of the probation service. The new regional structures, which we will introduce this summer, will see real responsibility and accountability flow through regional directors of offender management down to the front line. NOMS restructuring is not a move towards central control. The prison and probation services are, and will remain, services rooted in local decision making and accountability.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000118"></a>I want to be clear about what NOMS is. The creation of the agency is about co-ordinating offender management at a regional level for offenders in custody, or in the community, or in between. With the prison and probation services under the oversight of the same agency we can ensure that no more offenders fall between the cracks between prison and probation. Both services, as well as other organisations, must work together seamlessly if we expect to manage offenders effectively. It is about end-to-end offender management. If we do not do that, the excellent work done by front-line staff in prisons and on probation will easily be thrown away. There cannot be a simple handover of responsibility from one organisation to the other at the prison gate. Offender management must be both continuous and coherent if it is to be constructive.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000119"></a>Perhaps the most important aspect of the restructuring is the appointment of 10 directors of offender management&#151;DOMs, as they are called. After an extensive recruitment process, a DOM has been appointed for each of the nine regions in England and one in Wales from 1 April this year. Operating at director level, these individuals are responsible for performance in their areas, tying together the offender management work of all delivery agencies, probation, public and private sector prisons, and the voluntary sector. They are also accountable for integrating service provision  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC478"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC478</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>locally across these providers and with others such as local authorities. By integrating previous regional structures and devolving responsibility from the centre, the new director of offender management structure will allow NOMS to save &#163;10 million this year.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000120"></a>The DOMs will each answer to the NOMS chief operating officer, a role to which I shall return shortly, and ultimately to Ministers. Collectively, all 10 DOMs will become the key body influencing operational strategy. With real power in terms of spending decisions and operational management, they will also be expected to build effective partnerships with local and regional stakeholders in public and other bodies. There is no question of a prison service take-over in the implementation of this model. The DOMs are from a wide range of backgrounds with extensive experience in all aspects of offender management. Probation will of course be at the heart of this delivery model. Roger Hill, a name known to noble Lords here, previously director of probation, was the logical choice for the first DOM post in the south-east, the largest region in the country.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000121"></a>The decision to devolve significant powers in offender management to a regional level has inevitably required a review of management functions at a national level. There are no longer distinct prisons and probation headquarters functions. This work is now performed by staff directly employed by the NOMS agency. Although, in many cases, the same people will be doing the same work, albeit under a different employer, this restructuring has enabled significant efficiency savings to be made at the centre. While probation areas are required to make savings of 2.2 per cent in 2009-10 and prisons, excluding funding for building capacity, of 3 per cent, the NOMS headquarters function is expected to make a saving of 13 per cent in 2009-10. Many of these savings are possible because of the NOMS restructuring, as headquarters staff seek to avoid duplication and reduce bureaucracy.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000122"></a>At the most senior level, these changes are exemplified by the creation of a new post with operational responsibility for both prisons and probation: the NOMS chief operating officer. From 1 April this year, the chief operating officer has taken responsibility for the previous functions of prisons director of operations and director of the National Probation Service. I remind the Committee that this position was filled following a full external competition, supervised by the Civil Service commissioner, to ensure that the most suitable candidate was selected. The post of chief operating officer is much more than a simple amalgamation of senior posts in order to achieve efficiencies. His function is to ensure that the DOMs are delivering and to hold them accountable if they are not. As I have tried to make clear, the DOMS will now undertake much of the work at a regional level that was previously conducted nationally by either the director of the National Probation Service or the director of operations for the Prison Service.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000123"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, that&#151;as I think he knows full well&#151;there is no intention to reappoint another director of the National Probation Service, precisely as there is no intention to reappoint another director of operations for the Prison Service.  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC479"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC479</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>However, I assure him that oversight of the operational management of these two services has in no way been diminished. Rather, the additional oversight and scrutiny that the DOMs will provide constitutes a significant improvement in this respect. By contrast, the chief operating officer is responsible for representing operational management on the NOMS management board.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000124"></a>There can be no suggestion that the excellent work performed by staff in prisons, probation and headquarters is undervalued by us. We are under a duty always to seek improvements where they can be made. In these difficult times, the duty of public bodies to ensure that the taxpayer is receiving the best possible value for money assumes even greater importance. This requirement goes hand in hand with the need to focus resources on where they are most needed&#151;that is, on the everyday management of offenders, whether they are in custody, in the community or in that world in between. Only by prioritising our efforts in this area can we hope to achieve our ultimate aim which is, of course, that of protecting the public.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000125"></a>The changes that I have outlined will have a dramatic impact on the front-line delivery of offender management, making it both more effective and efficient. There will be more co-operation between organisations and less bureaucracy; more regional direction and fewer national directives; and better ways of working, rather than a perpetuation of some of the mistakes of the past. While change is difficult and always controversial, we will not shy away from implementing this restructuring, given the potential benefits it will bring to the management of offenders across England and Wales.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000126"></a>Noble Lords made some very interesting speeches and I am grateful to them for their contributions. The noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, talked about restorative justice. We agree that it can be a particularly useful way for victims to receive reparation from offenders and we are committed to encouraging its use. She will know that its role is emphasised in the recently published Green Paper on <I>Engaging </I><I>C</I><I>ommunities in </I><I>C</I><I>riminal </I><I>J</I><I>ustice</I>. The Government have already issued guidance on restorative justice for local areas and we are in the process of developing a victim-focused strategy to highlight best practice in victim engagement. I know that that is a topic that we will come back to on future occasions.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000127"></a>I was asked to deal with three questions from the noble Lord, Lord Henley. I can only say that I am delighted that the Official Opposition have a policy on this topic. It is certainly the exception that proves the rule. We look forward to seeing policy initiatives telling us what they might do if they are lucky enough ever to be back in government in other areas in this field. But I think that everyone will want to know exactly what they intend to do about the structure that we are creating here if and when they were to return to office. I do not ask the noble Lord to tell us now, but it is something for him to think about and tell us in due course.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000128"></a>He asked three questions. I cannot answer one today. I will have to write to him on his figure of &#163;1.5 billion for the setting up of the new system. I know that that is not what he wanted me to do, but I   


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC480"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC480</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will have to do that. As far as the headquarters costs of &#163;1 billion, the figure of &#163;1.012 billion for NOMS administration costs in 2006-07&#151;I think that that was what he was referring to&#151;in the NOMS business plan does not relate simply to funding the NOMS headquarters staff. Indeed, the vast majority of the figure relates to funding for major front-line programmes, which include private-sector prisons, electronic monitoring, prisoner escort contracts, the administration of the Parole Board, the prison and probation ombudsmen, Her Majesty's inspectorates of prisons and probation, dedicated funding for capacity building, administration of the shared service centre, providing human resources and financed support to prisons and central payments of IT costs for the entire organisation.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000129"></a>I am afraid that his middle question is one that has escaped me. If he would like to put it to me again, I may be able to answer it before I have to sit down. Otherwise, I will see what it was in <I>Hansard</I> and write to him. Before I sit down, I again thank the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, for starting this debate. It is one that we will continue. While there are differences of opinion, I hope that all noble Lords accept that the Government as well as all others&#151;</p>

Who is responsible for the leadership and professional development of the staff of the probation service? It is all very well having an operational director responsible for DOMs, responsible for the oversight of all this happening and the money and so forth. The Minister has given me that, but he has not concentrated on the staff of the probation service. He told us that they remain as a separate entity but also that they no longer have a director. To whom do they look as their professional leader and to whom do Ministers look for advice about what is going on in the service as a whole? The Minister mentioned the 10 DOMs, who all have these wonderful characteristics. How many of those DOMs come from within either the prison or the probation service?</p>

<p><a name="09051462000131"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051462000372"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I am sorry that I did not answer the noble Lord's question before, but the professional head is Michael Spurr, who is the chief operating officer I was talking about. He was recently appointed and supported by the DOMs themselves. As I already said, he was appointed following full independent competition. The senior operational probation staff work directly to the Michael Spurr. Under each of the DOMs, there is a senior probation officer alongside a senior Prison Service officer. I have already said that the DOMs themselves have a lot of experience in a number of different fields. I am not sure that it is not a bit over-simple to look at the background of each individual DOM and say, &#147;He&#146;s a prison person or a probation person&#148;. These are people of great experience, who will play a vital role in the new system. I have already pointed out how much extra resource this Government have put into the probation service as proof of how important we see it as part of this end-to-end management structure.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000138"></a>Today&#146;s discussion is probably extremely timely; I have a sense that we have reached a stage at which personal transporters have come of age. This was brought home to me in 10 minutes of the BBC&#146;s &#147;Children in Need&#148; appeal this year. There, appearing to watch a performance of &#147;The Office: The Opera&#148;, was Ricky Gervais, coming in on a personal transporter. You could see, with the facility, grace and elegance with which he did this, that it was now part of the national psyche.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000139"></a>I am also well aware that as long ago as 2005 my noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham, responding to discussions in your Lordships&#146; House on personal transporters during the passage of the Road Safety Act, said that,</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC482"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC482</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="09051462000318"></a>&#147;the machines can be extremely useful for law enforcement&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 26/10/05; col. 1275.]</ul>
<p><a name="09051462000283"></a>That was certainly the perspective with which I have initially approached this issue. I declare an interest as a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority and chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Policing.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000140"></a>Certainly, there is now considerable evidence around the world of substantial use by the police service of personal transporters. The documented benefits include helping to cut response times, assistance in community engagement, vehicles serving as an ice-breaker and so on. Numerous UK police forces have indicated that they would be interested in using the personal transporter, and there have been letters of support from a number of parts of the country.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000141"></a>I am told that Segway personal transporters are used by more than 1,000 police, law enforcement and security agencies worldwide, and the benefits to officer and community safety are universally perceived. In the United States, the Segway personal transporter is classified as a special purpose vehicle on the approved equipment list in the homeland security grant Act. Anyone who has followed attempts by organisations to get their product on that list will know that it requires a high degree of testing and of satisfying people of the safety involved.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000142"></a>I have seen correspondence from the commander of Sutton borough police in London, part of the Metropolitan Police, who examined in considerable detail the possible use that the police might make of personal transporters in their regular work. There was a case study to look at the matter and the police were keen to use the transporter in their own context. They quoted a community police officer in Albuquerque&#151;you may say that there is not a great similarity between Albuquerque and Sutton, but they nevertheless felt that what was said by him was pertinent to what they saw as an important use in their area&#151;about how the use of personal transporters could be easily integrated in the daily patrols of officers. Sutton police could see how it would cut down response times in a particular patrol area, and it was clear that it would facilitate community engagement because the police officer would be very visible and, as he was not in a car and perhaps not moving quickly, people could converse with him. Also, the novelty of the personal transporter might act as an ice-breaker for conversations. Sutton police saw it as an opportunity to improve relations between the public and the police, while delivering a better service more efficiently.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000143"></a>That is why I initially became interested and involved in the issue. It is clear that there could be other specialist uses of the personal transporter that would greatly assist the public service. I have also seen correspondence from the then director of environmental services at the London Borough of Bromley, who was also keen to examine the use of Segway personal transporters as part of the local council&#146;s sustainable transport strategy. It used one for about a year&#151;I do not know whether it still does&#151;and it could see huge advantages in the way in which it could raise awareness for local council policies. There are many practical applications of the machine that it would like to pursue. It commented that the Segway personal transporter had been used successfully by police forces,  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC483"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC483</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>airport staff and postal workers elsewhere. The London Borough of Bromley made the case to take this further by testing its use, initially, with park rangers within the council service and street service engineers. Both services typically involve numerous trips over short distances which are currently undertaken by car or van. The council&#146;s aim would be to undertake the majority of those trips by personal transporter, thereby reducing the impact of those services on the environment and the community.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000144"></a>If the trials were successful, Bromley then wanted to extend use of the Segway to other council services and to include it in a potential project focusing on mobility management in the town centre. Council officers from a variety of departments have seen the viability of using such personal transporters for existing transportation needs, and all the concerns that might have been expressed internally about practicality and safety were overcome as they examined this in some detail. That is an example of the possible use that might exist.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000145"></a>I noticed recently that the London Borough of Westminster&#151;which, as many noble Lords will be aware, has some of the most assertive and aggressive parking attendants in the country&#151;has put its parking attendants on mopeds, and they are zipping up and down to make sure whether people have paid the necessary fees. Here, again, the use of a personal transporter would be more environmentally suitable and provide them with the facilities they need.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000146"></a>The British Airports Authority at Heathrow provides another example of specialist use. Its five-man team of facilities inspectors use personal transporters in their daily inspection patrols around the building. It reports benefits in covering greater distance in less time and being able to respond to call-outs more swiftly. It also allows for more frequent inspections of passenger-sensitive equipment that is known to be unreliable. As far as it is concerned, the trial, which was entirely on its own private premises, was very successful and it did not want to give it up at the end of the trial period.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000147"></a>The British Airports Authority saw a number of strengths: quick response times to incidents and faults; virtually zero maintenance; simple to use, only 10-minutes training; large distances covered quickly; highly manoeuvrable; zero emissions and so on. It could see huge possibilities for it. BAA summarised the business benefits&#151;which would apply not only to Heathrow but to many local authority services&#151;as being the ability to patrol greater distances in less time, thus reducing response times and increasing the frequency with which it was able to respond.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000148"></a>There are clearly a number of specialist uses to which this could be put. It is quite clear that a much wider use of personal transporters is possible and I hope my noble friend the Minister will respond to those points in the course of his reply. Obviously this would facilitate a degree of modal shift. It would meet environmental concerns in that it would reduce emissions, and there would be huge benefits in terms of mobility for many people. So there is a case for wider use.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000149"></a>No doubt my noble friend has been briefed by his department on the possible problems and objections that there might be, but I hope that he will consider, as  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC484"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC484</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a result of the discussions that we have here today, the possibility of facilitating a number of trials. He has the legal authority to do so. Section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 makes quite clear that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000302"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may by order authorise, subject to such restrictions and conditions as may be specified by or under the order, the use on roads ... of special motor vehicles or trailers, or special types of motor vehicles or trailers, which are constructed either for special purposes or for tests&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09051462000284"></a>and, indeed, vehicles and trailers which are used overseas. So the legal powers are there.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000150"></a>Further, this would enable the Government to demonstrate their commitment to these issues. A Canadian study in 2006 reported a substantial modal shift. This was not about cyclists converting to personal transporters or pedestrians moving towards them; this was about people giving up their cars for short journeys to travel by personal transporter. So, in delivering the Government&#146;s objectives on modal shift, there is a very strong case.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000151"></a>I hope my noble friend, in responding to the debate, will take the opportunity to tell your Lordships that it will be possible to engage in some wide-ranging trials, either specifically in respect of the emergency services or local government, or, ideally, by designating an area where Segway personal transporters are available for general use.</p>

His comprehensive and informative contribution has set the scene for this debate. I look forward to hearing the answers to the questions which he has posed to the Minister and I shall put a few of my own.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000153"></a>I am a firm supporter of Segways and have owned a machine for three years. They are a fun and eco-friendly way to get around but they are not toys. They need to be taken seriously and I hope to explain why. They have been around for at least seven years and are now street-legal in more than 10 European countries as well as in a number of states in America and Canada. They have a truly global reach with 350 Segway authorised retail points in 66 countries and they are used with enthusiasm, as the noble Lord, Lord Harris, has told us, by around 1,000 police departments and security agencies around the world.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000154"></a>About three years ago when I was in America, I spoke to a member of the Kentucky police who patrols on one. He told me how good they were in street-market situations as well as for normal patrolling because it was possible to move around discreetly and silently and to see over the heads of the crowds without appearing to be too threatening or intimidating. He even told me that he had been able to make an arrest when thieves had tried to get away in a car, something which he said would certainly not have been possible if he had been on foot, although I am not sure that I can visualise that happening. I was even told that the chief of police was so impressed with them that he was doubling the number of machines in Kentucky.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000155"></a>In this country, despite having the support of the Metropolitan Police, the forces of Sutton and Brent and the O2 Arena police force among others, they  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC485"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC485</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have still not received formal approval from the DfT. So it seems that, because of this deafening silence, we in this country are falling seriously behind the curve. I hope that everything that the Minister hears today will convince him that these machines will not go away. This country is beginning to look increasingly isolated and out of touch. Despite widespread support for these machines, it is my understanding that ACPO is saying that it is reluctant to carry out an official trial until they are made street legal. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong but, if I am right, then we are in the midst of the most ridiculous Catch-22 situation which we have to resolve.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000156"></a>As I have already said, I am the owner of a Segway. I use it on private land around my home in Gloucestershire and I can assure the Committee that when I am out exercising our dog, it puts a wide smile on both our faces. I have reached the age when arthritic knees can take the fun out of a round of golf and so I also use it on golf courses. It always creates interest and even some amusement. Almost invariably I am asked by other golfers to let them have a go.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000157"></a>Some eight months ago, on 9 September last year, I was part of the parliamentary delegation led by Lembit Opik when about 12 of us set off from this House on Segways to deliver a petition to the Ministry of Transport in Marsham Street. Shortly after that, and because I still had the loan of the machine I had used for that purpose, I decided to carry out some practical research of my own. I wanted to see whether a Segway is really a viable commuting vehicle which did everything it said on the tin. We have a flat near Shepherd&#146;s Bush, so I decided to put it to the test on a journey to and from your Lordships' House. I donned a high-visibility jacket, wore a helmet and even had a flashing red light on my head, and set off. It was one of the easiest and most enjoyable journeys I have ever undertaken. I certainly had a novel view of London as I went through the parks en route, using the cycle ways. I received no antagonism whatever, only interest in what it could do. I completed the journey in a little under the time it takes me to drive. I have done this journey only once but the experience was enough to convince me that the Segway is entirely fit for purpose.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000158"></a>These machines tick many boxes for the urban environment. They are electric, with a range of about 24 miles from one charge; they are pollution-free at the point of use; they are practically silent in operation; and they can efficiently transport one person at a speed of 12.5 miles per hour while taking up a footprint hardly bigger than the person riding it. Therefore, if we are serious about reducing our carbon emissions&#151;a point alluded to by the noble Lord, Lord Harris&#151;and we all know what a long way we have to go if we are to meet our 2020 target, never mind the 80 per cent reduction by 2050&#151;then these machines should be approved immediately. At the very least, let us start conducting official trials.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000159"></a>There are now some very powerful electric bicycles on the market. They are perfectly legal and, as far as I know, the Department for Transport has no complaints about them. So I ask the Minister: why cannot Segways  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC486"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC486</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be grouped together with them, provided that some initial rider training is given? Would that not provide a quick and simple solution?</p>

<a name="90514-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000160"></a>There are people out there who are desperate to start up businesses selling or hiring these machines. In these difficult times, surely new business start-ups should be wholly encouraged. About six weeks ago, I was written to by a Mr Chris Hough from Liverpool. He asked me whether there had been any further developments to legalise Segways. He went on to say that he wants to set up a Segway tours company in Liverpool and make it a top tourist attraction. I have looked at his website and this is what he has to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000303"></a>&#147;I think it&#146;ll be awesome. Not only have I been on two Segway tours myself (Paris and San Francisco), but the City of Liverpool is crying out for such an attraction. With historic buildings, a beautiful waterfront, plans for a new canal and the Beatles experience (of course) there is nowhere more suited to the Segway&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000285"></a>I entirely agree with that statement. Is that not a great idea and very appropriate for our latest city of culture, as well as being a fine example of private enterprise at work? When he replies, I ask&#151;in fact, I plead with&#151;the Minister to give me some encouraging news so that I can write back positively to Mr Hough.</p>

I did not expect to be here in time. The only interest that I have to declare in this matter is that I have ridden a Segway. I thought that it was absolutely brilliant and terribly easy to master. To echo a point that has just been made, when I was in Holland the other day to speak at the Black Hat computer hacking conference, about 50 yards from the hotel was a shop selling Segways, including a cross-country one. That was the one that I really wanted because I am married to a farmer.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000162"></a>The problem is the application of the precautionary principle. I think it is the fear of the unknown, which stifles and is the enemy of progress, that we are facing here. To me, the Segway is just an electric bicycle but with the wheels side by side instead of in tandem. Therefore, what, generically, is the difference? I am not sure why it does not qualify as a bicycle. Perhaps a bicycle has to be constructed with the wheels in tandem, but I have no idea. The great advantage of the Segway is that it has a smaller footprint when parked. Due to the handlebars and length of a bicycle, you could park several Segways&#151;probably four&#151;in the space taken up by two bicycles. There is therefore great potential there.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000163"></a>My feeling about Segways is that we should not over-regulate. We have plenty of laws concerning safety and dangerous behaviour, so we should prosecute people if they ride them dangerously without going overboard about it, as would be the case with any other vehicle, such as a bicycle&#151;or, for that matter, a horse.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000164"></a>My final point is that the Segway ticks all the boxes on the green agenda, as mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool. Mass transport can get you to the hub. You can travel at high speed from London to Edinburgh or wherever, but it is the last mile that is the problem, and perhaps the Segway could be the answer  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC487"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC487</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to that. You could travel with it if there was nowhere to hire one cheaply at your destination. The Segway could be the answer to integrating transport so that the public do not always have to use their cars. You will never remove from people who have cars the desire to be independent, but perhaps the Segway could be integrated into the rest of our public transport network. I shall now leave noble Lords to segue into the personal transport of the future.</p>
<h5><a name="09051462000339"></a>4.25 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09051462000165"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051462000381"></a>Viscount Falkland:</b> We are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, and congratulate him on introducing the debate. It is many years&#151;I think the noble Earl said seven&#151;since those of us in this place with an interest were made aware of the Segway. All of us who tried it, as has been expressed this afternoon, were impressed. However, we were quickly made aware that the wider interest, crucially depending upon the Department for Transport, was becoming a slow business. One is tempted to think that this issue was so troubling to the department that it decided to keep its head down and hope that it went away.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000166"></a>Well, of course, it is not going away. The noble Lord, Lord Harris, said that this was a timely debate. Well, of course it is, because electrical vehicles for personal use are growing in popularity. Indeed, in the middle spread of the <I>Evening Standard</I> today, two vehicles are praised and reviewed, the first by the art correspondent, Mr Brian Sewell, who has an electrically powered smart car. He praises it handsomely, which is quite unusual for Brian Sewell in his own field.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000167"></a>Then the well known actress Imogen Stubbs tells us that&#151;having for many years propelled herself around with the freedom that I enjoy on two wheels, on a scooter&#151;she has now discovered a machine called the &#147;power bike&#148;, which interests me a great deal. Its use as a bicycle can be supplemented by the new technology of a lithium battery which enables leg power to be supplemented by electric power. She therefore has all the advantages that I do not have due to Westminster Council. Every time I mention Westminster Council I get angry, so I will not do it again, but I have to pay to park my motorcycle in spaces and I cannot find any. The whole thing is becoming absolutely ludicrous. There, again, the Department for Transport should have dealt with the anti-motorbike business many years ago and seen that the cycle lobby against motorcycles is completely pointless with absolutely no substance to it at all, as will shortly be proved. When the mayor comes to review his giving of the bus lanes to motorcycles, he will find that there is no problem at all. That may jog the memory of the Department for Transport, which has been so slow to recognise it.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000168"></a>Most of the advantages of the Segway have already been mentioned. I notice that it is pronounced somewhat differently by the two Earls who have spoken. I await to hear how the third Earl will pronounce it; we are very heavy on Earls this afternoon. Personally, I will go for the first syllable rhyming with &#147;leg&#148;. The noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, who has great knowledge of this machine, prefers the first syllable to rhyme with &#147;hedge&#148;. I do not know which is correct, but I will go for the first.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000169"></a>The Segway is an amazing machine. I do not know anybody, apart from the golf professional at my golf club, who has had any difficulty with it at all. It takes about 30 seconds to get used to it. You relax after that and realise that you really think the thing along, rather than grip it with white knuckles while frightened of it. The last President of the United States is the only person who had difficulty with it, but that could be heartening to people.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000170"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, has used a Segway for some time both on firm surfaces and on golf courses, where you need a different kind of traction&#151;you need different tyres to deal with the uneven ground. He has found it entirely satisfactory in both those applications. I tried to persuade my golf club to use it and said that I was coming up with the Segway salesman, who would be pleased to do a demonstration. Immediately, my wife got very alarmed messages from members of the committee, saying in frightened tones that personal golf transport was not allowed on this golf course. Luckily, golf courses do not all share that view. At the Royal and Ancient at St Andrews and at the Belfry&#151;two of the leading golf clubs&#151;it is now in increasing use. There are difficulties in changing the routines of speed of play, and so on; nevertheless, the machine has proved to be safe, capable of carrying equipment such as clubs when adapted and it is proving widely popular.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000171"></a>In most other countries in Europe and certainly in the United States, I would not have to be saying all this because it is already known. After all, this machine has been around for seven years, and in most countries it is now applied widely. A thousand police forces or enforcement agencies of some kind have used it, as the noble Lord, Lord Harris, said. I asked a policeman at the gates what he thought about Segway and he said, &#147;What&#146;s Segway?&#148; I told him what it was and said that if he went round the corner he might find a man willing to demonstrate it. I am glad that he did not because the man was not there because the machine did not arrive, as was intended. He asked me if the police would not look rather ridiculous in inner-city centres and I said, &#147;To the contrary&#148;. I have spoken to police forces in which it has been tried and they said that in inner-city centres the police have been delighted with it, not only because it gives them ease of movement with economy but because it has encouraged the interest of people with whom they normally have little contact&#151;that is, those who may cause trouble that they may have to deal with later on. That has increased the community spirit in those areas, so it has a benefit in that area, on the evidence that we have.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000172"></a>That is my anecdote, but I should not have to give these anecdotes; the Department for Transport should a long time ago have set up an inquiry into this vehicle, as it should with every new vehicle that could be used on the roads and elsewhere, to see whether it was suitable and how the law would accommodate it. As I understand it, if I go out on a Segway&#151;certainly in the Metropolitan Police area&#151;I shall not be stopped by a policeman because they have been told by the Crown Prosecution Service that they have no chance of getting a conviction, so just to leave them alone. They would have great difficulty in proving that it is any different in its effect on the population from an electric cycle.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000173"></a>The applications of the Segway are wide and various and have been mentioned by noble Lords who have spoken. It can be used for postal delivery, for example. I cannot think of a better way for people to deliver post. It is quiet, efficient and cheap and has every possibility of adaptation for carrying parcels and letters. As for police work, I do not know what the cost of fuel is or the cost of pollution in this country from police vehicles going around and performing their normal duties, but if police forces took a fraction of their members and put them on this machine, the cost to the taxpayer would be considerably reduced.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000174"></a>As noble Lords were talking about applications, I thought, what about the Olympic Games? There is a lot of talk about bicycles going to the Olympic Games. Time goes more quickly than one expects and they will be upon us before we know it. I do not see any possibility of people coming to this country to see the Olympic Games finding a cycle-friendly city, despite a policy announced by the Government, which is a total mess. I cycle as well as motorcycle and it is ludicrous. On Sundays you cannot cycle at all in London, because all the cycle paths are blocked with parked cars and vans. People who come and expect a cycle-friendly city will have a sad experience. But if we used the Segway and found it to be operative in that area, it would go a long way to solving many of the problems that are likely to occur.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000175"></a>I wrote down &#147;gardens, garden centres and parks&#148;. There are all kinds of applications for this thing, but we will never know until the Department for Transport actually gets itself together and institutes a proper examination of the product and its application. When will the department do that? Why does it not do that?</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000176"></a>I thought that my golf club was negative. It is a British thing: if something new arrives that does not tick all the boxes, people go to ground and hope that nobody will bother them too much about it. That certainly happened at my golf club and probably the Department for Transport is more conservative and nervous about this than my golf club. I hope that the Minister can give us some cheer on this subject, because it is here, it is good, it is high quality and cheap to run. It is likely to get cheaper in unit costs as people buy more of them. Its accident profile is negligible in so far as one can tell. If the Minister will institute trials, we will find out exactly what the risks are. We cannot just sit back, while the rest of the world uses a wonderful machine like this, and do nothing. For that reason, I emphasise my support for the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Harris.</p>

We have debated it before, but experience shows that it is rarely enough to raise the matter but once. I have also noted that we have a predominance of noble Earls in this debate. Perhaps we could have a word with Her Majesty and ask her to elevate the noble Viscount, and maybe also think about the noble Lord, Lord Harris.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Harris, talked about police using Segways in a public place. Will the Minister tell us how far from the kerb a footpath extends? A pedestrianised precinct is a long way from the kerb, but is it still a pavement or a footpath? Do the restrictions of the Highways Act still apply in the middle of a pedestrianised precinct?</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000180"></a>My noble friend Lord Liverpool made much of the benefits of a Segway and how it is used in the United States. My noble friend gave us a good indication of the potential for these machines. Indeed, we have used them together at various events. As explained by the noble Lord, Lord Harris, the Segway is legal neither on the road nor on the pavement or footpath. The only vehicle allowed on the footpath is an invalid carriage. That is an out-of-date term, because it gives the impression of some ugly black contraption rather than the modern snazzy machines that several noble Lords use in your Lordships' House and elsewhere.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000181"></a>One cannot help wondering whether the department finds this legislative hurdle convenient, because it means that the Government need do nothing. Several noble Lords made more or less the same observation. Will the Minister tell the House the view of disability groups regarding the use of Segways on the pavement or footpath? Has his department received any representation from them?</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000182"></a>It is easy to think that the Segway is some peculiar toy that requires considerable skill to ride. It is not, as observed by my noble friend Lord Liverpool. The Segway uses extremely clever technology, but it is only by riding one that it is possible to understand just how clever it is. I first tried one at the Ministry of Defence DVD show many years ago, but at the time I was amazed. Some time ago, I arranged an opportunity for Peers to ride a Segway in your Lordships&#146; car park. Many did and were surprised at how easy it was. Has the Minister himself or, more importantly, his colleague Mr Jim Fitzpatrick, who has ministerial responsibility for these matters, actually ridden a Segway?</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000183"></a>The essence of the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Harris, was to discover whether the Government were initiating a UK trial of some sort. The problem is that I suspect that it would be necessary to amend primary legislation, as the Highways Act makes it quite clear that only invalid carriages can be used on the footpath or pavement. Not even bicycles can be ridden on the footpath or pavement. Is there any way round this? We know that the Segway does not meet legal requirements for a road vehicle and the noble Lord, Lord Harris, touched on Section 44 of the Road Traffic Act which allows the Minister to relax the construction and use regulations. I have had a lot of involvement with Section 44, because that deals primarily with abnormal loads.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000184"></a>There is also a similar provision in respect of the type approval regulations that allows the Minister to relax those, so the construction and use and type

But he might not be able to relax vehicle registration requirements if they are a problem. The real crunch question for the Minister is, if he is minded to authorise a trial, does he have the necessary order-making powers or would some primary legislation be required?</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000185"></a>We are now entering the closing stages of this Parliament where only a limited range of new primary legislation will be introduced and passed that has not already been announced. The Minister will be able to use his existing powers to exercise ministerial control of our railway system and many noble Lords in this Committee and the wider House admire his work in that area. However, I think that we will have to wait until the start of the new Parliament before we see anything new happening with this or any other technology.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000187"></a>The noble Earl asks whether I have ever used a Segway and I have to confess that I have not. Indeed, my noble friend mentioned to me before the debate that he had not either. As a result of this debate, we must both jointly undertake to repair that omission forthwith. I thought that I took the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, to be offering a trial. If he is indeed offering another trial, we will be glad to participate.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000188"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09051462000386"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> I am sure that that can easily be arranged.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000189"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09051462000387"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> I take the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, to be keen to join us as well. I would be glad to experience the Segway at first hand and gain some personal appreciation of its benefits.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000190"></a>My noble friend asked, first, what assessments we have made of the potential benefits of the Segway and, secondly, whether we will support a full road trial. Perhaps I may take the two issues in turn. On the assessments made by the Department for Transport, noble Lords may be aware that this debate follows a meeting with representatives of the All-Party Intelligent Transport Group at the Department for Transport in November last year, and further meetings between officials, Segway promoters and interested Members from another place in January and March this year. The meetings continue a dialogue over some years between Segway promoters and the Department for Transport.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000191"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, said, Segways are permitted on the road and/or dedicated pedestrian cycle paths and tracks in some other countries. However, the way in which they are treated in law elsewhere and  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC492"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC492</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>used&#151;for example, off-road, on the road, on pedestrian footways or in cycle facilities&#151;varies significantly from place to place.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000192"></a>The meeting on 26 March was helpful in clarifying that Segway promoters are now seeking permission in this country to use the machines on cycle facilities and on the road. Previously, they had also wished to include use on pedestrian facilities such as the pedestrian footway beside the road. There is an insuperable legal barrier to that in that no powered vehicles are permitted on footways under the Highways Act 1835, a regulation that goes back almost as far as the premiership of the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, and is still valid as protection for pedestrians.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000193"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, raised the use of footpaths in pedestrian areas. Regulation depends on the relevant traffic regulation order for the particular road in question. However, there would be no problem in private pedestrian precincts for the use of the Segway.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000194"></a>At the 26 March meeting, Segway promoters gave a presentation on Segway use and benefits to officials from my department, who undertook to respond to it. I repeat that commitment today: my officials are analysing the issues and the further information made available to us and seeking further clarification as necessary, and we shall respond soon.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000195"></a>The Government recognise the potential benefits of electric vehicles as a whole&#151; which have been set out by the noble Viscount&#151;in terms of air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. Electric vehicles which comply with our road traffic law requirements benefit from advantageous treatment within the UK taxation system. They are, for example, exempt from annual vehicle excise duty, and electricity is exempt from fuel duty. In addition, the Government announced recently that it would make &#163;250 million available from 2011 for a system of incentives to build the market for electric and plug-in hybrid cars by helping to reduce the purchase price and supporting the deployment of recharging infrastructure.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000196"></a>However, we are of the opinion that Segways, as powered vehicles, do not comply with our road traffic law requirements and may not therefore be used on the public road or on cycle or pedestrian facilities. The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, asked whether Segways could simply be treated as bicycles. Promoters have suggested that they might qualify as electrically assisted pedal cycles, which are not treated in law as powered vehicles. Electrically assisted pedal cycles may use the public road and cycle facilities without registration and insurance. Riders can be as young as 14 and do not require a licence. However, Segways meet neither the UK nor EU definitions of an electrically assisted pedal cycle. The most fundamental point is that both UK and EU law require pedals by means of which the vehicle can be propelled manually, which clearly is not the case with a Segway. British electrically assisted pedal cycle regulations are under review with the aim of closer alignment with those of Europe, but removing the pedal constraint is not, I am afraid, being proposed because the view is taken that the requirements ensure that electric vehicles used on cycle facilities are similar in performance and behaviour to other cycles using the same space.</p>

There are other ways of installing a limiter.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000198"></a>I was more interested in the Minister&#146;s earlier statement about using cycle facilities or footpaths. Although we have said that it is totally impossible under an old law for powered vehicles to use the same facility, we still have what he termed &#147;invalid carriages&#148;&#151;electric buggies&#151;shooting up and down them. Presumably, that is illegal&#151;in which case, why are they not being prosecuted? Alternatively, there is an exemption, which could therefore be extended.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000200"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09051462000390"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> I was simply explaining what our view of the law was at the moment. Of course it would be possible to change the law, but the Committee needs to know what the law is so that we know what obstacles would need to be overcome if the Segway were to be used.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000201"></a>On the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, about invalid carriages, there are specific legal provisions that enable invalid carriages and specific cleaning vehicles to be used on pedestrian facilities.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000202"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0005.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="09051462000391"></a>The Earl of Erroll:</b> It is therefore possible to change the law; it is not inviolable, as the Minister was suggesting earlier.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000203"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09051462000392"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> Parliament is, of course, supreme. As a distinguished legal jurist said, Parliament may do everything except make a man a woman or a woman a man, and even that is not certain. Noble Lords&#146; collective capacity to change the law is not in question. If we are to move in this area, though, we need to be clear what laws need to be changed.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000204"></a>Consequently, it is the department&#146;s view that the Segway may be used in this country only on private land with landowner permission. We are aware that Segways are being used in this manner to some extent; my noble friend Lord Harris, the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, and the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, noted various different contexts in which that was true, ranging from golf courses to airports, from show grounds to warehouses. That offers a considerable range of usage and marketing opportunities.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000205"></a>Segway promoters were invited some time ago to share with my department any information that they had on Segway trials and usage in other countries. We also suggested that they engage with a wide range of other stakeholders, such as Cycling England, Sustrans and Living Streets, and share the results of such discussions. They kindly made available German, Canadian and American reports on Segway trials and usage and a report on a private land trial at Heathrow airport, together with other material&#151;for example, on  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC494"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC494</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>CO2 emissions. As has been noted in the debate, they have also offered trials to noble Lords and Members of another place.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000206"></a>On the CO2 aspects, the material supplied has been considered by officials. The report set out comparisons in CO2 emissions on a per-passenger-kilometre basis between a wide variety of vehicles. However, it did not consider the whole-life carbon impact of the vehicle, which would include its manufacture and disposal. The Government would therefore welcome further views on the carbon issue, taking account of the whole-life CO2 cost of Segways and not simply the per-kilometre usage.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000207"></a>Taking stock, significant changes in the law would be required to enable Segways to be used in the way suggested by promoters. We have yet to be convinced that it would be right to change the law so that this could take place, but we will continue to analyse and consider representations and further evidence, including the evidence made available from international experience. As I have said, we will respond, as we promised to do at the meeting on 26 March, to the latest information that has been made available to us.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90514-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000208"></a>I turn to the issue of a trial. A Segway trial on the public highway, proposed by a member of the Sutton police force, as mentioned by my noble friend Lord Harris, was discussed at a 22 January meeting between Segway promoters, interested Members of another place, a Sutton Police representative and Department for Transport officials. Initially it was thought, as my noble friend observed, that a trial might be authorised simply by an order under Section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. I regret to tell the Committee that our legal advisers found that, although Section 44 could suspend certain requirements of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, it could not disapply the other vital parts of the law that would be required for a trial, including requirements relating to registration and insurance, the use of cycle tracks and use in pedestrian areas.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000209"></a>Another concern was that while some individual police officers were keen, for reasons that have been lucidly set out by Members of the Committee, the Association of Chief Police Officers has formally stated,</p>
<ul><a name="09051462000319"></a>&#147;we are opposed to deregulation of these vehicles&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000210"></a>On this basis, the meeting on 22 January decided against pursuing the suggestion of a trial. We will consider further the issue of a trial or trials but, as I have said, even for a trial on the public highway and cycle tracks, we would need to undertake significant legal work and make changes to the law. This is not something that we could undertake either lightly or soon. Many factors would need to be considered before we could undertake to change the law. They are all part of the wider evaluation that I have referred to, but the additional factor would be finding appropriate legal vehicles. We would need to consider that, too.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000211"></a>I should add that we recently approached ACPO about the specific issue of a Segway trial. ACPO advised us that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000304"></a>&#147;If the Government is minded ... to introduce any trial, that is a matter for them but we would urge caution on safety grounds and potential for misuse if use is deregulated&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC495"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC495</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000212"></a>ACPO added:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000305"></a>&#147;There is no drive from ACPO for Segways to be made available for policing purposes&#148;.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000213"></a>I would encourage noble Lords who wish to take this further to engage not only with my department, but with ACPO and the police to see if they are able to persuade the police, corporately, that there are not significant safety issues at stake in allowing Segways on the public highway and cycle tracks. Taking up my noble friend&#146;s point about the potential benefits for the police, it appears to the department that while some police officers are seized of those potential benefits, the police, corporately, are not so seized.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000214"></a>In conclusion, we remain aware that Segways may legally be used on roads in some other countries, and that they are sometimes employed for policing purposes, as at the Beijing Olympic Games. Nonetheless, because something is permitted in another country, it does not necessarily mean that it should be permitted here. We would not wish to enter into the exacting processes of introducing legislation unless we felt confident that the benefits would outweigh the disbenefits. We need to balance our aims in respect of mobility, road safety, active travel and protecting the environment, directing our resources to the areas where we can achieve the greatest benefits. We will therefore continue to evaluate information on Segway use. We will respond to the representations made to us at the 26 March meeting. I will, of course, draw the attention of my honourable friend Jim Fitzpatrick, the Minister responsible, to the <I>Hansard </I>report of this debate. I know that he would be happy to speak further to my noble friend Lord Harris and other noble Lords if they would like to make further representations to him.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000216"></a>The way in which government consultations are conducted may seem a technical issue but it is actually important to the health of our political system. I have variously written and spoken about the importance of the relationship between Parliament and the public. This afternoon, I am concerned with the relationship between government and the public. How can interested members of the public have an input into policy deliberations by government? Equally importantly, how  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC496"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC496</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can members of the public see what is done with that input? To what extent does it inform government policy-making?</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000217"></a>My starting point is that it is common ground that these are important questions and that government recognise the need for consultation with interested parties when policy is being contemplated and the need for that consultation process to be as fair and transparent as possible. To that end, government provide guidance to departments and other public bodies on how to conduct consultations. The latest Code of Practice on Consultation<I></I>came into effect in November last year. All government departments have signed up to the code, and guidance on running consultations is available from the Better Regulation Executive.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000218"></a>My concern is not with the content of the code or the guidance provided by the Better Regulation Executive but with enforcement and co-ordination. The code of guidance is exactly what it says it is: it provides guidance. Departments are not required to comply with the guidance and, as far as I can see, there is no mechanism in place to monitor, across government, compliance with the code.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000219"></a>There is a public perception of central government as some highly centralised and homogenised institution, with the work of departments being directed from the centre. There is one approach to government that sees it in terms of presidential government. However, another is the baronial model of government, conceptualising government as a range of departments headed by Ministers who, in many respects, resemble medieval barons, with their own courts and little empires. I think this approach is more applicable in this case. Ministers, if they choose, can elect not to conduct a consultation or, if they do, to conduct it other than in accordance with the code.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000220"></a>Let me identify what I see as the problems with the current arrangements. One is the fact that there is no whole-of-government view of consultation. When I put down a Question asking what steps were taken to ensure that departments complied with the code, I was told,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000306"></a>&#147;There are several systems in place to aid compliance with the code of practice on consultation&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/11/08; col. <I>WA 241</I>.]</p>

<p><a name="09051462000286"></a>There is a difference between ensuring compliance and aiding compliance, and the several systems appeared to number two. One was consultation co-ordinators in departments working with policy officials as well as with officials in the Better Regulation Executive. The other was transparency, in that consultation documents cite the criteria of the code and give the contact details of the departmental consultation co-ordinator, and departments are required in the Better Regulation chapter of their annual reports to describe their consultation activity over the year and compliance of their consultation activities with the code. In other words, it is transparent but a form of self-assessment.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000221"></a>My concern about the utility of such transparency is that it does not have much effect on government. It appears there is no one at the centre, be it in the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform or in the Cabinet Office, who reads the reports and co-ordinates the data on consultation. In another  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC497"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC497</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Question last year, I asked how many consultation exercises had been undertaken by government departments since October 2007 and how many of them lasted, or were due to last, for the recommended period of at least 12 weeks. The answer began:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000307"></a>&#147;The Government no longer collate data on this&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/11/08; col. <I>WA 242</I>.]</p>

<p><a name="09051462000287"></a>It then went on to point out that the information is put in the public domain through the departmental annual reports. The material may be put in the public domain, but I am querying what is then done with that material. As far as the Government go, it appears to be the end of a process rather than part of a central process to monitor compliance and ensure that the code is being followed.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000222"></a>By leaving it to individual departments to follow the code, there is the danger of some departments not following it as rigorously as others. Some are innovative, others are not. The guidance provided by the Better Regulation Executive includes a section headed &#147;Reaching beyond the &#145;usual suspects&#146;&#148;. That is extremely important in conducting consultations. However, not all departments are energetic in seeking to consult beyond the usual suspects. When the Judicial Appointments Order 2008 was being considered by the House last October, I noticed that the Ministry of Justice had been assiduous in consulting the bodies that one would expect to be consulted regularly on matters affecting the judiciary. However, the Explanatory Notes recorded:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000308"></a>&#147;The level of public interest in the policy has been minimal&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000288"></a>As I pointed out, this could be because the order had been placed on the departmental website, and that appeared to be the extent of it. There was no attempt to be pro-active in going beyond the usual suspects.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000223"></a>Contrast this with the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, which lives up to its name by making consultation papers available to third parties in machine-readable form, thus enabling different bodies to identify when a consultation is taking place and then disseminate that fact to interested parties.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000224"></a>It is extremely important for the popular legitimacy of government that departments comply with the code. I would stress the need in particular for widespread dissemination of the fact that a consultation is taking place, following the practice of the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills; for the 12-week consultation period to be met, other than in the most exceptional of circumstances; and for departments to be rigorous in collating and making available the results of the consultation, and explaining how those results have fed into the policy deliberations. At the moment, I fear, there is some concern that consultations constitute going through the motions and that the Government have already decided the issues in advance. It is essential that there is monitoring and co-ordination within government in order to ensure that departments comply with the code. I therefore ask the Minister what is being done to ensure compliance&#151;not aid compliance but ensure compliance&#151;with the code of practice and, as part of this, what is being done to monitor performance. As the Answer to one of my Questions suggested, the Government appear to have moved backwards, not forwards, on this.</p>




<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC498"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC498</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000225"></a>A starting point to monitoring consultations is to draw together a list of consultations being undertaken. The Cabinet Office used to have a webpage listing all open consultations being conducted by departments. I was told, in answer to another Question, that it had removed the webpage because the service was not picking up all consultations, the cost of the service had increased and the site was receiving a low number of hits. It would be interesting to know why the system was not picking up all consultations; presumably it was because departments were not supplying the relevant information. However, the Answer to my PQ on the subject went on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000309"></a>&#147;However, the recent review of government consultation practices and policy, which led to a new code of practice on consultation coming into force on 1 November 2008, found that a comprehensive service of live consultations would be welcomed by stakeholders. The Better Regulation Executive in BERR is working with the Directgov team of the Central Office of Information to deliver such a service in the future. This would automatically pick up all consultation exercises published by central government&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/11/08; col. <I>WA 232.</I>]</p>

<p><a name="09051462000289"></a>That would certainly be a major step in the right direction. The Info4local.gov.uk website, run by the Department for Communities and Local Government, is very valuable in identifying consultations, but I am not sure how comprehensive that is. Perhaps the Minister could tell us what progress has been made in creating a comprehensive service of live consultations? If he is the bearer of good news, I shall be delighted, and if the Government are able to move in that direction, it will be a significant step forward. It will not be the end of the process but it will facilitate BERR or the Cabinet Office monitoring compliance with the code and ensuring that consultations take the form they should. That can only be to the benefit of our political system. Poor consultation, or no consultation, can undermine confidence in the process of government. As I say, this is much more than a technical matter; it is extremely important to the legitimacy of the political system.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000226"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09051462000395"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> I am very grateful to my noble friend Lord Norton for introducing this debate. I come at it as a member of the Merits Committee and therefore as a recipient of the outcome of a great many consultations. We regularly look at 30 instruments a week, and one of the very first things that we do is to look at the paragraphs on consultation.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000227"></a>I should like to take as a theme the Cabinet Office paper of 2007, which concerns a consultation about consultation. It is called <I>Effective Consultation</I> and on the front of the paper are the words:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000310"></a>&#147;Asking the right questions, asking the right people, listening to the answers&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000290"></a>As is very common with government documents, they do not help you to decide how to ask the right questions and they do not help with a definition of who might be the right people to ask. As to listening to the answers, I shall come back to that later, but I suppose it is a question of what weight you give the answers.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000228"></a>Therefore, when members of the Merits Committee look at the results of consultations, they are caught up in a series of judgments. They know that it is not  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC499"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC499</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>enough to be assured that guidelines are being followed&#151;indeed, I think that there has been plenty of evidence in recent days that just following the rules will not do&#151;but that you also have to exercise some judgment. That is the difficulty, because in the Civil Service&#151;the servants of the Government of the day&#151;the process is often more important than the outcome in the sense that, if you can say that you have followed the process, then what happens is not necessarily the most important matter.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000229"></a>I suppose that in a democracy we are talking about the people, but in <I>Effective Consultation</I> we come across something called a &#147;stakeholder&#148;, and I know that my noble friend comes across that term too. Does that mean someone who has an assessable interest, and is that a financial interest? What is the assessable interest? We are looking for people&#146;s opinions&#151;perhaps people within institutions or people who are grouped together in free association&#151;but why do we have to call them people who hold a stake? That does not seem to be a very good way of starting if you are looking to make a judgment, and in particular a judgment in relation to the level of consultation that is taking place. If there is consultation on assisted suicide or 42 days&#146; detention, that is at a different level. The ways and means of trying to find out what people think are many and various, and indeed they are employed in many and various ways. Votes may depend on that consultation.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000230"></a>However, it is not like that in the Merits Committee. The committee is in the area of secondary legislation, where the policy is set out in an Explanatory Memorandum and is, in a sense, a given. The questions asked in the consultation concern the implementation of that policy and do not necessarily question the policy itself. Indeed, it is not part of the Merits Committee&#146;s terms of reference to question the policy but only to try to arrive at a recommendation for the House as to whether the instrument will carry out the policy. Then of course there are some technical, low-level consultations, such as about the closure of a street.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000231"></a>Our present system of guidelines and of commenting on consultations does not attempt to give any feel of how significant the consultation was. How likely was it that there would be controversy? How much did the department in question know that there was indeed controversy on the subject? It is carried out in a way which does not give the feel of the questions to which the department would like to have answers; it is carried out in a way in which the questions are set to cover the ground but not to look for trouble. There is some reason to think&#151;I shall give one example&#151;that we should look for why we did not get an answer to a question, or why a question was not raised by anyone in whatever was put forward.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000232"></a>The weight of evidence is often presented in the outcome in a very bland way&#151;70 per cent said this, 30 per cent said that&#151;and little guidance is given about what to think about the 70 per cent and the 30 per cent. This brings me to the example I wish to give. We recently had an order bringing seven designated types of psychologists under statutory control. Before the consultation started on the implementation of the order, the Government had persuaded the British  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC500"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC500</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Psychological Society that it should agree to statutory control. That was a big judgmental move on the part of the British Psychological Society. It would have come under considerable pressure to make that move because the state system, again as mentioned by my noble friend, is very large, powerful and centralised. It would be a brave council of the British Psychological Society that stood out for self-regulation and common law if the Government wanted it to come under statutory control and the NHS was responsible for giving its members much of their work.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000233"></a>The regulatory impact assessment states that the order was brought in as a matter of modernisation of the regulation of healthcare, to ensure patient safety, to set standards of competence and to maintain and improve public confidence. In the consultation, no questions were asked about modernisation; it was a given. That is to say, statutory control equalled modernisation, in effect. No questions were asked of the people practising about their experience of patient safety, nor about what they thought about public confidence. All the questions they were asked were tailored around the given that this statutory regulation was going to be brought in&#151;after all, the society had agreed to it&#151;and therefore there was no need, I suppose, to seek evidence as to whether what was said in the regulatory impact assessment as the reason for the order was in fact an issue. We all agree that patient safety is an issue, but we need to tie the issue of lesser or greater patient safety to the question of whether it would be achieved by statutory control, or whether it is being achieved perfectly satisfactorily without statutory control.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000234"></a>I sum up by saying that I do not think that making a consultation into a well worked out process is sufficient; there needs to be judgment at every stage.</p>

I do not often get involved in these issues, but I have a simple question for the Minister. The advantage of Grand Committee is that the Minister has ready access to his officials, who, I am sure, can easily provide inspiration for the Minister&#146;s answer.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000236"></a>A while ago, a Member of another place was asked by the Prime Minister of the time to undertake an inquiry into a matter of public policy of which I had a little experience. The honourable Member wrote to me, asking for my views. I replied in detail, a couple of sides, but it may not quite have been what the honourable Member expected. Some might think that it was unhelpful. It was, indeed, carefully drafted.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000237"></a>The honourable Member misunderstood me and, in a letter to me, suggested that I did not want to make a contribution. I replied, and this is the important bit: &#147;Nevertheless, my letter of&#148;&#151;the date&#151;</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000238"></a>The question is: am I a consultee to that inquiry or not? In other words, should my name have been included in the list of consultees?</p>

However, I also extend my appreciation to the work that he has done prior to this debate to seek to elicit the facts. For he has, through most persistent questioning, raised a number of issues that I hope the Minister will have time to address. I also register my appreciation of how he has himself engaged in consultation on this subject on his blog. I have read with interest some of the letters that he received, which are available, from, among others, M J Ray, James Clark, Dave Briggs and a number of others, all of which express the public interest in what we are talking about.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000240"></a>Although it may appear to be an arcane subject, it seems to be of great importance to the public; not only to those who are specifically targeted by departments for consultation but, more generally, those who are affected, even if not centrally but peripherally. Many are anxious to access the policy-making process and, by participating and indicating their interests, to help to shape our democratic response to policy making.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000241"></a>At a time when Parliament is under something of a cloud for reasons unconnected to the subject that we are debating today, it behoves us all to think carefully about how we can strengthen the sense of public involvement in our processes. I very much welcome the debate on that account.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000242"></a>However, it is not only a matter of importance to the public. It is also a matter of high importance to Parliament, in its legislative process, to know what is happening and why, and how those affected, even indirectly, might feel. With the best will in the world, it is not possible, even for specialists, to rake up all the implications of legislation pouring forth from Whitehall, as it does, at an ever-increasing rate.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000243"></a>I have also noticed with great interest the remarks of the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, about the work of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee. I observed in particular one review, which the committee had conducted, of an order that seemed to speak eloquently of its wider experience and to underline the importance to Parliament of consultation. I refer to the Rent Officers (Housing Benefit Functions) Amendment (No. 2). Order 2008; the review summarised with the concluding sentence:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000311"></a>&#147;We note with concern the very short consultation period on this proposal and the fact that a significant degree of disagreement with the policy remains&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000292"></a>It is interesting that that particular report follows the committee&#146;s report on the Draft Freedom of Information (Parliament) Order 2009, in which it drew attention to the shortness of time that the Government had allowed it to consider why the order was necessary, what its policy objective was, and what the explanation was for the exceptional hurry that had limited the normal scrutiny process. That order related to the publication of expenses claimed by or paid to Members of either House. The well known rubric, &#147;Legislate in haste and repent at leisure&#148;, is underlined very clearly by these two examples. The Government must take extremely seriously the issue of consultation.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000244"></a>I add my inquiry to the Minister about the overarching arrangements for ensuring that the code published in November 2008 and which became operative then are available to the public and understood, and that the public are told where to go. It is not at all clear to members of the public where to look for subjects in which they may be very interested; with the constant changing of names of departments, who remembers the particular department responsible for this at the moment is BERR? Many people still think of it as the DTI and would be astonished to discover that there was responsibility within that department.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90514-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000245"></a>The reference in the cover notes that had been put out to going to the Department for Communities and Local Government is also somewhat confusing. Why should that particular department be the source of information across government? In fact, it is not entirely clear, as the noble Lord, Lord Norton, pointed out, that that department is in possession of all the information that is relevant and ought to be available.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000246"></a>In conclusion, I raise an issue that may be very easily answered by the Minister, on the extent to which these rules of the code are enforceable. The document itself&#151;that is, the introduction to the code of practice, setting out the status&#151;expresses the view that the code does not have legal force. Of course, in one obvious sense, that is clear. However, I read with some interest the text of the broadcast by a Mr Paul Greening, who is described as a public participation expert, in an interview that he gave with Radio Free Europe as long ago as 4 March 2003. The interest of this is that apparently he was the member of the Cabinet Office who was invited in 1998, as deputy head of consultation, to be responsible for drawing up the original code in 2000. At the end of his very interesting statement about how the different interests had been weighed up within government, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000312"></a>&#147;There is a public expectation that ministries will follow the Code of Practice. If they do not, according to UK law ... consultations can be subject to judicial review, which means the ministry could be taken to court&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000293"></a>I wonder if that is the case. Someone dissatisfied might be tempted to try it out, but I should like to hear the Minister&#146;s view on that possibility.</p>
<h5><a name="09051462000346"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09051462000247"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09051462000398"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I join other noble Lords in thanking my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth for drawing our attention to this important area of the legislative process. Consultation is vital to public confidence in our legislative system; indeed, it is a word that we hear often in your Lordships&#146; House. We on these Benches frequently call for more public consultation in order, as my noble friend said, to increase transparency, to enhance scrutiny and, above all, to allow for legislation to be developed with the confidence that the nation will concur with it because its citizens have been thoroughly involved in its preparation. Therefore, I am sure that your Lordships will applaud the work that has gone into many of these consultations, and that you will approve of the amount of interaction that this allows and the opportunity it theoretically provides for fine-tuning legislation. Indeed, we welcome such improvements as the Government have brought to the process of consultation.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000248"></a>In 2000, the Code of Practice on Consultation was introduced and, since then, I think that there have been no less than three updated versions. The code seeks to improve the,</p>
<ul><a name="09051462000321"></a>&#147;transparency, responsiveness and accessibility of consultations&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09051462000294"></a>Given that there are, I believe, currently more than 30 consultations running in different government departments, it is clearly vital that the process should be under constant scrutiny and subject to continuing improvement.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000249"></a>A number of important matters have been raised in today&#146;s debate but, in view of the hour, I hope that your Lordships will forgive me if I do not refer to all of them. I propose to pick up on three main areas of concern. The first is the over-arching one of the flexibility allowed to government departments under the code. There is no mechanism that I can detect&#151;my noble friend Lord Norton dwelt on this&#151;for ensuring compliance, and no mechanism for checking and co-ordinating what government departments are doing. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, said that my noble friend Lord Norton had been assiduous in raising questions on this subject. Indeed, in one such Written Question my noble friend asked:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000313"></a>&#147;How many consultation exercises have been undertaken by government departments since October 2007; and how many of them lasted or are due to last for the recommended period of at least 12 weeks&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000295"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter of Barnes, said in response&#151;indeed, my noble friend has referred to this&#151;that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09051462000314"></a>&#147;The Government no longer collate data on this. However, the information is put into the public domain each year, as departments are required, in the better regulation chapter of their annual reports, to describe their consultation activity over the year and the compliance of their consultation activities with the code&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 24/11/08; col. <I>WA</I><I></I><I>242</I>.]</p>

<p><a name="09051462000296"></a>They no longer collate the data. So there we have it. There is no mechanism for checking and co-ordinating and for comparing performance between departments. It is all very well departments describing their own consultation activity once a year but, as my noble friend asked, what independent verification of their claims is made? Perhaps the Minister will be able to address that.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000250"></a>My noble friend&#146;s Written Question also asked how many consultation exercises lasted or were due to last for the recommended period of at least 12 weeks. The response from the noble Lord, Lord Carter, did not directly answer that query. It is that lack of an answer which suggests that a considerable number of consultations might not last for the recommended period. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, referred to having first-hand experience of direct complaints about this. I, too have had such an experience and so this might be a further example of there being too much flexibility in the system.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000251"></a>My second area of concern is the appearance that the Government are merely going through the motions; that they undertake consultation half-heartedly because they have already decided what they will do; and that consultation is often, effectively, less than genuine. My noble friend Lord Attlee&#146;s experience sounds like a graphic example of this. I strongly suspect that his is not the only example. As a general point, I suggest  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC504"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC504</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the emphasis should be towards consultation on the issue rather than on the legislation. By definition, this happens earlier in the process and can genuinely influence the development of legislation before firm positions are taken by the government department on the exact direction that it should take. The Australians have taken some interesting steps in this direction which are worth looking at.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000252"></a>My third area of concern is the complaint that I hear increasingly from the people on the front line, who really have something to contribute to a consultation but are not being made aware that such a process is even taking place. Again, my noble friend Lord Norton spoke of this, as did my noble friend Lord Eccles, who, among other things, took issue&#151;as do I&#151;with the vagueness of the term &#147;stakeholder&#148;. It is true that some good use is being made of technology and details of consultations are indeed being put on official websites. However, this assumes that all people with something important to say in the consultation will know which website to look at and when to do so. Given the huge amount of bureaucracy in which we are all now engulfed, and to which the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, referred, it is unsurprising that key people miss such consultations. For example, when the consultation on the future of tobacco control was held, not enough was done to increase retailer awareness of it. Retailers were left to find it online, or to request a hard copy from the Department of Health, despite the fact that the provisions were to affect them directly.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000253"></a>That consultation is a very recent example of a pre-legislative inquiry by the Government. It does not meet best practice. We must not allow ourselves to become complacent. The word &#147;consultation&#148; is often bandied about, but we must ensure that we always remember that the word itself is not enough. It is vital that there is substance behind it. Consultation done poorly can do more damage than none at all. The results can, at best, be inappropriate and, at worst, misleading, providing a false sense of security that the legislation has been both widely approved and, indeed, improved. It would be very helpful if the Minister could reassure your Lordships that all future consultations will be conducted with more care and with reference to the Government&#146;s own code of practice on consultation. That code states that,</p>
<ul><a name="09051462000322"></a>&#147;effective consultation allows the Government to make informed decisions on matters of policy&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000254"></a>That is the theory of consultation, but it can only be achieved if the highest standards are maintained. Your Lordships have clearly shown today that you are concerned that those standards are not being maintained. The code of practice also states:</p>
<ul><a name="09051462000323"></a>&#147;we will continue to monitor how we consult and appreciate feedback on how we can improve&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000255"></a>I hope the Minister will take all our comments today in the constructive way in which they are intended and will explain to us how he hopes to improve matters.</p>

In preparation, I read the bio of the noble Lord, Lord Norton; I was obviously aware that he was a subject matter expert. I apologise that I have not read his blog. I thank him for tabling the Question for debate. Let me be clear: the Government are committed to effective public consultation that is targeted at and easily accessible to those with a clear interest in the policy in question. This is fundamental to a working democracy. I believe that, later, I will be able to give the noble Lord some good news.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000257"></a>I am delighted to report that our consultation code places the UK in a very small group of countries that are instituting rigorous requirements of this kind. In fact, the OECD praises us on our approach to consultation. We hope that the results&#151;to be published soon&#151;will show that the UK continues to be ranked as one of the best-performing OECD member countries on better regulation.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000258"></a>Your Lordships&#146; House plays a vital role in influencing and determining legislation as it proceeds in this House and in the other place, and through our Committee work. However, it is also essential that the Government provide their stakeholders with the opportunity to comment both on the direction and the implementation of new policies. We listen carefully to stakeholder views.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000259"></a>What is a stakeholder? It is anyone with a stake in the policy and could include businesses and citizens. On a personal basis, I would define it as those with an interest in the subject matter. We listen to stakeholder views on policy proposals and have a commitment to respond to consultation findings. That, after all, is an essential part of government. We have to be open to the views of stakeholders and be prepared to be held to account by others. Providing citizens, businesses and others with the opportunity to influence policy before it is enshrined in law is more than an academic exercise; it helps us design and deliver better policy outcomes.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000260"></a>In 2007, the Government actually used a stakeholder consultation process to review the code of practice on consultation itself and considered various interest groups and stakeholder views from those who regularly respond to government. We refined and updated the process, publishing this new code of practice last July, but there has to be a sense of continuous improvement. This document needs to be alive and changing. It needs to continuously improve.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000261"></a>There are important principles of the code are that all public consultations should adhere to. It must be timely, clear, accessible and well publicised. Consultations must be introduced early in the policy development process and last at least twelve weeks. Our best practice also includes providing a summary of responses received before or alongside any further action. The code does not, and should not, dictate that Ministers should conduct full, formal public consultations in absolutely every case. It is important to exercise judgment in deciding whether a formal consultation will add value to the policy development.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000262"></a>I assure your Lordships, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Norton, that the Government have strong processes in place to make sure that consultations are carried  


<notus-date day="14" month="5" year="2009" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC506"></a><b>14 May 2009 : Column GC506</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out in accordance with the code of practice. Each department has a consultation co-ordinator to ensure that consultations are run in line with the code, and officials from the Better Regulation Executive in my department monitor and challenge other departments on their compliance with the code as policies develop. I hope that that reassures the noble Lord, Lord Norton. I agree with the noble Lord that consistency on disclosure is required. The BRE engages where necessary during that whole exercise through the Cabinet clearance process to make sure that there is challenge. BERR is responsible for cross-Whitehall better regulation.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000263"></a>The Government are also committed to make the consultation process transparent to public scrutiny. Consultations are published on departmental websites and publicised to all interested stakeholders. I am glad to say that I am the bearer of good news: by the end of this year, it will be possible to search for all central government consultations. The Cabinet Office central index did not pick up all new consultations because it relied on all departments marking up their electronic documents in the same way. The BRE, with the Directgov team, is now simplifying the process. The Government are confident that by the end of 2009, all consultations will be available and searchable on Directgov. I am still coming to terms with Directgov.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000264"></a>Government responses must be published before or alongside the next significant step in policy development. Consultations must cite the seven criteria of good consultation. They must include contact details for the departmental consultation co-ordinator. Departments must describe their consultation activity over the year and the compliance of their consultation activities with the code in the better-regulation chapter of their annual reports. Good consultation is embedded within my own department where we look very carefully at how policy choices, at all stages of their development, will affect business and the economy. I am proud to say that BERR&#146;s 2007-08 annual report showed that 44 out of 45 consultations held by the department were fully compliant with best practise.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000265"></a>There is strong evidence across government that we are following best practice in consultation. I can give two examples. Earlier this year, the Government were setting out proposals making it compulsory for farmers to keep set-aside land, a former EU requirement. Working with key stakeholders, even prior to the publication of the consultation document, the Government recognised that a voluntary approach to the regulation would achieve the same outcome. The National Farmers&#146; Union preferred a voluntary solution, as a more regulatory option would impose policy costs of between &#163;61 million and &#163;135 million. The NFU predicted that the voluntary solution it proposed would cost farming businesses only &#163;250,000. The Government therefore modified their approach in response to the NFU&#146;s view.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000266"></a>In the interests of time, I shall not mention the other examples, but we believe that the Government have effectively consulted and listened to our stakeholders on a wide range of issues.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000267"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09051462000400"></a>Lord Maclennan of Rogart:</b> The department to which he referred, Defra, was one of those with the least good record of compliance. There were no fewer

In one case it allowed two weeks, in several it allowed four weeks and in others eight weeks. I do not think that is a particularly strong example of the Government&#146;s success in promoting the code.</p>

<p><a name="09051462000268"></a><b><a name="90514-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09051462000401"></a>Lord Davies of Abersoch:</b> I do not have time to consult, so I shall reply in writing. In any consultation it is important&#151;there have been a couple of questions on this&#151;to reflect on the weight of the evidence. Should we list all the individuals? It is not possible to provide departments with guidance on the weighting of responses. How does one compare a response from a citizen with a response from the CBI, from a huge lobby group or indeed from Greenpeace?</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000269"></a>Consultations are not votes; they are exercises in gathering evidence on which to base decisions. The new code does not require departments to list consultees, but it is important that all of them, including the letter of the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, are considered. That is absolutely part of the code.</p>

<a name="90514-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09051462000270"></a>The British Psychological Society was mentioned and the specific consultation. We shall need to respond to that later in writing. I hope that everyone is reassured that the Government take consultation very seriously. I hope that I have covered most of the points made during this interesting debate. Due to the limited time available, I shall reply in writing to any issues or comments which I have not covered.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="09051452000076"></a>Armed Services: Deepcut Review</h2>
<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09051452000003"></a><b><a name="90514-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09051452000072"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09051452000004"></a>I am announcing today the findings of the Boards of Inquiry (BOIs) into the tragic deaths at Deepcut of Privates Gray and Collinson. </p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09051452000005"></a>The impact of their untimely deaths was felt, not just across the MoD, but across the nation.  Our thoughts are with all their families and friends at this difficult time. </p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09051452000006"></a>The BOIs were delayed due to the other investigations and reviews into the deaths at Deepcut, which had to be completed first.  Having convened, they were subsequently reconvened to clarify evidence.  We deeply regret the additional distress that the delay to the BOIs has caused to the families of Privates Gray and Collinson. </p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09051452000007"></a>The next of kin were present at the BOI proceedings and have been presented with copies of the reports. </p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09051452000008"></a>The board agrees with the coroner&#146;s open verdict in both cases.  In the case of Private Collinson, the board concludes that there were no indications in his general behaviour during his time in the Army to suggest that he was at any risk.  In the case of Private Gray, the BOI concurs with Blake in concluding that there is no substantial evidence supporting third-party involvement in his death.  In addition to covering the specific circumstances surrounding the deaths, each report covers the background to Deepcut from 1993 until the time of the deaths, including such issues as discipline, staff selection, welfare support and guarding arrangements.  Both reports also detail the changes that have been made since the deaths to address these issues. </p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09051452000009"></a>The BOIs make 19 identical recommendations and the Gray BOI makes one further recommendation.  The recommendations are wide-ranging and there is considerable overlap with those made in earlier reviews and investigations into the deaths at Deepcut.  For this reason all have been addressed and further work has been put in train to ensure that all possible related improvements are made.  The recommendations focus on support to bereaved families; the service inquiry process, including tracking the implementation of recommendations; and the need to maintain momentum with continuous improvement in the training environment.</p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09051452000010"></a>The release of these BOIs does not alter our position on the need for a public inquiry.  Given the range of investigations that have now taken place, we do not believe there is any wider public or service interest in pursuing one. </p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09051452000011"></a>I will arrange for copies of both BOI reports, redacted in accordance with guidance on the Freedom of Information Act and the Data Protection Act, to be

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09051452000013"></a>The General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) will be held on 18 and 19 May in Brussels. My right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary (David Miliband), the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton) and my honourable friend the Minister of State for International Development (Gareth Thomas) will represent the UK.</p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09051452000017"></a>EU Foreign Ministers will discuss the presidency&#146;s agenda for the June European Council. The European Council will focus on EU institutional issues and agree Ireland&#146;s guarantees on the Lisbon treaty. The council will also discuss the economic, financial and social situation and will take first decisions on financial regulation based on the Commission&#146;s proposals on the De Larosiere report, as well as examining progress on the G20 London summit outcomes. There will also be a discussion on climate change funding mechanisms in order to develop an EU position ahead of the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen in December.</p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09051452000018"></a>The Government support these discussions at the June European Council. We welcome the continued co-ordinated EU response to the economic and financial situation and look forward to the council discussing credible options for an ambitious climate finance offer.</p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09051452000021"></a>The council will discuss preparations for the EU-Russia summit, which is taking place in Khabarovsk on 21 and 22 May. In this context the council will also discuss EU-Russia relations, taking stock of the state of negotiations on a successor to the EU-Russia partnership and c-operation agreement, and a range of international issues of common interest to the EU and Russia.</p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09051452000022"></a>At the summit, the EU will reaffirm its commitment to wide-ranging engagement with Russia, which the Government support as being in the UK&#146;s and EU&#146;s interests. We are willing to pursue active co-operation on important international issues, but also insist that Russia plays a responsible international role, keeping to international commitments it has made, including on Georgia. We will provide Parliament with a full update following the summit.</p>

We recognise Moldova&#146;s aspirations of closer integration with the EU, but maintain that this relationship must be based on a firm commitment to human rights as enshrined in the Eastern Partnership.</p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09051452000026"></a>Following the April GAERC, which agreed conclusions, this discussion should be an opportunity to broaden the debate and again encourage the EU to consider how it can best support US engagement. Member states will look to the council secretariat to update them on the Iranian response to the E3+3&#146;s invitation to recommence talks as soon as possible&#151;Iran has so far sent no reply.</p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09051452000027"></a>We will stress the opportunity that the E3+3 offer presents to Iran and the necessity for the EU to give its full backing to the renewed diplomatic efforts and the dual-track strategy, and encourage other member states to express their views on the most effective way forward. We will encourage further discussions on Iran over the coming months in the EU as the diplomatic situation develops.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09051452000028"></a><I>Georgia</I></p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="09051452000029"></a>The council will discuss the current situation in Georgia, including the EU's continued call for dialogue between the Government and the political opposition following a month of protests in Tbilisi. Ministers are likely to focus on the EU's current and future engagement with Georgia. The discussion is likely to include issues such as progress on trade agreements, visa facilitation and other elements arising from the Eastern Partnership summit on 7 May, as well as a discussion of the activities of the EU monitoring mission in Georgia.</p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09051452000032"></a>We would support council conclusions outlining the EU&#146;s serious concern about recent reports of mass civilian casualties in the conflict area. The Government are appalled by these reports; our position is that the fighting must stop, and that the safety and security of those civilians who remain in the conflict area is a priority. The council is likely to call on the Government of Sri Lanka to allow full and unhindered access for humanitarian agencies to IDPs wherever they are; and to underline the EU&#146;s determination to press the Government of Sri Lanka to make urgent progress on an inclusive political solution to the conflict.</p>

<a name="90514-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="09051452000034"></a>There will be a short discussion of illegal migration in the Mediterranean region, at the request of Greece. We expect Ministers to focus on increasing and strengthening co-operation in Europe to tackle the increasing flows of illegal migration. The UK supports this and recognises the particular challenges that are faced by Greece and other Mediterranean countries. We are also keen to further the UK&#146;s bilateral relationship with Greece on migration through the provision of technical advice and assistance.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="09051452000037"></a>The council is likely to review progress made to date on the five objectives and two conditions (&#147;5+2&#148;) required for the closure of the Office of the High Representative (OHR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), and future prospects for achieving these.  The UK will note the lack of progress made since the March meeting of the Peace Implementation Council.  We will reaffirm our commitment to the &#147;5+2&#148; needing to be completed before transition to a solely EU special representative-led mission can occur.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="09051452000042"></a>Ministers will also be given an update on seven European Defence Agency capability projects. This will include the Multi-national helicopter initiative (previously the UK-France helicopter initiative) which has raised &#8364;27 million towards the cost of upgrading European helicopters and training pilots to deploy to operational theatres. Defence Ministers will reflect on the EUFOR military operation in Chad and the Central African Republic which ended in March 2009.

The results are widely used by business and are presented along with a set of recommendations aimed at improving the resilience or organisations. They suggest that, in the years since the Civil Contingencies Act was passed in 2004, there has been a modest increase in the proportion of organisations surveyed that have a specific business continuity plan from 47 per cent in 2004 to 52 per cent in 2009. They also suggest however that only 25 per cent of small organisations have business continuity plans; and only 14 per cent were aware of business continuity management guidance provided by their local authority. By comparison 49 per cent of medium and 64 per cent of large organisations had business continuity plans.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_33"></a><a name="09051455000056"></a>This level of renewable electricity was estimated to save between 45 to 50MtCO2 in 2020, of which around 27 per cent, or 12 to 13 MtCO2 could be attributable to onshore wind. Emissions from electricity generation are covered by the emissions trading scheme (ETS). Carbon savings from onshore wind are not counted as additional to ETS emissions reductions.</p>

<a name="90514w0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_34"></a><a name="09051455000057"></a>Carbon savings are estimated by comparing the emissions from the generation mix under the renewable energy target, against emissions from the forecast generation mix under current measures, including RO banding. Estimates were made by independent consultants Redpoint et al (2008), and do not include any estimates for lifecycle emissions (from construction and manufacture) either of the renewable technologies, or of the conventional alternative.</p>

In particular, we are currently consulting on revised statutory guidance on promoting the health and well-being of looked after children. This guidance will be statutory on primary care trusts, strategic health authorities and local authorities and it will clearly outline the steps that should be taken to improve both physical and mental health. In addition, we have introduced an indicator within the national indicator set to measure progress on improving the emotional and behavioural health of looked after children. Other actions being taken include taking forward the recommendations of the CAMHS review in relation to vulnerable children, the piloting of multi-dimensional Treatment Foster Care and our wider Care Matters programme to improve outcomes for looked after children. This programme includes a number of measures to improve the quality of placements and of care planning which impact on children's health and well-being.</p>

That is why this Government launched the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy in 1999, following a detailed report by the Social Exclusion Unit.</p>

<a name="90514w0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_36"></a><a name="09051455000062"></a>Between 1998 and 2007 we have achieved a 10.7 per cent fall in the under-18 conception rate and a 6.4 per cent fall in the under-16 rate, reversing the previous upward trend. Within the overall reduction in teenage conceptions, teenage births have fallen by 23.3 per cent over the same period.</p>

<a name="90514w0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_37"></a><a name="09051455000063"></a>Our strategy places a strong focus on targeted interventions with young people at greatest risk of teenage pregnancy, in particular looked-after children and care leavers. Government guidance to local areas on effective local teenage pregnancy strategies highlights the importance of training and support for foster carers in helping them talk to their foster children about sex and relationships. The CWDC's Foster Care Training, Support and Development Standards, which set out the skills which all foster carers are expected to demonstrate, include sexual health promotion.</p>

The department has therefore, in light of the Act, made it clear that every National Health Service trust should have in place local policies and procedures that comply with the Act. Decisions on professional registration are made by independent regulatory bodies, not the Government, but we would expect them to make their decisions cognisant of a national context that encourages whistleblowing.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_587"></a><a name="09051455000655"></a>Suspicious activity reports (SARs) make a contribution to a range of outcomes including asset recovery but also harm reduction, the building of intelligence on criminals and terrorists, and criminal convictions. In relation to terrorism, the information contained in SARs has been used to assist in the prevention of further terrorist activity, through being linked to ongoing inquiries, and regularly adds valuable new information.</p>

<ul><a name="09051455000724"></a>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_63"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government what role journey-sharing has in carbon reduction; and whether there are any proposals to increase the practice among coach operators. [HL3509]</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_113"></a>
<a name="09051455000660"></a><b><a name="90514w0006.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09051455000837"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Transport (Lord Adonis):</b> Journey sharing has an important role to play in reducing carbon. The effectiveness, of course, depends on the number of people sharing the vehicle. An average car commuter drives 12 miles a day. Cutting that by even half through car sharing would save around 400kg of carbon dioxide in one year&#151;equivalent to around 170 litres of petrol. Transferring single occupancy car journeys to larger multiple occupancy vehicles, such as coaches, has the potential (depending on vehicle occupancy and vehicle emissions) to make significant further reductions to the emissions for a journey. However, there are no plans to specifically promote coaches above other multi-occupancy modes with regard to journey sharing.</p>
