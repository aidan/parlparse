</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Whether, following the outcome of the United Nations conference on natural disasters held in Kobe in January, they will now support a national platform in the United Kingdom for co-ordinating policy, practical action and research in this field.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="50704-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the Government take an integrated approach to emergency management and have established a framework for civil protection that covers environmental emergencies and those caused by other threats and hazards. This framework includes structures at local, regional and national levels to co-ordinate policy and action.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="50704-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Chesterton: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his rather cautious reply. Since Her Majesty&#039;s Government are well aware of the importance of co-ordinating research operations and information in connection with natural disasters, both in the UK and world-wide, will they follow other EU countries in recognising an appropriate UK body for that co-ordination in time for the meeting on dealing with disasters, to be held in London in December, under the UK&#039;s EU presidency?
</p>

<a name="50704-01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>Do the Government agree with the G8 and G5 legislators&#039; meeting yesterday in London about the importance of improving warnings for all kinds of natural disasters, particularly in relation to climate <br>&nbsp;<br>

change, as Admiral Fitzroy first demonstrated so successfully in the 1850s, which is being celebrated tomorrow on the bicentenary of his birth in 1805?
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="50704-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for that historical footnote. I thank him for his question. We recognise the importance of effective national structures, which is why we have our particular approach. At a time when climate change is on the agenda and is very much a political concern, the noble Lord will no doubt be delighted to know that the Government are sponsoring part of the important conference to which he referred and that they will be supplying several key speakers.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="50704-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Tanlaw: </b>   My Lords, will the Minister say whether the potential effects of asteroid impact are included under the definition of &quot;natural disasters&quot;? This is a very real threat, unlikely though it may be, and I would hate to see it excluded from the list of natural disasters read out by the Minister. Organisations like &quot;Spaceguard&quot; use it as an example for children to learn astrophysics, and to get encouragement from science.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="50704-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord asks an interesting question. Curiously enough, one of my children was asking me a similar question recently, and I did not have an answer for them. It would probably be better if I write to the noble Lord, but I thank him for raising an important point.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="50704-01_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Northover: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that, following the disastrous earthquake on 26   December that produced a tsunami, the line there was weakened? That was followed by another earthquake on 26 March. Is he aware that further earthquakes are expected in that region, and is he happy that preparations for such an event are well advanced?
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="50704-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, an early warning system has been agreed by international bodies. We are well aware of the potential threat, which will be at the forefront of our thinking on this issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="50704-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, the immediate disaster threatening this country is probably not being hit by an asteroid but drought&#151;certainly in southern England. Does the Minister agree that the longer-term worry is that 5 million people in the United Kingdom live in highly flood-prone areas? This requires not merely short-term disaster reaction, but long-term planning of a positive kind, in order to prevent a disaster in the future. Will he describe to us which entity, body or department is really taking this forward?
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="50704-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </b>   My Lords, it would probably be the Environment Agency. The noble Lord is right to draw our attention to these concerns. The issue of drought and, ironically, flooding&#151;the other <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="time_1"></a>
<a name="50704-01_time1"></a><h5>2.53 pm</h5>
<p><a name="qn_1"></a>
<a name="50704-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What steps are now to be taken on future financing of the European Union to sustain a viable value for the euro which favours the economy and employment, and to control proportionate re-allocation of budget resources.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="50704-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, as the Prime Minister said in his Statement to the House of Commons on 20 June, the UK believes that there needs to be a responsible and prudent approach to EU spending at a time when national budgets across Europe are under strain. There also needs to be a debate on the structure of the European Union budget to respond to the challenges of globalisation, which the UK plans to take forward under its presidency.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="50704-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his generalised response. I ask him, however, whether the steps to be taken to revive a stagnant economy and to stabilise the euro are not first of all to reform the ECB, as advised by your Lordships&#039; Select Committee; to reduce the interest rate to 1 per cent; to introduce enforceable limits to budgetary expenditure; and to introduce parliamentary control of commission regulations and abolish the <i>acquis communitaire</i>?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="50704-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, that is a long list. We should recognise that the European Central Bank is a relatively new institution. It will need time to develop and the financial markets will need time to respond to its approach. However, it is important that the ECB is independent. That is how it is set up and therefore it is not for individual governments to instruct it or to interfere with its judgments. Indeed, an important part of the stability that we are trying to create is that the bank is independent and is seen as being so.
</p>

<a name="50704-01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>On interest rate policy, it is a matter for the ECB and not for individual member states. On enforceable limits on budgets, one of the reasons why the UK could not sign up to the current financial perspective is that there was not sufficient agreement on capping the   budget, which is an important plank of the Government&#039;s policy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="50704-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Barnett: </b>   My Lords, the new budget does not start until 2007. What percentage of our GDP will our rebate be? Is it the Government&#039;s policy that, subject <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_416"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 416</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

to the common agricultural policy being phased out over the period of the new budget, we would be willing to phase out our rebate?
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="50704-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, on the CAP, the Government&#039;s position is clear; that we need to see a fundamental revamping of the budget. Indeed, if it were reduced, as a matter of arithmetic rather than negotiation, the abatement would decline.
</p>

<a name="50704-01_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>On the current value of the abatement as a percentage of GDP, I do not have that figure but it must be less than 1 per cent. I will write to the noble Lord on that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="50704-01_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Dykes: </b>   My Lords, the Question includes some complex business but I return to the common agricultural policy. Has the Prime Minister definitely dropped the startling suggestion to abolish the CAP&#151;&quot;to get rid of it&quot;, in his immortal phrase last week; or will he revive the idea of keeping some part of the CAP, pending getting rid of it eventually, when he responds to President Bush&#039;s even more startling suggestion?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050704/text/50704-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the Prime Minister has consistently said that the budget review is part of a wider debate about EU response to globalisation challenges. It is not expected to end the CAP now or to renegotiate it overnight. Any change must take account of the legitimate needs of farming communities and happen over time. However, there needs to be a clear process for the reform of the CAP which we would want to see in place during the course of the upcoming financial perspective.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </b>   My Lords, can the Minister tell your Lordships of any currency union in history which has survived without a federal budget and a government to run it? If the proposed constitution is not revived and enacted, what hope can there be for the survival of the euro, let alone for the niceties contained in the Question?
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew2"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I am not sure that I can give the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, a lesson on history. In relation to current monetary union, we do not take the position that it depends on a single political structure and a single government for Europe. That is why there is in place the ECB and an independent approach to monetary policy. It is also why the stability and growth pact, notwithstanding recent changes, is in place to ensure that there is fiscal responsibility. Those two key planks enable monetary union to be sustained without a single government.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Tebbit: </b>   My Lords, will the noble Lord have another attempt to answer the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Dykes? Last week he put the same question to the noble Lord, Lord Davies, who could not answer it. When the Prime Minister says that he wants to get rid of the CAP, are we to assume that the Prime Minister wants to get rid of the CAP or not?
</p>




<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I thought that I had dealt with that matter in answering the noble <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_417"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 417</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Lord, Lord Dykes, but I will try again. The Government&#039;s position is that we do not expect the CAP to be abrogated overnight, but there needs to be an approach for reform of the CAP, which has to be a process of negotiation with our partners taking account of farming interests. We need to see progress. That is a clear position.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </b>   My Lords, will the Government inform the House, and indeed the farming community, how long they propose to take in abolishing the CAP?
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord is trying to put words into my mouth. We are talking about reform and renegotiation of the CAP. The objective is to see any redirected European budget in place during the course of the current financial perspective, so at least the latter half of the perspective can have a budget that is fit for purpose and fit for the 21st century.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Davies of Coity: </b>   My Lords, in view of the constant questions that have been asked regarding the Prime Minister&#039;s Statement, will my noble friend confirm that what the Prime Minister meant was that we will get rid of the common agricultural policy in its present form?
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, I would urge all noble Lords to listen to and read what the Prime Minister said. It is very clear.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, interpreting the Prime Minister&#039;s words on many subjects is an art form and we are not going to reach clear conclusions now. I return to the original Question rightly raised by my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway. He mentioned the budgetary underpinnings of the euro&#151;which was also raised by my noble friend Lord Pearson&#151;and the future of the stability and growth pact.
</p>

<a name="50704-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>Does the Minister recall the Treasury producing a paper a year ago saying that the stability and growth pact had to be strong and effective and that it was a step forward in recognising the importance of long-term budgetary discipline? Now it has become weak and ineffective and a meaningless voluntary affair. So what does the Treasury say now? Have we achieved these goals, and if not, should we be putting forward some firm and clear reforms?
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, the position on the stability and growth pact is that we support a prudent interpretation of that pact but recognise that it needs to be flexible to deal with economic cycles in member states and to take account of debt levels and the need for public investment in member states. To suggest, as some do, that somehow it has all fallen apart is simply not right.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_418"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 418</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50704-02_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>A number of member states are going through some stages of the excess deficit proposals. That shows that the 3 per cent and 60 per cent limits are still in place, but they need to be interpreted with flexibility to take account of economic circumstances in particular member states.
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness O&#039;Cathain: </b>   My Lords, how flexible is flexible? Does it mean plus or minus 100 per cent for the 3 per cent and the 60 per cent? It looks as though we are allowing those countries that signed up to an agreement to be within two rigid parameters to have a huge amount of flexibility.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, it is important that whatever flexibility there is is limited. I could happily go through a list of member states that are subject to processes at the moment to indicate where they are and where it is proposed that they will get to. The excess deficit proposals for Germany and France are currently in abeyance following the Council&#039;s conclusions of November 2003, but that is because the judgment in their case was that the actions they have taken are broadly consistent with the correction of the excess deficit by 2005, so these things, as ever, need to be seen in context.

<a name="50704-02_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>Whether the current process of letting railway passenger franchises at frequent intervals is the best method of producing the highest standards of service.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the Government have the flexibility to let train operating franchises of different lengths. A balance needs to be struck between franchise periods that are long enough to encourage investment by train operators and short enough so that the market is regularly tested by competition and costs to the taxpayer are kept down.
</p>

<a name="50704-02_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>The White Paper <i>The Future of Rail </i>published in July 2004 announced a number of changes to rail franchising that will improve standards of service across the industry.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that reply, but may I say that it might easily have been given by a Minister in the Conservative government when the railways were privatised, when the Labour Party was vociferous in its criticism of the short-term management styles that are found with franchising, where people do not invest money in training or in improvements that passengers need. Why do the Government not go in for a system of franchising that really encourages investment, where <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_419"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 419</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

franchisees put a lot of their own money into the facilities that people want, which means longer timescales?
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, because we are not dissatisfied with the developing situation. The noble Lord will be all too well aware of the recent franchise negotiated by GNER, which seems good for the company&#151;it has won its bid&#151;but also good for the taxpayer because returns are coming to the taxpayer. There is also a guarantee that the service will continue with&#151;in fact, improve on&#151;the very good standards of recent years. So I do not share the noble Lord&#039;s rather gloomy prognostication about the nature of the franchises. We have built in additional criteria to which the franchisees are subject and we are confident that we will improve the railway.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Snape: </b>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that if he travels to Birmingham, he will see some trains run by companies with a 20-year franchise, some with a 10-year franchise, some with a five-year franchise, some with a three-year franchise and one with an 18-month extension on its franchise&#151;which I suppose meets all the eventualities outlined in his Answer? Will he accept that that is no way to run a railway, although it may well benefit livery designers and paint manufacturers? Cannot we find a proper franchise model and stick to it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="50704-02_spnew17"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is reflecting, with his well-known accuracy on railway matters, the position that has obtained for the past 10 years, which has produced those accumulating factors in railways in the centre of England. We are in the process of changing that. He will recognise that the new franchises have a more consistent length. Current lengths of franchises are over 11 years. He is reflecting on the accumulation of the past, not looking confidently to a bright new future.

<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="50704-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that we all agree with the Minister that we need the maximum possible investment in rail. From his answers, I am not sure that he has shown that will be done to maximum effect. Surely, franchises need to be slightly more flexible. For example, at the end of the franchise, there is not much incentive for investment in stations, and so   on. If there were more flexibility in the transfer of franchises and more compensation, that might happen. It does not seem that Network Rail is consulted in any way. I should like the Minister to answer about real investment in railways.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="50704-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord certainly made a substantial point when he referred to Network Rail. It is important that it is part of the process. We are realigning the franchises to be closer to the regional structure of Network Rail. That is crucial. We cannot improve train services unless the franchisees are guaranteed proper access to the track, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_420"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 420</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which Network Rail needs to guarantee. We all know the parlous state of our track since the Hatfield accident.
</p>

<a name="50704-03_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>However, things are improving significantly. Punctuality, which is still the absolute prerequisite when passengers evaluate train services, is improving. It is not reaching across the country the standards that we want, but there is clear improvement.
</p>

<a name="50704-03_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>I bear in mind what the noble Lord says about the end of franchise. It is obvious that when people come to the end of their tenure, the danger is that standards may decline. But I again offer the instance of GNER. Not only did its standards not decline but, against intense competition, it won a renewal of the contract. That is the model that we expect for the future.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="50704-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My Lords, can my noble friend explain why the success of the GNER franchise&#151;I commend the Government on what they have achieved&#151;was not matched on the west coast with Virgin Cross Country and Virgin West Coast? Their franchises have been on a cost-plus basis for three, four or even five years. Can my noble friend tell us when that matter will be resolved, so that those important routes are turned into proper franchises with management incentives to operate reliably?
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="50704-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is right to draw the contrast but the House will be aware of the fact that the problem with regard to the west coast franchise did relate crucially to the great problems with the renewal of the busiest track in Europe. It is the most intensively used track in Europe and we have now reached the final stages of its completion.
</p>

<a name="50704-03_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>The completion of the track will guarantee that the franchise operators will have access to the track on proper terms. It will enable us to move out of the temporary situation that we had with regard to certain aspects of the franchise on the West Coast Main Line which will be translated into a proper franchise of proper duration with a guarantee of improvement in service.

<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="50704-03_spnew4"></a><b> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </b>   My Lords, the Chiltern franchise has been let for 20 years. The operator has committed himself to substantial improvement to that railway and has funded it himself. Why is such scope for railway development not being allowed to other franchisees?
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="50704-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, there are certain unique features with regard to the Chiltern franchise. It is a much more self-contained system than many other franchises. The noble Earl is right&#151;the length of the franchise is 26 years and that is not a model that we will adopt right across the country. Merseyside Rail is one other franchise which is almost as long as that. It is a reflection of a much more closely integrated system in which it is far easier for the operator to be able to identify his running costs and the necessary investment and the returns on them.

</p>

<a name="50704-03_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Higgins </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_3"></a>Whether, in light of recent decisions regarding the implementation of primary legislation, they will make provision in specific circumstances for amendable statutory instruments.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="50704-03_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My Lords, in very exceptional circumstances, for emergency regulations under the Civil Contingency Act 2004 and the preceding Emergency Powers Act   1920, provision has been made in legislation for statutory instruments to be amendable by Parliament. In other circumstances the Government believe that to make provision for amendable statutory instruments would involve excessive complication and frustrate the purpose for which delegated powers are given.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="50704-03_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Higgins: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness the Leader of the House for that reply, but hope to persuade her to improve on it.

</p>

<a name="50704-03_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>There is serious concern about the way in which primary legislation is now being implemented by statutory instruments which turn out to be significantly different from what was expected at the time the primary legislation was passed. For example, my noble friend Lord Kingsland has expressed reservations about the way in which the proposals to restrict trial by jury are going to be introduced. The order that is designed to cope with the prolonged protest in Parliament Square clearly goes far beyond what was expected at that time and seems clearly to be in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights.
</p>

<a name="50704-03_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>If your Lordships are to continue to exercise restraint in not voting against statutory instruments, would it not be appropriated for the Procedure Committee and the Merits Committee to look at the case for amendable statutory instruments?
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="50704-03_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, I have to say that I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. In the two areas used as examples by the noble Lord, in relation to Parliament Square the Act refers to a distance of one kilometre; the proposal in the order is for 750 metres, so it is well inside the one kilometre. I am not clear how it is different from what Parliament expected when this was discussed.

</p>

<a name="50704-03_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>On the second proposal, which relates to fraud trials, there was an undertaking to carry out consultation. As the noble Lord knows, a seminar was held, chaired by my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General, to which representatives from the legal profession, representatives <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_422"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 422</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

in this House and opposition spokespersons in another place were invited. Options were looked at on the basis of a paper proposed by the Attorney-General&#039;s office and a decision was reached. I do not agree with the premise of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins.
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="50704-03_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   My Lords, do the Government recognise that there is a serious problem here? I am aware that we do not want something in the nature of a Committee stage debate every time we debate a statutory instrument, but could not consideration be given to some procedure for debating amendments to statutory instruments in special circumstances, such as those suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, perhaps on the basis of a recommendation by the Select Committee on the Merits of Statutory Instruments?
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="50704-03_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, there is full debate when Bills go through Parliament, not only at Second Reading but in Committee and elsewhere, where the need for statutory instruments is flagged up. A procedure is then undergone in the two Houses. In some limited instances, there is what we now call the super-affirmative procedure. But the two examples given by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, are areas on which noble Lords raised concerns. Despite that, the Acts went through both Houses of Parliament. Noble Lords seem to be asking for another opportunity to raise the same concerns that they raised then.
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="50704-03_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Strathclyde: </b>   My Lords, I know that the noble Baroness and her colleague the Leader of another place are always keen to improve Parliament&#039;s scrutiny of the Executive. Perhaps she will consider one useful convention: for governments to publish detailed draft regulations flowing from a Bill before its Committee stage and not to press for passage of a Bill before the publication of draft regulations. Does she accept that, if regulations are not published in time for Committee, there may be a case for a new procedure for both Houses to propose amendments to regulations before finally agreeing to any new law? That seems both sensible and fair to the parliamentary process. Will the noble Baroness undertake to lay that issue on the table in any discussion of this House&#039;s conventions?
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="50704-03_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, whenever the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, describes anything to me as being &quot;completely fair&quot; I remember the recent descriptions in the press with respect to how wily he is. On that basis, I undertake to look very carefully at what the noble Lord has said. But I cannot give any undertaking to put in place a new procedure. With respect to his comments about referral to the Joint Committee looking at the conventions of both Houses, there will be terms of reference for that committee, and individuals will give evidence to it, so bearing that in mind, I am sure that the noble Lord will be able to give his evidence.

<a name="column_423"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 423</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

as a matter of course; we hardly ever have primary legislation there. It is vital, if there is to be some sort of democratic scrutiny, that those orders are amendable. Today, and again on Thursday, we will go to the Moses Room to consider a plethora of statutory instruments which we must take or leave. As I have said previously in the House, there will come a time when our tempers will not be constrained and we will start to vote down statutory instruments. It is time the Government came up with some way of dealing with the Northern Ireland situation.

<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="50704-04_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord   Smith of Clifton, knows that I have some sympathy with the attempt to find an effective way of scrutinising Northern Ireland legislation in this House. We have made special arrangements to keep noble Lords informed and involved in the statutory instruments brought before the House. We take them off the Floor of this House to give as much debating time as possible. There is scope for discussion between opposition spokespersons and the relevant civil servants, and there are also regular meetings with Peers with an interest in Northern Ireland. I recognise the frustration of noble Lords with such an interest, and have raised the matter with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. My noble friend, Lord Rooker, and I will continue to press on this issue and see if there is any resolution that we can bring before the House.

<a name="50704-04_spnew5"></a><b> Earl Attlee </b>   moved Amendment No. 45:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>Page 15, line 31, leave out &quot;17&quot; and insert &quot;18&quot;</p>
</ul>

</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving Amendment No. 45, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 46. I remind the House of my interest declared at Second Reading. It is always a pleasure to move the first amendment on a Monday afternoon after Question Time. One of my regrets about the Bill is that it looks increasingly unlikely that we will finish Committee stage before the Summer Recess.

</p>

<a name="50704-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>Amendment No. 45 would make the &quot;alcolock&quot; scheme unavailable to 17 year-old drivers. The scheme is controversial and novel, but it may not be objectionable. Why does the Minister desire to make the scheme available to a young driver only 17 years old, who has made such a poor start to his driving career?
</p>

<a name="50704-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>Amendment No. 46 is far more important. Subsection (12) of new Section 34D is on page 16 of the Bill. I am concerned that a sober person could release the alcolock in order to allow a person who is not sober to drive the vehicle. I accept that the Bill goes some way to addressing the problem and uses the words,

</p>

<a name="50704-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>In the circumstances that I described, the alcolock will have functioned properly, but there will still be a drunk at the wheel. I do not think that any offence will have been committed by the person who has given a clean sample to the alcolock device. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="50704-04_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   My name is attached to Amendment No. 46 because it appears that the presence of an alcohol lock in a car&#151;we have not actually seen such a device yet&#151;does not prevent just anybody blowing in to it. If they did so, as the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, has said, a drunk person could continue to drive. We seek assurance first that there is such a device; secondly, that it is proofed against being used by somebody else&#151;really proofed, not in a way that can be got over by using a tube or something so that your mouth does not touch it; and lastly, that, if anybody uses one to permit somebody who is drunk to drive, the offence will be regarded as a serious one. The person who does it will be treated as if they had been the drunk driver.
</p>




<p><a name="st_55"></a>
<a name="50704-04_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   Can my noble friend clarify how the alcolock works? The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, has suggested that someone in the passenger seat could blow into the machine, enabling the engine to start. Quite often occupants of a car decide to change drivers. The driver may get tired and decide he wants to go to sleep, or he may decide that he is too drunk to drive. They may then stop the car, keep the engine running and change drivers? What is it that requires someone to blow into the machine again? Is it to make the engine start or is it when someone gets out of the driver&#039;s seat? This could lead to interesting debates as to who was driving and who was <br>&nbsp;<br>

puffing into the pipe&#151;especially if the engine is kept running, which I assume would avoid the necessity of having to recalibrate and retrigger the device. I should be grateful for an explanation from my noble friend.
</p>




<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="50704-04_spnew8"></a><b> Viscount Simon: </b>   It has probably been considered already but I have a suggestion to overcome this potential problem&#151;that is, to have a simple pressure switch on the driver&#039;s seat so that no one can vacate that seat without the mechanism being operated.
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>
<a name="50704-04_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I am not sure whether the Minister wishes to move his amendments in this group before I speak to our Amendment No. 49 but perhaps I should go ahead.

</p>

<a name="50704-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>In speaking to Amendment No. 49, I wish to question why Clause 14(1)(a) and (b) suggests that the experiment should last until 2010 or for as long as the Secretary of State may wish it to last. Although we may think that 2010 is roaring up on us it is still five years away, and five   years seems quite long enough to carry out any experiment and to report back on it without the Government having the latitude to extend it interminably, presumably by only an affirmative or negative order. The amendment seeks to delete paragraph (b) so that we know when the period of experimentation will finish.

<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="50704-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am grateful to all Members of the Committee who have spoken in this short debate. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady   Hanham, for speaking to her Amendment No.   49. I shall speak to the government amendments, which are of a purely technical nature and do not affect the content of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50704-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>By inserting new sections into the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, Clause 13 makes provisions to give courts the power, in certain circumstances, to offer offenders the opportunity to participate in an alcohol ignition interlock programme. Part of that process involves the court making an order for the offender to participate in such a programme.

</p>

<a name="50704-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Under proposed new section 34D(7) a court shall not make an order unless certain conditions apply. One of the conditions is that the offender appears to the court to be over the age of 17. The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, suggests that this should be 18. However, the condition specified in the clause applies in the parallel situation where a court makes an order for a drink/drive offender to attend a drink/drive rehabilitation course under Section 34A of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988. This places an obligation on the court to be satisfied that the offender is of an age sufficient to make him eligible for a licence to drive a motor vehicle.
</p>

<a name="50704-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>I do not see any strong arguments for restricting the scheme. I would remind the Committee that in view of the lengthy period of disqualification&#151;at least a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_427"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 427</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

year&#151;that will precede the time when an offender gets back behind the wheel&#151;even the youngest offender will be 18 in practice before they are in that situation. Although I recognise the point being made by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, the process envisaged by which justice will be dispensed makes it inevitable in this area.

</p>

<a name="50704-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, and the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, have identified an issue that has been examined at some length in the context of alcohol ignition programmes where they have been implemented in other countries. However, I am not in a position to accept Amendment No. 46. Circumvention of the system is never likely to be stopped completely. There is always a problem of enforcement regarding such activity. Frankly, short of locking offenders in prison, it is hard to prevent them driving while disqualified&#151;except through the deterrent effect of the risk and consequences of being caught. We know that some people do in fact take this risk. The only response that we can apply is a suitable punishment when that is done.
</p>

<a name="50704-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>Experience from other countries suggests that participants in alcohol ignition interlock programmes come, on the whole, with a positive frame of mind. They want to drive; they want to be compliant with the law; and they are willing to pay for it. All of those factors are likely to obtain when we introduce a similar programme. They are not inclined to risk a loss by cheating. Anyone driving while not in compliance with the programme conditions would be driving while disqualified&#151;and liable on conviction to a custodial sentence consistent with that serious offence.
</p>

<a name="50704-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>I was asked to specify some details by my noble friends. The key to the system is the black box type recorder which allows the participant to be held to account for all attempts to give breath specimens to start the car. I understand that the technology is being developed to allow individual drivers to be identified by a breath specimen. That is not effective at present in those countries where the device is used, but the technology is being developed. Of course noble Lords   are anxious about the situation in which we may introduce the system where that sophisticated dimension&#151;an imprint on the nature of the individual&#039;s breath sample, guaranteeing which driver has provided it&#151;may not be in force. Once we have that technology, any false specimens would certainly be detected and investigated. It would become clear that cheating could not possibly succeed.
</p>

<a name="50704-05_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>If this system were used, the likelihood of someone successfully providing a specimen on behalf of the person on the programme would be small indeed. We have made provision, under subsection (12) of our new Section 34D, for an offence of interfering with the proper functioning of the interlock, and we do not feel it necessary to extend it to the specific circumstances which the amendment identifies. I cannot at this stage promise that the full technology will be in place. However, the expectation is certainly that it will be worked on and that the full programme will operate that way once implemented. The obvious fact is that a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_428"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 428</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

person who is compliant in cheating in this way would, if discovered, find that the driver would be guilty of a very serious offence&#151;and that the person who collaborated in interfering would themselves find trouble being visited on their head.
</p>

<a name="50704-05_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>In summary, we expect to be operating a foolproof technology. If we have an interim period when we are not, it is equally clear that we are faced with the same situation: if people cheat by driving while disqualified they are balancing that cheating against the risk that if they are found out the consequences will be severe. Of course, that would also apply in this case.
</p>

<a name="50704-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>We would all recognise that some people are prepared to take such risks. If there were none at all they would not appear before the courts and we would not have the disastrous details that are revealed on occasions. The vast majority of people who are required to meet these obligations do so in good faith. I emphasise again that we expect participants within the framework of this particular provision to be already of a mind to comply with the law and eager to make progress with regard to their situations. Therefore, cheating ought to be at a minimum.

</p>

<a name="50704-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>The two government amendments, Amendments Nos. 47 and 48, deal with two instances in Clause 13 where the wording currently in the Bill is in error. Reference is made on page 18 at line 27 and at line 42 to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;an alcolock ignition interlock programme&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>where the correct term should have been,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;an alcohol ignition interlock programme&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-05_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>I apologise for those two mistakes. The amendments are merely to clear up that technical error.

</p>

<a name="50704-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>On the last amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, I must refer to the early development of the drink-drive rehabilitation courses and the arrangements put in place under the Road Traffic Act 1991 to allow courts to refer offenders to such courses. On successful completion of such a course an offender can have a reduction in his period of disqualification. The scheme was begun as an experiment in a limited number of court areas but, in 2000, after evidence had been gathered that reoffending among course attendees was around two and a half times lower than among non-attendees, it was rolled out nationally. I can happily report to the House that the scheme continues to be successful.
</p>

<a name="50704-05_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>We now have in prospect, in the form of alcohol ignition interlock programmes, a new disposal for which the scale application may be slightly narrower but the impact could still be significant. Broadly speaking, referral to a programme works in the same way as referral to a drink-drive rehabilitation course. Accordingly, the legislative provisions have been modelled very closely on those for the drink-drive courses under Sections 34A, 34B and 34C of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988. Those sections have clearly served us well and to a large degree we have stuck with them.

The only thing that I can report is that we are intent on making sure that, in all aspects of the observance of motoring law in those terms, the cheats do not prosper.

We are being asked to pass a law allowing the Government to introduce something, but they cannot even tell us that the technology that they propose to introduce actually exists. If we are being asked to pass something into law, we want to know that it works and that it has been tried out. It should not exist as a figment of somebody&#039;s imagination.

<a name="50704-06_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   Before my noble friend responds on his amendment, perhaps I may pick up on something that the Minister said. As I understand Clause 14, which is the clause I was talking about, it allows an experimental period in which the alcohol lock may be tested. The Minister equated that with the drink-driving situation. He went on to say that, once it was understood that the drink-driving course had been effective, it would be rolled out.

<a name="50704-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>I do read the clause as allowing the Government to do that. Clause 14 refers to an &quot;experimental period&quot;. My argument was that an experimental period of five years is surely long enough. Clause 17(7)(b) would enable an experimental period to be extended, even though no decision had been made about whether the alcohol lock was working. The Government could extend it for another 10 years if they so wished. All they would need to do is bring a statutory instrument before both Houses.
</p>

<a name="50704-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>If we are talking about experimental periods going on for longer than five years, the Government should consider carefully whether another experimental period is what they should introduce. They should be either abandoning it or rolling it out.

</p>

<a name="50704-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>It is not the case that the technology is weak. That is an added dimension that will cut out the cheating to which noble Lords referred earlier; that is, somebody else acting on behalf of the driver, which would be a serious offence on the part both of the driver and the person who was complicit in the cheating. The technology is entirely secure. It is used by the courts in north America. We have a research project working on it now, and the equipment can guarantee that, if the breath contains a non-permissible level of alcohol, the ignition will not work. I reassure the noble Lord that that part of the technology is secure. The only aspect on which I was asking for an element of understanding from the Committee was the further refinement of the technology that identifies the breath imprint.

   &quot;WEARING OF PROTECTIVE CLOTHING

<br>
   After section 16 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (c. 52) (wearing of protective headgear) insert&#151;


<br>
&quot;16A   WEARING OF PROTECTIVE CLOTHING


<br>
   The Secretary of State shall make regulations requiring, subject to such exceptions as may be specified in the regulations, persons driving or riding in motor vehicles of any class specified in the regulations to wear EN471 compliant reflective garments when leaving the vehicle at a roadside, except where the vehicle is parked.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_70"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 50 would introduce a requirement for car occupants to wear retro-reflective jackets if they leave their car at the roadside; for example, in the event of a breakdown or accident. We discussed this issue at some length at Second Reading so it is only proper that we return to it today in Committee.
</p>

<a name="50704-06_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>The essence of this proposed new section is that it is   designed to tackle the fatality and casualty rate among pedestrians involved in road accidents. By &quot;pedestrians&quot;, I mean someone who gets out of a car and thereby becomes a pedestrian as they are on their feet on the road. Some 774 pedestrians were killed in road accidents in 2003, representing some 22 per cent of the total number of persons killed.
</p>

<a name="50704-06_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>In 2001, the last year for which figures are available, 44 people were killed or seriously injured as a result of   vehicles being parked on the hard shoulder of motorways. It is estimated that 28 per cent of all accidents involving a car and a pedestrian can be attributed to either the driver looking but not seeing the pedestrian or to the person hit wearing dark or inconspicuous clothing. Enhanced conspicuity at the roadside offers an opportunity to reduce the number of people killed and seriously injured in road accidents.
</p>

<a name="50704-06_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>Indeed, the US Department for Transport found in a study that reflective clothing has been shown to increase the visibility of someone on the road by a factor of five. The same study found that wearing a reflective vest increased the distance at which the driver could see a pedestrian by around 159 metres.

</p>

<a name="50704-06_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>Wearing a retro-reflective vest makes a person more visible, allowing more time for drivers to react. Requiring car passengers unexpectedly forced to leave their car to wear retro-reflective jackets would reduce the number of road accidents, in particular in the event of breakdowns on busy carriageways or motorways. I understand that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_433"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 433</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

similar measures have already been implemented, or will   be implemented shortly, in Italy, Spain, Austria and Portugal. At a cost of as little as &#163;5 a vest, the price seems cheap compared with the cost of dealing with road accidents in the United Kingdom, which in 2002 amounted to around &#163;17,760 million.
</p>

<a name="50704-06_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>When this issued was discussed in another place the Minister said that the Government would consider such a scheme. I hope that the Minister can provide us today with an update on the Government&#039;s latest position. I beg to move.

<a name="50704-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Monson: </b>   This is an extremely well meant amendment and I am interested in the statistics that the noble Baroness produced. However, it is extremely impractical. If it were to apply to motorways only that might be one thing, but the amendment as drafted would apply to all roads, including urban roads, at all times, including mid-summer days in bright sunlight. It would mean that every single four-seater car in the country would have to carry four garments at all times in case a driver with four passengers ran out of petrol and the driver had to don one to go to the garage and his passengers had to don one each to go to the nearest caf&#233; or pub. I suggest that theft would be an enormous problem, since the garments would be almost identical and not easily attributable to any one owner. If this requirement were to apply to motorways only, there might be something to be said for it, but not in respect of all roads at all times.

I do not dispute the effectiveness of high visibility clothing. I am sorry to be unhelpful to my noble friend, but modern vehicles very rarely break down. However, my noble friend is right to say that a very high risk is attached to getting out of a vehicle on the driver&#039;s side, especially on motorways. The first lesson on a driving course is to locate and name major components of the vehicle. The second lesson is to mount and adopt the correct driving position. That includes being carefully taught to go towards the driver&#039;s door facing the traffic and to leave it still facing the traffic, that is, going towards the rear of the vehicle.

</p>

<a name="50704-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>The problem is that a high visibility jacket will be used very infrequently and it will therefore be kept in the boot. It will not be kept in the passenger compartment. Or will we prosecute motorists for not having the high visibility jacket in the passenger compartment because the boot will not be good enough? There will be a problem because an unskilled driver can still be careless while getting his high visibility jacket out of the boot.
</p>

<a name="50704-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>This is not relevant to the amendment, but I would support a requirement to carry and deploy a warning triangle. However, the <i>Highway Code</i> effectively advises against using a warning triangle on the motorway.

I believe that that is the opposite of what the Germans say. Why is our <i>Highway Code</i> different from the Germany highway code in respect of a warning triangle? If the Minister will write to me on that point, it will avoid me tabling an amendment on it at a later stage.

<a name="50704-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that a large percentage of lorry drivers, both delivery drivers and long-distance drivers, wear these vests all the time. It is standard practice and I suspect that they are required to do so by their contract of employment because of the safety factor. Therefore, the logic of requiring all users of cars   and motorcycles to wear them is there. But the practicalities worry me, as well as other noble Lords. If car occupants are going to have to wear vests when they get out of the car, then why not make all pedestrians wears them because drivers have become pedestrians in the process of getting out of the car? We can have an interesting debate. It is interesting to know that most lorry drivers wear vests for safety reasons. There is a significant benefit in that.

<a name="50704-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>Reflective vests do not cost very much. However, as the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, said, there should be greater emphasis on ensuring that you get out on the near-side and avoid getting out on the off-side, even if it means clambering over. There may be a risk to health of doing something to yourself while climbing over the gear stick, as there is a risk of dislocating an arm, a shoulder, or both, while trying to put on such a vest while in your seat&#151;that poses a new set of problems. But we are discussing the first of three &quot;conspicuity&quot;&#151;perhaps one should say &quot;visibility&quot;&#151; amendments. They go in the right direction.

<a name="50704-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>We advise pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists to wear fluorescent clothing during the day and reflective clothing at night to improve their visibility to other road users. That advice is in the <i>Highway Code</i>. The code also advises drivers and other vehicle occupants on where they should stand if their vehicle breaks down, with special advice regarding motorways. Our leaflet, <i>A Guide to Safer Motorway Driving</i>, also contains advice on what to do when a vehicle breaks down on a motorway. Drivers and occupants are not at great risk when they follow that advice. For example, regarding motorways, they are advised to wait on a nearby bank or verge, well away from the traffic. Therefore, we do not believe that we should go further and require the wearing of special clothing. I hope, in view of that explanation, that the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment.

<a name="50704-07_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply and I note her comments. There is no doubt that the proposed new clause was tabled due to the dangers that people face when they get out of vehicles. There have been many reports of people who get out to change a tyre, or because they have run of petrol, or because, having got out, they could not make their phones work on the motorway and they set off walking in bad visibility. They could not be seen and they have been killed by something coming in the other direction. To some extent, my problems would be overcome if the Minister were to consider including in the <i>Highway Code</i> guidance that reflective garments should be available in a vehicle if people were to get out. I have seen people get out on a motorway to change a wheel with nothing on at all. They might be sprayed by a passing vehicle. I could not possibly change a wheel, but I have seen people incautiously doing that.
</p>

<a name="50704-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>Will the Minister reflect on whether extra guidance could be provided in, say, the <i>Highway Code</i>, stating that it would be sensible to put on protective clothing if you get out on a motorway or, indeed, anywhere&#151;because country lanes are almost as bad, if not worse, for people getting out to walk, if, for example, they do not have a mobile phone? For today&#039;s purposes, I shall withdraw the amendment, but, perhaps we might consider before the next stage whether such strong guidance might be provided.

   &quot;RETRO-REFLECTIVE MARKINGS

<br>
   In the Road Traffic Act 1988 (c. 52), after section 80 (approval marks) insert&#151;


<br>
&quot;80A   RETRO-REFLECTIVE MARKINGS


<br>
The Secretary of State may by regulations made by statutory instrument require the fitting of retro-reflective tape complying with ECE 104 to international category vehicles N2 and N3 and on goods trailers under the international classification 03 and 04 newly registered in the United Kingdom.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_79"></a>The noble Lord said: The aim of this amendment is to increase the safety of heavy goods vehicles with the fitting of retro-reflective markings principally along the side of HGV trailer units.
</p>

<a name="50704-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>With your indulgence, I shall take a moment to explain the reasoning behind the need for such a clause. Goods vehicles represent 1.4 per cent of all licensed motor vehicles in the UK, yet 15 per cent of all fatal casualties in road accidents in 2003 were the result of an accident involving an HGV. Occupants of commercial vehicles account for only 8 per cent of all casualties on trunk roads, yet accidents involving these vehicles account for 26 per cent of the total.
</p>

<a name="50704-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>The contribution of HGVs to road fatalities is therefore disproportionate to the number of such vehicles in use. Action needs to be taken to help prevent accidents involving HGVs and reduce the number of people killed and injured.

</p>

<a name="50704-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>Forty-two per cent of all fatalities from road accidents occur in darkness, even though the Department of Transport admits that traffic is lighter at night-time. In the UK in 2001, there were more than 9,000 collisions where an HGV was struck by another vehicle. In 34 per cent of these cases the HGV was struck on its side. Recent research has found that 37 per cent of all side collisions with trucks at night occurred because they were seen too late. The same study also found that adding retro-reflective contour markings reduced accidents involving trucks and passenger cars under poor-visibility conditions by 95 per cent. The US Highway Traffic Safety Administration has found that the introduction of retro-reflective tape has reduced side-impact collisions with HGVs by around 17 per cent.

</p>

<a name="50704-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>There needs to be a greater role for passive lighting, such as reflective strips, to address this problem. Passive retro-reflective lighting works without the need of any   kind of power, as light from headlights from approaching vehicles is simply reflected back to drivers.
</p>

<a name="50704-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>Current UK regulations state that all HGVs in the UK must be fitted with rear retro-reflective markings that meet certain prescribed standards. However, the UK does not currently require retro-reflective markings to be fitted to the side of such vehicles. The problem of side-impact collisions with HGVs is therefore not addressed.
</p>

<a name="50704-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>Already, some of the large distribution groups, such as Sainsbury&#039;s and Marks & Spencer, have voluntarily adopted such markings on their long and heavy vehicles, and we are seeing a growing number of European countries adopting similar measures.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_437"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 437</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50704-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>The overall cost of such a step would be minimal compared to the cost associated with accidents on UK roads. A study conducted by the department this year found a significant cost benefit for fitting retro-reflective line markings to the rear and side of HGVs newly registered in the UK.
</p>

<a name="50704-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>The most effective way of implementing such a scheme in the first instance would be to require all newly built vehicles to comply. This would avoid imposing a heavy financial burden on fleet operators in retro-fitting all vehicles at the same time.
</p>

<a name="50704-07_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>In conclusion, reducing side impacts with HGVs by enhancing visibility would significantly reduce the number of people killed or injured on UK roads. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="50704-08_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Simon </b>   moved, as an amendment to Amendment No. 51, Amendment No. 52:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>Line 8, leave out from &quot;to&quot; to end of line 9 and insert &quot;all vehicles first registered on or after 1st January 2006&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50704-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>The noble Viscount said: The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, has reminded me that I have not declared certain interests. I should have done so last week. These include being president of GEM Motoring Assist; president of the Driving Instructors&#039; Association&#151;and I hold the latter&#039;s &quot;diamond&quot; advanced driving certificate; and a member of the Institute of Advanced Motorists. I hold a gold driving certificate from RoSPA, I am police class 1 trained, and I still do advanced roads policing traffic courses. In addition to that, I still go out regularly on traffic patrol. Unfortunately my noble friend Lord   Davies of Oldham is not in his place, but I was in the area where he lives only last Friday night.
</p>

<a name="50704-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>My Amendment No. 52 is an amendment to Amendment No. 51 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord   Hanningfield. His amendment is excellent, but I wonder whether it goes far enough. Consider a car at night travelling at the national speed limit on a motorway which is the first to come across a large vehicle crashed into the central reservation and lying side-on to the motorway. The driver of the car will, in all probability, not see the large vehicle and will collide with it. The car driver will almost certainly be caught in the collision. If the large vehicle has reflective tape affixed to it, the chances of a crash happening are reduced, as the vehicle will be seen sooner. That aspect has been addressed by the noble Lord.
</p>

<a name="50704-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>That is all well and good, but why is the safety proposal limited to large vehicles only? If one car hits another in similar circumstances, death, once more, is certainly inevitable. So my amendment proposes that all vehicles should have reflective tape affixed all around, thereby adding to their visibility in the dark.
</p>

<a name="50704-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, addressed the cost of the fixing of reflective tape. I am led to believe that it will not be significant&#151;less than half a tank-full of fuel. That is considerably less than the insurance implications of a crash. I have reflective tape fixed to my vehicle and so does my wife.

</p>

<a name="50704-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>Members of the Committee may believe that as number plates are already made of reflective material the small vehicle would be seen well in advance of approach. That is why I have specifically talked about vehicles side-on. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="50704-08_spnew1"></a><b> The Earl of Dundee: </b>   I support the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Hanningfield. As he said, research indicates that retro-reflective markings on HGVs can prevent a great many crashes and nasty accidents. I know that the UNECE is in favour of the measure. It could be applied to all heavy goods vehicles and, indeed, as the noble Viscount, Lord Simon, advocated, it could even be applied to all vehicles. Research suggests that it would in particular be a good idea to apply it to heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="50704-08_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </b>   I support the amendment but remind the Committee that some of the dodgiest trailers are not operated by HGVs but are likely to be home-made or agricultural. I therefore believe that the amendment should include such vehicles.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="50704-08_spnew3"></a><b> Earl Attlee: </b>   I have rather more sympathy for the amendment, but I am concerned about the need for a competitive market in this material. The market appears to be dominated by one supplier and I have found the material to be rather expensive for what it is. I could use it on some of my equipment, but the cost deters me. Before accepting the principle of the amendment, I urge the Minister to review the market. She needs to see at least three manufacturers and several wholesalers.
</p>

<a name="50704-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>However, I am absolutely convinced that the reflective tape is extremely effective. I do not believe that we need a few reflective plates on the side of a vehicle, as we have on the rear, but that the whole outline of HGVs should be covered in the material. In a side-impact accident, the motorist does not realise that a lorry is in front of him.
</p>

<a name="50704-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>As on the first day in Committee, other Members have made the precise point that I wanted to make. The noble Viscount, Lord Simon, spoke of the possibility of a road-traffic accident, immediately after which there are no vehicle lights. It is therefore easy to run into the remains of that accident. There is also the possibility of a total electrical failure on a goods vehicle.
</p>

<a name="50704-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>The amendment tabled by the noble Viscount, Lord Simon, seeks immediately to make it a requirement for all HGV vehicles to be fitted with retro-reflective tape&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="50704-08_spnew4"></a><b> Viscount Simon: </b>   All vehicles.
</p>




<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="50704-08_spnew5"></a><b> Earl Attlee: </b>   I would not go so far as making it a requirement for all vehicles, but would suggest that it applies to all new vehicles immediately and after five years to all HGVs. The reason for that is that when the vehicle is operated by its second owner it is more likely to become involved in operations that are not reckless but where an accident is more likely to occur.

<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="50704-08_spnew6"></a><b> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </b>   The noble Earl referred to a rather high cost for marking the sides of an HGV. Will he give some impression of what that price might be?
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="50704-08_spnew7"></a><b> Earl Attlee: </b>   Unfortunately I have come to the Committee ill prepared, but suffice it to say that it is enough to deter me from using the material.
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="50704-08_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   I am grateful to noble Lords for their contributions to this short but useful debate. I understand the Committee&#039;s interest and concern about the use of retro-reflective tape. I share the interest and concern of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. However, power to regulate the use of the material is already available and therefore the amendment is unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="50704-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>Previous research indicated the potential for increased visibility to reduce accidents by the wider fitment of ECE regulation 104 reflective tape, but it also highlighted disproportionate cost. The Department for Transport commissioned a new review of the benefits and costs of mandating the use of such material on goods vehicles, trailers and large passenger-carrying vehicles. Its final report, <i>Assessment of the safety benefit of retro-reflective markings on HGVs and buses</i>, was issued on 18 May, and copies are available in the Library.
</p>

<a name="50704-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>The review updated our understanding of the issue. I hope that the Committee will see that we are being positive about Members&#039; suggestions. It also updated our understanding of the costs involved in applying retro-reflective tape. It also indicated a more favourable cost/benefit ratio, compared with the earlier research, for the application of such tape to some categories of vehicle. My department will now consider how best, including wide consultation, to take this forward.
</p>

<a name="50704-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>The issue of mandating retro-reflective tape for all vehicles, as my noble friend suggests, has not arisen before. Any advantages and disadvantages, such as a possible reduction in the ready recognition of slow-moving, abnormal and indivisible loads and their retro-reflective marked escorts, have not been researched. It would be wrong to give guarantees on the basis of so little research. However, the department will keep in mind my noble friend Lord Simon&#039;s view on the matter. I hope that with that explanation he will withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="50704-08_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   Will the noble Baroness confirm that powers exist, if required, for the Government to require it to be fitted to heavy goods vehicles? That was a particular concern of mine.

</p>

<a name="50704-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>My noble friend Lord Attlee suggested that the cost was for only one supplier, but with market forces as they are I would have thought that other people will start making the stuff if a great deal is to be required; and there should be commercial opportunities for other people. Therefore, if considerably more tape were to be used the costs might come down.
</p>

<a name="50704-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>I would like to confirm that powers already exist and that therefore the Government could do this now without any amendment to the legislation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="50704-08_spnew10"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   Yes, I can confirm that powers exist by means of regulation through a statutory instrument under the Road Traffic Act 1988. The noble Lord makes a good point about the market. Should circumstances change, the market will respond accordingly.
</p>

<a name="50704-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>The noble Lord talked about side impact. He will know that the UK already has reflex reflectors and repeater lights on many vehicles, but I realise that he is talking about increased visibility through marking that would go along both the rear and the side of vehicles. Yes, the powers exist and yes, because of the updated research, we are reconsidering the matter.

</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="50704-09_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield </b>   moved Amendment No. 53:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>After Clause 14, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_2"></a><br>
   &quot;Cycle lights

<br>
   A pedal cycle fitted with a flashing or pulsating white or red light shall be deemed to satisfy the lighting requirement of the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 (S.I. 1989/1796).&quot;</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>The noble Lord said: Under the Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations 1989, a cycle fitted with a pulsating or flashing light is not lawfully lit. Many cyclists recognise the importance of making themselves visible to other motorists and road users, and many purchase flashing or pulsating lights or lights that are comprised of light-emitting diodes. Many of them purchase that equipment in cycle shops, not realising that, technically speaking, if they use them on their cycle, it will not be properly lit for the purposes of the 1989 regulations, unless the lights are used in addition to other fixed lights.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_441"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 441</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50704-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>The police may not enforce that law much because they recognise that it is better to have a cycle with a pulsating or flashing light, albeit an illegal one, than one with no lighting at all. The significance of the existing ambiguity in the law is found in the civil courts: if a cyclist is involved in an accident, civil liability is based on whether they were complying with the road traffic laws. If the cyclist has a pulsating or flashing light, but no other illumination, it is possible that they will be regarded as having breached the law on lighting requirements, reducing their chances of receiving damages and perhaps raising the issue of contributory negligence. That is a significant issue for cyclists and road safety.
</p>

<a name="50704-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>Many cyclists have used their judgment and reached the conclusion, which many road users share, that a cycle with a flashing or pulsating light is probably more visible than one without. The need for technical consistency to prevent any flashing or pulsating lights being used on the highway other than by emergency vehicles has been eroded by the effluxion of time and the behaviour by cyclists on our streets.
</p>

<a name="50704-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>If the noble Baroness is unable to accept the amendment today, she is guilty of giving out mixed messages: on the one hand the Government cannot accept white pulsating lights, but on the other it is giving a wink and nod that their continued use is acceptable. It is time that we cleared up that anomaly, moved with the times and accepted that technology in this case has the ability to save countess lives and needless injuries.
</p>

<a name="50704-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>This is a sensible and common sense-based amendment, and I hope that the noble Baroness, being the sensible and commonsense person that she is, will be able to accept it. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="50704-09_spnew3"></a><b> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </b>   This is the third of the   visibility amendments and perhaps not the strongest of the three. I go along with the noble Lord, Lord   Hanningfield. I wish that all cyclists were lit. Far too many are riding around without any lights at all.
</p>

<a name="50704-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>Sometimes I see people cycling with flashing or pulsating lights attached to their helmets, rucksacks or visibility belts. I presume that that is not lawful. I wonder whether the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, will be able to tell us about that.
</p>

<a name="50704-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>As somebody who has been a cyclist over many years I have often wondered why the fitting of lights to bicycles is not a compulsory part of the construction. There is no guarantee that they would continue to work for ever but it would be a good start.
</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="50704-09_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Oppenheim-Barnes: </b>   I very much support the amendment because it is about standardisation and ease of enforcement. Both are greatly needed given that, in many cases&#151;and obviously with notable exceptions&#151;the behaviour of cyclists is so horrendous.
</p>

<a name="50704-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>On several occasions at Question Time in your Lordships&#039; House we have had several replies about the number of motorcycle accidents and deaths and the number of motorcyclists who occupy National Health Service wards. I do not believe that we have had a Question or an Answer about pedal cyclists, but I <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_442"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 442</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

suspect that the rate of accidents is very high with very serious injuries to the cyclists themselves. It is very rare that the motorist will be harmed. Therefore any measure of this nature&#151;particularly at night-time&#151;that will make cyclists more visible in a standardised and enforceable way is greatly to be desired.
</p>




<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="50704-09_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   As a regular cyclist, I very much support the amendment. I use a fixed and a flashing light, front and back, because it is very useful to be able to say that you comply with the law. However, if you watch anybody else&#039;s lights, the ones that stand out are the flashing ones, as other noble Lords have said. It makes an ass of the law that you cannot use flashing lights but you can used fixed ones, when the flashing ones are said to be much better.
</p>

<a name="50704-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>When we were debating the Railways and Transport Safety Bill two or three years ago, I remember either my noble friend or his predecessor saying that the Transport Research Laboratory was still doing tests on the compatibility of flashing lights. Three years have passed. How long does it take to test a cycle light?

</p>

<a name="50704-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>Flashing lights are not cheap. The good ones cost around &#163;20, which is probably more than it costs to put reflective tape around a lorry. As other noble Lords have said, it is a very important measure to take. It is one means of protecting yourself from being hit by somebody else; of demonstrating that you want to be seen; and helping the majority of cyclists who do try to obey the law do so without having to buy so many lights. It is about time that these experiments were completed and that a set of high quality and reasonably prices lights was available at all cycle shops.
</p>

<a name="50704-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>I have just one word of warning. I switched on my light on Oxford station platform one day this winter and was told that I must not have the cycle lights on while on the station platform because it could be misinterpreted for a train in distress. I had a bit of a giggle about that but I am sure that the person who told me was right. More seriously it really is time that this matter was resolved. The amendment gives the Minister the ideal opportunity to do so.

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>I can understand the noble Lord&#039;s desire to allow the use of flashing lights on pedal cycles, and I share his interest in that area.

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>The noble Viscount said: I do not have much to say about this amendment. The Explanatory Notes on graduated fixed penalties refer to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;the circumstances of the particular offence . . .  the nature of the offence, [and] its severity&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>The penalty will become totally standard: neither the severity nor the circumstances will be taken into account. If someone exceeds the speed limit by a certain amount, they will get a certain number of points. I find it inconsistent that the number of points on a driver&#039;s licence should be reduced to two instead of three. That is the main reason why I want the variation to be between three and six.

</p>

<a name="50704-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>Any police officer on traffic patrol who pulls someone up for exceeding the speed limit will, and can, take into account such circumstances, whereas a safety camera cannot. I recall stopping someone who had been driving at just over 90 mph in a 60 mph zone. The   driver was driving perfectly safely and the circumstances were such that, although theoretically he should have been disqualified, he was sent off with only a ticking-off. In such situations, discretion can be exercised according to the circumstances of the offence. Three penalty points, not two, should be the minimum. I beg to move.

<a name="50704-10_spnew1"></a><b> The Earl of Dundee: </b>   In supporting the noble Viscount, Lord Simon, on Amendment No. 57, I should like to address Amendment No. 61, also included in this group, on graduated fixed penalties for speeding. The amendment would ensure that the minimum penalty for speeding remained at three points in urban areas where vulnerable road users are most at risk. A range of three to six points would apply in 20 and 30 mph zones elsewhere, and a range of two to six could apply elsewhere.

</p>

<a name="50704-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>The principle of graduated penalties for speeding is a positive one. However, there are serious flaws with   the proposals circulated in the Government&#039;s discussion document last year. It included a penalty of two points for driving at up to 39 mph in a 30 mph zone. Reducing penalties in those areas sends the wrong message to drivers about the safety and acceptability of exceeding the speed limit by relatively small margins. A lower penalty for exceeding the 30   mph limit would suggest that breaking the speed limit is thought by the Government to be less serious than at present. It undermines much of the progress on speed awareness achieved by the THINK! campaign.
</p>

<a name="50704-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Lower penalties for speeding are unlikely to have a positive result in terms of road safety, and at worst may lead to excess speed becoming more prevalent. In particular, a lower penalty for driving at up to 39 miles per hour in a 30 miles per hour zone would be undesirable. For pedestrians struck by a vehicle, the shift from mainly survivable to mainly fatal injuries occurs between 30 and 40 miles per hour. A pedestrian is more than twice as likely to be killed at 40 miles per hour as at 30. The risk to car occupants also rises exponentially between 20 and 40 miles per hour. This   suggests that encouraging compliance with the 30 miles per hour limit is of key importance. A reduced penalty for driving at up to 39 miles per hour undermines this. If a lower penalty comes to apply, consideration should be given to only applying it in speed limits of 40 miles per hour or above, to reflect the increased risks posed by speeding in villages and urban areas.
</p>

<a name="50704-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>It has been reported in the press that the proposals for lowering the penalty resulted in part from a concern about the economic and political implications of driver disqualification. It should be noted, however, that despite the recent sharp increase in the number of penalty points issued for speeding, the number of drivers disqualified for totting up or for speeding has remained static over the last 10 years. This suggests that the present system may be successful in persuading speeding drivers to change their behaviour.
</p>

<a name="50704-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>Ministers have previously indicated that the speeds at which different penalties will apply should be determined by regulation after further consultation. Therefore, this is a good moment for the Minister to reassure us that the proposal that goes to consultation will not contain the option of a lower penalty in built-up areas.

<a name="50704-10_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen: </b>   I support both the previous speakers, and remind the House that I am the President of RoSPA, part of the Safer Streets Coalition&#151;which is 29 social justice organisations from all sectors of society, who have united to raise concerns about the impact of road danger on transport choice, health, social inclusion and quality of life.
</p>

<a name="50704-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>The Safer Streets Coalition welcomes the principle of graduated fixed penalty points. However, they had expected the mechanism to be used only to vary penalties upward, in order to change driver attitudes to speeding and to discourage repeat offending. This was <br>&nbsp;<br>

indicated in the 2000 consultation, <i>Road Traffic Penalties</i>. The coalition strongly objects to a reduction in points and fines.

</p>

<a name="50704-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>There is no evidence that lowering the penalty for   speeding will improve road safety. Speed, whether   excess&#151;breaking the posted speed limit&#151;or inappropriate&#151;driving too fast for the conditions&#151;is a contributory factor in as many as one in three road deaths. Despite this, speeding is treated more leniently than any other offence that can kill and maim. The Bill&#039;s proposals send entirely the wrong message to drivers. I firmly believe this, and ask the Government to think again on the issue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="50704-10_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I have tabled Amendment No.   58 and Amendment No. 60 in this group, which are similar to ones the other day&#151;probing amendments, highlighting that the Government are making a mistake in simply equating the gravity of a speeding offence with the extent to which the limit was exceeded. It is apparent to everyone who has studied the subject that the circumstances in which speeding takes place are important. I do not agree with some of the earlier comments that&#151;always&#151;exceeding a speed limit of 30 miles per hour is the same offence.
</p>

<a name="50704-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>I think some 58 per cent of road users in urban areas often ignore speed limits. It is important that the motorists accept the speed limits, and it might be that at some times we need to be more flexible about changing speed limits. At some times, such as outside a primary school during the day, even if it is in a rural area, the limit needs to be 20 miles per hour. But it might be a very good road at 12 o&#039;clock at night, when you would have a job to convince a driver that he should travel past that school at only 20 miles an hour.
</p>

<a name="50704-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>As we have heard in this Chamber, there are many different views on this subject. The Government have referred to the gravity of the offence and the amendments seek to probe what the Government have in mind in regard to how the gravity of the offence will be assessed. As my noble friend Lord Dundee said, the matter is going out to consultation, and many views will be submitted before the Government reach a firm conclusion. However, at this stage of the Bill we should know more about the Government&#039;s thinking on how they intend to determine the new points system.

<a name="50704-10_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   I remind the Committee that I am a member of the Thames Valley Police Authority. I have discussed with the officers concerned how a graduated system would be administered.
</p>

<a name="50704-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>Many motorists already contest the evidence produced of a speeding offence with a fixed penalty, whether detected by a speed camera, a mobile van or a traffic policeman. The more graduations you produce in the system the more correspondence you will get. People will argue that they were going a little slower in order to receive a lower penalty&#151;obviously they will not argue that they should receive a higher one&#151;and the police are already burdened with a huge amount of   correspondence from motorists contesting the evidence produced.

<a name="50704-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>The police exercise discretion in making prosecutions&#151;for example, people are not prosecuted for going past speed cameras at 31 miles an hour&#151;but chief police officers obviously do not broadcast to everyone the kind of discretion allowed. But some discretion is exercised to allow for both the car speedometer being faulty and the camera equipment being faulty. People are not prosecuted for very minor offences.
</p>

<a name="50704-10_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>I draw attention to the huge number of people being prosecuted at the moment on the M4 motorway near Bristol, where three road workers have been killed and seven seriously injured because people are exceeding the 40 miles an hour limit by as much as 40 or 50 miles an hour. As the noble Baroness opposite said, speed kills&#151;and it kills many people.
</p>

<a name="50704-10_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>We have to be mindful of that but we must not load more bureaucracy on the police. Bureaucracy keeps policemen in the police station answering letters when they should be out doing other jobs.
</p>

<a name="50704-10_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>From the figures published last week, I believe that the county of Hampshire, which has resisted very firmly a reduction in traffic policemen, has done rather better than a number of others. Many other police forces have cut the number of people out on the road considerably.
</p>

<a name="50704-10_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>As the noble Viscount, Lord Simon, said, a roads policeman can exercise some discretion. He will know, for example, whether there is a school in the locality, whether it is a straight road in open country and good weather, whether it is an empty motorway at night. A speed camera, of course, cannot exercise discretion; it needs someone else.
</p>

<a name="50704-10_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>All films taken by cameras are passed through the eyes of someone, who refers them to a police officer if a very serious offence has been committed. Normally, a camera is able to verify if someone has grossly exceeded the speed limit, has overtaken on double white lines or indulged in dangerous driving, and the case is taken to court. But you will be opening a can of worms if you go down the road of variable penalties.

<a name="50704-11_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My name is attached to Amendments Nos. 57 and 59, and I remind the Committee that I am president of the Road Danger Reduction Forum. I believe that reducing the number of penalty points from a minimum of three to two for certain speeding offences is sending wholly the wrong message to drivers.

</p>

<a name="50704-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>Many noble Lords have talked about the relationship between the speed of vehicles and accidents, a subject which I expect will come back again many times today in the Committee. Government research shows that drivers are twice as likely to kill pedestrians or cyclists if they hit them at 35 mph instead of 30 mph. That, to me, is argument enough for not reducing from three to two the minimum points. I take the point of the noble Lord, Lord   Bradshaw, about complexity. Putting some of the limits up would be a good thing, but some pretty tight guidelines will have to be issued to reduce the amount of correspondence. Otherwise, as the noble Lord said, there <br>&nbsp;<br>

will be a complete clog-up of correspondence. However, we must recall that speeding is treated more leniently than any other offence which involves killing or maiming. I do not know why that is, but the proposal would send completely the wrong message. I see it as mere pandering to the rather extreme end of the driving lobby who seem to want to go as fast as they like, and say that only they know what a safe speed is. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.

<p><a name="st_106"></a>
<a name="50704-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Howie of Troon: </b>   It is not actually speed that causes the problem; it is impact. What noble Lords need to bear in mind is that the impact is proportional to the square of the velocity. Therefore speed is a secondary matter. If speed is multiplied by two, impact is multiplied by four. Now that is good enough reason to listen to what my noble friend Lord Berkeley has said.
</p>




<p><a name="st_107"></a>

<a name="50704-11_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   Then I am most grateful for that. I was getting just a bit muddled between his use of the words velocity and speed, since they are both the same thing when it comes to cars. My noble friend is quite right; and of course the mass and sharpness of the vehicle are factors as well. I am indeed grateful to him for his support.
</p>




<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="50704-11_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I too am grateful that the point of detail has been cleared up to the satisfaction of the Committee. On the more general point, I may be a little disappointing in view of the trenchant points that have been made. My defence for that is that the Committee will have recognised quite a range of viewpoints being expressed in our debate. I hear the criticism about the proposal that the range should extend down to two. Of course, we are aware of those points being made in our consultation. I also note that there is considerable support in some quarters for the range being to six.

</p>

<a name="50704-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>The reason why I shall be disappointing is quite straightforward. The Bill creates an enabling framework for the secondary legislation through which this issue needs to be resolved. We are presently involved in a consultation. This short debate is a happy contribution to that consultation and reflects fairly accurately the widespread public views on these issues. Yet it is secondary legislation on which we will debate these issues, and that is the appropriate place for the points range to be identified. I am therefore loath to engage in the degree of detail to which I have been seductively invited by everyone contributing to this debate. Even if there had been an absolute, unanimous expression of viewpoints across the Committee on this controversial issue&#151;a concept I can scarcely envisage&#151;and had I been able to guarantee that all of us gathered here represented the totality of the House in that unanimity&#151;I would still have maintained the point that I cannot accept the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_448"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 448</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

viewpoints and amendments today. That is because we   are concerned here with primary legislation, which creates the framework in which this debate is subsequently to take place.
</p>

<a name="50704-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>The consultation goes on: this debate is part of it. The Committee will recognise that the Government would not have indicated their range for this purpose if they were not convinced of one position to which the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, drew attention. We are not convinced of the case for a single penalty point for speeding. In every circumstance that we can envisage, the offence is significant enough for us to think that one penalty point would never be appropriate.
</p>

<a name="50704-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>Of course, at this stage, I am not prepared to commit the Government to the range of views expressed beyond that.

We are not seeking to delay with regard to this   issue. We have helped to prompt a significant public debate, which has been reflected in the views of noble Lords across the Committee, including those expressed by my noble friend Lady Gibson on the important representation of RoSPA. The noble Earl, Lord Dundee, also speaks on behalf of interest groups outside the House that are concerned about road safety and he is therefore reflecting a substantial body of public opinion.

It will be in the secondary legislation that will follow this Bill should it become an Act of Parliament.
</p>

<a name="50704-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>I merely reflect today that part of the process of consultation is to ensure that we have a full debate on all the issues involved.

If the evidence is furnished to the court&#151;it could be evidence of murder for that matter, we are not necessarily talking about road safety&#151;it is not the place of secondary legislation to lay down what the penalty should be. It should provide penalties that the court may, taking into account the circumstances, inflict.

<p><a name="st_115"></a>
<a name="50704-11_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   Of course, that is entirely right. I am not seeking to contradict that point. It is the responsibility of the courts to deal out the punishment related to the offence, but we are talking about the range within which the penalty points should be identified. I am merely indicating that we are consulting on it. I heard what my noble friend Lord Berkeley said. I could satisfy him by narrowing the range. I certainly would not satisfy the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, by narrowing the range at this stage; he wants to extend it beyond that. I have just indicated the broad parameters in which the   Government have conditioned the debate and our broad thinking. We are not seeking to take away from the courts their responsibility; we seek to indicate the contours of the public debate.
</p>

My noble friend Lord Berkeley had a good try at making me define things narrowly in the Bill, but I hope not to concede to that at this stage. I hope that the House will recognise that we have had a good debate and identified what is at stake. Everyone who is involved in the issues is well exercised about the consultation period. Everybody recognises that, in due course, secondary legislation will be proposed that will give this House and the other place a chance to take definitive decisions on such proposals.

<a name="50704-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>Amendment No. 76 would take that a bit further, as it provides for what I call an &quot;electronic traffic sign&quot;, the definition of which is in subsection (6) of the amendment. It is a little radio transmitter whose output is modulated so that suitable equipment on the vehicle will readily reveal the prevailing speed limit. That is a prerequisite for adaptive speed control and could be useful at high-risk locations, such as outside schools.

It is difficult, but if the speed limit is 20 miles an hour, it is usually very important that it is adhered to. Electronic traffic signs would make it much easier to comply with speed limits. I do not believe that in volume production, such devices would be expensive&#151;certainly no more expensive than a free-standing conventional traffic sign.
</p>

<a name="50704-12_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>There are alternatives, such as GPS and even electronic maps showing where all the signs are. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, will shortly speak to his amendment to ban equipment providing warning of the location of cameras. The amendment does not refer to GPS, but it does so implicitly. I cannot support the amendment as drafted, but it might be sound to allow a device that reveals the proximity of a camera if&#151;and only if&#151;it also gives an audio-visual warning that the speed limit is being exceeded.
</p>

<a name="50704-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>The topic is linked to Amendment No. 168, which was also tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, and which the Committee will consider later. It covers vehicle data-recording devices and links into the issue of road-user charging, which is receiving much inaccurate and unhelpful comment from the media. We are near to providing assistance to motorists so that they can easily comply with speed limits.

<a name="50704-12_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   I wish to speak to Amendment No.   66, which the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, kindly discussed very adequately, even though he does not support it. The purpose of Amendment No. 66 is the opposite of the amendments in this group standing in the noble Earl&#039;s name. Amendment No. 66 would prohibit people knowing where speed cameras were, on the basis that, if they do not know where they are, there may be some hope that they will keep to the speed limit at all times, rather than just when they know that they are approaching a camera.
</p>

<a name="50704-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>As the noble Earl said, GPS-based camera warning devices cannot detect when a camera is active, but they can detect camera sites.

about where speed cameras are&#151;be they fixed, moving, or whatever type&#151;as that would enable them when approaching a camera to jam on their brakes, as one often observes.
</p>

<a name="50704-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>Some noble Lord will probably say that such a device is dangerous as, if a driver jams on the brakes too suddenly, the car behind, which is also speeding, will run into them. I do not accept that. I believe that   having the equipment that we are discussing constitutes an invitation to drivers to speed when they know that there is no camera. That is not the reason that we are here tonight; we are here to try to get people to limit their speed to the legal speed limit and thereby reduce accidents.

I do not agree with the amendments in this group standing in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Attlee. Speed camera boxes often do not contain speed cameras; in fact, few of them do. Speed cameras are expensive, whereas the boxes are relatively cheap. Therefore, it is something of a confidence trick.

<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="50704-12_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   The fact is that you need evidence. Cameras are moved around from place to place according to the severity of accidents and the number of people committing an offence. However, mobile devices are available, particularly mobile automatic number plate recognition devices. They do not catch many people who are speeding, but they catch many criminals, disqualified drivers, people who have skipped bail and people who are wanted for criminal offences.
</p>

<a name="50704-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>I hope that the Minister will cover a matter about which I am particularly concerned; that is, that no car should contain a device that tells the driver that a camera is active. It is one thing to have a map or a GPS system that indicates the site of a box&#151;it was wrong to paint them yellow; the decision to do that was wrong&#151;but there should not be a device in a car that tells you whether a camera is active. One of the groups of people who would make most use of that are not speeding motorists but the criminal fraternity in general, who would pick out any device that the police care to use to enforce the law.
</p>

<a name="50704-12_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, is right about the matter. I am interested not just in jamming but in the devices that I have seen that sit on the windscreen and give a little whizzing noise to indicate that there is an active camera in the area. I am particularly concerned about those.

<a name="50704-13_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen: </b>   I rise briefly to support Amendment No. 66 moved by my noble friend Lord Berkeley. The Safer Streets Coalition also supports this amendment. It points out that the logic that argues for a ban on devices that can detect operational equipment also applies to GPS-based technology used to alert drivers to the location of safety cameras. In both cases, the devices encourage drivers to remain within the speed limit only where they know there is a risk of detection. That reduces speed limit compliance rates and increases the risk of crashes away from camera sites. If drivers stuck to the legal speed limit, they would not need equipment that detects speed cameras.

They are inconsistent: an alert driver would know that he was driving at the appropriate speed within the speed limit. The noble Lord, Lord Monson, talked about having his eye on the speedometer all the time. If it takes a second to look at the speedometer, how long does it take to look at the rear vision mirror or the door mirror? I do not know. It is probably exactly the same amount of time. That argument falls.

It is not impossible for people to drive in the appropriate gear for that speed.

They come round a roundabout at the end of the road, and they have about a quarter of a mile to go until they reach Finchley Road where they can turn to go to Glasgow and other desirable places. It is a straight lane. They whiz along as though they are in a hurry to get to Glasgow. I understand that, but they cannot all be in a hurry to get to Glasgow. Why on earth should they not be stopped from misbehaving in my lane, where I have lived for 50 years?

<a name="50704-13_spnew5"></a><b> Earl Ferrers: </b>   Perhaps the Minister could help me, because I am not sure what is and what is not proposed to be legal. I should declare an interest, in so far as I have a little instrument in my car that goes &quot;peep, peep, peep&quot; when it approaches a camera. That is an enormous help. My reaction is that I not only slow down but then tend to stick to the speed limit. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, says that people do not do that&#151;they slow down for the camera and put their foot down afterwards. It is true that that happens on occasion, but, in my experience, these instruments have greatly assisted people in keeping to the speed limit. I hope that the Minister will not say that such instruments will become illegal, because that would be a pity.
</p>

<a name="50704-13_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>The Government were right to paint the cameras yellow, because previously they were creepy-crawly and deceptive and were trying to catch people out. As the Minister said at the time, their purpose was to try to make people abide by the law, not to catch people. My understanding was that the devices in question would continue to be legal. I hope that they will&#151;not just for selfish reasons, but because they help people keep within the law, rather than, only just, break it.

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>There is often a camera placed at the bottom of a hill. If your car has cruise control and you keep to the limit, although you might have set your speed to 30   mph, you often find that by the time you reach the bottom you have increased to 35 or 40 mph and the camera catches you. That is matter of the placement of cameras. There is no question in my mind that camera detection devices help, because they treat people as reasonable individuals who can see a problem ahead.

I switch on cruise control and travel all the way there, except that every time I approach a speed camera, I have to brake, because some people gallop to the speed camera at 60 mph, slam on their brakes, slow down to 40 mph at the point of passing the camera, and then accelerate again. In practice, there is no advantage to galloping between cameras. However, I have observed that the vast majority of people do that, particularly during the rush hour, rather than obeying the law, as the noble Earl does, with or without technical assistance.

<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="50704-13_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   This has been a fascinating debate, which has led us through some technical areas, but some clear principles have been adumbrated. Although the amendments come from different perspectives, the objectives of the noble Earl, Lord   Attlee, are somewhat different from those relating to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley. I wish to identify the principles that underpin the legislation and why, therefore, I cannot accept the amendments, even though they have different perspectives.


</p>

<a name="50704-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>First, the effect of the noble Earl&#039;s Amendments Nos. 62, 63 and 65 to remove &quot;detection&quot; from the definition of speed assessment equipment detection devices and insert the word &quot;jamming&quot; would be to limit the range of the devices that the Bill would allow to be prohibited. It would reduce us to dealing with jamming devices. We do want to see such devices removed, because they directly interfere with the process of detection, and with the action of the police in seeking to identify someone potentially breaking the law. We are all agreed on that, and the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, has taken us some way with him in that respect.
</p>

<a name="50704-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>As currently worded, however, the provisions within the Bill mean that it would be possible to prohibit a vehicle being fitted with speed assessment equipment detection devices that detect or interfere with the operation of equipment used to assess the speed of motor vehicles, or to prohibit a person from using a vehicle carrying such a device. Jamming devices clearly interfere with the operation of speed enforcement equipment. That is in the Bill, and we do not need it reinforced any more. The amendments do not add significantly to that.
</p>

<a name="50704-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>Some people use jamming devices, although, mercifully, a relatively small number. The majority of speed assessment equipment detection devices in use, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_456"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 456</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

however, detect the presence of a speed camera or other police speed enforcement, and alert the driver&#151;the device referred to by the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, which gives him a helpful beep when it detects a speed camera. That device is not as benign as it may appear.
</p>

<a name="50704-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>This is where I will speak against the amendment of my noble friend Lord Berkeley. We are not against people being aware of where safety cameras are placed. That is why, even at the end of a delightfully scenic lane, like the one in which my noble friend Lord Howie lives, we put a garish yellow device that is clearly marked, and everyone knows what it is. It is preceded by a warning a little further away, which says that safety cameras are in operation in this area, and that they will detect people who break the speed limit.
</p>

<a name="50704-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>We are not opposed to people knowing where these cameras are. Quite the opposite: we want people to know, because the cameras are telling them that they are moving from one level of road activity&#151;where it is relatively safe, and higher speed limits are likely to pertain&#151;to an area where it is necessary to have speed cameras to enforce a limit with some certainty and to condition drivers&#039; activity.
</p>

<a name="50704-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>We have no objection to a positioning system working via satellite that informs a driver that they are   moving into areas where safety cameras are placed. Why should we? I see that my noble friend Lord Berkeley is going to tell me why we should.

<a name="50704-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   My noble friend says that the cameras are there to warn people of a changing circumstance. That may be the case sometimes, but the cameras are often in a particular spot on the road that has the same speed limit for several miles.

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>From what he is saying, it could be inferred that he is condoning people speeding until they reach the speed camera. I am sure that is not the case, but perhaps he can clarify that.

I am   chastened by the remarks of my noble friend Lord   Berkeley&#151;I did not want to indicate that all safety cameras fulfilled exactly that role.

I have indicated why I am not satisfied with the amendments tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, which relate solely to jamming and therefore narrow the scope of the Bill in relation to such equipment. I have also dealt with the well intentioned attempt of my noble friend Lord Berkeley to produce an amendment that would reduce the level of information about where fixed safety cameras are placed. I believe that their known positioning is to the benefit of road safety. That is why we make them so prominent. Those are two cardinal reasons why I reject the amendments.
</p>

<a name="50704-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>I come to the third point, which my noble friend Lady   Gibson raised. She asked whether, because we   were in favour of devices that informed road users of   the positioning of safety cameras, we were in favour of devices that go &quot;bleep&quot; whenever enforcement procedures are in place. They might not just go &quot;bleep&quot;; they might have a more sophisticated device that whispers in the ear all kinds of injunctions on how to tackle the problem. Whatever the device does, it is there to warn. We do not want those.
</p>

<a name="50704-14_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>Our provisions are intended to control areas of detection. Where police officers are engaged in necessary activity to restrain dangerous driving&#151;that is, speeding&#151;we do not want a situation in which people are warned that that activity is being conducted. It does not relate to the use of speed cameras, but the police have decided that action is necessary to improve road behaviour in a certain area. In that area, they move from place to place, aware that they have problems with accident rates or have been witnesses to excessive speeding, near escapes and all the issues that cause our heavily stretched police forces to set up cameras to guarantee that people respect speed limits.
</p>

<a name="50704-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>We accept the point on the GPS systems but reject my noble friend&#039;s idea that they should be available to drivers. However, we will not have available to people detection devices that tell them how police are operating in the area in which they are driving. That would interfere with the process of law enforcement, and it would do the very thing that my noble friend Lady Gibson was talking about. It is also the motive behind my noble friend Lord Berkeley&#039;s amendment.
</p>

<a name="50704-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>Are we creating a situation where people can drive with impunity at speeds beyond the limit because they have a device that tells them when they are likely to be   caught? No, we seek to remove that, which is the basis of the legislation.

The result is that you get so windy that you stick to the limit as far as you can. I hope I am right in believing that that is not going to be removed.

There are hundreds&#151;indeed, thousands&#151;of shops throughout the country selling equipment that, if I understand my noble friend&#039;s case correctly, would become illegal. Are those stores aware that that market will have to dry up?

<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="50704-15_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   In due course. We must be specific about the nature of the equipment. We are not at that stage on the detail yet. We are establishing the general principles of a Bill with which we promote safety and good conduct on our roads. All that I was saying is that the GPS system&#151;I used it as an illustration&#151;was communicating helpful information to the driver to ensure that he learnt early what we all learn with sudden effect when we see the clearly marked cameras with their great yellow boxes and the indication of the limits that they would impose by camera devices.

<a name="50704-15_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   The Minister just made a point about general principles, which is what I should like to ask him about. Both today and on the previous day when we debated this subject, he constantly mentioned safety cameras as opposed to speed cameras. I have regularly heard him say that they are not speed cameras, they are safety cameras. After he said that last time, I went to Notting Hill Gate to read the notice again. It clearly states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>&quot;Speed cameras are operating in this area&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>I have seen that in many places. Will all those signs be changed to read &quot;safety cameras&quot;? What is the position, the general principle, about speed cameras or safety cameras? Is one an outmoded title?
</p>




<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="50704-15_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   It is not a question of their nomenclature, it is a question of their purpose. They are safety cameras because it is announced to everyone just where they are. They are prominently displayed and the motorist knows exactly the device that may come into play to take the appropriate photograph if he breaks the speed limit in that area. That is a safety programme. It is nationwide; it is even found in the road of my noble friend Lord Howie. As I said, we are not against everyone knowing exactly where those cameras are placed, because they are part of the essential guarantees that our roads will be safer, because people will obey the speed limits in such areas.
</p>

<a name="50704-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>However, there are other occasions when the police need to enforce the law. It cannot all be policed through permanent, fixed safety cameras. I have told the Committee that we intend to remove the devices that identify police activity in the area.
</p>

<a name="50704-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 76. The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, has an interesting concept here: why should not speed limit traffic signs be electronic, because they would send out signals to individuals and give that additional helpful information immediately to the car driver that he may not have witnessed with his own eyes? I must say that car drivers who miss speed limit signs and say, &quot;I did not see them&quot; are not the safest people on the roads; that is why they are frequently prosecuted. But I understand what the noble Earl suggests, that that could be an additional form of safety.

</p>

<a name="50704-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>He will know that we have a very large number of speed limit signs. I gulp as I say this but there are more than 300,000. I do not have a figure at the moment for the cost of each individual electronic device, but the Committee will recognise that would involve substantial expenditure for communicating information that, if the driver does not see with his own eyes, he is not driving with the care that he ought.

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>I understand the motivation behind the amendment, and, in due course, we may reach the stage where such an electronic device becomes required because of the nature of road traffic in this country. We just do not think that the cost is justified at present.

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Simon, said that an alert driver would not speed. I disagree. If he speeds and is not alert, he is a real danger to himself and other road users. When the noble Viscount does his commentary drive with the police, he will have to point out a change in road surface&#151;he must be that alert and observant. The real danger is a speeding driver who is not alert&#151;not sufficiently alert to notice a speed camera.

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>I am not overly worried about the banning of detection devices. I am really interested in an electronic solution to help motorists comply with the speed limit and drive safely. The Minister himself said that there was no limit to what technology could do.

He and I may join forces and meet in the middle, perhaps by proposing at a later stage that we can allow GPS devices that squeak if you are exceeding the speed limit for the area but ban GPS devices that tell you where the camera is. We want people to adhere to the speed limit as soon as they enter the zone.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>After Clause 16, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_3"></a><br>
   &quot;DEFAULT SPEED LIMIT

<br>
(1)   The Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (c. 27) is amended as follows.


<br>
(2)   In section 81 (general speed limit for restricted roads), for subsection (1) substitute&#151;


<br>
&quot;(1)   It shall not be lawful for a person to drive a motor vehicle on a restricted road at a speed exceeding 20 mile per hour.&quot;&quot;.</p>




<p><a name="st_158"></a>The noble Earl said: This amendment would introduce a default 20 mile per hour limit in urban areas. Twenty mile per hour zones have been shown to be remarkably effective ways to reduce road deaths and injuries in urban areas, especially among children. They may also help to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_462"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 462</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

improve the quality of urban environments. In Hull and   elsewhere, properly enforced 20 mile per hour speed   limits have demonstrated a reduction in casualties by up to 70 per cent among child pedestrians and up to 60 per cent among other vulnerable road users.

</p>

<a name="50704-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>Some people have argued for a 20 mile per hour limit outside all schools. Although that would be beneficial, the school journey accounts for less than 20 per cent of child casualties. Children are also at risk where they live and play, and reducing speeds throughout residential areas would greatly increase child safety. A recent study by the Health Development Agency found that the expansion of 20 mile per hour zones to all residential areas could prevent 13,000 child pedestrian deaths and injuries&#151;equivalent to two-thirds of the total.
</p>

<a name="50704-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Instituting a default 20 mile per hour limit in urban areas would make 20 miles per hour the norm. However, local authorities would be free to set higher speed limits on suitable roads. Several local authorities, including Southwark and Camden, are already adopting that approach. To extend it nationally would save a great many more lives. I beg to move.

<a name="50704-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   I am not sure that I can match those last two short contributions, but I will do my best. My name is attached to the amendment and to Amendment No. 83A. We need to recognise something about a proposal as emotive as a 20 mile an hour speed limit in urban areas. Government figures indicate that the current rate of deaths for pedestrians and cyclists per distance unit of exposures are respectively somewhere between 17 and 19 times those of car occupants. In other words, if you are on the road cycling or a pedestrian on the pavement, your risk of being killed is 17 to 19 times higher than in a car.
</p>

<a name="50704-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>We need to reflect on what the roads and pavements are there for, because that does not represent a socially desirable balance between mobility and safety. It affects people&#039;s decision whether to walk or cycle rather than go by car. From the point of view of fitness, pollution and everything else, it is much better to walk or cycle, but if that clearly greater risk is reflected in the fear factor&#151;that people do not walk or cycle because they are frightened&#151;that is undesirable.

</p>

<a name="50704-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>For most roads covered by the amendment&#151;as the noble Earl said, local authorities do not have to designate all their roads to by 20 mile per hour zones; they can sometimes be 30&#151;that would send absolutely the right signal to car users, as well as pedestrians and cyclists, that that is a reasonable speed to which to limit yourself. It is sad that there is such a scarcity of these   zones. They probably occur only when there is tremendous pressure from pedestrians, cyclists or environmental groups. These will most likely arise <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>These amendments, or something like them, would send the right signals to local authorities and others, to consider 20 mph speed limits on the less well-used roads in urban and semi-urban areas. It would help people to reclaim the streets and use them for other things besides driving and make a major contribution to road accident reduction as well.

<p><a name="st_162"></a>
<a name="50704-16_spnew1"></a><b> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </b>   I wonder whether I am the only noble Lord present who does not know the   precise definition of a restricted road. Based on experience in my home in Clackmannanshire, I notice that there are a lot of signs which tell me that &quot;20 is plenty&quot;. They tend to be in the housing schemes, at the Braes of Tullibody for example, or else they are around the primary schools such as in Clackmannan and are indeed backed up by speed bumps. That strikes me as a good idea.
</p>

<a name="50704-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>I get the impression from the debate on this amendment however that those &quot;20 is plenty&quot; signs are not actually legal at present and are only advisory. It would be helpful if that could be clarified.
</p>




<p><a name="st_163"></a>
<a name="50704-16_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   I am not in favour of this amendment. If there is a need for a reduced speed limit for any reason, then yes, you should be able to put a sign saying, &quot;20&quot;. But to have it as the default is making it far too extensive. It would be better if we could teach children to cross at the correct crossing&#151;we used to have the very good green cross code that taught children that. Outside the schools there is nothing better than the lights which can be turned on at the hours the children are leaving rather than having traffic restricted all day when no child is coming out of the school, because then it discredits the sign and people will drive through without thinking that this is a moment when a child might be coming out.
</p>

<a name="50704-16_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, is an enthusiastic cyclist, but the way I see them coming up on the inside of the car when I am driving and crossing the traffic lights while the lights are still against them when I am on a bus, I am surprised that many more of them are not killed. Cyclists seem to be a law unto themselves and I would not want this restriction imposed upon everyone else on their behalf.
</p>




<p><a name="st_164"></a>
<a name="50704-16_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   From the Conservative Front Bench I would like to say that we do not support the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley; we do support the idea of a 20 mph speed limit when appropriate, but not a general blanket 20 mph approach. As my noble friend Lady Hanham said, and it is certainly the case in my own county, if one drove all the time at 20   mph one would often be overtaken by cyclists. Cyclists often easily go over 20 mph&#151;particularly in Essex. We do not support this amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_165"></a>
<a name="50704-16_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   We have had a variety of views in   our relatively short debate this afternoon. The <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_464"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 464</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government&#039;s road safety strategy recognises the problems in urban areas where speed is a contributory factor in many accidents and injuries, especially to more vulnerable road users. We take very seriously the concerns expressed in these amendments.

</p>

<a name="50704-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>The strategy therefore encourages the implementation of 20 mph speed limits and zones in the right situation, and has also made a commitment to develop and test practical solutions to improve the safety of main roads through urban areas, which often carry high volumes of traffic but also support high levels of pedestrian and cycle activity. In answer to the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, a restricted road is an urban street lit road.
</p>

<a name="50704-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>There are 10 mixed priority route demonstration projects under way looking at exactly how this situation can be improved. I would be very happy to speak with noble Lords about where the demonstration projects are around the country. I hope to persuade noble Lords that these amendments are therefore unnecessary.

</p>

<a name="50704-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>In relation to Amendment No. 67 tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Dundee, and my noble friends Lord Simon and Lord Berkeley, and proposed subsection (2) of Amendment No. 83A tabled by my noble friend Lord   Berkeley, Section 81(2) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 already provides a general power for the Secretary of State to increase or reduce the maximum speed limit on restricted roads by way of order subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.
</p>

<a name="50704-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>Furthermore, traffic authorities already have the powers to set a local speed limit through traffic order under Sections 82 to 84 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 where it is appropriate to adopt a speed limit other than 30 mph for restricted roads. Through the Road Traffic Regulation Act traffic authorities also have the powers to introduce a speed limit of 20 mph without obtaining consent from the Secretary of State.
</p>

<a name="50704-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>The purpose of proposed subsection (1) of Amendment No. 83A is to reduce the maximum speed limit from 30 mph to 20 mph on single carriageway restricted roads (urban street lit roads) without a centre white line.

</p>

<a name="50704-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>The department has no record of how many restricted roads do not have centre white lines so is unable to judge the immediate effect this amendment would have on speed limits. However restricted roads that vary in width may have centre white lines that are interrupted by intervals where there are none because of the different widths. The speed limit would fluctuate between 20 mph and 30 mph. This would be impractical and as such may   not have the full support of drivers, making enforcement difficult.
</p>

<a name="50704-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>The removal of centre white lines to make the road 20   mph would have the effect of substantially increasing speed limit signing. This may be an unwelcome financial burden on local authorities who may prefer to use this money to introduce proven traffic calming measures at sites where there is a history of speed related accidents.

</p>

<a name="50704-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>As I have already said the Government encourage the implementation of 20 mph speed limits. Research has shown that 20 mph limits and zones can reduce the number of accidents by two-thirds. However, it has also confirmed that 20 mph speed limits should generally be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_465"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 465</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

self-enforcing and that reducing the speed limit from 30   mph to 20 mph with no accompanying traffic calming features only reduces vehicle speeds by around 1   mph. The department therefore recommends that 20   mph speed limits are introduced only on those roads where vehicle speeds are already low, or where additional traffic calming measures are planned as part of the strategy. The existing restricted road network would clearly not fall into this category.
</p>

<a name="50704-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>There are also problems in that not all safety cameras&#151;or, thinking back to the last debate, speed cameras&#151;are type approved for use at 20 mph. The GATSO camera that currently appears on many restricted roads is for example only type approved for 30 mph and above. Traffic authorities determine local speed limits having regard to guidance issued by the department. We have recently consulted on updated guidance designed to improve clarity and deliver greater consistency of local speed limits across the country. I believe that that is the aim of the noble Earl&#039;s amendment.
<a name="time_15"></a>
<a name="50704-16_time0"></a><h5>6 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="50704-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>The traffic guidance also seeks to incorporate important wider factors such as quality of life through, for example, striking a better, more sensible balance between road safety, accessibility and environmental objectives, and taking better account of the needs of more vulnerable road users. It is a fundamental part of that guidance and the local speed limit process that traffic authorities give full and proper consideration to what is the right speed limit for individual roads, based on local needs and requirements and taking into account their wider management responsibilities. As well as improving safety, that also increases respect for, and compliance with, speed limits. As we know, if people see that there is a sensible and considered logic behind the imposition of speed limits on certain roads, they will be more likely to comply.

</p>

<a name="50704-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Through our wide-ranging Road Safety Strategy, we are improving the position of the most vulnerable road users. The number of child casualties, as pedestrians, cyclists and car passengers, has been reduced significantly, as has the number of adult pedestrian and cyclist casualties. I hope that, in view of that explanation, the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a>&quot;a road is a restricted road for the purposes of section 81 of this Act if there is provided on it a system of street lighting furnished by means of lamps placed not more than 200 yards apart&quot;.</p>

Local authorities are free to set higher limits as relevant. However, here I also take the point of my noble friends Lady Gardner of Parkes and   Lord Hanningfield. Certainly, we do not want the   default system to impose limits unnecessarily&#151;establishing 20   mph zones where they are not required&#151;and we do not want them to impose some practice throughout the day if that might be relevant for only part of the day.

<p><a name="st_170"></a>The noble Earl said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 69 to 73 and 81. The Committee will be aware of public and media concern regarding speeding and fatal accidents involving police vehicles. For instance, last Monday the <i>Daily Express </i>pointed out that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a>&quot;Home Office figures showed that the number of people killed   annually in accidents involving police patrol cars had risen 60 per cent to 31&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>That is approaching one per cent of all fatalities. I am grateful for the Minister&#039;s recent letter regarding one particular incident. The Committee would be wise to treat that matter as <i>sub judice </i>for the time being.
</p>

<a name="50704-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>I do not believe in regulation unless it is absolutely necessary. However, I suspect that the Committee will be extremely disappointed that a few police officers are severely damaging the police&#039;s reputation. I urge the Minister to draw to the attention of the Association of Chief Police Officers and chief constables themselves the pretty tough amendments that the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, and I have tabled. If they do not get their act together, Parliament will give them some pretty tough regulation. I beg to move.

noble Earl&#039;s amendments, I am afraid that I feel it necessary to probe a little further, probably so far as to make it very difficult for some emergency services to operate. However, my amendment, which goes further than that of the noble Earl, Attlee, reflects my concern about the situation with the police. I do not refer to the fire or ambulance services but police car activities are getting out of hand.
</p>

<a name="50704-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>The press reported a couple of weeks ago on a Written Answer in the House of Commons, on 20   June, that gave the latest figures for fatal, serious and other injuries caused by road traffic collisions, involving all the police forces in England and Wales. In 2003&#150;04 the figure had increased significantly from 1,259 in the previous year to 2,000. As I said at Second Reading, there is an extraordinary variation in the accident rate between police forces. That indicates that the national training scheme for drivers, which I believe now works quite well, is not working as well as it should.

</p>

<a name="50704-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>Amendment No. 71 would provide that police cars should obey speed limits unless responding to an emergency. I received a very interesting Written Answer from the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland. It says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;The police can only claim exemption from speed limits in restricted circumstances which are defined by statute&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>It says that they can exceed the speed limit,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;but only if the observance of the limit would hinder the vehicle in its purpose&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 14/6/05; <i>WA</i> <i>115</i>.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>We must consider what the purpose is.
</p>

<a name="50704-17_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>There have been examples of senior police officers driving at ridiculous speeds being caught by their own black boxes. We talked about that at Second Reading, so I shall not repeat it.
</p>

<a name="50704-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>As you go about the City of London, the West End, or other towns, you wonder how many of the police cars actually need to have their blue lights flashing and their horns bleeping. I have not had any satisfactory answer to that, so it would send the right signals to the police force if they were more restricted than at present.

</p>

<a name="50704-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>It may be that&#151;though it is not in my amendment because I did not have time to change it, but it provides the basis for discussion&#151;were all police cars fitted with black boxes, as many are at the moment, it would be   possible for the Independent Police Complaints Commission to produce an annual report on the number of times these cars had exceeded the speed limit, and to ask the forces to justify them. Perhaps something like that would send the right message to the police force. It may be fine to get to an incident as quickly as possible, but if they are going to put other people or themselves at risk to the tune of the accidents which came out in this Written Answer, then something needs to be done. It is unsatisfactory.

</p>

<a name="50704-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>The first part of Amendment No. 81 is the same as the amendment relating to the speed limit, suggesting that it would do no harm for police cars to obey traffic lights as well. Going through red lights at high speed can cause serious accidents, be they with pedestrians, cycles or other cars. Do they need to do that all the time?

</p>

<a name="50704-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>I welcome the fact that the Royal Parks Police are being integrated with the Metropolitan Police, but it is time they stopped driving down the footpaths in Hyde Park just to get to their station in the middle of the park a bit more quickly&#151;I assume to have tea or something. I cycle through the park regularly, and have seen them going at a speed which requires pedestrians to take avoiding action. They have not got their blue lights flashing. Why do they have to do it at all? We have 500 police officers who use bicycles, and that is fantastic. I do not think the motorcycle police or the police cars need to drive down the footpaths and cycle ways as they do in the Royal Parks for no particular reason.

</p>

<a name="50704-17_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>The other two parts of this amendment suggest that there needs to be some recording of speeding and other non-compliance with traffic regulations by police cars. A   check&#151;I have said by the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, but I think it should be the Independent Police Complaints Commission&#151;would send the right signal that the public have had enough of speeding police cars. Of course there are emergencies when they have to speed, but the issue is the frequency with which they do so. I have talked to a number of policeman who say they can disobey the speed limits, red lights or any other traffic sign if it is in the course of their business&#151;which includes going to work and, presumably, going to and from lunch. That is unacceptable.
</p>

<a name="50704-17_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>I do not think I have the right wording yet in this amendment, but I hope it will provoke discussion, and a reaction from the Minister.

<a name="50704-18_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Monson: </b>   I support the broad thrust of these amendments. Your Lordships will have read in the past few weeks of a case in the West Midlands&#151;Shropshire, I think&#151;where police cars were being tested at up to 83   miles per hour in urban areas and well over 120 miles per hour on the open road, in the small hours of the morning. I am not too concerned about what happens on the open road because there will be little traffic on the motorways at that time, but urban areas are different. It might not have been so bad a few years ago, when 99.9 per cent of the population was safely tucked up in bed at three or four in the morning. However, now the Government have, in their wisdom, permitted pubs and clubs to remain open 24 hours a day under the provisions of the Licensing Act 2003, it is a very different matter. You have a lethal combination of speeding police cars and drunken pedestrians.

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>I tabled a Question for Written Answer on this subject a couple of weeks ago and do not want to pre-empt the Answer, which I have yet to receive, but it is a dangerous state of affairs. It would be interesting to discuss the issue this afternoon.

Last year she was killed on a zebra crossing in Oxford, by a police car which was responding to a 999 call&#151;which could have been a hoax, though I am not sure. That was a tragedy.

</p>




<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="50704-18_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   I must intervene on that last point because the accident to which the noble Baroness referred was at 2 am in the morning on the Cowley Road. The police car was responding to an armed robbery. The police have strict rules or performance targets about responding to 999 calls. They are one of the key performance indicators&#151;much derided by some people&#151;that the Government set police forces. Responding to 999 calls and then attending the site quickly is one of the main things impressed on them.
</p>

<a name="50704-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>I will not take part in the whole debate about police forces, but be careful that we are not conflating one thing with another.
</p>




<p><a name="st_175"></a>
<a name="50704-18_spnew3"></a><b> Earl Attlee: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, makes an extremely important point, but my amendment seeks to separate the operational purposes that he talks about from other matters such as being late for a meeting.
</p>




<p><a name="st_176"></a>
<a name="50704-18_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, for making that point, and to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. We all sympathise enormously with the family that sustained the loss of the young woman in the way described by the noble Baroness, Lady   Masham. Of course, as the noble Lord, Lord   Bradshaw, indicated, the police on that occasion were working on the operational matter of a 999 call. I hear what the noble Lord says about important targets, but let us substitute for targets the necessity of protecting the public. That is the job of the police. We expect them to respond in an emergency. When the consequence is as calamitous and disastrous as the one described by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, then we all have the utmost sympathy, but we could not possibly envisage introducing into legislation a constraint on the police in these terms.

</p>

<a name="50704-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>Officers of the emergency services, whether police, ambulance, fire or the Serious Organised Crime Agency&#151;a new body established, as the House will recall, in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005&#151;have the right to be exempted from speed limits and traffic controls. They are specially trained to do this job and to meet these requirements. It is a recognition that we cannot have the concept of emergency calls unless we have these vehicles responding in a way which inevitably means that some risks have to be taken in regard to normal traffic laws and obligations. You cannot have a 999 call where the police respond at 20 miles an hour in a very restricted area or at 30 miles an hour in an area restricted to that speed.

</p>

<a name="50704-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>My noble friend Lord Berkeley is keen to emphasise with his amendments&#151;this is, of course, also the burden of the amendments of the noble Earl, Lord Attlee&#151;that we should ensure that there are procedures in place which guarantee, first, that these vehicles are driven outwith the law only in emergencies; and, secondly, that there is proper recognition of the seriousness of such an activity <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_470"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 470</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and that it is recorded. I can assure the Committee that such incidents are recorded and logged. It is not done by way of an annual report, as suggested by my noble friend Lord Berkeley&#151;that would be superfluous&#151;but they have to be logged and recorded.
</p>

<a name="50704-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>Of course, if a calamitous accident occurs, it is quite possible that the officers concerned can be properly charged with driving without due care and attention or even dangerous driving. It is likely, of course, that the officers will be able to erect the defence that they were authorised to meet an emergency call, but if it was for something as trivial as being late for a luncheon engagement, as my noble friend Lord Berkeley suggested, that would not be a defence.
</p>

<a name="50704-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>Nor would it meet the requirements of the supervising officers charged with the responsibility for ensuring that these vehicles are used only for operational purposes. They can break speed limits and other aspects of the law&#151;go across red lights and so on&#151; because they are responding to an emergency. It is therefore to the greater good because they are reacting to a situation where as fast a reaction as possible is needed.
</p>

<a name="50704-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>I understand that the amendments have been tabled to give an airing to public anxiety and disquiet about cases where people are injured and killed in accidents involving emergency vehicles. We cannot go through a year without every aspect of the emergency services being involved in some kind of tragedy associated with one of these activities. It is in the nature of the dangerous deployments required in response to emergencies.
</p>

<a name="50704-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>I could take the amendments apart on the basis of certain defective qualities in their wording but my noble friend Lord Berkeley, in particular, would not thank me for doing so. He often tables amendments in order that we should understand the nature of the issues rather than that they should be brought immediately into legislation. I am not going into the defective nature of the amendments.
</p>

<a name="50704-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>I want my noble friend and the Committee to accept that the procedures which he identifies and requires are already in force for these officers. I do not doubt that a debate such as this has the salutary effect of articulating the public anxiety that the exemptions to the law that we give can sometimes result in tragedy. But all those who operate under these exemptions from the law&#151;however skilled they are as drivers and however high their level of training&#151;still have a massive obligation to guarantee as far as possible that such activity is for the good and security of the public, and to ensure that there is not a threat to the public which the careless use of these exemptions would occasion. I can give my noble friend that assurance.
</p>

<a name="50704-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>I have heard what my noble friend said about the Royal Parks but, from time to time, police cars need to cross the Royal Parks in the way he outlined. Again he has taken the opportunity to air a grievance.
</p>

<a name="50704-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>I hope that I can leave it at that and that the noble Earl will withdraw this amendment and not move his   other amendments, and that my noble friend Lord Berkeley will not move his amendments.

responding to an emergency and, therefore, testing such cars at double or treble the speed limit&#151;no matter that it be in the small hours of the morning&#151;is very definitely to be discouraged and is almost certainly illegal?

   &quot;MOTORWAYS: MAXIMUM SPEED

<br>
   The maximum speed on a motorway shall be 80 mph and in other circumstances shall be determined by highway controllers and the police with access to the motorway warning signs system.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_183"></a>The noble Lord said: Contrary to most of the discussion we have had on the Bill today, the amendment suggests the raising of the speed limit in   certain circumstances. It seeks to introduce the concept of variable speed limits in response to weather conditions on motorways while raising the maximum speed limit to 80 miles per hour, thereby ensuring the most expeditious, effective and efficient use of our motorway network.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_472"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 472</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50704-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>I am aware that there are many statistics&#151;a number have been bandied around&#151;that oppose the raising of speed limits. No doubt powerful and convincing material can be brought to bear on both sides of the argument. The aim of the amendment is to achieve a simple and straightforward system of speed limits. We shall come to a number of other amendments on speed limits later, I notice.
</p>

<a name="50704-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>The amendment should not be branded as a cavalier approach to road safety when it is quite the opposite. Edmund King, the executive director of the RAC Foundation, has argued that there should be a review of speed limits and that travelling at 80 miles per hour in a modern car, on a good road surface and at a proper distance from the car in front, is perfectly safe.

</p>

<a name="50704-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>We all believe that low speed limits need to be imposed where vulnerable pedestrians are concentrated&#151;for example, close to schools and so on. We had an endless, very important debate about this earlier. It is sensible to keep the maximum speed limit on a motorway down to, say, 50 miles per hour in bad weather, when rain and ice increase braking distances. That is very effective now.
</p>

<a name="50704-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>The limit of 70 miles per hour on motorways was introduced at a time when most vehicles had drum brakes and there was an oil crisis. Since then, braking, steering and suspension systems have developed substantially, allowing drivers to brake more rapidly, safely and effectively. Technological advances mean that motorists can obviously travel more safely at higher speeds. Increased engine and aerodynamic efficiency, higher gearing and modern tyre technology also allow higher speeds. New developments in car technology allow the average motorist consistently to deploy full stopping abilities while retaining control and steering.

</p>

<a name="50704-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>Concerns have been raised about the environmental impact of raising speed limits. The increased emissions resulting from such a small change are not likely to be significant and, as we know, progress continues to be made with new cars to reduce dramatically the amount of toxic pollutants released in emission gases. As we said at Second Reading, traffic contributes only one- quarter of airborne particulates&#151;most of which are produced by large diesel engines in buses and heavy goods vehicles, which would not be affected by the change in speed limit. For example, a bus emits 120 times as much particulate as a car. The Association of British Drivers has shown that an increase in the motorway speed limit to 80 miles per hour would save approximately 11 million vehicle hours per year for cars, and 1.5 million hours for light goods vehicles. It would be a good way of reducing some congestion on our roads.

</p>

<a name="50704-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>The notion of variable speed limits on our motorways is not new, and has been used in the past on particular stretches of road such as the M25 due to poor weather conditions or weight of traffic. In fact, we would be lucky to go at 20 miles per hour most of the time on the M25, as we all know. While the Department for Transport has said that the idea had previously been rejected on road safety grounds, it has also made clear <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_473"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 473</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that it would be kept under review. It has been pointed out in another place that an estimated 19 per cent of those who travel on motorways already do so at speeds in excess of 80 miles per hour, while perhaps 50 per cent exceed 70 miles per hour. The law must be enforced, as we have said several times today, but it must also enjoy public support. It is a question of achieving the balance.
</p>

<a name="50704-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>Rather than holding on to the existing 70 miles per hour limit on motorways&#151;which so many see as arbitrary and not worthy of attention&#151;we should set realistic limits on all roads. That obviously means at times reducing the current limits, thus achieving compliance with limits that genuinely matter. This amendment will allow us to stop criminalising drivers who travel on our motorways at safe speeds.
</p>




<p><a name="st_184"></a>
<a name="50704-19_spnew2"></a><b> The Earl of Dundee: </b>   I believe that the effect of my noble friend&#039;s amendment would be to increase the frequency and severity of collisions. Not least are two   particular aspects of concern. First, there is the differential between 80 and 90 miles per hour. If the   motorway speed limit became 80 miles per hour, then motorists would tend to exceed it towards 90 miles per hour. Secondly, there are the relative speed limits between heavy goods vehicles and other vehicles. To increase this difference would add to the current danger of our motorways. Just now, the difference is between 56   miles per hour for heavy goods vehicles and 70 miles per hour for others. The current amendment, if adopted, would thus cause this difference to widen between 56 and 80 miles per hour respectively.
</p>




<p><a name="st_185"></a>
<a name="50704-19_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Cobbold: </b>   I strongly support this amendment. It seems to me to be a matter of common sense, and puts a little faith in the good sense of British motorists. That is long overdue as they are so often much maligned.
</p>




<p><a name="st_186"></a>
<a name="50704-19_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Attlee: </b>   I agree with where my noble friend is coming from. The fact is that the police accept 80 miles per hour in good conditions, yet they have the ability to prosecute on the absolute offence of 70 miles per hour if they detect a motorist driving at 80 in bad conditions. That is the reality, but of course it is also an uncertainty.

</p>

<a name="50704-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>It would be better to follow the good example of the variable speed limits on the M25. I would not have an upper legal speed limit, but would use variable speed limits on all motorways. It would make for more comfortable motoring, and probably reduce congestion by eliminating problems like bunching&#151;because it might be appropriate, for reasons of congestion, to stick to a constant 50 miles per hour. But then, the speed limits which are shown as variable should be strictly enforced. At the moment, we have an uncertain situation. Is it legal to go at 80 miles per hour on the motorway, or not? It is not legal, but the police tolerate it. To an extent, the principle is linked with my amendment about the electronic speed limits. It is a similar issue.

<a name="50704-19_spnew5"></a><b> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </b>   This proposal is, no doubt, quite tempting. Superficially, it could certainly be popular. There is a certain mantra which goes with it, about modern vehicles clearly being capable of going at <br>&nbsp;<br>

80 miles per hour. Many people already drive at 80 miles per hour&#151;certainly, at least, on the relatively empty motorways in Scotland&#151;and it would reduce bunching.
</p>

<a name="50704-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>I am, however, certainly opposing this amendment, on grounds which may indeed be boring; grounds like fuel economy, given the fact that vehicles are rarely fuel-efficient above 2,500 revs. I accept that there are now expensive cars geared to produce 2,500 revs at 70, but not usually at 80, except for the very expensive cars. It depends ultimately on the drive ratio which is fitted. Then there is the air pollution issue. Vehicles going above 2,500 revs will be producing more harmful gases. We are against that. Finally, there is the rising collision damage which comes from a large number of vehicles driving at that speed. So, the amendment may be good retail politics, but it is unsound.
</p>




<p><a name="st_188"></a>
<a name="50704-19_spnew6"></a><b> Viscount Simon: </b>   The variable speed limits have a lot to recommend them in controlling traffic flow, etc, and that is very good. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, mentioned distances between cars. How many people know the correct distance between them and the car ahead at a certain speed? Not many&#151;and not many can actually judge it. An experiment has concluded that that is correct; they do not know what the correct distance is.

</p>

<a name="50704-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>Although I understand what the noble Lord said, it would not work in practice. Not only that, but the noble Lord stated in great detail the advances in vehicle design, braking, etc. Yet he has not told us how the human body has evolved. The frontal lobes of our brains would still hit the front bones of our heads at the same speed as they did 200 years ago when we are involved in a crash, although we would not have had a crash at that speed on a motorway 200 years ago. Yet the psychology of the modern human is also unchanged. Those two things go against 80 miles per hour, but I do agree with the noble Lord&#039;s variable speed limits. Finally, the noble Lord quoted the Association of British Drivers. That is a very vocal body, with a membership of less than 3,000.

<a name="50704-20_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   I would like to support the amendment, though I would also like to ask a couple of questions in view of what other speakers have said. My noble friend Lord Attlee said that we can do 80 miles per hour. Now, I very conscientiously watch that I never go above 70. I find it quite terrifying that someone always sits right on my back bumper bar, and in a terrible position. I am always thinking &quot;What on Earth would happen if we have an accident? There is no way that this person could pull up&quot;. This is not in the fast lane&#151;I am either in the middle or slow lane, but wherever I am, someone will come within inches of my bumper bar. If I could do 80, maybe I could get away from them&#151;or maybe they would then go higher. However, I would like confirmation that the police will allow drivers to do 80, because that is very interesting.
</p>

<a name="50704-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>My other question is about these motorway warning sign systems, which certainly exist now on the M25. These are usually gantries with illuminated electric signs on them, which tell you that the speed might be   40, although it is normally a motorway speed. It is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_475"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 475</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

rather funny when one thinks of Fred Mulley, the Minister who introduced the M25. When he passed the plans he said, &quot;It will never be used&quot;, but by the time it was built it was already too small. The M25 is always crowded.
</p>

<a name="50704-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>I have been told that the illuminated electronic motorway signs&#151;the electric light signs&#151;are not enforceable. They are optional and you cannot be hauled up because they are not mandatory. Will the Minister clarify that for me because there seems to be a great lack of understanding about whether you are obliged to abide by those signs. Again, masses of people do not seem to. Are you or are you not obliged? I support the general principle of this amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="50704-20_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </b>   I would be very surprised if my noble friend, when he replies, is able to say that there is any public road in Britain on which a speed of 80 miles an hour is legal. There may be many motorways on which there is an absence of police patrols and people cheerfully speed above 70 miles per hour knowing that they will not get caught&#151;often in the absence of safety cameras to catch them as well. However, it is my understanding that there is no legal limit above 70 mph anywhere and I am sure that my noble friend will make that point.
</p>

<a name="50704-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>I oppose this amendment, not because I am in any way anti-motorist, but because, in a Bill that seeks to improve road safety, it would send an extraordinary signal if in an amendment we increased the speed limit. Nobody can argue that it is safer to travel faster. Therefore, we would be accepting that people are at present breaking the law and that that breaking of the law should be condoned. As the noble Earl rightly pointed out, if the speed limit goes up to 80 mph, the law will be broken at 90 mph or above, and that is even more dangerous than what is proposed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_191"></a>
<a name="50704-20_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Goschen: </b>   The fact is that the current speed limit of 70 miles an hour is in disrepute because it is so widely ignored by motorists. I note that the percentage of traffic that breaks the 70 miles an hour limit is quoted at 20 per cent. I should have thought that it was much higher, but none the less, let us accept that figure for the moment. The present position is that a law is not enforced. You can drive quite happily past a police car at 85 miles per hour and the policeman will not stop you.

</p>

<a name="50704-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>In response to the noble Lord who has just spoken, clearly, this is not an official policy. But it appears to be a <i>de facto</i> operational policy of the police. Therefore, if faced with a law that people generally choose not to obey, and are not chastised if they do not obey it, we should set a limit that reflects advances in motor car technology&#151;ABS breaks, better tyres and so forth&#151;and enforce that rigorously.
</p>

<a name="50704-20_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>We know that enforcement technology is changing very rapidly. We have not seen too many so-called safety cameras&#151;speed cameras&#151;on the motorway network to date, but undoubtedly, the prospect of raising substantial sums of revenue from the motorists will arise. I noted in a newspaper this morning that one <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_476"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 476</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

traffic camera on a motorway has raised &#163;1.2 million. I am sure that the Government will not ignore that. With better enforcement technology, the issue of speed creep will go away. It will become known that if you exceed the new 80 miles per hour limit you will be prosecuted and there will be no escape.
</p>

<a name="50704-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>I am quite sure that the Minister will stand up and say that this proposal would incite people to drive faster. I am not sure that that is necessarily the case. I should have thought that a limit that has the support of the motoring public that is then properly enforced would be the answer, so I support my noble friend.
</p>




<p><a name="st_192"></a>
<a name="50704-20_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   I do not support the amendment for many reasons. First, the throughput of motorways is very much determined by the average speed of the traffic moving through them. If a few vehicles are going very fast and some are going relatively slowly, fewer vehicles will go through than if everyone went through at a constant speed. That is the science behind the cameras that have been put on the M25, where the variable limits are adjusted so that the maximum number of vehicles can get through the motorway at a given time. There are certainly plenty of speed cameras in force on the M25, mainly because men are working there.
<a name="time_17"></a>
<a name="50704-20_time0"></a><h5>6.45 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="50704-20_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, mentioned a speed camera that has raised &#163;1.2 million. That it is perfectly true. The cameras that he mentioned are at Bristol. They have been erected while the motorway is being repaired. They have been in operation for only a month or two. The limit is 40 miles per hour. They have raised all that money because people have been going through at speeds in excess of 100 miles an hour. In all the motorway service stations in the area big notices warn people that there is a speed limit. It is to protect people who are working there. I am certain that I have these statistics right: in the same period three workmen have been killed and seven seriously injured. No other industry would tolerate that level. If three railwaymen had been killed and seven injured there would be shouts for a public inquiry and all sorts of things, whereas on the roads it is dismissed as just more casualties.

</p>

<a name="50704-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>The 70 mile per hour limit is, as has been said, widely not observed, but we know that people go along at about 80 miles per hour and that is more or less tolerated. However, we also know that, if the limit were raised to   80, the amount of tailgating and other unsocial behaviour by people bullying their way along the motorway would increase no end. To mix up lorries which are supposed to go at only 56 miles per hour with cars going along at 90 or 100 miles per hour is a recipe for disaster and tragedy. Certainly, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, that if he is expecting any support from me he is certainly mistaken.
</p>




<p><a name="st_193"></a>
<a name="50704-20_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   We have had another interesting and lively debate and one that could have been predicted. The arguments have been well rehearsed on previous occasions. I will make one obvious salient point&#151;my noble friend Lord Faulkner expressed it first, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_477"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 477</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

so I will admit to plagiarism. This is a road safety Bill. Therefore, it behoves those who wish to present amendments to indicate how they would enhance road safety. The noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, and the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, said that common sense suggests that we should increase the limit to the speed at which a certain proportion of drivers drive regularly on our motorways. The answer to that was given by the   noble Earl, Lord Dundee, first. People drive at 80   because the speed limit is 70 miles per hour. If the speed limit were 80, they would drive at 90.
</p>

<a name="50704-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>This is not a question of people observing speed limits rigorously when they are absolutely sure that the limits are the right ones and having a level of tolerance when they think that they are the wrong ones. That is not so at all. People know that their cars can go faster. The majority of vehicles can get up to these speeds with ease and therefore the driver is not constrained by feeling that he is driving his car at its extremity. At 90   miles an hour the vast majority of cars&#151;certainly the ones that occupy the outside lanes of the motorway&#151;always give drivers the impression that they are fully under control. There is no constraint with regard to that.
</p>

<a name="50704-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>So where does common sense cut in? There is a well known belief that it is quite difficult to enforce speed limits tight to the margin. The higher one goes, the more difficult it is to operate in the margin. The police have a margin at 30 miles an hour, where they do not enforce the speed limit at 31 miles an hour, although I am not saying that now and again one or two people do not get caught close to that lower limit. However, even with cameras&#151;particularly with cameras&#151;the police need the security of knowing that they will win the case and that the information is sufficiently accurate.
</p>

<a name="50704-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>I am afraid that the problem with cameras is that the tolerance level is a percentage level, so as the speed rises, so the percentage of tolerance has to be increased. The simple fact of the matter is that every motorist in the country will believe&#151;and they will be reasonably right in their belief&#151;that if the police do not hit him at 75 mph, even at 80 mph, when the limit is 70 mph, they will certainly not hit him at bang on 80   mph when the limit is 80 mph, because the technology would not secure the prosecution. The police would be obliged to operate a level of tolerance beyond 80 mph. What would that mean? Of course, it would mean a level of tolerance pushing towards 90   mph. It would not be a question of common sense, but a question of every driver knowing what the outer limit was as far as likely prosecution was concerned. That is the nature of progress in a car.
</p>

<a name="50704-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>If I am causing puzzlement because a number of noble Lords are not attracted ever to driving a car close to the speed limits, all I can say is that our fellow citizens do. Every day, one just knows that that is the case. If you stick to the speed limits on any road in Britain, you will find yourself under a degree of pressure. You will certainly be passed if it is possible to pass you. As the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, indicated, if you go along at 70 mph on the motorway, you will be passed by a very substantial proportion of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_478"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 478</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the traffic. I got a nod of agreement from the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, on that. I will not get a nod of agreement when I say that if the limit were 80 mph, pretty similar proportions of motorists would be driving in excess of that speed too.
</p>

<a name="50704-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>If noble Lords proposing the amendment were to say, &quot;But we&#039;ve got evidence to show that the faster the traffic goes and the more contented and fulfilled the driver is, the safer the traffic&quot;, it might be a different matter, but it is not so. Perhaps I may appeal to the common sense of the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, by asking whether it is likely that the roads become safer at higher speeds. First, there is our old friend, reaction time, and our old friend, the question whether even the safest of cars can brake as effectively from 90 mph as they can from a speed that is 10 mph lower.
</p>

<a name="50704-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>We have of course the evidence from those who have tried this exercise. In the United States, we are able to compare those states which raised the speed limit&#151;modestly, to 75 mph&#151;with the many states which kept the old speed limit. The beauty of the United States&#039; federal constitution is that no state has to do what the others do. The difference between the states that increased their speed limits and those that did not was a 38 per cent accident rate. It is not always that one can refer to the United States as a laboratory for all aspects of social activity, but I think that driving a car is not a bad laboratory. After all, the United States have the highest level of car ownership in the world and that is the evidence that they have produced.

</p>

<a name="50704-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>Of course we understand the power of the argument that laws are valid because they meet with public opinion and are obeyed voluntarily by our fellow citizens without need for enforcement; and that any law which requires total enforcement is not doing its job because it does not have the support of the public. But let us be absolutely clear about the motorway speed limit. If we increase that   speed limit, our fellow citizens&#151;and we ourselves perhaps&#151;would stretch the limits beyond the speed limit, because that is what we do.

</p>

<a name="50704-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>In answer to the question of the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, the technology exists. Between Junctions 10 and 15 of the M25, that most beloved of motorways, gantry-mounted controls operate variable speed limits. Nobody has ever dared to ask, &quot;Why don&#039;t you up them a bit to 80&quot;? &quot;Variable speed limits&quot; mean that a 70 mph limit is in force and, as the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, indicated, the speed limits are sometimes reduced because of traffic conditions and traffic flow, and, of course, weather conditions. Would that we had the technology right across our motorway system. We do not have it, and that is why we cannot use variable limits in that way. But I have no doubt, given the increase in car ownership and the problems of congestion on our roads, that we probably will have to face up to the bills involved in this technology. It has been installed at those particular junctions on the M25 for two reasons: first, the extensive roadworks as the road is being constructed there; secondly, it is the most intensively used motorway in the United Kingdom by <br>&nbsp;<br>

quite a significant margin. That is why the technology is in place there. I hope that answers the noble Baroness&#039;s question, but it may not have done.

<a name="50704-21_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   I asked the Minister&#151;and I will repeat the question&#151;whether, when that variable limit comes up, you are obliged to abide by it or whether, as I am often told, it is advisory only.

<p><a name="st_195"></a>
<a name="50704-21_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   No, the technology is in place and the variable limit is enforced there. That is the distinction between Junctions 10 to 15 on the M25 and all other motorways. We do not have the technology for camera enforcement elsewhere. We are able to use quite sophisticated strategies for the speeds at which traffic should go through that very difficult area on that most congested of motorways. We may in due course develop the technology elsewhere. First, it must be proven in terms of the safety advantages it brings to the nation and, secondly, there is always the question of cost.
</p>

<a name="50704-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>I recognise the strength of feeling on this issue, but the case is not proven and I therefore hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.

<a name="50704-21_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I am disappointed by the Minister&#039;s answer because I have found that, on this Bill, he and I agree with each other more than we do with other noble Lords. I have agreed with a lot of what he has said.

</p>

<a name="50704-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>We are discussing a Road Safety Bill, and everything we want to do is related to road safety, but the legislation has to be acceptable and to recognise the world as it is, rather than simply reflect the views of those sitting on the red Benches of this House. A number of our debates have not really been representative of what is going on in the world, although I know some noble Lords here have a particular interest in road safety, as we all do.
</p>

<a name="50704-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>If one legislates for speed limits, people should keep to them. A lot of the discussion that we have just had has been based on the assumption that if you have an 80 mph speed limit everyone will drive at 90 mph. That is not at all what I meant or what I suggest. As noble Lords have said, modern technology has moved on. I would suggest various speed limits from 20 mph to 80   mph, but that they are enforced, so that people know that if they exceed them they are breaking the law.
</p>

<a name="50704-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>So much of the debate has been about people exceeding those speed limits on motorways and not being penalised, which is wrong. Therefore, this part of the debate has been very strange. People want to drive speed limits down. On some occasions, if it is the right thing to do, the Government should be looking at raising them or at least judging, at times, what the right speed limit is, as in the case of the flexible limit on the M25. We all know that it would be almost impossible to drive at 80 mph on the M25, because, whatever the time of day, it is full. We are talking mostly about other motorways, not the M25.

I implore everyone here to try to be a bit more flexible in their approach. We want this legislation to improve road safety, but not to be seen by the outside world as being unrepresentative of the world as it is. Millions of people use cars, and the use of cars will increase a lot more. Statistics in my county show that there will be a 20 per cent increase in the number of cars in the next 10 years.

<a name="50704-21_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Hanham </b>   moved Amendment No. 75:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>After Clause 17, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_6"></a><br>
   &quot;SPEED LIMITS FOR VEHICLES OF CERTAIN CLASSES

<br>
   In Schedule 6 to the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (speed limits for vehicles of certain classes), in paragraph 5(2)(b)(iii), column 3(c), leave out &quot;40&quot; and insert &quot;50&quot;.&quot;</p>




<p><a name="st_198"></a>The noble Baroness said: We return to speed restrictions. The amendment would increase the speed limit for heavy goods vehicles on single carriageways from 40 mph to 50 mph. The reason is to cut congestion and, particularly, to reduce the temptation of motorists to risk a dangerous overtaking manoeuvre. The amendment needs to be looked at in the context of the maximum speed being suitable for the circumstances.

</p>

<a name="50704-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>At present the maximum speed for lorries on single carriageways is 40 mph. We know that lorries have become safer, that their braking is more efficient, and that the quality of many of our single carriageways&#151;particularly trunk roads&#151;has increased significantly. Some time ago in the past it was possible to overtake lorries on single carriageway roads with relative ease because traffic was much lighter and there were far fewer vehicles coming in the opposite direction. Drivers nowadays know that it is almost impossible to overtake any vehicle at busy times on single carriageway roads. As a result, all traffic goes at the speed of the slowest, which means that if a lorry is going at 40 mph at the   front of the queue everybody trails along at about 30 mph.
</p>

<a name="50704-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>Heavy goods vehicles often find themselves generating driver frustration. I understand that Tesco now has a sign on the back of all its lorries saying &quot;This lorry is limited to 40 mph&quot; because so many motorists find that speed incredible and sometimes vent their frustration on the driver. In times past I suspect that some lorry drivers went above the speed of 40 mph, but with cameras and tachographs they cannot do so. As a result, the frustration of drivers behind them creates a danger.
</p>

<a name="50704-21_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>Introducing such a change would improve road safety rather than making it worse. That is the view of   those in the commercial goods industry, of many of those who drive heavy goods vehicles, and of most of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_481"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 481</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the people who drive behind them. It is meant to be a practical amendment and goes back to what my noble friend Lord Hanningfield said in his closing remarks on the previous amendment. While we all want road safety, we must consider the practicalities of millions of drivers and the frustrations and difficulties that they face daily.
</p>

<a name="50704-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>The amendment refers to heavy goods vehicles only. I beg to move.

<a name="50704-21_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Attlee: </b>   This is a different matter from the previous amendment. If my noble friend had not tabled the amendment, I should have done so, and I apologise for not having put my name to it.

</p>

<a name="50704-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>In the UK we are building more and more high quality and wide single carriageways where a dual carriageway is not justified. Often top speeds of 50 mph on those routes gives a reasonable average speed, but 40   mph does not. That creates a terrible temptation, often in frustration, to overtake a heavy goods vehicle. I do not believe that the main driver for the amendment should be to reduce congestion or increase productivity for heavy goods vehicles.
</p>

<a name="50704-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>The main driver for the amendment is pure safety. A head-on collision with an impact speed of more than 100 mph is not survivable. It is also totally unfair to the completely blameless driver coming the other way who has a head-on collision with a car attempting to overtake a heavy goods vehicle. A particular problem is that what may appear to be an ideal location to overtake a heavy goods vehicle, such as a junction because the road is widened out with even better visibility, is the worst possible place to overtake.
</p>

<a name="50704-21_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>I am really concerned that Ministers do not understand how refined modern heavy goods vehicles are. I urge the Minister or a colleague in the other place with responsibilities for these matters to take a ride in a heavy goods vehicle&#151;perhaps off-road at MIRA or Millbrook&#151;to see what a modern vehicle is like at 40   mph and 50 mph. My experience of driving heavy goods vehicles tells me that if the Minister maintains his current position, he will condemn many people to unnecessary death in a brutal head-on collision with high impact speeds.

<a name="50704-21_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   This is another amendment that seems to argue that it is safer to go faster. We have no   statistics to back that up, but it appears that frustration builds up to such a high level among car drivers that they kill themselves overtaking. With the speed of approach of two vehicles when one is coming the other way, it is very serious, but it seems that it is less serious if drivers can go faster.

</p>

<a name="50704-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>The statistics produced by the Department for Transport show that poor overtaking in those circumstances is implicated in only 4 per cent of fatal crashes, while excessive speed is a factor in 28 per cent of such incidents.
</p>

<a name="50704-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>Lorries are heavy, but most modern lorries are extremely efficient, and are driven by professional drivers. The same cannot be said for many motorists. Even so, in 2003 the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle <br>&nbsp;<br>

kilometres from HGVs was 90 per cent higher than for cars over the same distance. On rural A roads it was 30 per cent higher; on other rural roads it was 46 per cent higher. Compliance with speed limits is even worse&#151;72 per cent of HGVs exceed the 40 mph speed limit. Therefore, nearly three-quarters of HGVs exceed the speed limit.
</p>

<a name="50704-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>The same argument is used for motorways: increase the speed limit and everybody will be happy. However, the statistics do not bear that out. The best thing for a frustrated motorist to do is to stop and have a cup of coffee or take a tranquiliser. If motorists are feeling that frustrated they should not be driving. Lorries have just as much right to be on the road as cars. Perhaps the alternative solution is to reduce the speed limit for cars and everybody will be going at the same speed.

<a name="50704-22_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   Tesco operates one of the best fleets of lorries in the country, which is commonly acknowledged in the industry. They are good vehicles, which are professionally maintained and well operated. They have signs on the back saying that they are supposed to go at 40 mph.
</p>

<a name="50704-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>The majority of heavy goods vehicles are not in that class and there is a large majority that are very badly maintained and have poor braking characteristics and other things. I would be very sad indeed if they were allowed to go faster. There are frustrations within the haulage industry about such matters as the working time directive and the fact that it would like to schedule its lorries at faster speeds to enable a driver to complete a journey within the scheduled time.
</p>




<p><a name="st_205"></a>
<a name="50704-22_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I am becoming very concerned that this discussion on my amendment is not the discussion which I thought we would have. This is not about the rationale for lorries to go faster so that they reach their destination quicker and enable a little more   business to be done. This discussion is about the frustration of drivers travelling behind lorries who cannot get past them, and the road safety implications of frustrated drivers trying to overtake lorries. If those lorries were travelling about 10 miles faster, the drivers would probably just sit it out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_206"></a>
<a name="50704-22_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   That may be so but if the noble Baroness reads the road haulage press she must be aware of the pressure that is being brought by the road haulage industry for the speed limit for lorries to be raised to improve the productivity of the fleet. That is a factor in the whole of the discussion. I am not in any way ignorant of the facts; I know what I am talking <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_483"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 483</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

about. I travel behind lorries but it is rare to find an HGV travelling at 40 miles per hour, as the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, said. They usually travel at about 50 miles per hour. If the speed limit were raised, they would travel even faster. We are back to the same argument that we have had about motorways&#151;that the current limits are as safe as they can be. Some lorries could go faster. The modern lorries to which reference has been made have much better braking, much better visibility and so on. However, that does not constitute the whole of the lorry fleet and we have to take into account the whole of the lorry fleet.
</p>




<p><a name="st_207"></a>
<a name="50704-22_spnew6"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   I am amazed at the notion that all these ancient lorries are trundling along our roads, or certainly where the noble Lord who has just spoken lives, as I have not noticed that. Having tried to buy an old lorry to help cart grain on my wife&#039;s farm, I know how difficult it is to find such things. They are all in junkyards and are not allowed to travel on the roads. Such vehicles are inspected all the time. Trying to describe a Victorian state of affairs does not get us any further forward.
</p>

<a name="50704-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>The suggestion that frustrated drivers should take tranquillisers will not help road safety at all. It would slow down drivers&#039; reactions even further and cause many problems. It is astonishing to hear that suggestion from a noble Lord who is normally very responsible as regards road safety.

</p>

<a name="50704-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>The notion that it is a terrible idea to improve industry&#039;s productivity and that that is the main reason you should knock down a perfectly sensible amendment is another astonishing idea. If the productivity of the road haulage industry were increased as a result of the measure, that would be a wonderful by-product. I feel very strongly about the amendment. Sometimes you get your timing wrong, or there is a crisis and you have to get somewhere quickly. You do not want to break the speed limit but you get stuck behind a slow moving chain of traffic. Depending on the urgency of the situation, there is a tendency for people to take risks. I have done that in the past. That is very dangerous. These days it is much more dangerous than it used to be as people do not expect others to overtake; people tend to tailgate much more and it is harder to get back into lines of traffic. That is why I no longer take such risks. However, some people will still take those risks.

</p>

<a name="50704-22_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>Further, due to the existence of speed cameras people are frightened to accelerate properly while overtaking so they do not overtake in the shortest possible time, which also increases the risk. The amendment that we are discussing is very sensible as it would result in all the traffic moving at the same speed. That would result in far greater road safety. Lorries are quite capable of travelling at 50 miles per hour. The notion that they are not is ridiculous. I believe that, if accepted, the amendment would considerably enhance road safety.

<a name="50704-22_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   Once again consensus has not broken out. The intent of the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, appears to be to increase the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_484"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 484</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

speed limit for HGVs from 40 to 50 miles per hour on single carriage roads. As the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, said, such a change would clearly bring benefits for the road haulage industry in that it would lawfully be able to deliver goods faster and, presumably, be able to make its operations more cost effective, as other noble Lords have said. Those are very understandable objectives. Of course, we would all like to get where we are going faster and to arrive sooner. However, that desire needs to be balanced against the risks involved.
</p>

<a name="50704-22_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>The 40 mile per hour speed limit for HGVs on single carriageways is there for a purpose. It is there because it will generally take an HGV longer to stop than a car at any given speed. The extra distance it will take to stop increases the faster the vehicle is travelling. So whereas it is possible for an HGV travelling at 40 miles per hour to pull up in time to avoid hitting a car stopping in an emergency at, say 60 miles per hour, it would be very unlikely to be able to stop if it were travelling very much faster. Some very modern HGVs might be able to do so&#151;the noble Baroness raised that point, as did other noble Lords, including, I believe, the noble Earl, Lord Attlee&#151;but the vast majority might not. That, I suggest, is the problem with the proposal.
</p>




<p><a name="st_209"></a>
<a name="50704-22_spnew8"></a><b> The Earl of Erroll: </b>   It is impossible for a lorry travelling at 40 miles per hour to follow a car travelling at 60 miles per hour. That lorry could not run into the back of the car because a vehicle travelling at 40 miles per hour cannot follow one travelling at 60 miles per hour&#151;the one travelling at 60 miles per hour would have disappeared into the distance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_210"></a>
<a name="50704-22_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   I will think about that in the fullness of time.
</p>




<p><a name="st_211"></a>
<a name="50704-22_spnew10"></a><b> Earl Attlee: </b>   Following on from that argument, why is the noble Baroness content for an HGV to travel at 50 miles per hour on a dual carriageway when a car can travel at 70 miles per hour on the same road?
</p>




<p><a name="st_212"></a>
<a name="50704-22_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   We are talking about single carriageways. We are talking about a car stopping in an emergency when travelling at 60 miles per hour and a shunt occurring. However, I shall read <i>Hansard</i> as regards the car travelling in front.

</p>

<a name="50704-22_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>Noble Lords should bear in mind that, because of their size and weight, accidents involving HGVs will generally have more serious consequences than accidents involving smaller, lighter vehicles. This is the real issue. If the HGV speed limit were to be increased, would there be more rear-end shunt accidents involving HGVs? The answer to that question is to some extent unknown, but even at the current 40 miles per hour speed limit, the HGV accident involvement rate on single carriageway rural roads is some 45 per cent higher than that for cars. Part of the explanation for that might be the fact that HGVs are generally less manoeuvrable than cars because of the size of HGVs. A further part of the explanation might be the fact that so many HGVs already travel faster than the speed limit anyway. The statistics show that 30 per cent already <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_485"></a>

exceed even 50 miles per hour. At any rate, if the HGV speed limit were to be increased, the Government fear that there would be more accidents, injuries and fatalities.

</p>

<a name="50704-22_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>It is sometimes said that car drivers become irritated when following slower moving HGVs, and that having to do so might even encourage dangerous overtaking manoeuvres in some cases. Indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, referred to that frustration. Of course, that is a concern, but I am afraid that it will never be possible to find a speed limit which will satisfy some drivers. Indeed, the very same people who become irritated when following an HGV at 40 miles per hour are just as likely to be equally irritated if they are following at 50 miles per hour. Sadly, it seems to be a fact of life that some people just do not like following other vehicles, irrespective of what type of vehicle we are talking about. But that is not a good reason to increase the HGV speed limit. Such concerns about what is essentially bad driving need instead to be addressed by promoting better awareness&#151;which is something that the Department for Transport does&#151;and, where necessary, by appropriate enforcement action by the police. In short, increasing the speed limit for heavy goods vehicles on single-carriage roads would create unacceptable risks to road safety. For that simple but nevertheless critical reason, I sincerely hope that noble Lords will be persuaded and that the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment.

I have limited myself to heavy goods vehicles and have not included tractors or JCBs that   tootle along roads. If we raised the speed limit to 50 mph for a tractor or a JCB, noble Lords would have some right to ask what I was getting at.

I have trailed many a vehicle on many a road at 30 mph, and no amount of coffee or tranquillisers would have made the situation any better. It just gets worse.

<p><a name="st_217"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall not waste the time of the House by explaining why we desperately need more working dentists in Britain. We all know that. It is fair to say that the Government are trying to tackle the problem. The Walport report is under way, and an additional 170 dental undergraduate places have been allocated, but the case that I wish to make to the Government tonight is that they are missing the fact that without adequate money for dental research we shall not have the new dentists we need, however many dental students there may be.

When I heard that, I feared that dental research would be only a tiny proportion of the whole, so on the following day I made inquiries at the Department of Health. No one there could tell me how much of the &#163;25 million was for dental as distinct from medical research. The department explained that the funding covered areas such as epidemiology; checking exactly how hospitals and universities were spending the money on; and checking if and how it was seeping down to ensure better treatments for patients.

<a name="50704-23_para6"></a>

<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>There is not a lot of point in having more students if   there are no teachers to teach them. The writing is on the wall for all to see.

</p>

<a name="50704-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>I am sorry to say that teacher numbers are falling steadily. I believe that the Government intend to listen&#151;I have no doubt about that&#151;but unless they understand and act to meet the grave concern being expressed by the Council of Deans of Dental Schools and by eminent professors in the field, such as Dr Ian Chapple of the Birmingham Dental Hospital, we shall face real trouble. Clinical academic numbers are falling. The last year for which I could obtain figures was 2003&#150;04. The figures showed a drop of 6 per cent. If that drop continues, I dread to see the figures for 2004&#150;05. I beg the Government to study the pressures on the recruitment and retention of academic dentists.
</p>

<a name="50704-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>In too many cases, dental hospitals are in poor shape as workplaces. That is not connected with research, but it is part of the point that I wish to make. Major rebuilds are undoubtedly needed. The infrastructures are not good. Capital moneys promised in the drive to get more students do not even meet the interest charges on proposed rebuilds. It is important to get that point on the record. I felt bound to mention those facts in passing, but they are only peripheral to my main point, which is that insufficient research funding is the big stumbling block in getting and keeping the dental teachers we must have.
</p>

<a name="50704-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>I want to point out a few things about the work that dental teachers do. It is hugely demanding. They have to see and treat patients, rather like a dentist does in his ordinary work. Beyond that, they have to give lectures, teach students, answer their questions and be there to respond to their problems. Many are honorary consultants to NHS trusts and, in addition, have administrative duties. We should compare that to the demands on a dentist in ordinary practice. On top of all that, they somehow have to find time for research, which is made extremely hard by the lack of funds.
</p>

<a name="50704-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>It is perhaps not widely recognised how crucial that research is, nor is it widely understood that a dental clinical academic&#039;s performance is primarily judged on his research&#151;not on his chair-side manner with his patients, nor on his lectures to his students, his consultancies or his administrative skills. Why is that the case? Because the most common diseases that are suffered by man are dental&#151;that is not widely known. In Britain, they cost the NHS &#163;2 billion a year, not including the amount spent on private care.

</p>

<a name="50704-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>Research should be recognised for the essential that it is. Many people outside the House currently struggling with the problem recommend the commissioning of an   immediate and far-reaching review of UK dental research funding. I hope that that might lead to a UK-wide research council, so that those at the coal face who have to deal with the problems day by day can give their expert views, which have been collected over many years, on the problems and difficulties. That is what the profession wants, and that is what the public needs. No such body exists.

Noble Lords may be interested to know that last year, 15 awards were made world-wide and, of those, Britain won four. If the Minister is tempted to say, in the light of that intelligence, &quot;There you are; obviously, if they are doing that well, they do not need any more research funds&quot;, I would remind him of the man who boasted that he had trained his donkey to do without food and that he had succeeded in doing that, when the donkey died.

She was not the only one. That happened normally. Compare that with today&#039;s level of care. Entirely due to dental research, a generation of young people today grow up without any dental decay&#151;they do not have to have all their teeth out.

Of all those millions, I am told that dentistry receives only &#163;6,000 out of &#163;25 million. Not only is that figure hopelessly inadequate, not only do the dedicated researchers richly deserve our thanks and a fairer amount of public money, but, unless they get it, they will continue to leave, and the students will have no teachers and the public no dentists.

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>The route to become a professor is long. The dean of the post-graduate Eastman Institute of Dental Surgery had 16 years of training. Training times have been shortened, but are still long and costly. Many dentists do a three year masters degree, often in the United States.

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a>The salaries of clinical academics are not good and compare unfavourably with the earnings of those in dental practice. A specialist dentist charging &#163;1,000   per implant is anecdotally quoted as carrying out 40 implants on one day&#151;but 20 is the more realistic number. No academic salary can compare. Our highest paid dental professor may earn about &#163;150,000. His Swiss equivalent is paid more than three times that sum, about &#163;500,000 normally. Noble Lords may note that I said &quot;his&quot;, because no woman professor earns that. Some Harley Street dentists are reputed to have a turnover of fees of about &#163;700,000.

</p>

<a name="50704-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a>I have quoted the extremes of dentistry, but at whichever level the comparison is made, the academic dentist loses out. All registered dentists must now prove that they have undergone a suitable amount of &quot;continuing professional development&quot;, or CPD, throughout the year. At some courses they are electronically tagged to prove the actual time spent at the course. They are paid a special fee by the NHS of &#163;59.30 per hour to compensate for their loss of practice time. To me, it is an alarming statistic that the clinical academic dentist providing that essential course is paid less per session than the amount that the NHS pays the practitioner to attend.
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>Is it surprising that there is a fall in the number of clinical academic dentists&#151;a drop of 6 per cent in the past year&#151;and a further 14 per cent decrease in the   number of lecturers. There is no way in which the Government will be able to honour their commitment to increase dental students by 25 per cent unless they can ensure that they have the teaching staff. My noble friend made that point and I support her. Some 50 per cent of clinical academics are now aged over 45 and only 12 per cent of clinical professionals are female. There is an opportunity to change academic dentistry so that it is perceived as an attractive career by the young and by women.
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>However, funding is the real issue. Can the Minister confirm that all the funding for new dental places will be spent on dental education and not be top-sliced by universities and hospital trusts?
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>London, our capital city, has the highest UK population and a very high dental need, but it is not easy to attract dentists to train for academic posts here, as the cost of living in London is high, schools for children may not be up to standard, and housing is a major problem.

</p>

<a name="50704-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>As a Commonwealth dentist myself, I am distressed by the case of the New Zealand dentist who has found it difficult to obtain practice rights in the UK. I quote from the correspondence in the <i>British Dental Journal</i>. In her letter, this dentist explains how difficult it has been to pass <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_490"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 490</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the test, called the International Qualifying Examination. This now costs &#163;2,200, as the exams have to be done in three parts and take nearly two years to do, and seems to be deliberately obstructive of Commonwealth dentists. I am aware that there are no spare people in Australia; there is a shortage of dentists there. It seems, however, that New Zealanders are keen to come, and I recall that they had a high standard of training.
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>The dentist goes on to say that some New Zealand dentists here are working in pubs or in any other way. Who is going to spend &#163;2,200 and then spend all that time trying to requalify? It is more fun to go and do these other things. If you come from any part of the European Union, however, your qualifications are not tested.
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>The reply from the chief executive of the General Dental Council was terrible. He said the council decided to stop recognising overseas qualifications for a number of reasons. I remember when they stopped the Australian dental qualification being accepted. It was all because of a row&#151;when someone went out there and enjoyed a bit too much of the local amber, as they might call it&#151;over who should pay who to go out and test the Australians, and the chief executive&#039;s reply makes the same point. Eventually the qualification was reinstated. I was on the GDC, and helped a little bit in that.
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>The GDC says it will undertake a review of the IQE, and it should. The standard of training in New Zealand has always been superb, and to have people coming from that country, ready and willing to work here, and instead working in a pub is unbelievable.
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>The Minister has told us of the number of dentists who have chosen to work in the personal dentist services. The noble Lord, Lord Chan, made an interesting speech last week on this. He said that some of these dentists can now earn up to &#163;100,000, and he sounded as if he knew what he was talking about. If the Minister accepts that he must have competent clinical dental academics to train dentists, the rates of pay must not be allowed to fall so far behind those of practitioners.
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>When we have a good supply of dental academics, a strong and skilled team of dental researchers will follow. We have to realise, however, that these things will not happen automatically. We have to create an interest in, and an awareness of, the need to make this an attractive option for people. Dentistry starts with the teaching, and it all goes on from there.

</p>

<a name="50704-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>Dental research is part of the political debate about patient access to dental provision and how good oral health is to good general health. If we are to pursue preventive dentistry and good oral public health, and I am sure this is the direction the Government wish to achieve in their health strategies, it is imperative that we champion evidence-based patient care.
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>The British Dental Association&#039;s briefing paper in this debate&#151;and I am grateful to James Clarke for all his help&#151;has outlined a number of good examples of where decent, well-researched oral health studies have provided evidence to wider public health debates. The research by Birmingham University on fizzy drinks and tooth erosion, and how consumption of such drinks by 12-year-olds massively increases the chance of suffering erosion, is a case in point. They found that four or more glasses per day increases the chances of erosion by an amazing 252 per cent. This type of work should play a key part in supporting Government policy-making to phase out fizzy drinks from our school vending machines.
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>The work at Newcastle University on the importance of people having access to fluoridated water should underpin the public debates about the Government&#039;s decision to consult on local water fluoridation schemes, away from some of the opponents&#039; alarmist and misleading arguments. This country&#039;s oral health would be much the poorer without this type of work, but unfortunately there are a number of issues that are making life increasingly difficult for dental clinical academics and researchers.
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>One of the biggest issues facing this specialist sector is workforce shortages. The recent staffing level report by the Council of Heads of Medical Schools and the Council of Heads and Deans of Dental Schools found dental clinical academic numbers had decreased by 6   per cent in just a year. That is a huge number of trained and dedicated academics to lose in such a short period. The study also stated that there were a total of 208 vacant senior posts in academic medicine, with the staffing problems being even more acute in academic dentistry. This does not bode well for the future.
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>The Government, though, for reasons I understand and support, want to increase undergraduate training places by 25 per cent. How do these two sets of statistics sit comfortably together? There is a feeling among the BDA&#039;s central committee for dental academic staff that any increase in undergraduate numbers without a commensurate increase in clinical academics will exacerbate an already fragile situation.
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>As noble Lords might expect, my daily work brings me into contact with both practitioners and academics. One such academic has told me that any additional dental school, to which the Government have clearly committed themselves, will destabilise existing schools and damage research. I am also told   that there is a general feeling among the dental academic community that they are being required to devote so much time to teaching that the quantity and quality of research is being severely limited. I fear for <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_492"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 492</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

dental research if those remaining in dental academia are forced to spend even longer on teaching, but are still expected to fulfil their research commitments.
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>I fully support the expansion of places. It can only be a good thing that this country produces more highly-qualified dentists in order for people to have full access to NHS dental services. Equally, though, the Government have to be realistic about who is actually going to teach these students, and at what cost to dental research work.
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>There is a feeling that this situation will be further compounded by the patchy implementation of the new academic consultant contract and its aspiration of a 40-hour week. I am told that clinical academics in the main welcome this policy, but see it as a pipe-dream. The reality is that the average dental clinical academic works an average of 52 hours per week, yet universities are pushing job plans that would see all clinical consultant staff on a 40-hour week in the future. This well-meaning policy is doing nothing to alleviate feelings that the Government&#039;s plans on working conditions for dental academics is unrealistic and lacking any sort of joined-up implementation.
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>The Government have been disappointingly vague on all these aspects. How are they going to arrest these alarming decreasing numbers of dental clinical academics and researchers? How are they going to find the right teaching and research balance for individual academics, especially in the light of the creation of 170 new undergraduate places? How will the academic consultant contract be successfully implemented? We have had a number of informative reports over the years&#151;for instance, the Richards report, the Dearing report, the Walport report and the annual CHMS/CHDDS surveys&#151;which have all highlighted the crisis in academic dentistry. And yet significant recruitment and retention problems remain and seem to be getting worse. I would therefore ask the Minister to set out specific plans in answer to these questions.

</p>

<a name="50704-24_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>A good start would be for the Government to recognise the concerns of the Doctors and Dentists Remuneration Review Body in 2005, which indicated concern about the split in pay parity between NHS consultants and those holding honorary consultant contracts as a result of the awarding of additional programmed activities to NHS staff. The recommendations of the Walport report also support a policy of awarding all clinical academics pay parity with their NHS colleagues as a way of raising morale within the dental clinical academic profession. They also called for the creation of a cohort of new senior lectureships awarded through an annual national competition. It is hoped that that will get some much-needed new academics into the profession. Without the Government giving their full backing to the scheme, including full funding, I cannot see where the new, younger academic researchers who are desperately needed will come from.
</p>

<a name="50704-24_para24"></a>

<a name="50704-25_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Barker: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Knight of Collingtree, for drawing the attention of the House to this important subject. I say that having spent all weekend feeling as though I was about to go to the dentist&#151;it was terrifying! To get here and see the list of speakers before me did nothing to calm my nerves. I do not intend to repeat any of the arguments that have been made so capably and ably by other noble Lords.
</p>

<a name="50704-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>As we focus the debate on all five key factors, it is important to recognise the importance of academic dentistry to the provision of frontline dental services. Essentially, the debate is about five key factors: the potential for the current acute crisis in frontline dentistry to become more severe and chronic because of the lack of capacity in academic dentistry research; the unsustainable workload on existing research posts; the piecemeal and inadequate funding of research capacity; potential for the Government&#039;s proposals announced a year ago to weaken the existing academic dental research base; and the potentially harmful effects of failing to plan the development of academic dentistry as an integral part of the NHS.

</p>

<a name="50704-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>Acute and chronic shortages in frontline dentistry make the headlines every day, but shortages in research do not. Yet they are potentially much more serious. In   July 2004, the then Health Secretary, John Reid, announced that the equivalent of 1,000 dentists would be recruited by 2005 and that would include dentists from overseas. He also announced the establishment of an additional 170 undergraduate training places and two new dental hospitals. That was an attempt to address the deficit of 3,000 dentists across the country.
</p>

<a name="50704-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a>I will return to the phrase &quot;the equivalent of&quot;, but for now I want to ask the Minister what percentage of the &#163;250 million announced for dentistry is to be earmarked for investment in dental research and in   increasing academic dental capacity. Previous speakers pointed out the statistics and the worrying decline in the number of academic dentists. I have pointed out that at present UK dental schools are increasingly hiring staff from overseas.
</p>

<a name="50704-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>Given the demonstrated reduction in the number of academic dentists, does the Minister not agree that the creation of a new dental school would jeopardise existing schools and their research programmes? I wonder what the benefit of that would be to frontline dentistry. When a number of institutions are failing to fill the posts they have, it is difficult to see why a new school is needed. Without an obvious rationale, one is tempted to speculate on whether or not lurking behind his proposal is yet another PFI deal. I invite the Minister to end such speculation by giving a definitive statement on that matter today.

</p>

<a name="50704-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a>Of the new dental student places announced, 78 are intended to be in existing schools and 92 are intended for new schools or satellite schools. It would be most <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_494"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 494</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

helpful if the Minister could explain exactly what these satellite schools are. What is the reason for their establishment? What will they do? Where will they be? How will they relate to existing dental schools? More importantly, how will they be staffed? Will these be schools which train dentists or, returning to John Reid&#039;s announcement in 2004, will they be training schools for professions allied to dentistry and dental nurses, thereby giving the equivalence of which he spoke?
</p>

<a name="50704-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, talked about the intended rise in student numbers and the inevitable growth in the demand for teaching time, which will lead in consequence to a decline in the time available for research. How do the Government intend to enable dental schools to sustain both necessary functions?
</p>

<a name="50704-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>Development of research is essential to dentistry and dental education. Dental school funding comes from three sources: the Higher Education Funding Council, the DfES and the Department of Health. While the Department of Health may fund more dental school places, it does not necessarily fund the creation or development of clinical academic posts. How will the Department of Health work with the DfES and the HEFC to ensure that there are sufficient clinical academic posts for dentistry? Furthermore, can he assure the House that his department will work with those two other bodies to align their funding processes so that the system of funding becomes sufficiently transparent to allow planning to a realistic timetable? That must be one of several years, noting the noble Baroness&#039;s point about how long it takes to train academic dentists.

</p>

<a name="50704-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>Maintenance of oral health is integral to the improvement of the general health of the nation and achieving the Government&#039;s public health objectives. Study after study shows that dental and oral healthcare research should not be separate from the rest of the NHS. One can think, for example, of the effect of bad dental health on specific groups in the population, such as older people and children. It seems strange that at a time when dentistry, like the rest of medicine, is having to come to terms with new genetic knowledge and some of the new diagnostic techniques, one should propose another dental school as stand-alone and not part of the rest of the NHS.

</p>

<a name="50704-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>Currently, the UK&#039;s dental research is well recognised internationally as being of a high standard. It seems that we should at this point attempt to ensure that within the NHS we retain the basis on which we can plan to maintain those levels of excellence into the future. Clinical academic dentistry does not enjoy the NHS and other funding available to academic medicine. In medicine, 44 per cent of posts are funded by research councils, while the comparable figure for dentistry is 82   per cent. The lack of NHS-funded staff available to dental school places puts additional pressures on the funding councils, whose performance is judged by the   research output. Dentistry encompasses specialist technical subjects&#151;subjects such as surgical dentistry, oral radiology and oral microbiology. Deficits in those posts are becoming more acute.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_495"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 495</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50704-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>There is a case for saying that unless the Government act now with a plan over a considerable period of time to invest not only in academic teaching but in specialist dental research, we are storing up enormous problems for the frontline dental services in the future. Indeed, if one looks at it, it seems as though the Government&#039;s present policy on dentistry is a bit &quot;drill and fill&quot; rather than a preventive strategy as a whole.


</p>

<a name="50704-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>It will take at least 10 years to fill those posts that are empty at the moment. Unless we are going to plunder other nations to take from them their academic staff it is important that we grow our own at home. The noble Baroness, Lady Knight of Collingtree, is right that this issue needs to be addressed urgently and strategically if the chronic shortages of frontline dentistry are not to get worse.

</p>

<a name="50704-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>I thank my noble friend Baroness Knight for her clear and timely introduction to such an important topic. This Question, following on the heels of the Question asked by my noble friend Lady Gardener of Parkes a couple of weeks ago on the availability of NHS dental services for all and an interesting and lively debate in another place on the same subject last week, serves to emphasise the importance of dentistry as a key component in maintaining the good health of all of us in this country.
</p>

<a name="50704-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>I should think that most of your Lordships will have suffered at one time or another from some form of dental disease. According to the Council of Heads and Deans of Dental Schools,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;the NHS spend alone on this most common disease  . . . is around &#163;2 billion per annum&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-25_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>Yet less than half of the adult population of England is registered with an NHS dentist, leaving everyone else to find vast sums from their own pockets or not go to a dentist at all. One of my abiding memories of the general election campaign will be the lady who appeared on a television programme with the Prime Minister who had resorted to pulling out her own teeth.
</p>

<a name="50704-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>On the basis that prevention is always better than cure&#151;a point raised by my noble friend Lord Colwyn; an expert in the field&#151;surely the two most important aspects of dentistry are good oral hygiene, established through regular visits to the dentist from an early age, and research into dental disease. I remember that, when my children were small, I became aware of research showing that regularly drinking cordial from a feeder beaker was bad for them because it caused tooth decay. Because I was aware of it, I was able to do something about it.

</p>

<a name="50704-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>Recently, as my noble friend Lord Colwyn mentioned, articles in the <i>British Dental Journal</i> have brought similar problems to the awareness of the British public. Research last year from Birmingham identified the heavy consumption of fizzy drinks as a main cause of teenage <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_496"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 496</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

tooth erosion. Research from Newcastle shows that children who drink bottled water miss out on the required levels of fluoride to protect their teeth from decay. That causes particular concern, given that the consumption of bottled water is rising.
</p>

<a name="50704-25_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>I do not think that anyone could or would argue against the premise that the need for evidence-based research is vital and that high-quality research goes hand in hand with basic dental provision. As the Chief Dental Officer, Professor Raman Bedi, noted,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;the plans for the expansion of dental services are critically dependent upon support for and rehabilitation of academic dentistry&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>That view was backed up by a joint report, published last month, by the Council of Heads of Medical Schools and the Council of Heads and Deans of Dental Schools, calling for an assurance of long-term and adequate funding for the expansion in undergraduate places, to ensure stability in our dental schools, thus avoiding any further compromise of the standard of dental education in the UK.
</p>

<a name="50704-25_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>The Minister told your Lordships&#039; House on a previous occasion that our dental courses had an international reputation that continued to attract students from all over the world. He is right, and we should be proud of that. But pressures from the research assessment exercise, along with closures and mergers of departments have meant a loss of more than 100 clinical academic posts. By 2003, according to CHDDS, our,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;dental schools were operating at the lowest staffing levels for more than a decade&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50704-25_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>Add to that the potential retirement time-bomb, to which my noble friend Lady Gardner referred, with a third of the clinical academics in dentistry being between the ages of 46 and 55, and a further 20 per cent being over   the age of 56, and we have to start asking some uncomfortable questions about how the Government will accommodate the 170 new undergraduates a year without compromising the quality of teaching and research. Will the creation of a new dental school jeopardise existing schools?
</p>

<a name="50704-25_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>Last year, the Chief Dental Officer called for a,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;general and concerted effort  . . . to make academic dentistry an attractive career again&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-25_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>In March 2005, a report by a committee chaired by Dr Mark Walport, chairman of the Wellcome Trust, considered how junior doctors could pursue a research career. The report also identifies the underlying problems that have given rise to the,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;perilous state of academic medicine and dentistry in the UK&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50704-25_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>It highlights the lack of a clear route of entry and transparent career structure; the lack of flexibility in the balance of clinical and academic training; and a shortage of properly structured and supported posts on completion of training. One of the recommendations is   for the creation of a cohort of new blood senior lectureships, jointly owned and properly funded.
</p>

<a name="50704-25_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>As my noble friend Lady Knight clearly stated, funding is at the heart of all future development. Currently, dental school funding comes from the NHS <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_497"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 497</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and the higher education funding councils. Three-quarters of clinical lecturer posts in dentistry are funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. That is heavily bureaucratic and depends on the research assessment exercise.
</p>

<a name="50704-25_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>Dentistry fared well in the previous exercise in 2001; two dental schools had the highest rating of 5*, five rated 5, five rated 4 and two rated 3A. But that does not always result in the best funding and does not appear to recognise the teaching and clinical pressures on dental teaching and research staff. Nor does it favour collaborative research, which surely has to be in all our best interests.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>Clinical academics carry out wide-ranging research; they teach and are responsible for treating patients and providing specialist services. In dentistry, they are also   front-line, closely supervising their students, who are providing primary dental care throughout their training. Yet, very little funding comes from the NHS&#151;just 15 per cent. Because the rest of the funding comes from the funding councils, dental academics are judged on their research output, where they are compared with non-clinical scientists who do not have the pressures of treating patients. This has led my honourable friend Dr Andrew Murrison to say that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;the research assessment exercise appears to be sounding the death knell of dental academia&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50704-25_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>There is no doubt that the UK&#039;s dental research is internationally recognised. The General Dental Council sees research as essential to future developments in dentistry and sees it as underpinning dental education. The Government should be under no illusion about the present threat to the future of research into dental disease in this country.
</p>

<a name="50704-25_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>I wonder therefore, if the Government have considered the possibility of looking again at how dental research is funded and might think about additional dedicated funding in the next allocations to the research councils.
</p>

<a name="50704-25_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a>A visit to the dentist is no longer the thing of fear and unavoidable pain which we all remember as children. When so much can now be done to ensure that as a child grows up and grows old it will be with healthy teeth for life&#151;what a tragedy it would be if a lack of a rewarding career structure and a lack of funding now failed the sheer excellence of dental research in this country.

<a name="50704-26_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department of Health  (Lord   Warner): </b>  My Lords, I congratulate the noble Baroness on raising the important issue of dental research tonight and I join her and others in paying tribute to the work of dental academics and the high quality research and teaching that they undertake.
</p>

<a name="50704-26_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>The other day we debated the whole issue of the Government&#039;s reforms to NHS dentistry. I do not propose to go over that ground again other than to say that we do realise that the full benefits of our measures to improve access to dental care will need also to ensure that we maintain a programme of research into both oral health promotion and dental treatment.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_498"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 498</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50704-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>A number of noble Lords have cited examples of good quality dental research that have informed public policy. Let me add another. Until recently it was the practice to extract all impacted wisdom teeth at considerable pain and discomfort to the patients involved. Then the National Institute for Clinical Excellence advised, on the basis of recently completed research, that impacted wisdom teeth do not automatically decay or cause painful eruptions. NICE set guidelines on the symptoms which indicated that the removal of teeth was required and as a result the number of wisdom teeth extracted has dropped by two thirds. That is a very good practical example of the way dental research has improved public policy on dental care.

</p>

<a name="50704-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>I would like to say a little bit about what the Government is doing to sustain a relevant, scientifically rigorous programme of research in this particular area. First, there is the NHS national R&D programme on primary dental care. This programme was given a budget of &#163;5 million; 48 studies were approved&#151;the first started in 1998 and the last is due to finish this year. That programme has included a systematic review of skill-mix in dentistry to produce a comprehensive review of the skills and circumstances of employment of auxiliaries in dentistry. There has also been an evaluation of the effectiveness of dental treatment in children&#039;s primary teeth and an evaluation of a model system for active prevention in the NHS general dental services. This has identified how high street dentists can complement the treatment service they provide with greater emphasis on oral health education.

</p>

<a name="50704-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>Alongside that programme the health technology assessment programme has recently funded two projects related to dental health, including a study of the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of routine dental checks. The result informed advice published by NICE last October that, instead of recalling virtually all patients at six month intervals, dentists should determine the interval by assessment of each individual patient&#039;s disease level. For most patients, recall is unlikely to be required more frequently than every 18 months. Again, this is another good example that dental research is alive and well and informing public policy in this particular area.
</p>

<a name="50704-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>There is also the research capacity development programme which is funding six research fellowships at a total cost of some &#163;2.6 million. These provide individuals from PhD to career scientist level with the opportunity to develop their research skills.
</p>

<a name="50704-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>These fellowships are building the UK&#039;s capacity to undertake the research needed to provide the evidence base for dentistry. The current programme includes award holders working on the prevention of dental caries in young children, the early detection of oral cancer, and the options for administering conscious sedation to patients as an alternative to a general anaesthetic.
</p>

<a name="50704-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>This programme is also contributing to the funding of the Manchester-based National Primary Care R&D   Centre. Within the centre the Manchester Dental   School is receiving departmental funding of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_499"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 499</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

&#163;225,000 per annum from 2004&#150;07 to support an oral health unit, a virtual centre for improving oral health and a fluoridation information and research centre.
</p>

<a name="50704-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>I cite all these because to have heard the debate this evening one would imagine that the Government was putting no money whatsoever into dental research. There is a flourishing programme of dental research going on even as we speak which is producing research reports which inform our public policy.

</p>

<a name="50704-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>The Medical Research Council (MRC) is the main agency through which the Government support medical and clinical research. The MRC does not normally allocate funds to particular topics, as research proposals in all areas compete for the funding available. However, in 2003&#150;04 the MRC spent &#163;1.3 million on oral health-related research. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) also funds support for the research infrastructure in higher education that contributes towards dental research.
</p>




<p><a name="st_223"></a>
<a name="50704-26_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </b>   My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Lord for what he is telling us, but perhaps I could interject with a small question. I am told that the funding model used by HEFCE for calculating existing funded student numbers has been based on the 1990 intake, therefore those figures are 15   years old. Is he aware that perhaps there has been a backlog? I know that the Minister would wish to overcome any such problem but it worries some of us.
</p>




<p><a name="st_224"></a>
<a name="50704-26_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I intended to come to the issue of HEFCE and funding for teaching places but I was illustrating how the Government have funded a flourishing research programme. As I understood the noble Baroness, she suggested that mediocre sums of money were available for research and came close to suggesting that research opportunities might be drying up. I was illustrating that there is actually quite a strong programme. I shall come shortly to the issue of how we fund programmes for placements in dental schools.
</p>

<a name="50704-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, talked about the IQE system. We have worked with the General Dental Council to accelerate the IQE process within one year. I mentioned in the debate the other day the action taken to accelerate that programme, again with government money.

</p>

<a name="50704-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>Noble Lords raised the issue of clinical academic staffing levels in UK medical and dental schools. We accept the recent report of the Council of Deans of Dental Schools, which showed a decline in the number of clinical academics working in dental schools. That decline was from 474 in 2003 to 444 in 2004. I accept   that   that is a worrying reduction, but it must be kept in perspective. I remind noble Lords that as a Government we are opening dental schools not closing them. That is the context in which we set out our policy.
</p>

<a name="50704-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>I am pleased to say that HEFCE is to review its baseline in connection with the expansion of dental education. That is a direct response to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Knight of Collingtree.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="50704-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>We are embarking upon the biggest programme of investment in dental education since the inception of the NHS. Additional recurring funding, rising to &#163;29 million by 2010&#150;11, has been allocated to provide for 170   additional undergraduate training places from October 2005. The expansion will be supported by new capital investment of &#163;20 million in each of the four years 2005&#150;06 to 2008&#150;09. That additional investment in dental schools will improve the working environment and career prospects of dental academics.
</p>

<a name="50704-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, in setting up the new dental school we have established a joint implementation group&#151;it rejoices by the name of JIG&#151;comprising the Department of Health and the Higher Education Funding Council for England. It manages the Government&#039;s programme for expansion of dental education. JIG invited all higher education institutions in England to make expressions of interest in having a new dental school by 26 May. JIG evaluated the bids at its meeting on 22 June and the short-listed respondents will shortly be asked to submit a full business case and to make a presentation to JIG later in the year. We are going through that process in partnership with HEFCE.

</p>

<a name="50704-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, also mentioned satellite dental schools. The details of the expansion are still being considered by JIG. Already medical and dental schools teach students in outreach facilities&#151;for example, large dental practices&#151;in the community. One option for JIG would be to build on that pattern of provision. I cannot give any more firm information than that.
</p>

<a name="50704-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>Alongside this, the joint Department of Health/DfES Strategic Learning and Research Advisory Group for Health and Social Care has developed a plan for the educator and researcher workforce across all the professions in health and social care&#151;not just dentists. This is being taken forward, along with the Walport report which a number of noble Lords have described.

</p>

<a name="50704-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>The Walport report will itself take forward the recommendations with the Department for Health and other people in the research community. Its recommendations can be grouped into four sections, each addressing the key stages of a clinician&#039;s career&#151;namely medical school; foundation programme; specialist training; and consultant/general practitioner grades. Proposals for each of these career grades are made separately for academic dentists. In a former incarnation, I announced, when the Walport report was published in March, a small element of funding to contribute towards the first stage of establishing training fellowships during the specialist training phase. That funding will begin shortly, and work is going on within Government to take forward a fuller   programme for implementing the Walport recommendations.
</p>

<a name="50704-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>We recognise that there are issues here that have to be addressed, but it would be wrong to suggest that there is not a flourishing programme of dental research, as I have indicated. We are on track to expand our dental schools and to put the money into <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>After Clause 17, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_7"></a><br>
   &quot;TRAFFIC SIGNS FOR INDICATING SPEED RESTRICTIONS

<br>
   In section 85 of Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (c. 27) (traffic signs for indicating speed restrictions), after subsection (4) insert&#151;


<br>
&quot;(4A)   Where a road is subject to a speed limit under section 84, regulations made under subsection (1) or (2) shall provide that at least one prescribed traffic sign would always be within sight of a driver if there was no other vehicle on his side of the road.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_227"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving Amendment No. 77, it may be convenient if I speak also to Amendments Nos. 78, 79, 80, 82 and 83.
</p>

<a name="50704-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>On these occasions when we debate road safety matters, the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, normally moves an amendment to provide for 30 miles per hour repeater signs on restricted roads. Equally predictably, the Minister resists his amendment. I suspect there are two reasons for that. First, the total cost of doing so could be very high; secondly, the Minister will desire to retain the principle of Section 8 of the Road Traffic Act 1984, which provides for a speed limit of 30 miles per hour on restricted roads. Repeater signs showing 30 miles per hour would undermine the principle of Section 81.
</p>

<a name="50704-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>But I am not convinced that a high proportion of drivers are aware of the principle of Section 81. I am suggesting that where a road is not a restricted road and it has street lights, the driver must always be able to see the next repeater sign but not necessarily to read it.
</p>

<a name="50704-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>When driving along a road that has street lights I often have a fright because I suddenly realise that I do not know what the correct speed limit is at that point even though I know the road very well. If my amendment was agreed to and I was driving along a road that could be restricted but I saw a repeater sign, I would know that it was not restricted and that the speed limit would be at least 40 miles an hour. In any case, it would not be long before I could read the repeater sign and I could be confident that I was not exceeding the speed limit.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_502"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 502</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50704-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>On the other hand, if I was driving along a faster rural road with street lights it would be out of the question for it to be restricted, but what would be the speed limit? My amendment would deal with that problem because I would quickly see the repeater sign.
</p>

<a name="50704-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>Part of the A1 near Sandy has street lights. Presumably there is an accident hazard there and the road is lit to reduce the number of accidents. This is very welcome. But the speed limit starts at 60 miles per hour and then, presumably when the authorities judge that there is an even higher accident risk, the speed limit is reduced to 50 miles per hour. I am very happy to have that advice as to what is the appropriate speed to drive at because otherwise I might tank along at 70   miles per hour&#151;so I am grateful for the advice&#151;but you can go an awfully long way without seeing a repeater sign. On one occasion I counted 12 lampposts before I saw another repeater sign.
</p>

<a name="50704-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>I am suggesting that you should always be able to see the next repeater sign but not necessarily be able to read it. This would make it much easier to comply with speed limits where there are lampposts. I beg to move.

<a name="50704-27_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </b>   I wish to speak to Amendments Nos. 78 and 79, which are grouped with Amendment No. 77. The first amendment deals with the issue of speed limits in villages. I do not intend to take up the time of the Committee in arguing the case for 30 miles per hour speed limits in built-up areas. I believe we would all agree that the arguments are very well known.
</p>

<a name="50704-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>Incidentally, I do not know whether noble Lords have seen the department&#039;s latest advert which I saw in a cinema last night. It shows a young child, who is dead because the vehicle which hit her was travelling at 40   miles per hour. It then goes on to explain that the child would have had a good chance of survival had the vehicle which hit her been travelling at 30 miles per hour. It is an extremely powerful and moving argument. 

</p>

<a name="50704-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>I do not believe we need to dwell today on the case for a 30 miles per hour limit in villages. At the launch of the   Government&#039;s Road Safety Strategy in April 2001, the Prime Minister said that 30 miles per hour should be   the norm in villages. So, in a sense, the amendments and the debate today relate to the process by which we achieve this and not to the limit itself.

</p>

<a name="50704-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>I speak on the issue because when I was first elected a county councillor, in Suffolk, we became the first county in the country to introduce 30 miles per hour speed limits in all villages. That came about because many of us who campaigned in the 1993 elections were struck by the repeated requests, from right around the county, for 30   miles per hour speed limits. These were from rural communities who felt that their quality of life was being blighted by traffic which was, quite legitimately, travelling through their villages at 60 miles per hour.
</p>

<a name="50704-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>So, in 1993, the incoming Suffolk administration determined that all villages who wanted to have a speed limit would have one&#151;but in looking into that, we realised just what a highly intensive, slow and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_503"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 503</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

expensive process it was going to be. The system of consultation&#151;making and advertising the orders, placing the signs, and so on&#151;is, indeed, extremely time-consuming. We decided to organise the county into batches; in that way, we could get some economies of scale through the process. However, we did realise that it would be very expensive, and at that time local authorities were beginning to be really cash-strapped.
</p>

<a name="50704-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>At that point, we hit upon a wheeze which I can now explain to noble Lords, since it does not matter any more. At the time, it rather saved our bacon. An on-the-ball county treasurer spotted that the mechanism for funding local government at that time, the SSA, was, in part at least, down to how many miles of urban road we had in our county. For those purposes, an urban road was defined as one which had a 30 miles per hour speed limit on it. So, in Suffolk&#039;s case, we accelerated the programme&#151;and it paid for itself extremely quickly. Unfortunately, they caught on to that one, but we had managed to get ahead of the game. All of that explains, I suspect, why nowadays fewer than one in five local authorities have a policy similar to Suffolk&#039;s, where all villages have speed limits.
</p>

<a name="50704-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>The new policy, then&#151;as proposed in the amendment&#151;would do a great deal to reduce the current bureaucracy and inconsistency involved in determining 30 miles per hour speed limits on a case-by-case basis. It is not removing local choice because locals have no choice now; they have a 60 miles per hour limit unless they have street lighting, or unless the local authority is prepared to go through the process. The change is simply in the default speed limit. We are saying that in the absence of street lighting, or being signed otherwise, that the current 60 miles per hour limit is inappropriate and should be changed.
</p>

<a name="50704-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>The second amendment to which I wish to speak, Amendment No. 79, concerns speed limits in country lanes. On the basis that it is unusual to have primary legislation in Parliament on road safety&#151;this is the first we have had for quite some time&#151;we should take the opportunity to address the problem of rural roads, particularly single-carriageway roads. I noticed that in a reply to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, on 28 June that, of the 3,508 people killed in road accidents in 2003, 2,065 were killed on rural roads. That is simply not acceptable; it is the one area where the situation is getting worse, not better.

</p>

<a name="50704-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>There is a coalition, from the Motorists&#039; Forum through to CPRE and Transport 2000, which is much in favour of tackling the problems of speeding on country lanes. They feel that the current limit of 60 miles per hour on many rural roads is simply too fast. The problem has always been to find a way in which one could reduce the speed limit on a country lane that would be acceptable to motorists while not filling the countryside with clutter.
</p>

<a name="50704-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>The beauty of the amendment which has been tabled in my name and that of other noble Lords is that it would enable the speed limit to be reduced to 40 on narrow lanes without white lines, which would be a more appropriate speed limit. A major campaign <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_504"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 504</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

would clearly be needed for drivers to understand the new limit&#151;but once that is done, we would have no need for signs throughout the country.

<p><a name="st_229"></a>
<a name="50704-28_spnew0"></a><b> The Earl of Dundee: </b>   Within this group I shall address Amendment No. 80, which seeks to place a duty on local authorities to produce an annual report on speed limits. Speed&#151;whether excess speed; breaking the posted speed   limit, or unwise speed; driving too fast for the conditions&#151;is a contributory factor in one in three road accidents. It is an even greater contributor to fatal accidents. For that reason, both the Department for Transport and local authorities have been undertaking advertising and educational campaigns, most notably under the &quot;speed kills&quot; heading, to persuade drivers to change their behaviour.
</p>

<a name="50704-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>Local authorities are responsible for about 96 per cent of road lengths in England. It is their responsibility to consider the setting of sensible speed limits on their roads, bearing in mind the guidance from the department set out in the soon-to-be revised circular. Amendment No. 80 would place a duty on local authorities to report on the setting of speed limits on those roads for which they currently have responsibility. It would require them to look at the limits currently on those roads and whether they should be changed in any way. It would be a further encouragement to local authorities therefore to adopt a strategic approach to the setting of limits.

</p>

<a name="50704-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>The Minister may say that local authorities already undertake this kind of analysis. That is certainly true. What does not seem to be the case, however, is the requirement to provide information for central government to enable the department to monitor the development of lower speed roads and see the effect of these on casualty reduction. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will give a positive response to this amendment to persuade local highway authorities to take further action to reduce speeds on their roads.

That is fine because you should have known the limit. But we can do better than that and I think that Amendment No. 77 is the answer.

</p>

<a name="50704-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>I looked at national speed limits for villages, as so well described by the noble Baroness Lady Scott, but can she or anyone else please explain why subsection (2) of Amendment No. 78 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;A &#039;village&#039; for the purposes of this Act shall be a settlement of 20 or more houses  . . . along more than 600 metres&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>Should that not be &quot;less than 600 metres&quot;, because more than 600 metres would mean that there could be 19 houses in 600 metres and the 20th could be another kilometre away and that would classify, according to subsection (2), as a village. That is for the purposes of the law&#151;for me, the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, and others. We would lose our licences because that would be laid down in law. I have an idea what a village is, as I suspect Suffolk County Council does. I suspect that Angus Council also has a very good idea of what a village is. If the noble Baroness narrowed down the definition, we might understand it. I can quite understand 30 miles per hour. That ought to be well signed so that people understand what they are about.
</p>

<a name="50704-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>We then come to Amendment No. 79. I am afraid that I did not hurry along to Clause 27 of the 1984 Act when looking at Item No. 1(i) and Item No. 1(ii) in the table. What are these roads supposed to be? The noble Baroness spoke about country lanes, but there again we have a problem. What is a country lane?
</p>

<a name="50704-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>I can take the noble Baroness to Scotland; I can take her to Wester Ross. I have just attended a dinner dance there with my noble friend Lord Gray of Contin. Huge tracts of road have been paid for by the European Union. They display the lovely European sign&#151;blue with yellow stars. They do not have white lines down the middle of them. Perhaps not I or others will be going along them, but foreigners. I was up there two years ago and was overtaken by German camper vans. I was doing 60 mph&#151;not that I was worried about the satellite or the speed cameras. People were overtaking me, quite safely, at considerably higher speeds. I worry just a trifle about blanket or semi-blanket limits for country lanes or rural lanes.
</p>

<a name="50704-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>Can the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, and her colleagues who have put down the amendment think, first, about what is a &quot;village&quot; and, secondly, a country lane. I have an idea what a country lane might be in Suffolk&#151;I have driven a few miles in that county&#151;but there are huge tracts of northern England or Scotland to which this legislation will apply. If people are driving at 45 or 50 mph on a completely empty road, should they be hounded off the road and have points on their licence, with the prospect of being off the road for a year if they do it twice or three times? I worry just a little about that.
</p>

<a name="50704-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>Of course I understand the need to slow down in what the noble Baroness called &quot;villages&quot;. I too have seen her figures of 30 to 40 mph on television and I am interested in them. Having been involved in a skiing crash at 30 mph, I would not like to be struck by a car at that speed. Had it been at 40 mph, I would have been more seriously injured.

<a name="50704-28_para9"></a>

I think that the amendment should state &quot;less than 600   metres&quot;. Did she intend that? One cannot say that it is just a misprint. I am sure that those who drafted it took good care.

<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>If the noble Baroness or the noble Lord, Lord   Bradshaw, could explain also Item Nos. 1(i) and 1(ii), I would be very grateful because I do not want to lose my licence. Even the noble Baroness admitted that before she imposed 30 mph limits in Suffolk, people were going, legitimately, at 60 mph. If that was legitimate and not dangerous, I think my point is made.
</p>




<p><a name="st_231"></a>
<a name="50704-28_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </b>   Something can be legitimate, but still be dangerous. That is indeed the point. There is already a blanket limit of 60 mph on rural roads of any type at all. Clearly, there are roads where that speed limit is simply not appropriate. I can only say to the noble Lord that if there were not a safety issue here, we would not have 2,500 people dying on rural roads every year. There is unarguably a safety problem on these roads. I am afraid that I have very little sympathy with anyone who says otherwise.

<a name="50704-28_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I have a lot of time for the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, because she is a great defender of local government, but I am quite surprised by this amendment. Suffolk County Council has taken the decision to do that. I represent nine villages on Essex County Council. All of them have speed limits of 30   mph, but we took those decisions in those villages because that is what we decided we wanted in them. We are looking at 20 mph limits beside some schools in those villages. I am surprised that the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, and the Liberal Democrats, who I thought believed in localism, want to impose something nationally which should be left to local communities. My local community has decided to impose limits and I have supported it. We should not do it nationally; we should leave it to local people to decide these matters according to circumstances in their villages. So I am very surprised that the Liberal Democrats want this.

<p><a name="st_234"></a>
<a name="50704-28_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </b>   Local authorities currently have no choice about the 60 mph speed limit, which is the default speed limit. We are not suggesting taking away local authorities&#039; choice, but if the default were reduced to 30 mph in villages and 40 mph on rural roads without white lines, local authorities could if they wished keep it at 60 mph. Their choice will not be removed; it is the default position that will be altered.
</p>

<a name="50704-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>The problem at present is that many communities and local authorities want to reduce the speed limit but   the process is bureaucratic, expensive and time-consuming. It is one thing for a village to make a <br>&nbsp;<br>

choice not to have a speed limit and quite another for it to be told when it wants one that, because of the bureaucracy, the council cannot afford it and it must wait.
</p>

<a name="50704-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>Leaving the matter to local choice addresses the point made by the noble Lord earlier. In country lanes where 60 mph is a perfectly reasonable speed limit, it can be left at that. The local authority could change the regulation in its own area, but the default for many roads that are not suitable would then be 40 mph. That is a much more sensible way forward in the eyes of the great coalition of people.

<p><a name="st_235"></a>
<a name="50704-29_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lyell: </b>   The noble Baroness says that that would be sensible. I think that she has made the case for me.   She wishes to impose a blanket rule, but local authorities have to go through what she admits is bureaucracy to allow people to drive on roads that are not near a village, but miles away in the open. If I drive at 42 mph my licence will be taken away if the local authority does not go through the bureaucracy.
</p>

<a name="50704-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>We can have a reasonable amendment, as suggested by my noble friend. I am tempted to think that the noble Baroness is suggesting a blanket rule for rural lanes, but what is a rural lane? We could go on like that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_236"></a>
<a name="50704-29_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   We should think about this issue very carefully. We have attempted to table simple amendments. My county of Oxfordshire followed Suffolk along the 30 mph road, and there is a limit of 30 mph in all villages in Oxfordshire. The parish councils of each parish decided the boundaries of the village. Some are not what other people desire, but the decision on the boundaries at either end was made by the parish councils. Local decision-making applied.
</p>

<a name="50704-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>To get round the bureaucratic tangle to which my noble friend referred in her introduction, we should like the normal arrangement to be a 30 mph limit in villages unless a village decided otherwise. The village would opt out rather than opt in.

</p>

<a name="50704-29_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>The position is similar on the country lanes amendment. We have some experience in Oxfordshire, where we have introduced limits for quiet lanes. They are single carriageway roads&#151;they are actually one-vehicle width roads with passing places&#151;where 60 mph is a ridiculous speed because every so often you meet another vehicle coming the other way. There are many other similar roads that unfortunately are used as rat runs, much to the annoyance of the people who live on them.
</p>

<a name="50704-29_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>Again, we want to say to local authorities that the default limit is 40 mph, but if they consider that it should be 60 mph the simple expedient is to put a white line on the road because it is considered wide enough for vehicles to go at the faster speed.
</p>

<a name="50704-29_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>We want to start from a simple position and then allow a local authority, a parish or district council to depart from that standing. We want a simple answer to a lot of pressure, which I am sure all noble Lords have had from the Council for the Preservation of Rural England, which is alarmed at the speed at which people <br>&nbsp;<br>

drive on rural roads and through villages. I could take noble Lords to many rural villages where there is huge pressure for the installation of speed cameras because those villages are being cut in half by the speed and volume of the traffic. It is not just a safety issue; it is a severance issue, caused by a growing volume of traffic. People see a speed camera as a means of restoring sanity in the village. They are not anxious to catch motorists, but they want them to slow down when passing through their village.
</p>

<a name="50704-29_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, referred to 30 mph repeater signs. In a significant number of lit urban areas, there is a case for a repeater sign to be placed either on the road or on a lamp-post at the discretion and even at the expense of a local authority. I know of local authorities that are pleading to have a means of reminding people that even though they are outside a town they are still in a built-up area and still in a 30   mph limit area. I know of places where people are pleading for some relief from vehicles passing through their area at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour.

</p>

<a name="50704-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>I admit that perhaps neither of the new clauses on speed limits that we on the Liberal Democrat Benches propose is perfect. However, they point to a way forward, and one to which many noble Lords have referred. This is probably the only Road Safety Bill that we shall have in this Parliament. Is there no way in which some relief can be given to those who live in rural areas and on the outskirts of towns during our discussions on the Bill? I rest my case and await the Minister&#039;s response.

<p><a name="st_237"></a>
<a name="50704-29_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen: </b>   As someone who has lived most of my life in rural areas, I support Amendment No. 78. I have lived on one of the rat runs described by the noble Lord and am aware of the difficulty that that causes. When the Government published their road safety Strategy, the Prime Minister said that a 30 mph speed limit should be the norm for villages. The amendment would go a long way to achieving what I took to be a commitment along those lines.
</p>

<a name="50704-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>The amendment is supported by the Safer Streets Coalition, but that body sees it only as a first step towards adopting a default 20 miles per hour limit. I raise that issue on that body&#039;s behalf. However, as we are not considering a 20 mph limit today but a 30 mph limit, I am pleased to support the amendment.

<a name="50704-29_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   I support the amendments, particularly Amendments Nos. 78 and 79, although I do not wish to spend too much time discussing them.

</p>

<a name="50704-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>Some noble Lords have mentioned examples of places where they believe such restrictions are inappropriate. The noble Lord, Lord Lyell, referred to Wester Ross. The last time that I was in Wester Ross, I seem to remember, every road was a single track with passing places. If you put a white line down the middle, you would have to drive with a wheel on either side of it as the roads were so narrow. If motorways have been built there now and the relevant authorities have not bothered to put a white line down the middle of them, white lines would be the answer to enable motorists to travel at higher speeds. However, there are many other examples <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_509"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 509</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of places where it is unsafe to walk or even to cycle. When one thinks of country lanes one tends to think of high hedges, although that is not always the case. If you are walking along a road why should you have to jump on to a wet verge or, even worse, into a ditch because a car is travelling too fast? You have as much right to be there as the car.

</p>

<a name="50704-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>We need to start considering seriously lower speed limits on certain roads where that is appropriate and for local authorities to set those speed limits. We should at least make it easier for local authorities to set those limits as, otherwise, people will be marooned in villages in their houses or flats. They cannot get out as they cannot walk anywhere or they are frightened to do so.
</p>

<a name="50704-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>I wish to speak briefly to Amendment No. 82, which stands in my name and is grouped with the amendments that we are discussing. It might be thought odd to table an amendment to introduce regulations to cover speed cameras within two years of Royal Assent. Many noble Lords may think that there are enough already.
</p>

<a name="50704-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>I have done a bit of research on this, and I have been told that there are no regulations whatever, just various circulars and instructions from the Department for Transport. Given the amount of time that we have talked about speed cameras today and during the previous Committee day, it would be good for the Government to be able to rationalise what is done with speed cameras; where they are put; and how many hundreds of people have to be killed at a site before a camera can be put up. They could leave it to the local authority or partnership to put them up anywhere, which I would prefer. Speed cameras were all grey until Mr Spellar said that they had to be yellow. So they are yellow now, and my noble friend the Minister has explained why, which is perfectly valid, even though I might disagree with him. As there are no regulations and given the fact that technology is moving fast, it would be good to have regulations so everyone knows where he stands.
</p>




<p><a name="st_239"></a>
<a name="50704-29_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   I have half a sympathy with Amendment No. 77. It sounds good, but I would not want it to reach such a point that signs proliferated and there were too many of them. The answer to that would be to have signs on the road, something to which the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, referred. Signs painted on the road are easier, particularly as we are talking about areas that are lit. That point has been made. When one is driving, they are much easier, as the road is in vision all the time. A repeat sign painted on the road would be less expensive to maintain and would be clear and helpful.

</p>

<a name="50704-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>On Amendment No. 78, I puzzled about a village in a different way from my noble friend Lord Lyell. It seems to me that there is no maximum number of houses for a village. A major metropolis could be labelled as a village. A definition of &quot;village&quot; is necessary. The amendment says &quot;20 or more houses&quot;. There might be blocks of flats&#151;which would not be houses, but dwellings&#151;and it could be a built-up area.
</p>




<p><a name="st_240"></a>
<a name="50704-29_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </b>   I can help the noble Baroness on that point. At the moment, if a community has street lighting, it automatically has a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_510"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 510</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

speed limit. So, in the scenario to which the noble Baroness referred, I cannot imagine a situation where a large settlement would have flats and so on but would not have street lighting. At the moment, if a community has no street lighting, the default speed limit is 60 mph, regardless of how big it is.
</p>




<p><a name="st_241"></a>
<a name="50704-29_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   I thank the noble Baroness. I was making the technical point that I thought that that definition needed to be clarified.

<a name="50704-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>I am sorry to say that I do not agree with Amendment No. 80, tabled by my noble friend Lord   Dundee. Local authorities are so busy doing reports on pretty well everything all the time that they should have discretion on whether to take on the burden of an annual report if there is a local demand for it. I am always reluctant to give extra burdens to local authorities. We legislate all the time and push work on to local authorities, but we never give them the money to do what we have asked them to do and the cost goes to the council tax payer.
</p>

<a name="50704-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>I thought that Amendment No. 82 was very surprising, as the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley said. I did not understand that there were no regulations already. It is important that there should be regulations. Since we started on the Bill, the noble Lord, Lord Davies, has repeatedly made the point that speed cameras are supposed to be safety cameras. As for Marlow Hill in Wycombe, I have now seen photos, and I realise that I know it. It is an unbelievable hill. It is hard to believe that people can ask drivers not to wish to put their foot on the accelerator to try to get up it. At the moment, it is apparently the local authority that has the right to decide what speed to put where. That needs to be considered. I have no further comments.

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-30_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>That is as far as I intend to speak on the amendment, but it might raise the temperature slightly if I recount the experience of friends in whose village, where the road had a white line along the centre, the national speed limit of 60 mph was reduced to 30 mph. One day, the lady of the house was gardening outside and saw someone ignoring the 30 mph limit, so she put up three fingers. The driver obviously disagreed and thought that the limit should have been 20 mph, because he stuck up two fingers.

</p>

<a name="50704-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>Regarding Amendment No. 77, moved by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, I understand the concerns that might arise from drivers being unaware of the speed limit. However, I hope to show that the amendment is unnecessary. Local traffic authorities can make speed limit orders under Section 84 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, as I am sure the noble Earl is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_511"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 511</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

aware. Provisions relating to the placing of speed limit signs are contained in the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (TSRGD) 2002. As the power is already available to make provisions relating to repeater signs, primary legislation would not be needed, should it be necessary to change the repeater sign requirements.

</p>

<a name="50704-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a>Those regulations provide that repeater signs are placed at regular intervals along all roads. The only exceptions are street lit roads, where a 30 mph speed limit is in force, or unlit roads, where the national speed limit is in force. The national speed limit is 60 mph on single carriageways and 70 mph on duel carriageways.
</p>

<a name="50704-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>I acknowledge that the presence of street lighting might be an odd way to indicate speed limits. However, in practice, it has the merit of simplicity. If there are street lights and no signs to the contrary, the speed limit is 30 mph. That has been law for more than 70 years and drivers are required to learn that to pass their driving test. That said, guidance on good practice on the placing and size of repeater signs exists in the form of Traffic Advisory Leaflet 1/95. That is advisory, rather than mandatory, and allows local traffic authorities greater flexibility when placing repeater signs and overcomes the situation where signs that are placed marginally too far apart make the speed limit unenforceable. Ultimately, if local traffic authorities placed repeater signs, as has been advised, a driver should be fully aware of the speed limit that is in force on any given road.
</p>




<p><a name="st_244"></a>
<a name="50704-30_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   I wish to be absolutely clear. Is the Minister saying that the present statutory instruments allow a local traffic authority, if it wishes, to erect signs within an area where there are street lights or put them   on the road surface, as the noble Baroness, Lady   Gardener of Parkes, said? Is it advisory, whereby the authorities can do that, or are they prohibited from doing that? If that were the case, we would seek to move an amendment that would allow them to do that if they wished.
</p>

</p>




<p><a name="st_246"></a>
<a name="50704-30_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   So the SI mandates them against providing repeater signs or signs that would remind motorists, even on a long stretch of road, that they are still within a 30 mph limit, if that road is lit. I must be absolutely clear, because that would then lead us on to the question of an amendment we might wish to move, following what the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, to allow local authorities to do that if they wished. I am not seeking to take the power from local government, but to make it available to local government, should they wish, in particular circumstances, to apply it.

However, it is unlikely that such a limit will be appropriate for all villages&#151;for example, those located on roads with a strategic or through-traffic function. That is why we favour the current regime, which provides traffic authorities with the flexibility to be able to set an appropriate speed limit through villages on their roads, having given full and proper consideration to what is the right limit based on all needs and local requirements. In our view, as well as improving safety, this also increases respect for, and compliance with, speed limits.
</p>

<a name="50704-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>I hope, in view of the fact that it is already government policy for villages to be subject to a 30   mph speed limit where appropriate, and of the fact that traffic authorities already have the necessary powers to set an appropriate speed limit through villages, that noble Lords will withdraw this amendment.

<p><a name="st_250"></a>
<a name="50704-30_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </b>   Will the Minister accept that the term &quot;government policy&quot;, with all due respect, is completely meaningless in this context? The Government have not altered any of the regulatory framework within which local authorities have to operate to create a speed limit. It is still down to the local authority to decide if the limit is right, so government policy does not enter into it.

</p>

<a name="50704-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>On the question of &quot;strategic routes&quot;, villages on fairly important routes are, in many cases, exactly the places where they need the speed limit most. The volume of traffic is such that it is more dangerous and has a greater impact on the quality of life. Under the terms of a scheme related to our amendment, imperfectly worded though it <br>&nbsp;<br>

is, a local authority would still be able to opt out a village. Will the Minister accept that there are many more villages on small roads than there are on strategic roads?
</p>




<p><a name="st_251"></a>
<a name="50704-30_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   I have repeatedly stated that the Government are in favour of a 30 mph limit in those circumstances. However, whether or not the noble Baroness wishes to hear it called &quot;government policy&quot;, the Government would want local authorities to have flexibility to make what they see as the appropriate decisions. I am afraid therefore that there is not a meeting of minds on this issue between myself and the noble Baroness.
</p>




<p><a name="st_252"></a>
<a name="50704-30_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   That contrasts greatly with what the Minister said to me about repeater signs. I ask simply that local authorities should have flexibility. The other point is that we want to see the position altered so that the policy would normally be 30 mph and the default position would be the higher limit. In reversing that, we are making it easier to set the 30 mph limit but, by exception, accepting that a local authority is the arbiter in deciding whether 30, 40, 50 or 60 is the appropriate speed through a village.
</p>




<p><a name="st_253"></a>
<a name="50704-30_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   I understand the point about the default mechanism, but we are not persuaded that it is the way to move ahead.

</p>

<a name="50704-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>Amendment No. 79 seeks to insert an additional category of road into Schedule 6 to the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. The intention is to lower the speed limit from 50 mph to 40 mph on single carriageway roads without a central white line for passenger vehicles which exceed 3.05 tonnes, or are adapted to carrying more than eight passengers, or are drawing a trailer; and for goods vehicles which do not exceed 7.5 tonnes. This would align the speed limit for these classes of vehicles with that of HGVs which are already restricted to 40 mph on these roads.

</p>

<a name="50704-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>This is a complex issue, as has been brought out in the debate. We believe that it will need more careful consideration in order to avoid potentially imposing additional restrictions for potentially little benefit. On the face of it, the proposal might appear to be attractive from the point of view of improving road safety. However, it would be wrong to reach the conclusion that speed limits should be reduced without, for example, first having some clear understanding about what proportion of accidents on these roads involving these vehicles may be related to inappropriate speed.
</p>

<a name="50704-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>That information is not currently to hand and no doubt other factors will also need to be taken into consideration before a firm decision can be made on the merits of the amendment. However, I should be happy for officials to engage in a separate discussion with Members of the Committee about the amendment outside the consideration of the Bill. If after further discussion the proposal were to be accepted, the necessary legislative amendments could be made through statutory instrument. I hope that in view of that undertaking the amendment will be withdrawn.

<p><a name="stpa_451"></a>On Amendment No. 80 in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Dundee, we come to a call for an annual report on speed limits. I thank him for setting out his reasons for the amendment. However, I am still a little unclear as to whether the report that he wishes to see is intended to cover the trunk road network for which the Highways Agency is traffic authority.
<a name="time_28"></a>
<a name="50704-30_time0"></a><h5>9.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="50704-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>The local authorities&#039; responsibilities in respect of road safety go much wider than speed limits. They are already locally accountable in a number of ways, as the noble Earl suggested. For example, Section 39 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 imposes a duty on local authorities to carry out studies into road accidents in their area and to carry out programmes of measures designed to promote road safety. That is done through a combination of engineering schemes, education, training and publicity.
</p>

<a name="50704-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>Local highway authorities in England are already required to prepare and submit five-year local transport plans. They are also required to prepare annual progress reports setting out progress against those local plans and targets.
</p>

<a name="50704-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a>The department&#039;s guidance on the second round local transport plans, covering the period 2006&#150;11, also now requires authorities to produce and to publish a speed management strategy as part of their overall approach to delivering safe roads in their area.
</p>

<a name="50704-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>Traffic authorities determine local speed limits having regard to guidance issued by the department. We have recently consulted on updated guidance which is designed to improve clarity and deliver greater consistency of local speed limits across the country. The updated guidance, which will be published later this year, is intended to form the basis for the local speed management strategies.

</p>

<a name="50704-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a>Local authorities already keep their speed limits under review with changing circumstances. The updated guidance on setting local speed limits is, however, eagerly awaited by traffic authorities and can therefore be expected to lead to more formal reviews as it is implemented on the ground. It would seem appropriate that local authorities&#039; intentions for reviewing speed limits in accordance with the new guidance could usefully be part of their speed management strategies.
</p>

<a name="50704-30_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a>To conclude on the amendment, local authorities already therefore have a number of other important priorities, which include work in relation to speed management. We would much rather that the time that might have been spent on compiling a speed limit report, as set out in the amendment, was spent on implementing further road safety measures that will help to reduce casualties.
</p>

<a name="50704-30_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>Amendment No. 82, tabled by my noble friend Lord   Berkeley, calls for regulation of cameras. Noble Lords will know that most speed cameras are now operated under the national safety camera programme, which requires the safety camera partnerships to operate under the strict rules set out in the department&#039;s <i>The Handbook of Rules and Guidance for the National Safety Camera programme for England and Wales 2005&#150;06</i>.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_515"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 515</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50704-30_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>National safety partnerships consist of local authorities, the police, the magistrates&#039; court, the Highways Agency where appropriate and other key stakeholders, including the local health authority, to ensure that the safety camera programme operates in the most effective way.
</p>

<a name="50704-30_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>Among other things, the handbook stipulates the rules on important matters such as the process to be followed in order that netting off&#151;cost recovery&#151;is allowable; camera deployment criteria; signing; and conspicuity rules&#151;visibility rules.

</p>

<a name="50704-30_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>The content of the handbook of rules has been reviewed and strengthened annually since the programme was first established in 2000 to ensure that the programme remains effective. Furthermore, individual cameras are also kept under review by safety camera partnerships as part of their operational case submissions. Camera partnerships must already fully comply with the statutory requirements of the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002 with regard to speed limits and camera signage. Further regulation of the rules as proposed in Amendment No. 82, would reduce the flexibility to develop the programme to ensure that it continues to be effective in future. For example, it would make it more difficult readily to change deployment criteria&#151;where to place the camera&#151;or rectify any problems, should the need arise.
</p>

<a name="50704-30_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a>Amendment No. 83, would insert a new clause entitled,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>&quot;Traffic signs for indicating speed restrictions at regular intervals&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-30_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a>I understand the concern that may arise from drivers being unaware of the speed limit. However I hope to show that the amendment is unnecessary.
</p>

<a name="50704-30_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a>Section 85 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 requires the Secretary of State and local traffic authorities to erect and maintain prescribed or authorised traffic signs to ensure that adequate guidance is given to drivers regarding the speed limit on any road. Under that section, no signs are required where a road subject to a 30 mile per hour speed limit is lit by lamps not more than 200 yards apart. The amendment would be to reverse that position and mean that 30 mile per hour repeater signs would be required on such roads.
</p>

<a name="50704-30_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a>The Secretary of State has power to make directions by statutory instrument for the placing of speed limit signs. Provisions relating to the placing of speed limit   signs are contained in the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (TSRGD) 2002.
</p>

<a name="50704-30_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a>The TSRGD already provides that repeater signs are placed at regular intervals along all roads. The only exceptions are street-lit roads where a 30 mile an hour speed limit is in force or unlit roads where the national speed limit is in force.
</p>

<a name="50704-30_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a>As I said earlier, Members of the Committee may be of the opinion that the presence of street lighting may be an odd way to indicate a speed limit. However, as I also said earlier, it has the merit of simplicity.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_516"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 516</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50704-30_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a>Furthermore, TSRGD requires that terminal speed limit signs must be placed on both sides of the carriageway at the start and end of a speed limit, including roads with a system of street lighting subject to a 30 mile an hour speed limit, except at a junction with a road subject to a higher speed limit, where only one terminal speed limit sign is required.

</p>

<a name="50704-30_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a>The effect of the amendment would be to place an additional requirement on local traffic authorities to place repeater signs on street-lit roads subject to a 30 mile an hour speed limit. That requirement would significantly increase the number of repeater signs required for our roads. Aside from the sign clutter, which has already been mentioned, and environmental intrusion aspects, there are substantial cost implications related to such a move.
</p>

<a name="50704-30_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>Local traffic authorities would be expected to fund additional signing. The department would much rather that money was spent introducing proven traffic-calming measures in areas where there is a history of speed related accidents.

</p>

<a name="50704-30_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>Ultimately, a driver should be fully aware that the presence of street lights indicates a road subject to a 30   mile an hour speed limit, unless signs indicate otherwise.
</p>

<a name="50704-30_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>In view of that lengthy explanation, I hope that the noble Earl will withdraw his amendment.

On the roads concerned the local authorities are buying all sorts of   signs which say, &quot;Think&quot;, &quot;Reduce your speed&quot;, everything except what speed you are supposed to be doing because that is prohibited under the regulations. There are six or seven of these signs which are available to buy. They are fluorescent and can be attached to a lamppost.

<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_8"></a><br>
   &quot;DRIVER LIABILITY IN COLLISION WITH VULNERABLE ROAD USERS

<br>
(1)   This section applies when recompense is being sought by or on behalf of a person who was not a person to whom in the circumstances which give rise to recompense being sought in section 143 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (c. 52) (user of motor vehicles to be insured or secured against third-party risks) applies, or would apply but for the exceptions from a duty to insure or give security contained in that Act or elsewhere, and the person from whom recompense is being sought is a person to whom section 143 of that Act applies, or would apply but for the exceptions from a duty to insure or give security contained in that Act or elsewhere.


<br>
(2)   When this section applies, a court shall find for the person seeking recompense or on whose behalf recompense is sought, unless the person from whom recompense is sought shows that he has no responsibility for any of the circumstances giving rise to recompense being sought.


<br>
(3)   The court may make reduction in recompense if in all the circumstances of the case (including the age and any physical, sensory or mental disabilities of the person seeking recompense or on whose behalf recompense is sought) it considers it just to do so and shall in any case not make any reduction in recompense if recompense is sought on behalf of a person under ten years of age at the time of the first event giving rise to recompense being sought.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_257"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment concerns driver liability in collisions with more vulnerable road users. It is pretty obvious to say this, but if a motor vehicle hits a pedestrian, a cyclist, an equestrian or a disabled person the non-motorised user is much more likely to be injured than the driver. As I said earlier today, the figures are something like you are on average 18 times more likely to be injured if you are not in the vehicle.
</p>

<a name="50704-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a>It ought to mean that drivers have a greater duty of care for non-motorised users and their safety. But this is not currently recognised in law. The current civil liability system requires negligence to be proven, which is of course often impossible for pedestrians and cyclists when they have been killed or injured.
</p>

<a name="50704-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>My argument is that the law on driver insurance schemes should be amended so that non-motorised road users will be able to claim injury damages from   drivers who hit them unless it can be shown that the non-motorised road user behaved recklessly. In deciding this, the person&#039;s mental and physical ability should be taken into account so that groups such as children and people with learning difficulties and disabilities would normally obtain damages in any event. Drivers would not, however, be criminalised under these proposals. These proposals are in line with laws already in place in other European countries.

that. My impression is that it is much safer to ride a cycle in those cities than it is in London, where I am used to cycling. Drivers give cyclists more space and give way to them when they have the right of way. I have talked to quite a few cycling groups about the matter, and I am persuaded that the reason for the difference is that drivers in those countries understand that they will be seen to be guilty if they hit a cyclist or pedestrian while driving without due care.
</p>

<a name="50704-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>It will be interesting to hear what my noble friend says, as the amendment would make a major contribution to redressing the balance between the road user in a motorised vehicle and others such as pedestrians and cyclists, who have an equal right to use the road.

<a name="50704-31_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness. I said that the amendment would include pedestrians, cyclists, equestrians or disabled persons; in other words, any road user.

<p><a name="st_260"></a>
<a name="50704-31_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   Of course, I share the concerns about vulnerable road users.

That seems to destroy the concept on which our law is founded.
</p>

<a name="50704-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a>Furthermore, I am not sure that the amendment would encourage road safety. The likelihood is that it would encourage greater recklessness on the part of those who could never in any circumstances be found at fault because they are defined by my noble friend as the innocent party. Instead of the courts being able to look at the incident, take account of all the factors concerned and reach a judgment, a judgment would already have been made against the motorist, in any circumstances, in favour of the other party. I do not think that that is tenable.

<a name="50704-31_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Berkeley: </b>   I am grateful for my noble friend&#039;s response.

There is no great outcry on the Continent because motorists are proved guilty before they can even protest their innocence. I shall reflect on what my noble friend says.

<p><a name="st_263"></a>The noble Earl said: The amendment would introduce a new charge of causing death or injury by negligent driving; thereby, it claims to bridge a gap in the law relating to serious driving offences.
</p>

<a name="50704-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a>The current pattern of road traffic law in dealing with a death or injury on the roads has been criticised by many as deficient. At present, a death or injury may be followed by one of three criminal charges. First, the most serious one is that of causing death by dangerous driving. It can be tried in the Crown Court and carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. In bringing such   a charge, the Crown Prosecution Service must demonstrate that the standard of driving by the defendant was far below that expected of a competent driver.

</p>

<a name="50704-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a>Secondly, there is the charge of dangerous driving that has resulted in injury but not death. As in the first case, such dangerous driving must be deemed to be far below that expected of a competent driver. The second charge can be tried in either a Crown Court or a magistrates&#039; court. The maximum sentence is two years&#039; imprisonment. The third charge is driving without due care and attention, often referred to as careless driving. That charge can be taken only in a magistrates&#039; court. A sentence cannot include imprisonment, driving disqualification is discretionary, and any fine imposed may not exceed &#163;2,500.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_487"></a>A Department for Transport research report published in 2002, <i>Dangerous Driving and the Law</i>, followed a series of cases through the court process. It discovered that a number of incidents involving a death on the roads were subsequently treated as cases of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_520"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 520</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

careless driving, with far lower penalties ensuing than seemed to be right, given the severity of the offence and of the consequences. The report proposed a new offence&#151;causing death by negligent driving&#151;to fill the perceived justice gap.
</p>

<a name="50704-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a>The Government had been reluctant to act on the issue until the publication of a report commissioned by the Home Office. Published in February of this year, <i>A Review of Road Traffic Offences involving Bad Driving</i> contained proposals to amend the law. The closing date for consultation on the proposals was 6 May. In a debate in Westminster Hall on 21 June, the Home Office Minister, Fiona Mactaggart, referred to the intention to publish a summary of the responses received &quot;in due course&quot;&#151;a timescale that could mean almost anything.
</p>

<a name="50704-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a>The Government had already indicated their intention to raise the maximum penalty for dangerous driving to five years&#039; imprisonment. The consultation document proposed a new offence of causing death by careless driving. Amendment No. 85 therefore offers the Government an opportunity to write their intentions into the statute book.

</p>

<a name="50704-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_490"></a>There are, however, two differences. First, the amendment here deliberately uses the word &quot;negligent&quot;, rather than &quot;careless&quot;. Many crashes involving a death are not accidental. They may not be deliberate&#151;dangerous driving covers that issue&#151;but they involve a lapse of concentration that a careful driver should not experience. The term &quot;negligent&quot; would perhaps fit better than &quot;careless&quot;. Secondly, it would introduce the aspect of serious injury. That already applies in Northern Ireland. I beg to move.

<a name="50704-32_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Monson: </b>   Last time we had the Committee stage on the Bill, I opposed an amendment proposed by the noble Earl. This time, I am pleased to support him, at least as far as the first part of his amendment goes.
</p>

<a name="50704-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_491"></a>As the noble Earl said, in Northern Ireland, for a great many years, it has been an offence to cause grievous bodily injury by driving dangerously on a road. The wording is almost identical to that proposed by the noble Earl, with one exception: he uses the words &quot;serious injury&quot;, while in Northern Ireland they talk of &quot;grievous bodily injury&quot;. Surely, it comes to the same thing.
</p>

<a name="50704-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_492"></a>It has worked well in Northern Ireland. After all, if you drive so badly that you blind somebody or cause them to be paralysed from the neck down, it ruins their life almost as much as if you had killed them. It is high time that we brought our law into line with Northern Ireland in that respect.
</p>

<a name="50704-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_493"></a>I am not so sure on the second part of the amendment. In principle, the noble Earl is correct, but the proposed maximum penalty of 10 years is on the high side for negligent driving. At the moment, it is true that the penalties are much too low, but 10 years for causing death by negligent driving is too high. Five ought to be the absolute maximum in that case.

have taken an unduly lenient view of those who leave people injured for life as a result of their negligent driving. There seems to be both a reluctance on the part of the Crown Prosecution Service to bring the most serious charges&#151; and often to bring the lesser charge, which can be tried in the magistrates&#039; court&#151;and for the magistrates&#039; court to take the driver&#039;s point of view rather than that of the person who has suffered injury.
</p>

<a name="50704-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_494"></a>This is a very serious issue. I hope that when the Minister replies he will tell us that the Government will pick up the results of the consultation, which was debated in Westminster Hall, and that it is their intention to introduce into the Bill either the amendments proposed by the noble Earl or something similar. I cannot think of many cases where you can behave in such a negligent and dangerous way and be dealt with in such a lenient way, often in a magistrates&#039; court. You may not be disqualified even though you have left someone grievously injured for the rest of their life.

I also thank the noble Lords, Lord Monson and Lord Berkeley, as well as my noble friend Lady Hanham for theirs. As indicated, a justice gap has been acknowledged by the Government. They have already suggested that the maximum penalty for dangerous driving should be raised to five years, and their consultation paper is already in favour of the institution of a new offence of causing death by careless driving.

</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_274"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 20, as I read it, introduces disqualification for the second offence of using a vehicle in a dangerous condition. That is a serious offence and I can fully understand the mischief that the Minister seeks to remedy. However, there are some difficulties.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_523"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 523</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50704-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a>First, a six-month ban is quite onerous: I suggest that a three-month ban would still have a salutary effect. Secondly, whether a vehicle is in a dangerous condition is very much a matter of judgment, and not of fact&#151;such as whether a vehicle is exceeding a speed limit. I have never been prosecuted for any offence, not even a motoring offence, touch wood. But if I were prosecuted under Section 40, I would seek the best specialist legal advice. I would certainly not take it on the chin, because if convicted, I would already be halfway towards losing my licence. My noble friend Lord Hanningfield will deal with the position of someone who is an employed driver, who can be in a more difficult position than a private motorist. I will fully support him in that amendment.
</p>

<a name="50704-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_505"></a>My final concern is that I will vigorously defend any prosecution for the offence of using a vehicle in a dangerous condition. But what happens if, prior to the passing of the Bill, a motorist is convicted for using a vehicle in a dangerous condition? The court knows that giving him three points will only take him a quarter of the way, or an extra quarter, towards losing his licence&#151;and therefore takes that into account when setting the fine. Then, after the Bill is passed, and the court is considering a second offence of the same kind&#151; using a vehicle in a dangerous condition&#151;the court will have to disqualify if it convicts. But the court considering the first offence of using a vehicle in a dangerous condition would not have been able to take into consideration the effect of the Bill when setting a fine. Therefore, the Bill will effectively increase the penalty awarded by the first court. I am not convinced that that is compliant with the ECHR.
</p>




<p><a name="st_275"></a>
<a name="50704-33_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   My Amendment No. 91 is linked with Amendment No. 90. As the noble Earl said, Clause 20 would make disqualification for using a motor vehicle in a dangerous condition obligatory and not discretionary if the driver has committed a similar offence in the previous three years. What it does not say is how dangerous a vehicle has to be. Before I go on to the main point of the amendment, which is the employee, I would point out that a vehicle in a dangerous condition could be anything from having one tyre that does not fulfil the requirements to a vehicle that is a complete write-off in terms of tyres, engines, lights, ignition and indicators.
</p>

<a name="50704-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a>Therefore, the first flaw with this clause is the fact that the description of the vehicle is omitted. It is pretty harsh that, if three years previously one got a fine for a bald tyre or not having an indicator or back light, one should automatically be disqualified for having one more faulty tyre or indicator. The definition of &quot;vehicle in a dangerous condition&quot; needs to be sorted out.

</p>

<a name="50704-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a>The main burden of my amendment is to highlight a difficulty with the legislation. As the clause stands, a good driver who is not the owner of the vehicle but merely an employee would automatically lose his livelihood when there may be no culpability on his part. The courts should decide on the basis of the evidence before them and not be ordered by Parliament to take a certain view on disqualification. The amendment would therefore <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_524"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 524</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

exempt any offender who was employee driving a vehicle that was not his from the insistence that a second offender receives an obligatory ban.
</p>

<a name="50704-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>There are many occasions when drivers take vehicles out&#151;builders or people transporting goods from one place to another. They simply collect the vehicle in the depot and take it on. Only the most assiduous employee would crawl over the vehicle first to make sure that it was in excellent condition. There are certain circumstances in which, if one is driving somebody else&#039;s vehicle in the course of employment, one understands and knows that there is something wrong with it. There are many vehicle defects, however, that are weighty enough to make the vehicle dangerous but which the driver might not know anything about, especially if it is not his vehicle. For example, a badly corroded chassis would not be immediately evident to the driver. If it was a commercial vehicle with a tipping facility on the back one would not necessarily know whether that mechanism was in a dangerous condition. Why should the employee know whether the vehicle is in a dangerous condition?
</p>

<a name="50704-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>Why do the Government want to include a provision in the Bill that could, in certain circumstances, be an attack on an innocent working man working for an employer who was not following the maintenance of his vehicles properly? The worker could find that he lost not only his licence but his livelihood. If his only trade is as a driver, he could be taken off the road by the disqualification and consequently would not be able to work. We should allow the courts to look at the evidence before them. If there was a fault that experts could say would not necessarily be apparent to the driver of the vehicle, why should the driver, who is not the owner, receive an immediate ban?
</p>

<a name="50704-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>There are many other examples within road driving legislation where there is a differential between the owner of a vehicle and the driver. I recommend that we ensure that that differential remains true of this clause as well.

<a name="50704-33_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bradshaw: </b>   Perhaps I may add a word or two to what has just been said by the noble Baroness. We are talking about vehicles in a dangerous condition, not necessarily vehicles in a defective condition.
</p>

<a name="50704-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a>If you have attended a vehicle inspection as I have and seen vehicles stopped, you would be horrified by the standards of some vehicles. I remember one instance of a lorry carrying coal from Southampton to Glasgow, which was stopped at Abingdon. I was invited by the vehicle inspector to bend down and look at the tyres. He told me not to touch them, but, by that time, I had done so. The metal of the tyres was exposed all the way around. The tread had gone completely. He said that if he were to take the case to the local magistrates&#039; court, the driver would be fined &#163;200. He said that that was less than the cost of one replacement tyre. He said, &quot;The one thing I can do which will effectively punish him is to stop the lorry here, and he will have to manually shovel all the coal out of the lorry into another lorry&quot;.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column 525</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50704-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a>I cannot believe that that driver, be he an employee or the employer, would be ignorant of the fact that the lorry was not in roadworthy condition. Before any driver, be he working for a local builder or a local haulage firm, takes a vehicle on the road, he should make simple checks of the tyres, the lights, the windscreen washers and the like&#151;the sort of things that we are encouraged to do. He should do so because he is a professional driver. The Vehicle Inspectorate is unlikely to prosecute somebody for having a dangerous vehicle because one light is out or one windscreen wiper is not working, but if a person has really taken a dangerous vehicle on to our motorways, he is causing lots of people to suffer risk of serious injury. The Government are right to think fairly seriously about this, but I shall be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say.
</p>




<p><a name="st_277"></a>
<a name="50704-33_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Attlee: </b>   It is surprisingly easy to pick up a conviction for using a vehicle in a dangerous condition. It is not perhaps as easy as my noble friend on the Front Bench suggested, where just a defective indicator is concerned, but a loose filler cap on the diesel tank, for instance, is a very serious matter. When the vehicle goes round a corner, the fuel can spill out. This is extremely dangerous for cyclists. Therefore, the authorities need to prosecute. No specific offence exists. All that one can do is prosecute the driver for using a vehicle in a dangerous condition. That is an example of how easy it is to pick up a prosecution.
</p>

<a name="50704-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_513"></a>If we make the result of being prosecuted for a loose filler cap too devastating, the authorities might not prosecute at all, because they will jeopardise the driver&#039;s licence, but they still want to prosecute him for something. The provision could have an unfortunate effect. We need to think very carefully about this, but I too would be interested in hearing what the Minister has to say.

the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, said about how easy it is to be prosecuted for being in charge of a dangerous vehicle.
</p>

<a name="50704-34_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_516"></a>Let me make it clear. The vehicle must be dangerous, so a bald tyre does not come within the frame.

You would have to be a pretty careless driver not to know that your filler cap does not fit.

<p><a name="st_281"></a>
<a name="50704-34_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   I bow to the technical knowledge of the noble Earl, who has no doubt dealt with more ill-fitting filler caps than I have.
</p>

<a name="50704-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_517"></a>Even so, on the more general issues, we are talking about vehicles that are in a dangerous condition. That is tremendously important as the issue relates also to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, in Amendment No. 91. Let us remember that we are talking about a second offence. The noble Earl, Lord   Attlee, said that a second offence brings in more condign punishment after the first offence has been committed. Legislation is like that. If the driver does not know that the legislation governing the conditions under which he does his work and how he conducts a truck or lorry on the road has changed, he is not fit to be the driver. It is his professional responsibility.
</p>

<a name="50704-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_518"></a>It will not do to say that in some malign or unfair way the Government have now upped the sentences on a poor individual. He is somebody who has committed an offence on two separate occasions and we intend to ensure that trucks are safe on the road. To do that, the driver must take responsibility.
</p>

<a name="50704-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_519"></a>In response to the contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, it need not be the driver who is charged with the offence. The offences are the use, causing or permitting another person to use a motor vehicle. In other words, it might be the employer who is negligent and the charge might be brought against him. It might even be the filler cap man. It might be that the driver could not possibly have spotted that the filler cap did not fit. The owner of the vehicle might be his employer, and in those circumstances, the prosecuting authorities will deal with the person responsible for the dangerous condition of the vehicle.
</p>

<a name="50704-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_520"></a>That is my answer to the noble Baroness, who tugged at my heart strings when she suggested that a new Labour government might wish to victimise a working man in the course of his duty. Of course we would not want to victimise any working man or woman engaged in any form of professional activity. I want to bring it to the attention of the noble Baroness that we would want to identify who was responsible for the offence of bringing a dangerous vehicle on to the road. As the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="st_282"></a>
<a name="50704-34_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Hanham: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for his robust reply. He said that a decision would be made on who was responsible for the vehicle, but that is not what the Bill says. I refers to

</p>

<a name="50704-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_522"></a>I recognise that my amendment is not correct as it stands but neither do I think that the legislation is   correct as it stands as regards penalties being apportioned as between the owner and the driver. On that basis we may need to return to the matter again to obtain clarity on it. Once you move the penalty from being that of a discretionary disqualification&#151;which leaves the matter of whether the user or the permitter is at fault in the hands of the court&#151;you take the matter out of the hands of the court and make it an absolute offence for which there must be absolutely a disqualification. Once you do that and thereby put people&#039;s livelihoods in jeopardy, you must be clear what the new section is saying.

However, I sought to emphasise that existing legislation provides for the fact that if the driver can demonstrate that he drove the vehicle on the basis of assurances from the employer that it was a safe vehicle, but it proved not to be, the driver would not be prosecuted; rather the owner of the vehicle would be prosecuted. However, no doubt we shall return to these issues.

Our proceedings are essentially the same as those in the House. Noble Lords will speak standing. All noble Lords are free to attend and participate, and proceedings will be reported in <i>Hansard</i>. As we are in Committee, Members of the Committee may speak more than once to any Motion. As there is more than one item of business today, each item will be called individually by the Clerk. I make it clear to noble Lords that this Committee is charged only to consider Orders, not to approve or disapprove them. The Motion to approve will be moved in the Chamber in the usual way. If there is a Division in the Chamber while we are sitting, the Committee will adjourn at the earliest convenient moment after the Division bells are rung and we shall resume after 10 minutes.

convenience and to avoid repetition, I shall briefly confirm for the Committee, and through the Committee to the House, that the Secretary of State is mindful of the issues raised at Question Time by several colleagues in the House about the way that we deal with Northern Ireland business. I hope that we will shortly be able to make proposals. It may not go as far as the opening bids of amending the legislation&#151;these things never do&#151;but certainly we are looking at the possibility of bringing to your Lordships, with officials and Ministers, drafts of the legislation before it is published as a draft&#151;so that it can be talked about, questioned, and possibly changed before it is published, in a different way from what we do now.
</p>

<a name="50704-35_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a>We are looking at that, and obviously we have to discuss it with the authorities. I am not saying that that is exactly what will happen, but it is that kind of possibility that the Secretary of State will be having discussions about. The Leader of the House, the Lord President of the Council, indicated that the current situation is unsatisfactory. We hope that it will be used for only a short period. We have taken on board the issue. It is the first time since the election that we have taken orders in Grand Committee, although it is not the first time that we have considered orders. The others were considered on the Floor of the House. We have a package here today and, as was mentioned, there is a further smaller package on Thursday this week. I hope that we will be able to have a process.
</p>

<a name="50704-35_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>If we agree to do something, maybe we could try it for a Session and then review it so we can make a decision to start a new process after the Summer Recess, and run it to the end of the Session to see how we go and in order to review the situation. I hope that by then we will be in a different situation entirely, and if there is good progress we will not need to consider those matters. We are conscious that we need to do better on the scrutiny of the legislation before your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="50704-35_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a>We are considering the draft Budget order today as a result of the continuing suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly. It is a matter for regret, and everyone here would share that. We need good government and the provision for public services to continue, and therefore Parliament is needed to give its approval for the resources and the cash requirements for Northern Ireland departments. Of course, the Budget order, unlike some of the others, has already been considered by the other place. The main purpose of the draft order is to authorise the balance of the 2005&#150;06 main estimates, which is in addition to the vote on account that Parliament approved in March this year. The vote on account, amounting to approximately 45 per cent of the total voted provision for the previous financial year, enabled funds to continue to flow to public services for the early months of the current financial year until the main estimates before us today could be presented and considered.
</p>

<a name="50704-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>The broad figures are that the balance of the requirements for 2005&#150;06 amounts to some &#163;7.6 billion of resources and &#163;6.2 billion of cash. When added to the vote on account, it will increase the total amount authorised for 2005&#150;06 to some &#163;13.1 billion <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC25"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC25</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of resources and &#163;10.9 billion of cash. The difference between the two figures is a question of timing, with money allocated for one year being spent in another.
</p>

<a name="50704-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>The 2005&#150;06 main estimates reflect the allocations announced in the Northern Ireland priorities and Budget in December last year, and the estimates volume that supports the draft order provides further details on the sums sought. The order also seeks to authorise the use of resources of some &#163;122.2 million in 2003&#150;04 in respect of an excess vote in the Department of Education in relation to teachers&#039; superannuation. The excess has already been subject to scrutiny and a report by the Public Accounts Committee, and the committee recommended that it should be authorised by Parliament by means of an excess vote. Further details are provided in the statement of excess, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House, along with other supporting documents. I assume that they are in the Room with us today.
</p>

<a name="50704-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>I will not attempt to summarise the high level of financial detail in the Budget order and the supporting documents, as I understand that that would not be the normal practice in this House. However, I will try to address any specific points of detail that may be raised in terms of expenditure covered by the order. The Government&#039;s objective for 2005&#150;06 and beyond, in relation to the use of the expenditure, continues to be the delivery of quality public services. We hope that that will be achieved by investing in the skills of the    workforce, investing in our public sector infrastructure, and ensuring that progress on reform and modernisation is accelerated.
</p>

<a name="50704-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>Investment and reform are already under way in a number of areas. The first investment strategy for Northern Ireland was published in draft form in December and is being revised in the light of comments received during the public consultation process. That document will provide a comprehensive and effective approach to making informed decisions on the investment plans.
</p>

<a name="50704-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>The Government are taking forward a programme of major education reform that will change and improve substantially what our children learn, how they learn, and the environment in which they learn. As is well known, the reform of water and sewerage services will provide a secure, reliable and affordable basis for financing those services in Northern Ireland. The reform of the domestic rating system will secure a fairer distribution of the rating burden. It will be well known to colleagues present who are much more expert and familiar with the matters than I am that the figures and Budget that we are talking about applies to the government departments of Northern Ireland, not the Northern Ireland Office, which is responsible for non-devolved issues.
</p>

<a name="50704-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>We are committed to ensuring that the public in Northern Ireland benefit from efficient and improved public services. As I have said to many people on my visits to Northern Ireland&#151;it is not a criticism of any of my colleagues in post in the past&#151;we are not there to mind the shop. We will continue and step up the <br>&nbsp;<br>

pace of reform&#151;there is no question about that&#151;simply because not to do so would deprive the people of Northern Ireland of the benefits of quality and improved public services and better value for money. I beg to move.

</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="50704-35_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   I thank the Minister for introducing the order. I also very much welcome his opening remarks about improving the democratic processes for legislation in Northern Ireland while we have to work without a devolved government. Anything that he can bring forward will be welcome, I am sure.
</p>

<a name="50704-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>I am not an expert in government finances. I find these tomes virtually impossible to understand and I certainly do not claim to have read them from cover to cover. I am sure other experts here have done so and that they will enlighten me. However, I would like assurances on one or two points from the Minister. He mentioned the &#163;123 million overspend from the Department of Education last year. I ask the Government to ensure that that will not, and cannot, happen again.
</p>

<a name="50704-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>That brings me to my main topic this afternoon, which is the administration of Northern Ireland in general. I know a consultation paper has been produced on the reorganisation of local government and all that might go with that. That has been out for a considerable time and I hope that the Government now have some good ideas on the financial savings that will spin off from that reorganisation. The Minister knows that I shall be pressing him as hard as I can to bring that forward as soon as he can. I note what he says about wanting to modernise the administration of Northern Ireland to bring in improvements across the board. With the great coagulation of people and infrastructure that we have in Northern Ireland, that will be very difficult. A tragic fact is that 33.5 or 34 per cent of those employed are employed by Her Majesty&#039;s Government and something like 40 per cent of GDP is down to government of one kind or another. That has to change if the finances and the economy of Northern Ireland are to stand up to the rigours of the future, with or without devolution. Very sadly, we have to assume today that we shall be without devolution for a while. I do not support that, but while we do not have it, I support the Minister in all that he can do to continue to modernise and to show a streamlining of accounting policies and where the money is going.
</p>

<a name="50704-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>The Minister mentioned that many reforms are coming into the education system. I ask him to leave the dogma out of that&#151;he knows exactly what I mean by that. We welcome reforms in education and modernisation, but let us leave old-fashioned dogma out of it and let us leave what is working well and has worked well for years&#151;I refer to the grammar school system&#151;in place. Do not let us destroy what is good. Let us improve things and move forward and let the dogma be.

</p>

<a name="50704-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>On hospitals, I too noted that the Secretary of State in the other place has been very critical of the administration in Northern Ireland, and particularly of the Northern Ireland health service. I have seen personal examples of how appalling the Northern Ireland health service is. Many years ago&#151;it is in the distant past&#151;we were proud of our National Health Service, as we were and still are of our education system. We were proud of our hospitals, but now they are a sorry mess. They are dirty and overcrowded and there is too much bureaucracy and not enough action. There are many very good people on the ground in those hospitals doing their very best in the most appalling circumstances to meet the needs. Nevertheless, there are still seriously ill patients lying on stretchers in corridors and so on. That requires not only money but also serious changes and serious improvements as well as ensuring that the money in the National Health Service goes to the right places and does what we all hope it will do.
</p>

<a name="50704-35_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>I have probably said enough, but in the other place the strategy for waste was mentioned. I have to declare an interest. At one time in my life I was responsible for a waste disposal company and I also chaired a committee for the Minister of the day on growing a greener economy, so I know a little about waste disposal. I was also on the Front Bench in this House with responsibility for the environment when the directives came in from Europe about fridges and electrical appliances and so on.
</p>

<a name="50704-35_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>It is quite clear that the Government in Northern Ireland went into this game totally unprepared. They did not have the facilities to handle the waste from refrigerators and the like which caused a significant amount of wasted expenditure. I would look for assurance from the Minister that the Government have their act together on disposing of technical waste and conforming to the directives from Europe.

<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="50704-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Smith of Clifton: </b>   I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, for introducing the Budget order, but I must reiterate my oft-stated and long-held view that this is a very unsatisfactory way of scrutinising Northern Ireland legislation. It is cursory because of insufficient time, and undemocratic because it is not amenable to amendment, so that it is more a matter of form than of substance.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>In effect what we do when we consider the multitude of orders that constitute Northern Ireland legislation is to look&#151;with few exceptions, when Ministers may intervene&#151;at civil servants&#039; rule. When I recently made that point to the Secretary of State at an informal meeting with him and Peers who are especially interested in Northern Ireland, he said that his Ministers would exercise a strong influence over government policy. With the best will in the world, and fully accepting Mr Hain at his word, the small ministerial team and the very extensive range of government business means that, for all practical purposes, most policies are drawn up by the Civil <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC28"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC28</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Service. Northern Ireland civil servants do their best, but it is near impossible for us to assist their work by the means currently at our disposal.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>In parenthesis, I want to cite just one of my experiences that illustrate inefficiency in the Civil Service. Last Monday I received the usual mountain of mail from Belfast, as no doubt did other noble Lords. In my opinion it was bigger than it should have been. I was sent two copies of the Draft Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order from the Department of Employment and Learning; two copies of the consultation on the draft regulations implementing the new EU procurement directives from the Department of Finance and Personnel; two copies of a letter concerning the Electricity and Gas (Determination of Turnover for Penalties) Order (Northern Ireland) from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment; and two copies of the Industrial Training Levy (Construction Order) (Northern Ireland), again from the Department of Employment and Learning. Other departments succeeded in sending me only one.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>I have not had time to examine today&#039;s post. These may seem trivial examples of waste, but how far are they symptomatic of a very generously financed system of government relative to that of the other parts of the UK? Under present conditions it is very difficult to find out.

</p>

<a name="50704-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Furthermore, even if, as the Secretary of State said, Ministers are going to take a closer look at decisions, welcome though that is, it still means that the executive branch of government&#151;which comprises both the permanent Civil Service and the ministerial element of transient politicians&#151;proceeds essentially unencumbered by adequate parliamentary scrutiny. To be fair, that is acknowledged by Ministers. Whenever I have raised the subject, I have been assured that they are looking at it, but no remedies are suggested then by them. I doubt if this subject heretofore has absorbed much of their time. Therefore, I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, for his preliminary statements today, and I hope that at long last the Government will come up with some positive suggestions for improving the situation.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>Having made those general remarks, I shall concentrate on one specific issue; namely, community relations policy and how it is translated through the Budget. My noble friend Lord Shutt of Greetland, as usual, will be asking probing financial questions relating to those aspects of the Budget order on which his accountant&#039;s gimlet eye has alighted.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Government policy in the framework document &quot;<i>A Shared Future: The Framework for Good Relations in Northern Ireland&quot;</i> was published in March this year, following a commitment given by the then Secretary of State to my honourable friend in another place in January during Northern Ireland Questions. This document followed a review of community relations in Northern Ireland by Dr Jeremy Harbison, whose report was published in January 2002, and a further government consultation. <i>A Shared Future</i> outlines realistically the scale of the challenge and indicates that good relations will be built on the significant progress of the equality agenda.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC29"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC29</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50704-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>The objectives outlined in <i>A Shared Future</i> include the elimination of sectarianism; the reduction of tension at interface areas; the facilitation of the development of a shared community where people wish to live, work, play and learn together; the promotion of civic mindedness via citizenship education; the protection of members of minorities; and the shaping of policies, practices and institutions to enable trust and good relations to grow.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>We on these Benches very much welcomed the publication of the framework document. Within it, there is an appreciation of the fundamental social, economic and financial costs arising from a divided society. The practical result of sectarian attitudes is that they manifest themselves as segregation. It is a <i>de   facto</i> practice on the ground with respect to education, housing and the delivery of services. In the public sector, housing has become much more segregated. In the vast majority of housing estates, fewer than 10 per cent of residents are regarded as coming from a perceived different section of the community. In education, only 5 per cent of children attend schools that are integrated in ethos.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a> The Alliance Party has conducted research into how much the duplication of services costs in Northern Ireland. It believes that the economic impact of sectarianism amounts to &#163;1 billion to the Northern Ireland taxpayer per annum. While we acknowledge that the situation will not change overnight and that this is long-term, challenging work, it is important that the debate moves on swiftly from the policy framework to practical changes in actual policy. In terms of policy action, community relations can no longer represent a small niche within public policy, but rather must be mainstreamed throughout the actions of all departments and public agencies.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>That is a major task. Can the Minister give a more precise breakdown of the amount of money allocated across the departments for the promotion of this policy? Can he tell us how much has been spent in the past 12 months and how much is forecast to be spent in the next 12 months on the provision of, and the promotion of, integrated housing both across Northern Ireland as a whole and within the area of each borough council? Furthermore, can he give us the same figures for integrated education? Finally, can he also give us figures on government investment in the voluntary sector, which does so much to promote good community relations on the ground in Northern Ireland?
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="50704-36_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   My Lords, I too thank the Minister for his opening remarks, in particular those on legislation. However, scrutinising finance is of a different order from scrutinising legislation. How on Earth that can be dealt with to my satisfaction, I do not know. I have studied this estimate book for about four or five hours, but I cannot scratch it. I also find it deeply unfriendly. It is not user friendly and it would be no bad thing if someone had another go at producing it. For example, a narrative would be useful for any major changes, which we do not have in the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC30"></a>

book. I am not surprised that people find the book difficult: I find it very difficult. I can make these comments largely because the figures pop up at me rather than my having to scratch very deep. It would take many weeks to do a proper job.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>As regards Northern Ireland, I always start off thinking about the wonder of the Barnett formula and the wonder of European money, about which there is an English jealousy. If Northern Ireland was funded on the same basis as England, the jam would not spread particularly far. Nevertheless, there are substantial resources in the population of Northern Ireland, the resources available and the comparison that we have.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>Depending on whether we are looking at resources or cash, I would wish to raise the subject of European funding. On page 17 of the document&#151;I shall go through it not page by page but in order&#151;our expectations for 2005&#150;06 are &#163;549,425,000, an increase over last year when the figure was &#163;390,191,000. That is 4 per cent of the Budget of Northern Ireland, or 5 per cent if one is looking only at cash. On any basis, it is a lot of money.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>One wonders, with other activities in the European Union and eastern Europe, how long this can last. One also wonders about the relative importance of that which is funded from Europe and what it is paying for to that which is funded from the mainstream and what that is paying for. Some of the expenditures which are funded from Europe may be more important than the mainstream. <i> </i>The voluntary sector has been adept at picking up European grants, and I worry how it will cope in the future if these moneys are reduced. That is a very important issue for Northern Ireland, where the voluntary sector has done such wonderful work over the years.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>Secondly, I am interested in value for money. Even though, in English terms, the extra resources are substantial, I am not worried about that, provided the money is spent well. However, on page 47, A.8, headed &quot;Cultural Policy&quot;, shows that the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure spent &#163;1 million last year and the year before, and this year the expenditure is &#163;5   million. I am in favour of culture, but I do not know that I am particularly concerned about cultural policy. I wonder what one gets for an extra &#163;4 million.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>On the next page, the total expenditure for Arts Council, Museums and Galleries, and Sports Council comes to just short of &#163;40 million. The previous year it was &#163;30 million and the year before that it was &#163;26.9 million. Again, that is an interesting lift. The Minister may know the reason for that large increase. Perhaps more wonderful things are to happen or there are deferred repairs to pay for. On such an occasion as this, it is useful to ask a question.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>There is another matter on page 93. With regard to the Department of Employment and Learning, a note indicates that there is &#163;166,429,000 grant-in-aid to universities, while another &#163;41,897,000 is provided for capital grants to universities and colleges of education. Over the last weekend and a little before then, there <br>&nbsp;<br>

was quite a lot of publicity regarding the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ulster, Professor Gerry McKenna. From what I read here, this seems a pretty pickle. There were complaints from all directions, and eventually Sir Michael Buckley was hired to investigate and produce a report to see if there are grounds to investigate and produce a report. It is a sort of report before a report.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>It may well be that because reports and investigations cost an absolute fortune&#151;I am thinking of Bloody Sunday, and so forth&#151;this may be a cheap way in which to do this sort of thing. I do not know; but there has been a tremendous cost to the public purse. Sir Michael Buckley and his two assistants have had to be hired, while the vice-chancellor has been on sick leave, has been suspended or is having a sabbatical. There is the use of his house and, no doubt, a financial settlement.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>Has the department and the Minister been kept informed of all this and agreed whatever package there is, and are additional monies required for this? Is there going to have to be some virement within this budget because of those extra expenditures, and would that virement be outside the university&#039;s budget, or would it affect the other university&#151;Queen&#039;s University, Belfast? It would not seem right for that to happen. Of course, if it were a school that we were talking about, the expenditure might be put into special measures. I do not know what plans there are. Will the Northern Ireland Audit Office conduct an inquiry into whatever settlement there has been, what financial controls there are and into the governance of that university? It would be useful to know what the position is.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>On Page 131, the financial administration of the Department of Finance and Personnel seems to cost &#163;14.3 million, whereas previously it cost &#163;8 million and, the year before that, &#163;6.9 million. Again, it would be useful to understand why there should be that lift. Of course, one explanation could be that things have been put in different columns, but if that has happened, it should be explained. The cost of financial administration has nearly doubled, and that should be probed a little.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>On the next page, page 132, is the item Ulster Savings. On 13 December 2004, I spoke on that issue. Noble Lords will remember that Ulster Savings was a savings bank in Northern Ireland that decided to close down; this has been going on for several years, but we were told that there was about &#163;8 million left. I suggested on that occasion, seven or so months ago, that there will come a point when you cannot find anyone else and asked what would happen to the capital sum of &#163;8 million. I suggested that a useful place for it would be to help to endow the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland and to put to work that money which had been saved by people but was not going to claimed because people were dead&#151;or whatever has happened to them.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Amos, gave a response, indicating in effect that I was a year or two too soon. Interestingly, however, on page 132, the actual amount to be expended by Ulster Savings is nil, which rather <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC32"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC32</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

suggests that no wages are being paid out to people in Ulster Savings to try to find any more people who have disappeared, and that they have reached the end of the process. I would not mind knowing what the score is in that regard, and I would like to think that the idea that I suggested will be very seriously pursued. It seems wrong for that money simply to be used for reducing the national debt.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a> On page 217, we see the Department for Regional Development. I have spoken before about the railway services in Northern Ireland; thankfully, more resources have been put in, both for rolling stock and track renewal. However, I hit upon the heading, &quot;Road passenger services&quot;, which is obviously the bus services of Northern Ireland. I was surprised to see that the revenue figures had increased from &#163;36 million to &#163;40 million. This year, however, the figure is &#163;73.2 million. That seems quite a hike. Are there to be a lot more bus services in Northern Ireland? There are also tremendous sums for repairing depots and so forth. The book does not tell us about that expenditure.


</p>

<a name="50704-36_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>The next area is the Northern Ireland Assembly, on page 274. It is interesting that the resources are in place to pay for Assembly men. I am not making a point about the sums of &#163;32 million, &#163;33 million and &#163;47 million; the latter figure clearly refers to a full year. However, as this is 4 July, we are three months out and the Assembly has not been fully in progress. As I understand it, the &#163;47,656,000 figure applies to full Assembly operation rather than the reduced salaries currently being paid. So the virement already exists if anyone wants to take it, and no doubt that will happen because that is the way of the world. If the figures were to follow suit, &#163;12 or &#163;13 million could be made available, unless there is a solution and the Assembly returns. However, that does not look likely at present.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>I turn to page 306 which refers to the Food Standards Agency. The preamble on page 305 tells us that the Northern Ireland Food Standards Agency is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;part of the UK wide Food Standards Agency, which has its head office in London and . . . offices in Belfast, Aberdeen and Cardiff&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-36_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>Those started life on 1 April 2000, but Northern Ireland became a separate identity on 1 April 2004. For two years it cost &#163;2.8 million, but this year it cost &#163;3,795 million&#151;a 34 per cent increase. Is something happening in food standards that is much more costly? Is that 34 per cent replicated in England, Scotland and Wales, or is this a special deal for Northern Ireland?
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>I move to what may be my final point, the Northern Ireland Audit Office, dealt with on page 317. Interestingly, point 3 of the introduction proudly states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;The provision sought for 2005&#150;06 is 8.5 per cent higher than the final net provision&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-36_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>estimate for 2004&#150;05. Hallelujah! This department is saying that it will cost 8.5 per cent more. I do not know why it says that, though that is clearly the case. That is not stated everywhere, but this department says it will happen. I am delighted that it has. I think that there is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC33"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC33</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

a case for indicating whether the markets are moving up or down. The department says what is happening and I give it credit for that.
</p>

<a name="50704-36_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>As I say, those are the few points I picked out. They struck me as worth discussing. However, one could dig very deep indeed, going into the realms of agriculture, mainstream education and so on. There must be a better way. I hope that the points I have raised will receive good answers. However, there could be very many more questions. This way of scrutinising is just not the best.

<a name="50704-37_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   My Lords, I, too, welcome the presentation by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker. I join the spokesmen of the two main parties in welcoming the noble Lord&#039;s suggestion that there will be some movement towards better scrutiny of legislation for Northern Ireland. Any movement in any direction can only be good, and I very much welcome that. I thank him for his remarks and I acknowledge the work done by the two spokesmen for the major parties in putting pressure on to get to the point we are at today.
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>I took great heart from the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Shutt of Greetland. Despite his training in accountancy and having spent four hours studying the document, he could not make too much headway with it, so I do not feel too bad. But in the absence of devolved government in Northern Ireland, this is an opportunity to raise a number of topics which I think have currency in Northern Ireland and deserve to be answered. They are all areas which are funded from the document in front of us.
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>Under the funding arrangements for the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure outlined on page 47 of the Northern Ireland Estimates 2005&#150;06, I should like to consider the funding of community festivals. In a Parliamentary Answer of 21 June, I was informed that the funding for the year 2004 for the West Belfast Festival, which is regarded as a nationalist event, was in excess of a quarter of a million pounds. Other national festivals, including New Lodge and Ardoyne, also received substantial public money. I have no problem with funding nationalist or other festivals. But there was no government support whatever that year for the annual Orange demonstrations in any part of the Province. Does that not seem one-sided?
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>Further, when I examined the Answer, I noted that the Events Company and the Belfast Regeneration Office provided funding between them of &#163;122,720. Did these sums come from those organisations&#039; budgets or were the amounts just paid out of DCAL and the Department for Social Development funding? If they were paid out of budgets other than their own, was it from the interim funding budget&#151;a pot of money in existence today which was developed between DCAL and the Department for Social Development? Could the noble Lord indicate how big the fund is, how big it may have been in 2004 and to where the funding went? Could he also inform us what the criteria for access to the funding are and what proportion has gone to non-nationalist events?
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC34"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC34</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50704-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>My understanding is that the position this year is not much better. In other Parliamentary Answers dated 21 June, I was informed that, to date, &#163;115,000 had been allocated to the West Belfast Festival. I expect total funding for the event to reach at least a quarter of a million, similar to last year. Add to this all the other nationalist festivals, and the figure could be almost half a million. Yet for the entire Province, only &#163;33,657 has been allocated for Orange celebrations, despite the fact that this year they are regarded as tourist attractions and are included in both Tourism Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board&#039;s publications of events. That is despite the fact that a lot of effort has gone over the years, and will be witnessed again next week, into changing these marches into a tourist attraction and making them much more culturally acceptable to all people so that they can go along and enjoy an interesting day out. They are accessible to everyone in the community, unlike some of the nationalist festivals.
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>I understand that the interim funding for this year amounts to half a million pounds. My understanding is that &#163;50,000 will go to Maiden City Festival, &#163;52,000 to Queen&#039;s University and almost &#163;400,000 to nationalist events.
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Last year, DCAL attempted to carry out an audit of funding for festivals. The department stopped the process when it discovered that the proportion was at least &#163;9 for nationalist festivals to &#163;1 for Unionist ones. With this sort of information and my experience as chairman of the Ulster-Scots Agency, I believe that a big threat to the stability of Northern Ireland is the green caucus that operates in the Northern Ireland Office and has shades in other departments, most notably DCAL.
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>Clever wording of letters and Parliamentary Answers cannot disguise the clear determination of DCAL only to support things Irish and hold up and treat in an offhand and dismissive way things that are not Irish. The NIO at all costs seems to provide everything that Sinn Fein/IRA ask for, but little for the rest of the community.
<a name="time_1"></a>
<a name="50704-37_time0"></a><h5>4.15 pm</h5>

</p>

<a name="50704-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>I ask the noble Lord for a full investigation into the funding processes in DCAL. That should include examination of the business cases for all festivals and the time taken to process applications. This is an issue which will not go away.
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>I beg understanding from your Lordships which would allow me to return to a topic that I have raised several times before: the scandal of Waterways Ireland. Funding for that organisation comes partly through the Department for Culture, Arts and Leisure. Details of the &#163;9,639,000 granted to Waterways Ireland for 2005&#150;06 can be found on page 47.
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>Waterways Ireland is one of the cross-border implementation bodies set up as a result of the Belfast Agreement of 1998. The advantages of having an actual cross- border body seem limited to Unionists, but it is important to nationalists. Unfortunately, the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC35"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC35</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

recent activities of Waterways Ireland have done more to undermine confidence in cross-border bodies than anything a Unionist could do.
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>We have 21 cases of the bullying of staff. To date, one has been proved against the chief executive. The other 20 cases, with the backing of the Republic&#039;s Government, are being pushed into a mediation process. In some cases, it looks as though the person accused of the bullying is organising the mediation and appointing the investigator. I know that the Minister gave me an assurance that I would be allowed to see the outcome of reports into the further 20 staff members and their cases, but the chief executive&#039;s response to that seems to be to try to push everything into mediation which he will control. Can the Minister assure me that is not the case? Interestingly, the chief executive who was found guilty of bullying is still in his job, but the person he bullied has been sacked. What confidence does that give to anyone that the cases will be dealt with fairly?
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>In the case of appointments without competition there is much outrage. It may be accepted practice for the Fianna Fail Government to appoint its supporters into organisations without open competition, but in the case of the position of director of marketing and communication, the job is located in Northern Ireland and is subject to Northern Ireland law. I have no idea whether the appointed person is the best for the position because I cannot find out what his qualifications are and what previous positions he has had. Perhaps the Minister can help me in this area?
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>Leaked risk assessments for the organisation are very worrying and have not been addressed. I outlined the difficulties to your Lordships in a recent debate, but received no satisfactory answer. I can assure noble Lords that the issues with Waterways Ireland are not just in my imagination. Many major newspapers produced detailed articles about aspects of each scandal. A number of investigative journalists are hard at work producing more, and included in that number is a least one television network. I cannot stand by when there is bullying. Bullying in the work place is a major scourge of society today. If the Government do not act to punish bullies in the organisations that they fund, and if the bully is rewarded and the bullied loses his job, what message does that send to other bullies? That is another issue that will not go away.
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Under the allocation to the Department of Education found on pages 63 to 78, I would like to raise the proposed changes to the Northern Ireland education system, a topic to which the noble Lord,   Lord Glentoran, has referred already. The Department of Education seems to be bent on driving through the proposals as set out in the Costello report, much against the wishes of the vast majority of parents, teachers and educational professionals. The Household Survey demonstrated that the majority of those who responded wanted to do away with the transfer test in its current form, but they wished to retain academic selection. What they clearly did not want is a community-based comprehensive system based on selection by postcode.

</p>

<a name="50704-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>We in Northern Ireland have some of the best schools in the country and they have consistently produced higher average results than any other region of the United Kingdom. Can the noble Lord the Minister confirm that the Northern Ireland education system is funded &#163;1,000 per pupil less than the average in the rest of the United Kingdom? Is that the real reason behind the current crisis? We also have no independent sector as the quality and diversity of schooling provided dispenses with the need for one&#151;unlike the rest of the UK.
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>Comprehensive education does not work. It failed the children of England, Scotland and Wales and should not be allowed to fail the children of Northern Ireland. The reverse should be the case. I am interested to know the Minister&#039;s opinion of these matters. How we educate our children is how we define and determine the future of our society. Also on education, I should like to raise the issue about funding for education as an additional language. That is also found between pages 63 and 78. Unfortunately, for all the talk, there has been very little action.

</p>

<a name="50704-37_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>Early last week senior members of the Department for Education&#151;not the Minister&#151;met with representatives from the education boards, organizations such as the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities (NICEM) and trade unions. They discussed the proposal that NICEM had originally put in March, that the infrastructure that currently exists for English as an additional language&#151;for example, money going to the boards to run teams of experienced EAL curriculum support teachers, should be kept in place for the next academic year, while discussions were carried out as to the best way to fund this area of education in Northern Ireland. Unfortunately that infrastructure has already gone in all boards except the South Eastern Education and Library Board, which has encouraged some of the schools to use the allocated money to buy in to an EAL-teacher-support-serve from the board. But even in the South Eastern Education and Library Board this service is now much depleted and the team of teachers has been reduced from 13 to five.
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>While the redundancy of those curriculum support teachers is a major concern, the most important aspect of all of this is the effect the loss of an experienced EAL teacher and all that he or she can bring to the classroom will have on the children. The teacher can provide a bridge between a child, newly arrived to Northern Ireland, and his teachers and between the child and the rest of his classmates. The EAL teacher can also provide a bridge between the school and the child&#039;s parents, many of whom do not speak English at all. The EAL teacher can give guidance in helping to develop policies of whole-school integration and, very importantly, anti-racism.
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>Under the common funding formula, the vast majority of money for EAL pupils goes directly to the schools and is not ring-fenced&#151;each school gets &#163;800 per annum per child. There is no way of tracing how and even if the money is actually spent on EAL support or resources. What is the delivery mechanism for the funding of EAL and how is it accounted for? Moreover, can the Minister explain how the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC37"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC37</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Department for Education will ensure the delivery of appropriate, professional and experienced support for EAL pupils, their teachers and schools in September and during the following academic year?
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>While on the subject of education, I refer to a Parliamentary Answer that I received, again on 30 June 2003 [HL 635], concerning the bailing out of a religious order in Middleton by the purchase of a school, a chapel and a cemetery. Who made out the business case for the purchase of that property, the only new premises purchased by the education department for many years? How was the case for the payment of money to the order worked out before the premises were taken into the control of the department? How was the 5p year rent considered and worked out after the purchase, the 5p being paid by the order to the department? Can the business case for that purchase be lodged in the Library, or can we access it in any other way? Or was it, as many suspect, a stitch-up by the then Minister of Education, Martin McGuinness, and the Dublin Government to use hard-pressed education funding to support a religious order?
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a> I want to pick up on a few points that have been brought to my attention by the British Medical Association regarding general practitioners in Northern Ireland. Details of funding for the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety are on page 171 of the estimates.
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>First, global sums have been incorrectly calculated for GP practices under the new GP contract, a fact which has caused endless annoyance to GPs in Northern Ireland. GPs had global sums calculated to run their practices. However, because the Government did not put enough money in the global sums, 90 per cent of practices are going to lose out. To correct that, minimum practice income guarantee was invented. That took a practice&#039;s GMS earnings for one year and added staff costs to calculate the MPIG. In Northern Ireland, the Department for Health, Social Services and Public Safety released funding to the four health boards for practice staff just after the baseline year. Although given the discretion to include those staff in MPIGs, boards&#151;at the behest of the department&#151;did not include those staff salaries in MPIGs, causing financial distress to many practices with sums ranging from a few thousand to in excess of &#163;30,000. GPs are using the dispute resolution process of the contract to address those matters. Why did the department push the boards not to include staff salaries in MPIGs?
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>Secondly, in the new GP contract, employer&#039;s superannuation payments are included in the global sums/MPIG. However, in the baseline year, employer&#039;s contributions were at 5 per cent for three quarters and 7 per cent in the last quarter, which gives an average of 5.5 per cent. In England, there was a Treasury transfer and contributions went from 7 to 14 per cent, and the full extra 7 per cent was added to GPs&#039; MPIGs. In Northern Ireland, the department and boards refuse to fund employer&#039;s contributions <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC38"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC38</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and, although they have added only 5.5 per cent to GP budgets, they are deducting 7 per cent, which is the level at which the payment now is. Why?
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>Elsewhere in the United Kingdom, sessional doctors, formerly known as locums, have been able to join the National Health Service pension scheme since April 2001. The department has promised the BMA that Northern Ireland sessional doctors will be able to do so but, more than four years later, they have yet to bring forward the legislation to allow them to do so. It has promised that those doctors will not be disadvantaged and will be able to backdate payments, yet the Inland Revenue now says it will not relax the rules that allow only 15 per cent of a salary to be paid in one year, and that appear to prevent those doctors claiming their full amount. The BMA has received numerous letters and promises from the department, but no action. That is an absolute disgrace. If one of those doctors should die in service, they will have accrued no pension benefit, as English, Scottish and Welsh doctors have. Will the Minister comment in due course?
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>There is also concern with regard to the board and department accounts. Although they expect practices to account for every penny that they are allocated, they appear not to apply the same levels of probity to their own accounts. There is much inaccuracy in the accounts and no one knows how much has been spent in any one area. Will the Minister give us an assurance that that will be investigated immediately?
</p>

<a name="50704-37_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>Lastly, all spending now requires a business plan approved by the Department of Finance and Personnel. The new GP contract committed &#163;3 million to IT spend in general practitioner practices in 2004&#150;05. The boards were then required to prepare a business case to justify that&#151;although it was part of a UK deal. They paid PricewaterhouseCoopers thousands of pounds to prepare the case, which was also approved by the Department of Finance and Personnel in the middle of March 2005, too late to be spent. That also meant that the boards had no funding to purchase urgently required IT replacements and, put in a difficult situation, had to spend money from other budgets to meet emergencies. Why?

<a name="50704-38_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   My Lords, I should like to speak on a topic that I intentionally left out, but which the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, raised; that is, the situation at the University of Ulster. I declare an interest as a member of the court of that university. What will the Government&#039;s attitude and part be in this? There has been an enormous amount of adverse press coverage. It is looking more and more like a university cover-up. My private inquiries lead me to understand that, ultimately, the bill for this debacle could end at the door of Queen&#039;s University. I would like two assurances from the Government: first, that the bill for any impropriety in the University of Ulster will not land on the doorstep of Queen&#039;s University for payment; and, secondly, I am interested&#151;but I totally understand if the Minister feels that he is unable to comment at this stage&#151;to know what line the Government will take into the situation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="50704-38_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I will do my best to address the issues that have been raised. On those issues that I cannot address satisfactorily, I will write to noble Lords. I know that writing is second-best, but even when writing, letters are still read back later because they were not quite right. However, I shall do my best to address the general thrust of the varied issues that were raised. That is the beauty of the Budget: anything can be raised, which may or may not be relevant to the figures. I will try to go through the issues in order. I may have to jump about a bit, but in some cases I will have to write because issues go across departments.
</p>

<a name="50704-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>The budget is set for 11 departments. Someone asked a question about the voluntary sector, but I cannot have those figures because every department would be involved in that one way or another, so I probably would not have a global figure. Nevertheless, I will look to see what we can supply.


</p>

<a name="50704-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>In respect of the matter that I raised in my opening speech about the overspending in the Department of Education, there was no other effect on other public services of the teachers&#039; superannuation scheme. I assure noble Lords that steps have been taken to ensure that it does not arise again. The matter was subject to the Public Accounts Committee.
</p>

<a name="50704-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said that the Review of Public Administration had been going on for a while; it has been going on for far too long. In fact, tomorrow I will meet all five major parties for them to come to tell me their views&#151;separately unfortunately, but that is the way of the world. The consultation closes on 30 September. We will get written submissions, because through the document each chapter poses one or more questions to guide views. It will close on 30 September and that is it; there is no requirement or need for an extension. I would not support an extension, and I would not advise the Secretary of State to support it. We are committed to making decisions on the way forward&#151;although it will not be instant because some of it will require <br>&nbsp;<br>

legislation&#151;around the turn of the year. People deserve a better system of administration than they have now. There is no question about that; it has been accepted and that is why there has been such a lengthy consultation. It has gone on for some two and a half years altogether.
</p>

<a name="50704-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>I certainly do not want to pre-empt anything. We have a consultation, and we genuinely want to listen. It does not just affect local government; it affects the health service, education and the interface between local government and the government of Northern Ireland. Nevertheless, we want to go forward&#151;there can be no excuses. I have said to local government representatives&#151;and this may be helpful&#151;that frankly they are more likely to get more powers the fewer bodies there are. There are 26 authorities in local government. Powers are extremely limited; they are not at all equivalent in any way, shape or form to what happens in England. It is not my function to take from England what we have there and impose it in Northern Ireland; far from it. However, strong, independent local government providing good civic leadership and good governance practices will be better the smaller the numbers. Frankly, we would not want to disperse the powers to smaller bodies, because the capacity would not be there. I mean capacity; the capacity among the councillors, not just the officers. There will have to be some capacity building, there is no question about that, for those who take on what will be major roles on behalf of their fellow citizens with the reform of public administration.
</p>

<a name="50704-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>I am looking forward to playing a positive part in the decision-making that will flow from that. It will require a lot of change by a lot of people, and it will save a lot of money. I do not have the figures off the top of my head but they are considerable sums, which will not come back to the Treasury; they will be put into services for the people of Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="50704-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>The noble Lord also asked about the strategic future of the health service. My colleague responsible for the health service, Shaun Woodward, has made some announcements. I am not putting words into his mouth, but he has been appalled at what he has discovered in the inadequacy of the service and the high waiting lists. Given the amount of money that has been pumped in there, compared to what is happening in England, we are not getting good service for the people of Northern Ireland. They are getting less for more money, and that is completely unacceptable&#151;and it will change. We will be looking at the health situation as part of the Review of Public Administration, but it does not have to be held up by it&#151;maybe. People have got to face up to this issue. I pay enormous tribute to those who are working in the health service at the sharp end; the doctors, nurses, bottle-washers, cleaners, the people who turn the engines on. That is probably not where the problem is; the problem is elsewhere. Nevertheless, this issue has got to be taken seriously. In 2005&#150;06, the increase on current spending on health will be more than 9 per cent, so it is not a question of starving the health service of money.

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>I have certain weaknesses in covering all the departments, because I am not as up to speed as I would like to be on all 11. There are some areas of nuance and detail that I dare not muse about, because I would drop myself right in it&#151;education is one of those. It is incredibly complicated, whether in England or elsewhere. One can be out of date as matters are on the move, and I freely admit that I have to be really careful. The new arrangements for the review of post-primary education are not about imposing a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach; I want to make that absolutely clear. They are not about simply abolishing grammar schools or introducing postcode selection; they are about providing the best education&#151;a better education&#151;for all of our young people. I am not in favour of the dogma ruling the policy&#151;far from it. It is the output that counts. If you get it wrong you cannot really go back to youngsters and say, &quot;We will give you another five years&quot;. They have gone; they have gone through the system, so we must get it right. I am not claiming that this has been done, but we must not use young people as guinea pigs for experiments. We have to get a better system, but it is not about the Ministers currently responsible imposing the dogma.

<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="50704-38_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Smith of Clifton: </b>   I thank the Minister for giving way. On that point, it is obviously gratifying to many of us here that the Minister realises that the educational problem with post-11 selection is a very sensitive issue in Northern Ireland. Would it be possible for him to come along with his new innovations that he intimated at the beginning for us to consider such orders&#151;particularly any orders regarding post-primary transfer? Could that be facilitated by the reforms? Of all the issues in the past five or six years, this is probably one of the most sensitive.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="50704-38_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   In the spirit in which I started off, I will do my best to make sure that we have informed scrutiny and informed decisions from a parliamentary point of view. I cannot be specific about exactly what the process of any legislative changes might be&#151;I do not know off the top of my head and I suspect that it is not known. Going back to what I said earlier, if there are requirements for parliamentary approval, I suggested that we get something up and running for the next Session that will enable noble Lords to have a look at things with Ministers and civil servants before we publish finally. We would say, &quot;Here is the draft&#151;we have not finished it. Is there anything that we can change? We have not reached the point of no return&quot;.
</p>

<a name="50704-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>For other forms of scrutiny, I have to fall back, and I do not apologise for doing so, on the fact that there is a departmental Select Committee in the other place, which is the appropriate place for such scrutiny&#151;or I most certainly hope that there will be. Some of the slight difficulties have been resolved in recent days, or are about to be. I will be more than happy to invite my ministerial colleagues from the Northern Ireland team to come and discuss issues with your Lordships, <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="50704-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>On the issue of Civil Service costs, as the noble Lord, Lord Smith, was reading out the list of all his reports, I thought, &quot;Blimey, that is good&#151;sending you two copies&quot;. When I was in the other place, I always used to say, &quot;Can I have two copies? One for me and one to give to someone and say, &#039;Will you do some work on this little bit for me?&#039;&quot;. I did not want to lose my own copy. The Lib Dems have so much money these days, with all the extra researchers, maybe we sent an extra copy for the noble Lord, Lord Smith, to pass to his researcher. I apologise if he is upset about it, and if it is a waste of expenditure we will see that it does not happen again, because we do not want to be wasteful. Sometimes it is useful to have two copies of a document if one wants to get some external advice. You do not want researchers or people who you might be asking to help you to have to go and buy the damn thing. That is what Parliament is for&#151;to provide free copies of such literature for our friends outside the House and our helpers.

<a name="50704-39_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Smith of Clifton: </b>   I thank the Minister for giving way. The point is that if they are going to send me two copies, why do they not do so in one envelope rather than two envelopes, because opening all those envelopes has ruined my potential career as an international violinist.
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="50704-39_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   The chances are&#151;going back to my MAFF days&#151;that these envelopes get filled automatically, and if you start to vary it by putting more than one document in, it does not work. Someone has to fit them in the envelope&#151;so it may be more difficult. But I am sure that there is a satisfactory explanation which at some time in future I will be informed of.
</p>

<a name="50704-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, referred to the complexity of the estimates. I would be lying if I said that I had read them; I looked through them, but I was more concerned with looking through my Q&A and my briefing than with the figures. I did that last week, which I thought was probably better for my education than sitting in the public gallery in Committee Room 10 in the House of Commons to listen to the other place go through the Budget. I was not there all the time, but I was there for more than an hour, and I was not aware of listening to a single Member of the House of Commons refer to a specific page or question a figure. That fulfils my other claim that the level of scrutiny in this place, with Ministers, is much greater than in the other place. I have found lots of examples. I am in my third department in this place, but that fits the bill. They were discussing other issues, but it was useful for me to have a look through the document.
</p>

<a name="50704-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>I would not say that the document was complicated or impossible to understand; probably if you had a narrative explaining each page, it would double the size of the volume. I apologise, and I certainly sympathise, but we are currently examining ways in which better to integrate or simplify the document&#151;so <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC43"></a>

there is work under way. Officials accept that we need to do better in how these things are explained. If there is any specific input that the noble Lord would like to put to us, over and above his speech today, we would be more than willing to listen. If he has an idea about how we could tear it up and redo it in a different way, we will certainly take that on board. It is in everybody&#039;s interests that we understand what we are dealing with, as there is a lot of money involved&#151;which is taxpayers&#039; money, by the way, not the Government&#039;s money.
</p>

<a name="50704-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>I was asked about the increased funding for cultural policy. The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, was going through the page numbers&#151;page 47 was cultural policy. This reflects some of the increased funding for the Irish Language Broadcasting Fund and the Ulster Scots Academy. I am not saying that that wholly accounts for the expenditure, but they are some of the reasons.
</p>

<a name="50704-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>The increased funding for arts, museums and sports, particularly arts, includes a large increase in spending on improving access for the disabled. There is a major issue of access to public buildings for people with disabilities following the legislation approved by both Houses&#151;and quite right too. So there is a large area of expenditure there. In addition, there has been the refurbishment of the Grand Opera House and the Lyric Theatre, a range of additional works at museum premises, and funding to make sports grounds safer. I make no apology for those increases; the Government have had a big investment programme to improve public services in this country, and there is no reason why that should not nip over to the infrastructure of Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="50704-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>I must say, however, that it is a pity that one museum that I walked past the other day&#151;on a Saturday in the middle of the summer, at eleven o&#039;clock&#151;was not open until one o&#039;clock, so I could not get a cup of tea let alone see the exhibition. I was in the botanical gardens, and the palm house was not open until one o&#039;clock, on a Saturday in the middle of the tourist season. I mean, do we make these things user-friendly or not? This is crazy.
</p>

<a name="50704-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>You cannot on the one hand push for tourism. It is a minor matter. I took myself off on my first off-duty weekend to look around the botanical gardens. I raised the point later on when I was introduced to the man who was purportedly the chairman of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. I said, &quot;Just the bloke I want to see&quot;. He said, &quot;We keep telling them about it&quot;. He thought that the council might be answerable but was not so sure about the large concrete building at the side. I think that was part of one of the universities. Nevertheless I met members of the public who were trying to get in at 11 or half past and found that it was closed until one o&#039;clock, as I say, on a Saturday. I hope the point is made.

<a name="50704-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>One or two Members of the Committee raised the issue of the European Union funding. Parliament provides 95 per cent of the total fund&#151;I am now speaking of global figures; noble Lords should not tie me down to the last decimal point. The EU element has <br>&nbsp;<br>

an important role to play and it fits across the different areas, such as agriculture and the PEACE II programme. I was present at the launch of the extension of the PEACE II programme a few Fridays ago. Some of those things use European money which, if you like, is new money, extra money over and above that which would be provided by central government for various projects. I shall do my best to try and get more detailed information over and above that which is in the documents.
</p>

<a name="50704-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>On issues relating to the University of Ulster, I have to say that I am wary of treading on ground about which, frankly, I know nothing whatever. This is mainly an issue for the employer. Indeed, similar cases have occurred in universities in England. I know from my former role in the other place that when I had such difficulties, it was difficult to go to Ministers from any government because of the nature of the legal set-up of universities&#151;they are self-funding bodies. Any payment to the persons concerned would not be from public funds but from the university&#039;s own resources. Universities have their own resources so there is no import on other public services.
</p>

<a name="50704-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>At the outset the department impressed on the university that all the relevant guidance on financial matters must be strictly adhered to. There is no question: they have to be adhered to. We have asked the university to review its financial procedures. As a result, the universities engage the Higher Education Funding Council for England to oversee this work. That is a body with some degree of experience.

</p>

<a name="50704-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Smith, raised the issue of <i>A Shared Future</i>. I became aware of the document&#151;I freely admit&#151;when I arrived at the Northern Ireland Office. It is a very important document. I have mentioned this issue to my ministerial colleagues: it was published on the eve at the end of purdah, virtually as the election commenced. Not everybody knows about it. Together with officials, I am looking at that to give it a push. It deserves a push. When one gets close to an election you can imagine that there are some things that Ministers can do and some they cannot do as it would be quite improper. This initiative was launched. I do not make any criticism, but because of what happens in a general election, not everything gets the elevated exposure that it justifies. Therefore, I want to have a further look at. On the date&#151;21 March&#151;we all know what was on our minds on 21 March.
</p>

<a name="50704-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>On the increasing administrative costs of some of the issues asked by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, some of the increases are mainly due to departmental costs of the new accounting services programme. I shall find out more about that. I need to because I do not know anything about the new accounting services programme, but this will prove a more efficient and effective financial management system across the Northern Ireland Civil Service. In other words, it sounds as though there have been some changes in the way in which the figures have been presented and we could have explained them better. The changes are designed to make the system easier and more effective and, needless to say, we need to explain them.

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>I turn to the issue of Ulster Savings&#151;I forget the page number on which it is dealt with&#151;and the establishment of a dormant fund. The creation of a dormant fund account is a reserved matter, not a matter for the Northern Ireland Government. The Treasury is considering the issue. It is a matter for Parliament but not for the Northern Ireland budget.

<a name="50704-40_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My note says that the Treasury is considering it. The issue is about re-using the unclaimed funds. However, the Treasury is looking at it. When a decision has been made, I shall inform noble Lords way one or the other in a parliamentary statement or a Written Answer. If it was previously included with figures, we need to have some closure so that people know exactly what has happened.
</p>

<a name="50704-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>There is a note regarding the voluntary bodies. As I    say, there are many government departments providing mainstream funding to a wide variety of voluntary and community organisations, delivering, for example, children&#039;s services and other services across Northern Ireland. It is not possible for me to give a global sum for the voluntary sector. I have no doubt that there will be estimates on that. However, they are not disclosed in the way in which the accounts are presented.
</p>

<a name="50704-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>The issue of funding for road passenger services also was raised. The Budget 2004 allocations provide &#163;48 million to replace Translink&#039;s aging fleet. I freely admit that I have not yet travelled on a bus in Northern Ireland. There may be a day when I do, but I do not think that that is planned at present. The provision will enable Translink to purchase 350 new buses over the next two years and improve public transport in Northern Ireland. It scores as revenue, not capital, as it is paid as a grant.

<a name="50704-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>On the Food Standards Agency&#151;a matter that is close to my heart because I took the original legislation through back in 1999&#151;the increase represents a cost transfer from the Department of Agriculture. It is not an increased cost. There has been the matter of setting up and, frankly, that should have been explained. I looked at the book and did not realise it. I know how it was set up because I was involved as the then Minister with responsibility for food safety. I know how we took account of Northern Ireland, Scotland <br>&nbsp;<br>

and Wales in a UK agency. At the time we were only planning devolution; we had not yet done it. We had to plan in legislation how to take account of devolution. I looked at it and I did not understand. In other words, perhaps we should have attached a note to explain what looked like a large increase.
</p>

<a name="50704-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>On the cost of the Assembly, a matter which has crossed my desk a few times, our priority is an early return to regional devolved government. There is no question about that. I think that the decision was taken some time ago to keep the system in being. It is as though they are on recess, but the Assembly has not been abolished. As noble Lords know, even a general election took place while the Assembly was suspended. We think that it is prudent to make provision for the full cost. It is just a question of being prudent. We do not know when it will return, but we hope that it is as soon as possible.

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>A central point that the noble Lord made was the disparity of funding for festivals in Northern Ireland. There is a range of festivals that I will not know about. I have read about some, been asked about some, and have seen others write about some. The No. 1 point is that the perceived community background is not a factor in the funding considerations. The assistance is provided on the basis of the merits of the individual festival and the extent to which that festival meets the needs and objectives of the relevant funding body. The funding bodies will be varied anyway. They will have different criteria, which is right; we do not want one size to fit all. Proposals for any new festival supported by a business case demonstrating the need and benefits would be considered in the same way as for existing festivals. Departments continue to work towards more cohesive and less fragmented arrangements for the funding of festivals; we anticipate that those will be in place in good time for 2006 festivals. Such arrangements, although simplifying the funding mechanism and improving accountability, do not carry the promise of additional funding for festivals. I do not make that commitment and promise at all.

I think that I asked him to confirm or otherwise the existence of an interim funding pot that has been developed between the Department of Social Development and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.

of it, or in which it has been advertised for other people to apply for funding. As I see it, it is in somewhere in the region of &#163;0.5 million, and it is not open for everyone to apply to. It is simply given out at the behest of those departments. Why has it not been opened to other groups?

</p>

<a name="50704-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>I also asked the Minister something about which he is part of the proof, in a parliamentary Answer that he gave me about claims from, for instance, the Northern Ireland Events Company and the Belfast Regeneration Office. I am saying clearly that that money was not in the budgets of those organisations. It came from DCAL and DSD, from the interim fund. The departments simply used those organisations to try to disguise the money by writing a cheque. That is not acceptable.

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>This is a very tricky area. It is one in which an awful lot of people&#151;including I have to say, immodestly, myself&#151;have spent an awful lot of time trying to get people back on the rails in the community from which we come. At great personal risk and inconvenience, and not a bit of expense, we have been trying to put things back in place, organise festivals and so on, and turn things round culturally. I find that there is scant, if any, support from government. The Ulster-Scots Agency put a business case to DCAL in 2004 that would cover exactly what I have said&#151;&#163;600,000&#151;was taken out of the Budget by DCAL. At the same time, nearly that same amount of money was given to nationalist festivals. I do not find conclusions to come to other than that there is a very nasty stink of discrimination about.

<a name="50704-40_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I shall look further into the specific allegations that the noble Lord has made. There is ongoing work between the two departments in terms of that interim funding. I shall report back to him on that. Let us get it clear: although I cannot give specific and detailed answers, I shall not brook any cover-up or any funny-money fiddle that has my name on the end of it. I shall always want such things looked at. At the same time, I am looking at it purely on the merits of the case regarding what the rules are. If this is public money, the public are entitled to track it down; the auditors are entitled to track it down and know what is what. There should not be any hidden pots. However, perceptions about the rules for the money could be at the heart of this. They are based on the arrangements for the funding organisation itself. They may have different rules and may want to fund different things, but I agree that perceptions can be very powerful and get in the way of progress. It is important that that does not happen.

There is no question about that. But I cannot go into specific cases, and I do not think that the noble Lord would expect me to. I can give him the general point about the way I intend to operate once I am responsible for these issues.

Public expenditure analysis shows that per capita&#151;that is, per pupil&#151;education funding is some 30 per cent higher in Northern Ireland than in England.

I do not believe that anyone can claim that we are short-funding. Some of the additional funding has been required mainly due to the high level of quality points obtained by general practitioners and the cost of boards in providing GMS out of hours services, which was previously the responsibility of GPs.

<a name="time_3"></a>
<a name="50704-41_time0"></a><h5>5.11 pm</h5>



<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="50704-41_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker </b>   rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) (Northern Ireland) Order 2005.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>The noble Lord said: This order would introduce provisions broadly in line with those already in force in Great Britain by the enactment of the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004. I believe that it will be helpful to the Chamber to comment briefly on the order and then say a few words about the detailed provisions. The main purpose of the order is to restore investor confidence in financial markets, which was damaged by major corporate failures, particularly in the United States. The order is also designed to support the development of the social economy with the introduction of a new type of company&#151;the community interest company. A modern and effective company law framework is crucial to the performance of the Northern Ireland economy, and it is essential that investors, creditors and consumers feel confident in dealings with business. We all need to know that our money is secure.
</p>

<a name="50704-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>The provisions in Part II of the order are designed to provide safeguards that will protect investors, creditors and others who do business with companies. This part of the order focuses on strengthening the regulation of the audit and accountancy professions, and giving the department greater powers to investigate companies. Part II also relaxes the prohibition on companies indemnifying directors against most liabilities. It is important to encourage high quality individuals to assume the role of company director and we believe that these provisions strike a balance between the need to deal firmly and robustly with cases of dishonesty and negligence, while at the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC50"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC50</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

same time encouraging those high quality individuals needed to make companies successful to become company directors.
</p>

<a name="50704-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>Part III of the order sets out the framework for creating community interest companies and explains how these companies will be regulated. The community interest company will offer a new and additional choice for social enterprises. Social enterprises make a substantial contribution to local economic development. The social enterprise sector has informed us that it is difficult and expensive to set up a company that meets their needs. We are therefore providing an &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; company form that will make it easier to set up social enterprises and encourage the important social enterprise sector in Northern Ireland. Those who choose the community interest company form will have voluntarily accepted certain constraints, such as an asset lock and a higher level of supervision from an independent regulator. This will ensure that the business is run for the benefit of the community and that its assets are protected.
</p>

<a name="50704-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>In summary, UK company law is highly regarded around the world. We therefore have a responsibility to businesses in Northern Ireland to keep pace with developments with that legal framework so that we continue to meet their needs. The measures in the draft order represent the first step in modernising company law in Northern Ireland, which is essential to help sustain the economic progress that we have seen for the past few years. I beg to move.

I took part in the debate when this Act&#151;then a Bill&#151;was brought to your Lordships&#039; House for the rest of the United Kingdom. My noble friend Lord Hodgson and I were on the Front Bench for the Opposition. I led on the CIC, Part III. I assure Members of the Committee that we took the Bill very seriously. We had some long debates. The noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, made his officials available to us on a number of occasions. We met them in the department and elsewhere. I assure the Committee that this Bill was given a very serious going over by my party and, I am sure, the Liberal Democrats during its passage through your Lordships&#039; House when it was being enacted for the United Kingdom.

</p>

<a name="50704-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>Is it intended in the foreseeable future for Northern Ireland company legislation to be looked at in a comprehensive way? It is important that that should be done for it to be at the cutting edge and following best practice. That is particularly true when there are scandals&#151;thankfully, outside the United Kingdom&#151;such as Parmalat and so on. Northern Ireland, in many ways, is in the forefront of innovation and so forth, but we should make sure that the legislative context in which companies there operate is of the very best.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="50704-41_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   My Lords, I would like to pick up on a few issues arising from this order and ask the Minister to clarify some points. First, paragraph 3 of the Explanatory Memorandum says that the order,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>&quot;corresponds closely to the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>Perhaps the Minister can tell us how closely it corresponds and why it does not mirror legislation for the rest of the United Kingdom.
</p>

<a name="50704-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>Despite paragraph 4 of the Explanatory Memorandum declaring that the draft order will,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;help restore investor confidence in companies and financial markets following major corporate failures&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>I am not totally convinced. Indeed, Northern Ireland has so few publicly quoted companies that investor confidence in them cannot be a problem. That poses the question: why do we need community interest companies? Looking at Article 34, in particular, I am inclined to believe that the drafting and wording of the draft order would be utilised to cover actions which could sap, not restore, investor confidence. Just think for a moment how associates of terrorists could make use of the words to legitimise their activities. Is investor confidence not more concerned about the lack of sufficient scrutiny processes to ensure that all directors are fit and proper people to undertake and to carry out responsibilities of their office?
</p>

<a name="50704-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>I am concerned that the draft order appears to be targeted at large economically significant companies. Money laundering, which is unfortunately becoming more and more widespread across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, may and does occur through the use of a number of smaller companies. Why is the draft order not seeking to address that issue?
</p>

<a name="50704-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a> Only last week in the Irish Republic, there was an example of questionable outcomes when a company ran into difficulties, which caused an old people&#039;s home to close. Thirty-six elderly folk were made homeless at 24 hours&#039; notice, and the staff went unpaid. One of the directors of the company which owned the home is Ted Cunningham, who is being investigated by the police concerning Sinn Fein/IRA money laundering following the raid on the Northern Bank in Belfast. In recent years, it has become clear <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC52"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC52</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that a considerable amount of laundered money has gone into old people&#039;s homes in the Republic. I hope that such things do not happen in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="50704-41_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a> Looking at Articles 18 and 19 regarding directors&#039; liabilities in Chapter III of Part II, I must ask the Minister to explain why directors should be protected from liability. Surely use of corporate vehicles is a privilege and directors should continue to be responsible for their actions, and indeed inactions, where that is appropriate. Fit and proper officers would not wish to see change in the area.
</p>

<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="50704-42_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I am grateful for the comments of the noble Lords, Lord Glentoran and Lord Smith, and shall do my best to answer the points of the noble Lord, Lord Laird. I shall deal first with the issue about relating closely. This is parity legislation. In the main legislation, some issues are UK-wide. We could say, &quot;This mirrors exactly&quot;, but there is a nuance&#151;almost a play on words. This is the GB legislation transferred to Northern Ireland, as parts of the Act contained matters relating to the UK.
</p>

<a name="50704-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>It has already been thought appropriate to maintain a separate body of law for Northern Ireland in respect of transferred matters. Company law is such a matter. For that reason, and to ensure that the legislative programme for Northern Ireland is driven by current policy objectives, the bulk of Northern Ireland legislation continues to be by Order in Council. We use GB Bills where appropriate and feasible. We are examining the potential for including Northern Ireland in future GB company legislation, to achieve timely implementation of reforms. By definition, it will always be behind at the moment. If we are trying to plug some loopholes, they will be in Northern Ireland a little longer.
</p>

<a name="50704-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>There has probably been a misunderstanding about directors; my speech was incredibly brief on the matter. I talked about indemnifying directors for only some issues, not others, because there was a prohibition on companies indemnifying directors against most liabilities, not all liabilities. Certainly for negligence and criminal activities, the company would not be able to give cover to directors. On other matters that are more run of the mill, it is perceived that there is a shortage of people coming forward because the companies are not able to give insurance cover. There is no possibility in any way, shape or form of a company using company funds to give indemnities to directors where the companies are involved in money laundering, criminal activities, negligence and so on. I shall put the words in the order in which I have them in front of me. The company cannot indemnify the director in respect of negligence, default, breach of duty or trust by him in relation to the company. In other words, there are other issues, so there is no catch-all or <i>carte blanche</i> for people to do what the noble Lord mentioned.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="50704-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>The community interest company is just another vehicle. It gives a greater choice to people setting up companies, particularly in the social sector. There will be an assets lock and an independent regulator. The independent regulator will be a very unattractive option for two people who want to be involved in organised crime and terrorist activity.

</p>

<a name="50704-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>There will probably be very few community interest companies in Northern Ireland. As I understand it&#151;perhaps someone will tell me if I have it wrong&#151;subcontracting will be for the independent regulator and for someone who is experienced and doing the job in England and Great Britain. The person will not have to learn on the job; it will be someone who is experienced. It is not a matter of the English doing it for Northern Ireland. It is being purchased as a contract. That is how I understand it, and I think that I have it right based on memory and what was said last week.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="50704-42_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   My apologies for intervening. I forgot to ask one question on that subject. It struck me that the cost to government of the office of the CIC regulator will be only &#163;10,000 per annum. How did that happen? The noble Lord may have explained that it will be a subcontract, but you cannot do much for &#163;10,000 in that role. Before he spoke, I was assuming that it would happen from within the CIC regulator&#039;s office in England.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="50704-42_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I do not know how the particular sum has been fixed. However, we are not expecting a massive number of companies. It just provides another opportunity for those involved in this field to go down another route. That is available to them but we are not pushing it. A nominal sum, perhaps, is being provided. As I say, however, it is important to use a regulator, and an independent regulator is being provided. We can therefore close the potential loopholes which the noble Lord, Lord Laird, mentioned.
</p>

<a name="50704-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>As for the comprehensive treatment of legislation, we recently initiated discussions with the Department of Trade and Industry on extending new proposals in the company law reform Bill to Northern Ireland at the same time. A company law reform Bill is up and coming and we are initiating discussion to include Northern Ireland in that. I hope that that will satisfy noble Lords.
</p>

<a name="50704-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>It is not a massive change. It is designed to bring to Northern Ireland the comfort of legislation that we have put in train in Great Britain following some of the scandals in America about which we all know&#151;I will not list them&#151;by closing potential loopholes, improving the audit investigation function and thereby improving investor confidence. The &#163;10,000 is a token sum for estimates. The subcontract is to the Great Britain regulator. It is a bit like the 5p in the previous order we discussed; sometimes you have to include a sum in order to make the provision work. It is there for the purpose of estimates and is not a nominal sum. I commend the order to the Grand Committee.

<a name="50704-42_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker </b>   rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Traffic Management (Northern Ireland) Order 2005.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of this order is to transfer the powers for parking enforcement in Northern Ireland to the Department for Regional Development, following the decision of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to withdraw from this activity. This order would introduce provisions for decriminalised parking enforcement, broadly in line with those already in force in Great Britain by the enactment of the Road Traffic Act 1991. It would also introduce provision for the civil enforcement of other traffic contraventions in line with those enacted in Part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004.
</p>

<a name="50704-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>The order is about dealing effectively with and reducing illegal parking, which is a significant problem in Northern Ireland. Those who responded to the public consultation on the proposals agreed that effective parking enforcement was necessary and supported the proposals, including provisions to clamp or tow away vehicles in certain circumstances. I should say now that the department&#039;s intention is not to clamp or tow away vehicles for routine enforcement purposes. These powers will be used primarily to recover outstanding debts; in other words, if you park your car illegally and do not pay the fine, at some time in the future your car may be towed away if you have collected a few fines. However, that would not be done to enforce illegal parking, but only for non-payment of the debt.
</p>

<a name="50704-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>Transport for London uses similar powers to recover debts from unpaid congestion charge penalties, a point that I did not know until I met colleagues to be briefed about this. I am informed that that is working well&#151;it must be because I have not read about it anywhere&#151;as a debt-recovery tool. Since July 2003, Transport for London has clamped or removed over 2,200 vehicles to recover such debts. Payment has been secured on 64 per cent of the debt in question. During the public consultation on the order, some concerns were expressed about using a private company to carry out the enforcement work. We believe that a specialist private company will bring experience and expertise in managing similar operations elsewhere. The department, with its experience in contract management, will carefully specify the contract and oversee the delivery of it.
</p>

<a name="50704-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>Note that the administration of the proposed scheme, including the processing of payments and decisions on debt recovery, will all remain in the public sector. Likewise, the interface with the public about the operation of the scheme, including complaints, will be handled by the department&#039;s Roads Service. That transfer of powers is intended to lead to less congestion, traffic moving more freely on the roads, and improved road safety. In practice we expect it to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC55"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC55</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

benefit all road users. The proposals have been welcomed, especially by disabled drivers, because more effective enforcement will mean that parking bays on public roads reserved for blue-badge holders are more likely to be available to them. The proposed new system will also be more efficient and economic. While it is difficult to put a figure on it, the estimated savings are modest. Putting a cost on reducing congestion is not the easiest thing in the world. We all know that it must cost the overall economy a fortune, particularly due to badly parked vehicles.
</p>

<a name="50704-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>The Government are confident that as a result of the proposed new scheme we shall see fewer people running the risk of parking illegally. Town centres and neighbourhoods throughout Northern Ireland will be safer and better places for that. There are economic benefits that are clear to everyone. The central part of the public interface will remain in the public sector and the issue of clamping and towing will be used for debt recovery and not for the enforcement of illegal parking. I beg to move.

I understand from my briefing this morning that it is hoped, in due course, that it will become self-funding, which is a good objective. I am a little concerned about having only one company for the whole of Northern Ireland being responsible to the department, but it is not a large geographical area for an operation of this nature; we are probably talking of a town or a city. One matter that is absolutely certain is that the parking discipline in Northern Ireland at the moment is non-existent and something needs to be done about it.

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>One concern, which I always have on such matters, is that I see that regulations will be made following the passage of the order, which presumably will outline the authorities and how the whole business will work in practice. They will be made under negative instrument, so we shall not see them. I always feel uneasy about giving the Secretary of State any more power than he has already. However, perhaps on this occasion we can overlook that and if it all starts to go wrong we can return to it one day. I support the order.

<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="50704-43_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </b>   I too thank the officials, who have been extremely helpful to us as we considered these rather thorny questions. I shall speak for slightly longer than the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. Although we have no objection to these measures in principle, we have questions about how the scheme will operate, primarily on accountability. As there are a number of questions, I do not expect the Minister to answer them all this afternoon. I shall be quite happy if he would like to reply later.
</p>

<a name="50704-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>How will this measure affect the traffic warden service currently employed by the Police Service of Northern Ireland? Will traffic wardens be redeployed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC56"></a>

to other duties that do not fall under this scheme at the moment? If the department decides to contract out, which it will do, what standards and criteria will it use to assess the credibility and ability not only of the third party, but of the people whom it employs? I understand the department will be responsible for them. There are also questions about the training that the individuals will receive. I understand, although I would like it confirmed, that because it will be country-wide&#151;Northern Ireland-wide&#151;arrangements will not vary across Northern Ireland; that the arrangements will be the same in every district. That would ensure that standards of training are comparable. How do we ensure that the quality of work is of a common standard?
</p>

<a name="50704-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>I mentioned to the officials the role played by the policing board of Northern Ireland to ensure that the chief constable, and all those who work for him, which at the moment includes traffic wardens, are effective and efficient. While I do not disagree with what the order proposes in relation to the attendants, I query the carrying out of those responsibilities. Who will carry out the review function if not the policing board?
</p>

<a name="50704-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>Article 3(4)(c) allows the department to prescribe other functions which may be carried out by traffic wardens. I wondered what the department may have in mind for that. How will such functions be prescribed and will they need to come before Parliament or will they merely be administrative decisions?
</p>

<a name="50704-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>Schedule 1 concerns contraventions that a traffic attendant can enforce. There is quite a list. I wonder whether that is an exhaustive list or whether the department envisages adding to it. Article 18 sets out the circumstances in which the department may immobilise a vehicle. The Explanatory Notes suggest that the regulations could include a specified number or level of debt that has to be reached before powers to immobilise can be employed. I wondered what other conditions might be in the regulations.
</p>

<a name="50704-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>Under Articles 21 to 28, the department will have the power to remove a vehicle and its contents and the power to dispose of a vehicle and its contents. Can the amount recoverable be varied by the department or would that need to come before Parliament, even as a negative instrument?
</p>

<a name="50704-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>Articles 29 to 31 set out the procedure and criteria for appointing adjudicators. While we welcome the provisions relating to the adjudicators and appeals and while the process looks rigorous and fair, we are pleased to see that a report will be published every 12 months on the discharge of the functions of the adjudicators. We look forward to examining those reports to ensure that the appeals process is indeed fair and effective.
</p>

<a name="50704-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>Article 32 changes the reference to &quot;institution&quot; in the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons (Northern Ireland) Act 1978 to &quot;organisation&quot;. On conviction, the offence is punishable by a fine not exceeding &#163;1,000. Perhaps the noble Lord could remind me&#151;it is a number of years since I was a magistrate in this country so I am a little out of date&#151;how this fine <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC57"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC57</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

compares with that of a similar offence in England and Wales. I would be happy to receive a written answer. I wondered whether the maximum is quite high.
</p>

<a name="50704-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>Article 38 deals with acquisition of land for purposes of functions of the department under this order. I am not sure what this means. What moneys have been put aside to acquire this as yet unspecified land?
</p>

<a name="50704-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Finally, is the Minister satisfied that ordinary post is reliable enough for the service of documents under the order? Normally they are sent by registered post.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="50704-43_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   I too identify myself with the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, on the presentation made by the Minister on this order. Perhaps due to my own incompetence, for which I apologise, I would like to have been briefed by the department&#039;s officials this morning. It might have saved a lot of time. I feel that that exercise would be extremely useful. I am surprised it has been offered to other noble Lords but it does not seem to have been offered&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="50704-43_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   Let me make this absolutely clear. The noble Lords were not briefed personally, but as representatives of their parties&#151;as Front-Bench spokespeople. That is the reason. I understand that the noble Lord sits as a Cross-Bencher.
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="50704-43_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   Yes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="50704-43_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   That does not mean to say that the noble Lord does not have a valuable view, but the Cross-Benchers do not have a party structure. In trying to improve the quality of scrutiny, the offer of a briefing from officials is made to the political Front Benches.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="50704-43_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   I thank the Minister for his explanation. That is what I suspected.
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="50704-43_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Smith of Clifton: </b>   I think I am right in saying that we request such meetings. They are always willingly given, but it is up to us to request them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_46"></a>
<a name="50704-43_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, for that clarification. In future, if a Cross-Bencher such as me requested a briefing, would I receive such a briefing? It seems to me a much more scientific and better way to do things.
</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>
<a name="50704-43_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I do not run this place, but I shall have to say no to that. There is one Conservative Party and one Liberal Democrat Party but 180-odd Cross-Benchers of no party, all with an equally valid view. Therefore, if I said, yes to the noble Lord, I would have to say yes to 180 others. However, when major issues come before the House, sometimes before Second Readings of Bills we have had meetings in this Room on the all-party Whip, with officials and Ministers present, so that any Peer can raise issues and discuss them. That has happened in my four years in this House. That cannot be done on every item of Northern Ireland business because we deal with Northern Ireland differently. However, if there are particular <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC58"></a>

concerns identified to me on certain issues, I shall always do my best to facilitate the supply of information in advance.
</p>




<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="50704-43_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation and for his promise of help in advance. I appreciate the point, but there are probably not many Members on the Cross Benches who would request information about a Northern Ireland order.


</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="50704-43_spnew11"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   Perhaps it would help if I explain that it applies across all departments. There are meetings with the Minister and officials on major legislation that are open to all Peers. That pattern occurs right across. That happens when there is a major Bill. The meetings are set up on an all-party basis. Were Ministers to offer meetings to individuals from the Cross Benches, Back-Benchers from the three other parties, who do not always agree with their Front Benches, would demand such meetings and the Ministers would never be able to do anything at all.
</p>




<p><a name="st_50"></a>
<a name="50704-43_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   I appreciate the words of the noble Baroness. I understand the problems. This is an order, so there would not be a request to meet the Minister on issues such as this, but simply to be briefed by officials on what is meant by the order. However, I shall make progress.
</p>

<a name="50704-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>I have grave concerns about the order. Like other Members, I am anxious that such an order will put an undue emphasis on the collection of money through fines and insufficient emphasis on safety. A service of this nature that is motivated by profit and, therefore, open to corruption, will do little to improve highway and pedestrian safety.
</p>

<a name="50704-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>When the former Minister, Mr Spellar, announced the decision to privatise traffic wardens back in November 2004, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;The decision to employ a specialist contractor is based on extensive research on the best practice of enforcement across the UK&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>I wonder how many people in England agree. We hear many stories of traffic wardens determined to issue as many tickets as possible, and of some being sacked because they did not meet the daily, weekly or monthly quotas. Indeed, you have only to walk down a local high street in England to see wardens approaching the service with tremendous gusto, ticketing all who cross their path. The department has already said that no quotas will be placed on the service. Can the Minister repeat this assurance today?
</p>

<a name="50704-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>Perhaps more worrying is the impact all this has on the traffic wardens themselves. A recent report by UNISON called <i>Clamping Down on Violence</i> said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;There is evidence that some local authorities, or more particularly the private companies they employ to undertake parking control, are exploiting drivers and attendants alike in the relentless pursuit of higher fines revenue. This can have a significant effect on the health and safety of attendants, putting them at even greater risk of violence in an already dangerous job&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50704-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>It is clear that traffic wardens already face daily harassment and the very real threat of violence. Ninety per cent suffer some form of violent incident at work each year, according to the UNISON survey, and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC59"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC59</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

almost 20 per cent are attacked or threatened on at least a weekly basis. This will only increase if this profit-driven approach is applicable in Northern Ireland. UNISON recommended a review of parking control methods in Great Britain, to encourage its use primarily as a method of public safety and congestion control, rather than a revenue collection service. Should we not strive to do the same in Northern Ireland rather than merely replicate legislation from Great Britain that is possibly flawed? Can the Minister tell us what impact all this will have on current traffic wardens and their jobs? Will there be any redundancies as a result of the order?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo050704/text/50704-44.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="50704-44_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I shall answer that last question first. It was raised also by the noble Baroness. The existing 104 Police Service of Northern Ireland traffic wardens and 25 Road Service car park staff&#151;that is, civil servants&#151;will transfer to the company. So the answer on redundancies is no. They will transfer under the rules that appertain to the transfer to the TUPE regulations. That will be to a specialist parking enforcement company. I do not know which company, as it has not been chosen, but someone professionally experienced in such matters. I shall turn to how they will be measured in a moment. I shall try to go through the issues in the order that they were raised.
</p>

<a name="50704-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>On the training of enforcement staff, obviously when selecting the contractor we have to review the training proposals of each tender, because it comes back to choosing the appropriate company. A key performance indictor for this contract will be the level of continuous training of the staff; it will not be the issuing of tickets. That is not an issue at all. The new British Parking Association model contract on quality of enforcement will be adopted. This is not something that we have just invented; there are professionals out there doing this job at present. There are companies with a model contract, and we will adopt that. It will be a single private enforcement company, to get continuity of approach across Northern Ireland. It is important that there is continuity of approach in what is a fairly small area. It would be terrible if there were divisions and if people were being treated differently in different geographical areas, for reasons that I do not need to explain. The best practice involved in that model contract will promote higher quality standards of on-street enforcement. One of the indicators will be quality of training; others will be good quality penalty charges, a reduced number of complaints and a reduced number of appeals. There has been a big consultation on this, and many of the issues were raised. There is a general consensus that something has got to be done.
</p>

<a name="50704-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>The regulations will need to set out the conditions that will have to be satisfied before the department uses the powers to clamp or remove vehicles. As I have said, for normal parking enforcement there will be financial penalties. If the penalties are not met, the regulations are likely to specify a level or a number of debts that might have to be outstanding before the powers of removal or clamping are used. They are similar conditions to those in the London Road User Charging Regulations, where the congestion charging <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC60"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC60</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

scheme at the moment specifies three outstanding penalties. Obviously, we will consult on the draft regulations. The fact that they will be negatived does not matter&#151;it does matter, I accept that, but they will not be bounced on anyone. We will consult on them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_52"></a>
<a name="50704-44_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </b>   There is a concern about who will make sure that they are doing their job properly and what redress there will be if they are not. I do not know whether the Minister is aware of a difficult television programme of traffic wardens in London clamping people. That was a farmed out, or contracted out, role. It was absolutely horrendous. I do not want that to happen in Northern Ireland.
</p>




<p><a name="st_53"></a>
<a name="50704-44_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I made it clear that for the enforcement of illegal parking the norm will not be clamping and removal; it will be the issuing of a penalty notice. The issue of clamping and removal will arise only following the regulations that I have just referred to, which we do not have at the moment, if a number of penalties are outstanding on a vehicle, or if that vehicle hits the threshold of the totality of penalties and is found.
</p>

<a name="50704-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>People do not realise these days that digital technology has it all. All our number plates are photographed. It is exactly the same as the congestion charge; it works. I have been sent the letter with the photograph of my car number plate when I forgot to pay my charge one Monday. It is there. Our number plates are the test, and therefore if penalties are not paid there is no short cut; you lose your vehicle. Losing your motor and your wheels is quite a big sanction to most people. By and large, they will pay the penalties. It would be even better if they did not park illegally and cause congestion and road safety hazards in the first place.

</p>

<a name="50704-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>There must be proper accountability. The conditions of the contract will specify the role and responsibility of the contractor and the department. The contract will allow sanctions to be taken against the contractor if he fails to discharge his responsibilities. The chief executive of the department&#039;s road service is the agency accounting officer, and the chief executive is accountable to the Minister in charge of that department. I am covering myself a little, but this issue affects more people in a sensitive way than most of the other issues that we have touched on today. The regulations must be made to prescribe the conditions that must be satisfied before the powers to clamp or remove vehicles can be used for recovery purposes&#151;the level of debt or the number of charges. This works elsewhere, by the way.
</p>

<a name="50704-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>I do not know anything about the television programme, but some authorities in this country have stopped clamping for enforcement and do it for non-payment of fines, because they realise that can be a perverse thing and can turn the motorist against them. We do not want to turn the motorist against us&#151;we want the motorist on our side, because they can flow freely in the cars to and from and in and out of cities. We hope that not much land is required, but when we lift the cars we must put them somewhere, and land will be required for pounds&#151;as in car pounds.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC61"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC61</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50704-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>As for Schedule 1 offences, it is not the department&#039;s intention to add to the list at present. It covers a range of waiting and parking restrictions and stationary offences. The order prescribes for the enforcement of certain stationary offences and civil enforcement of moving traffic offences. A feasibility study is being undertaken at the moment on civil enforcement of moving traffic contraventions in bus lanes, for example. The traffic attendants will be responsible only for parking; they will not have the powers for directing traffic and so on, even in emergencies&#151;that is the job of the police. Their functions are prescribed for which they can be properly trained.
</p>

<a name="50704-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>Do the penalties imposed correspond to those for offences in Great Britain? The answer is yes&#151;and I hope that that satisfies the noble Baroness. It is not a way of raising money, by the way; the first year the scheme will cost more than &#163;2 million, so it is not a money-raising scheme. People who park legally have nothing to fear, but we must make out of pocket those who park illegally, so that it does not pay to do so. The traffic attendants will be given specific confrontation training&#151;in the jargon. They are fellow citizens doing a very worthwhile job for their community, keeping the roads free and keeping them safer.
</p>

<a name="50704-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>One thing that I did not say and which it is important to put on record, although no one has specifically raised it, is that at no time will anyone in Northern Ireland ever be asked by anybody in authority regarding this scheme to pay cash or by credit card to a person in the street for either collecting or unclamping their car. If ever they are asked to pay by anybody, that person is a criminal, because they are nothing to do with the scheme. The payments will all be made to the appropriate departments, specified offices and to public civil servants. The clampers, the attendants and the company will not be collecting money in the street off motorists. So there is no bonus for the crooks, spivs and gangsters to move into this, because there is no money in it. I cannot make it clearer than that. I have probably been a bit bolder than I should have been, but it is best not to sugar-coat these things so that people are left in no doubt.
</p>




<p><a name="st_54"></a>
<a name="50704-44_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   It crossed my mind that there may be some parts of Northern Ireland in which these people will not be able to operate. Has the Minister, or have the Government, taken thought about how they might be protected?

<a name="50704-44_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I have not been over much of Northern Ireland. I get there twice a week, but I do not go to many places. But I am told and I have read that the current department operates road enforcement, road fund licence activities and checking all across Northern Ireland. I am unaware of any no-go areas regarding that activity. Obviously there will be areas where there is no problem&#151;nevertheless, you always need to check whether there is a problem. People will have someone to complain to if there are problems. You can have problems of bad parking in small <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="50704-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>We want normality in Northern Ireland&#151;that is what it is about. What on earth is wrong with traffic attendants keeping the roads clear and putting stickers on the cars where they are not? In other areas, what is wrong with going out as a team to remove the vehicle if it has been identified and someone is wilfully refusing to pay the fine? I do not expect, and we will not countenance, any no-go areas for this activity. That may be bold, and the noble Lord smiles, but it is the normal process. The fines are normal, and this is as normal as you can get, which is what the people of Northern Ireland want.

<h4 align=center><a name="topichd_9"></a>Colleges of Education (Northern Ireland) Order 2005</h4>

<a name="time_5"></a>
<a name="50704-45_time0"></a><h5>6 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_56"></a>
<a name="50704-45_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker </b>   rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Colleges of Education (Northern Ireland) Order 2005.
</p>




<p><a name="st_57"></a>The noble Lord said: The purpose of the draft Colleges of Education Order (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 is essentially to remove an outstanding legal anomaly and to establish Stranmillis University College as a legally distinct corporate institution, in line with all other higher education institutions in Northern Ireland.

</p>

<a name="50704-45_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>There are, as noble Lords will know much better than I, two small institutions in Northern Ireland which specialise in initial teacher education&#151;St Mary&#039;s University College and Stranmillis University College. Both colleges are academically integrated with the Queen&#039;s University of Belfast but are financially and organisationally separate. For academic purposes, they are colleges of the Queen&#039;s University of Belfast. These arrangements will be unaffected by the provisions in the draft order.
</p>

<a name="50704-45_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>The unique status of Stranmillis University College and its relationship with government go back to 1922, when the college was founded as a non-denominational institution by the then recently established Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland. The college was established to provide state-funded teacher training in Northern Ireland alongside that already available at St. Mary&#039;s College, Belfast.
</p>

<a name="50704-45_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>The Ministry purchased for this purpose Stranmillis House and its grounds, some 3 kilometres from the centre of Belfast. Most of the area was declared a conservation area in 1996. The college&#039;s grounds and buildings remain government property and its board of governors is directly appointed by the Minister with responsibility for the Department for Employment and Learning.
</p>

<a name="50704-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>Stranmillis College was established under cover of Section 1 (3) of the Ministries of Northern Ireland Act 1921. It operated within the scope of the minutes laid <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC63"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC63</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

before Parliament under that section and was subject to the direction and control of the Minister who remained responsible for the administration of the service. Since the 1930s it has, in practice, been run as an independent body under the management of a board of governors.
</p>

<a name="50704-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>The board of governors, however, does not operate on a statutory basis. The current board has been appointed by the Department for Employment and Learning on an extra-statutory basis, as an interim measure, to advise and assist the department on the running of the college. The college remains subject to the direction and control of the department.
</p>

<a name="50704-45_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>There is a need to change the legal status of Stranmillis as the position of the college is inconsistent with that of the other higher education institutions in Northern Ireland. The other higher education institutions, while being diverse in origin, size and organisation, share the following characteristics of being, (a) legally independent corporate institutions and (b) accountable through a governing body which carries ultimate responsibility for all aspects of the institution.
</p>

<a name="50704-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>An appraisal of options for changing the legal status and governance arrangements concluded that incorporation provided the best method of securing an appropriate statutory basis for the college. Incorporation will allow it to become a legally distinct institution accountable, through a governing body, to the department. It is for that reason that the draft order is before the Committee today.

</p>

<a name="50704-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>Last year, the Department for Employment and Learning launched a policy consultation on the proposals to establish Stranmillis University College as a legally distinct corporate institution. Following the policy consultation, the draft legislative proposals were issued for public consultation, which closed on 19 May this year. All consultees welcomed the proposals.
</p>

<a name="50704-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>Part II of the order provides for the establishment of a body corporate to be the governing body of Stranmillis University College&#151;a College of Queen&#039;s University of Belfast. It also provides for the transfer of responsibility for the management of Stranmillis to the new governing body and outlines the respective functions and powers of the governing body and the department. More detailed provisions in relation to the transfer of powers are contained in Schedule 1.

<a name="50704-45_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>The order also contains provision for the making of instruments and articles of government which will contain provisions for the constitution and functions of the governing body. The governing body will become responsible for all aspects of the management of the college, which includes the economical, efficient and effective use of all of the college&#039;s resources and expenditure. The governing body would become the employer of college staff; the owner of its estate including buildings, land and equipment; and would be responsible for all services, including financial systems and maintenance of estate.

<a name="50704-45_para10"></a>

same time as its competitor institutions in England and Northern Ireland. Certain safeguards have been included in the order to protect the public interest in the acquisition and disposal of land and other property, which would be subject to the prior consent of the sponsoring department.
</p>

<a name="50704-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>The college&#039;s responsibilities, with regard to the usage of, and accountability for, public funds would continue to be subject to a financial memorandum between the department and the college, and also to such other guidelines and requirements as may be promulgated by the department from time to time.
</p>

<a name="50704-45_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>Part III of the order deals with the necessary amendments to the Education and Libraries (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 in relation to the functions and powers of the Department of Employment and Learning and the Department of Education and colleges of education generally.
</p>

<a name="50704-45_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>Schedule 2 outlines the membership, eligibility and proceedings of the governing body. The membership, as outlined, is reflective of the sector norm and all members will be appointed, under the guidance of the   Commissioner for Public Appointments, by ministerial minute.
</p>

<a name="50704-45_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>The equality provisions of the Northern Ireland Acts have to be taken into account in considering whether we can continue the nominations to the governing body currently operated by the three main Protestant Churches. Although there is not a separate category listed under Schedule 2 from which we can specifically designate representatives of the Protestant Churches, it is important to point out that Church representatives will not be excluded from membership of the governing body and, in addition, current members may continue in office until their term expires. We acknowledge the interest of the Churches, and officials are in discussion with them with the aim of finding a solution within the parameters set by the order and the equality legislation. There is a need to resolve the issue in a way which is compatible with the requirements of the legislation, but I wish to make it clear that the issue does not arise from either the proposed incorporation or from the order itself. It is as a direct result of equality legislation. I sat on a governing body and chaired one in Birmingham for 20-odd years, and I am confident that a satisfactory solution can be found.
</p>

<a name="50704-45_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>The board has in the past been responsible for the management of the college and for securing the efficient, economic and effective use of all the college&#039;s resources and expenditure. This role will not differ substantially once the college has attained incorporated status. I commend the current board of governors which has managed the college on our behalf in an efficient and effective manner.
</p>

<a name="50704-45_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>I have already referred to the composition of the governing body and have explained that this does not arise from the proposed incorporation or from the provisions of the order. In relation to the order, the impact of this proposal on the nine equality categories identified in Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 has been assessed. Having considered all <br>&nbsp;<br>

available evidence, it is the Government&#039;s view that the proposal to incorporate Stranmillis University College would not have an adverse impact on any of the nine equality categories.
</p>

<a name="50704-45_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>Incorporation of the college, with legislative safeguards, would not adversely impact on employees and students, nor would it impact on the delivery of the academic provision. Incorporation would not impose any changes to the existing staff/student interface. There would be no change to the terms and conditions of staff employed at the college, no changes to the academic provision and no changes that would impact upon the students. In fact, both staff and student bodies are fully welcoming of the proposals.
</p>

<a name="50704-45_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>Incorporation is about establishing the college as legally distinct from government and similar to the other providers of higher education in Northern Ireland. This legislation will enable the college to plan more effectively for the future to the benefit of staff, students and the wider community.
</p>

<a name="50704-45_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>It is our intention that, subject to the approval of both Houses of course, the order can be made at the Privy Council later this month. That will give time for preparations to be made so that the transfer can be effected from 1 October 2005. On behalf of my ministerial colleagues, I extend thanks to everyone who has been involved. The legislation is almost unique and settles an issue that has lain around for a while. Of course, it makes sure that the college is not disadvantaged by not having the incorporated status that its competitor colleges have. I beg to move.

<a name="50704-46_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   Once again this afternoon, I thank the Minister for an extremely clear explanation of what is actually a rather complicated little affair. I also had the privilege of a briefing from officials this morning. It was not until I was coming to the end of that briefing that I realised the interplays and complexities of what appears, at first sight, to be a simple and straightforward tidying-up operation. We have reached a situation in which, from the outside, it would appear that there would be no obvious change to anyone, but from the inside everyone is in agreement, so far as I can understand from what the Minister said.
</p>

<a name="50704-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>Only one little thorny problem is left: appointment of the board of governors. That becomes slightly complicated because of the equality provisions. I suspect that all of us&#151;the noble Lord said that it was his experience, and it is mine&#151;feel comfortable and confident on such an issue that compromises will be reached, and that what we call at home the right answer will be arrived at. I have no difficulty in supporting the order.
</p>




<p><a name="st_59"></a>
<a name="50704-46_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Smith of Clifton: </b>   In so far as this is a tidying-up order, we support it, but I cannot let the occasion pass without remarking on two things. The two colleges of education&#151;Stranmillis and St Mary&#039;s&#151;<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC66"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC66</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have provided between them teachers of outstanding quality, which has put Northern Ireland in the forefront of education in the United Kingdom. That said, the two colleges reflect and reinforce the divided community, which is very unfortunate. I would have liked the tidying up, although recognising the distinctiveness of the two communities, to introduce a more unified and less sectarian approach to the provision of teachers. Apart from that, we will support it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="50704-46_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   I join others in thanking the Minister for his clarity in setting out the order. We are beginning to get the measure of his plain speaking, which we very much appreciate in Northern Ireland; he will find it uncommon among his new colleagues in Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="50704-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>I too was concerned about the issue of the formation of the board, bearing in mind the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, that you have in Northern Ireland two education colleges that reflect the division inside the community. You have a system of Catholic education, which does not make itself amenable to Section 75 of the Government of Northern Ireland Act, for reasons that are not exactly appropriate.
</p>

<a name="50704-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>The problem is that the churches, as we know, gave their schools and control of their schools in the 1920s, 1930s and the 1940s to the Department of Education. Therefore, they have held, as a position of honour, places on the board of Stranmillis. I listened very carefully to what the Minister said, that a compromise could be on the way. I very much approve of a compromise that ensures that the particular position of these churches is respected. I would like the Minister to inform us of the earliest possible occasion when such a compromise could be reached, and what the compromise is.
</p>

<a name="50704-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I make one final remark to the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton. I appreciate his kind remarks about the quality of teachers emerging from the two colleges. I think his remarks are very timely: I have been joined by a graduate of Stranmillis, the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis of Drumglass.

<a name="50704-46_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I am very grateful for the Committee&#039;s support on this issue. I am absolutely certain that the arrangements will be made. I do not want to go into the matter a great deal because other people know a lot more about it than I do. On the point that the noble Lord, Lord Smith, made about the division being perpetuated, I asked about the mixture of students. There is a mixture of students in both colleges. There is a small minority in each. I understand that at Stranmillis the ratio is about 1,370 to 190, but 190 is more than 10 per cent; and at St Mary&#039;s it is 1,155 to 30, a somewhat smaller percentage. I understand that the governing body at Stranmillis has not been exclusive on the one side. I understand that recently a &quot;lady&quot; representative was put on the board who was from the &quot;other side&quot;, if I can put it that way. So there was a mixture. Therefore, it worked happily.

<a name="50704-46_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>The colleges have been forced to address the issue because of the equality legislation. Everyone sees an advantage in incorporation. In other words, we do not have to look at things like failure, defeat or victory. There is a chance of success for Stranmillis out of incorporation. It can achieve success from incorporation with the issues I have raised, which I do not have to repeat. Part of the consequences of that is the equality legislation. That was not there originally.
</p>

<a name="50704-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>I am absolutely certain that we and the people involved can find a satisfactory solution to this matter, because that is not the purpose of the change.

<p><a name="st_62"></a>
<a name="50704-46_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rooker </b>   rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2005.
</p>




<p><a name="st_63"></a>The noble Lord said: I beg to move that the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2005. It is part of the Government&#039;s proposals for legislative reform of the criminal justice system. The order provides for a variety of improvements to the criminal law in Northern Ireland; some are procedural; and some are policy.
</p>

<a name="50704-46_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>The order will help tackle anti-social behaviour and crime. It will provide new powers and procedures for criminal justice agencies and hopefully create more efficient criminal justice processes for both defendants and agencies. In many respects, it will bring Northern Ireland legislation up to par with the law in England and Wales.
</p>

<a name="50704-46_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a>The proposals for the draft order were consulted on for 12 weeks between March and June this year. Fifteen responses were received, most of which welcomed the proposals. Differing comments were made on the proposals in relation to anti-social behaviour legislation. Some welcomed the proposals, the commitment that the Government are giving to tackling anti-social behaviour and the support this gives to communities and victims. Some expressed concern regarding anti-social behaviour legislation overall, commenting on the legislation that is already in place and there are those who take the view that such legislation has an adverse impact on children and young people.
</p>

<a name="50704-46_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>The Government believe that the anti-social behaviour legislation and the orders remain a necessary component of the overall response to tackling the growing incidences of anti-social behaviour across Northern Ireland, as indeed the rest of the country. ASBOs will continue to help safeguard <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC68"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC68</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the rights of ordinary citizens to live peaceful and law-abiding lives without fear of harm or intimidation in their own community. I accept that others take a different view. There are some legal challenges to this, so it would be inappropriate for me to comment on it.
</p>

<a name="50704-46_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>The draft order provides the courts and prosecutors, the police, prisons and probation with additional powers and procedures. It improves current legislation on anti-social behaviour. It will also help the fight against drink-driving. It will also help the Assets Recovery Agency to tackle organised crime even more effectively.
</p>

<a name="50704-46_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>It is very much a miscellaneous order. I turn to the key features of the order. Apart from its introductory section and schedules, the order has six broad sections&#151;the anti-social behaviour legislation, prisons law, proceeds of crime, youth justice, road traffic and a miscellaneous section.
</p>

<a name="50704-46_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>The anti-social behaviour provisions include an enabling power for the Secretary of State to designate additional authorities to make application for ASBOs; an interim anti-social behaviour order on conviction; an appeal mechanism; and arrangements for adjournment, variation and discharge of ASBOs on conviction. There are additional provisions to protect vulnerable or intimidated witnesses in ASBO proceedings; and it extends discretionary reporting restrictions to 17 year-olds when this age group comes within the ambit of the youth court.
</p>

<a name="50704-46_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>For prisons, the provisions focus largely on improving and updating current prisons and life sentence law. These include: the re-naming of prisons boards of visitors as independent monitoring boards&#151;as is the case in England and Wales&#151;and the removal of prisons boards of visitors&#039; rarely used or obsolete powers to reflect the new status. There are two separate and largely technical amendments in life sentence legislation and legal aid provision.
</p>

<a name="50704-46_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>On proceeds of crime, the Government propose additional powers for the Assets Recovery Agency in its fight against organised crime in Northern Ireland. A power will be created to allow investigators to obtain information on the details and contents of safe deposit boxes. Solicitors&#039; orders, currently available only in confiscation investigations in criminal matters, will be extended to civil recover investigations brought by the Assets Recovery Agency.
</p>

<a name="50704-46_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a>On youth justice, an adjustment to the timing within which reparation, community supervision and youth conference orders will allow the court more flexibility. A change to ensure that 17 year-olds will continue to be remanded, where appropriate, to a young offender centre will permit the expansion of the youth court to include 17 year-olds. Expansion was recommended by the Criminal Justice Review arising out of the Good Friday agreement and will bring the youth court in Northern Ireland into line with that in England and Wales. Two procedural adjustments to current provisions relating to pre-sentence reports and ASBO reporting restrictions, which I have already outlined, to extend to 17 year-olds will improve youth court procedures.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC69"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC69</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50704-46_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a>On road traffic, provisions improving the ability to take specimens of blood from those suspected of drink-driving are being created. What is currently a temporary arrangement for the funding derived from fixed penalty notices under the safety camera scheme and its use to reimburse authorities for their expenditure will be firmly established in law. Again, these provisions are already in force in England and Wales.
</p>

<a name="50704-46_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>Finally, a series of miscellaneous provisions creates a number of new powers covering bail, legal aid in extradition, arrestable offences and information for victims. The bail adjustments will facilitate police, defendants and those standing surety and will also save court time. Additional police powers of summary arrest in certain sexual offences will bring Northern Ireland law into line with that of England and Wales. The power for the Secretary of State to create a victims&#039; information scheme in probation cases will further extend the services available to victims across the criminal justice system.
</p>

<a name="50704-46_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>In conclusion, across the order, anti-social behaviour and crime are being addressed and drink-driving powers are being extended. The criminal justice system will be made more efficient; for example, in court procedures, bail continuity and road traffic funding arrangements. Victims will have additional protections and information and defendants will have further rights of appeal and legal aid. I am pleased to bring forward these proposals. I commend them to the Committee.

<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="50704-47_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   I thank the Minister. I concede that this is a tidying up order, but it is a difficult one to handle in this way. Each one of these parts is worthy of significant debate. As I said earlier, I am never happy that the Secretary of State can add additional authorities as he wishes to anti-social behaviour orders. We have to assume that he will do the right thing, but it is a serious situation. On the other hand, I accept that other authorities possibly should have that power. When I asked the officials this morning I was encouraged to learn that that power will not be given to private sector landlords and so on. I think it is right that housing associations should have it; I think it would have been quite wrong for any parts of the private sector to have similar rights. I just wanted to note that.
</p>

<a name="50704-47_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>I understand that the provisions under prisons and the recall of life prisoners on licence and so on have no impact on anything to do with the Good Friday agreement and those who were released and who may have been re-arrested under that legislation.
</p>

<a name="50704-47_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>With regard to the transfer between young offender centres and prison, I understand that the decision is not going to be made by independent monitoring boards any more, but will be made by the authorities running the young offender centre. I do not think that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC70"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC70</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that is a very good change. It seems to me that an independent body should be involved in that. If someone has been making a serious nuisance of themselves and become unmanageable within a young offender institution, it does not seem to me that the manager of that institution should make the final decision to send the youngster off to goal or to a proper prison. After all, that decision could send the young person down a road for the rest of his life. I would have liked to have felt that there were a series of independent minds on that, and it should not be left with the management of the youth offender centre.
</p>

<a name="50704-47_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>I support youth conferencing and any legislation to include 17 year-olds. In regard to road traffic legislative changes, I also support Articles 18 and 19 and blood samples being taken under different circumstances.
</p>

<a name="50704-47_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Self-funding for speed cameras is&#151;the noble Lord will almost certainly agree with me&#151;an ongoing debate. Their success and failure, the way they are managed and the moral issues behind them, whether local authorities use them to make huge sums of money for themselves and save their ratepayers or whatever, is still very much up for grabs. I note that I have read recently in the press that some local authorities and maybe government are having second thoughts about the effectiveness of speed cameras. I read that in certain areas the death toll has gone up where there are a large number of cameras. One might ask why. I suspect that it is because people are searching for the camera and not looking at what is going on in front of their motor car. I was going to use the word &quot;ragbag&quot;, but it is not a ragbag, it is very sound legislation, which comes from all parts of the overall legislative scene in Northern Ireland. It is quite hard to take on the situation as a whole. The reference to the new legislation on victims of crime, again, is an ongoing debate in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. The victim information scheme would ensure that the victim of a crime knows as much as possible about the offender or the person who has attempted to murder them, stalk them or whatever. Any improvement on victim information has to be a good thing. In principle, I support the order, but it is very difficult to debate in the way that we are.

</p>




<p><a name="st_65"></a>
<a name="50704-47_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </b>   I, too, thank the Minister for introducing this order. Rather like the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, I believe that there are a number of things encapsulated in it. As regards the public consultation between March and June when, I understand, there were 15 responses, concerns were expressed about the legislative proposals relating to ASBOs and reservations about extending the numbers of organisations that can apply for ASBOs, particularly at a time when existing provisions are still being tested. I have a bit of <i>d&#233;j&#224; vu</i> with parts of this order, because I have a vague feeling that I have been here before when we dealt with various parts of criminal justice in England and Wales.
</p>

<a name="50704-47_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>First, I should like to make a general point about the consultation process. It would have been a great help to our deliberations if we could see the responses to the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC71"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC71</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

consultations, which the Minister can take away and consider. Even a trawl through the NIO website shows us the draft, the explanatory memorandum and a letter about the consultation, but nowhere are any of the responses. If some organisations or individuals want their responses to be confidential, obviously we could not expect them to be published. Otherwise, it would be quite useful to make them available. This is just a suggestion, but perhaps the Government could put an exact web address on the accompanying explanatory memorandum.
</p>

<a name="50704-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>As regards Articles 2 to 8, the order proposes six new provisions designed to extend and improve anti-social behaviour legislation, which mirrors that in England and Wales. Article 2 enables the Secretary of State to designate additional bodies or persons to those already listed in Article 2(3) and (4) of the Anti-social Behaviour Act. Can the Minister give us any kind of indication about what bodies or persons might be added to the list of relevant authorities or persons? Notwithstanding the Minister&#039;s very welcome views on scrutiny earlier, the issue again arises on how we legislate for Northern Ireland. Although the Secretary of State will have to lay a statutory instrument before Parliament to amend the list of relevant authorities or relevant persons, the order will be passed by a negative procedure, so the only opportunity to debate its provisions would be by praying against it. In any case, legislating in this way means that we could not amend an SI even if we wanted to. We cannot even attempt to amend this order to propose that any additions to the list come by way of an affirmative SI. Perhaps the Minister would give a commitment that the Secretary of State should consult on any additions to those lists. Full public consultation would be helpful, but, if not, perhaps the Chief Constable and local councils should be consulted on their views.
</p>

<a name="50704-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>As regards Article 6, can the Minister remind us what reporting restrictions are in place for minors? There have been concerns that by publishing the names of young people who are subject to ASBOs they may believe that it leads to a sort of hero-worship. They may be quite proud that they have been given an ASBO and consider it almost a badge of honour. Of course, it could also be detrimental, making them the target of older gangs. We are slightly concerned about that. Article 10 provides for boards of visitors for prisons and visiting committees for young offender centres and remand centres to be renamed as independent monitoring boards, which is similar to the renaming in England and Wales. Going back to the first point about consultation, was that change something that the boards of visitors and visiting committees wanted? Will the Government publicise the change so that there is not any confusion?
</p>

<a name="50704-47_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>Article 12 would remove the role of the visiting committee in reporting to the Secretary of State that a person is incorrigible or exercising undue influence over inmates. The transfer function will remain the   responsibility of the Secretary of State. Can the Minister clarify who will undertake that role if the   Board of Visitors does not do the reporting. I would be most grateful for clarification on Article 14, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC72"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC72</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which provides that information pertaining to safe deposit boxes will now have to be disclosed by persons or financial institutions when a customer information order is made in the same way that information pertaining to accounts is already required. Is the Minister trying to correct an anomaly here between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK or are there specific reasons why that is necessary for Northern Ireland?
</p>

<a name="50704-47_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>We hope that Article 15 will help in the recovery of assets from criminal activities, as the Minister mentioned when he introduced the order. That seems very sensible. Articles 16 and 17 deal with remands to custody. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, touched on this point. It will bring 17 year-olds within the remit of the youth court. In the majority of cases, those aged 17 will be committed to a young offender centre on remand. Can the Minister explain the thinking behind the decision to do that? Are more sophisticated 17 year-olds adversely influencing younger offenders in juvenile justice centres or are juvenile centres too crowded?
</p>

<a name="50704-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>Article 18 applies to specimens of blood for analysis. There will be a new summary offence of failing, without reasonable excuse, to give permission for the laboratory test of a blood specimen so taken. I may have missed the Minister&#039;s assurance on comparability with England and Wales. I cannot remember whether he said that it would be comparable. Because I am a bit out of date on those penalties, how does it compare with England and Wales?
</p>

<a name="50704-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>Finally, Articles 21 to 26 relate to the availability of legal aid for representation at proceedings under Parts 1 and 2 of the Extradition Act 2003. Article 24 deals with giving evidence by live video link from outside Northern Ireland; that does not extend to the accused and such evidence can be given before a resident magistrate as well as a judge. I am not opposed to that, but I wanted to flag up a circumstance and a sort of example. Let us say that someone was involved in drug dealing, was then forced to leave Northern Ireland because of intimidation from the paramilitaries and was subsequently arrested by the police for the drug dealing. While we are obviously not condoning the action for which such a person was rightly arrested, none of us would want a situation to arise in which someone was not afforded protection from paramilitary organisations.

<a name="50704-47_para11"></a>

<a name="50704-48_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I am grateful for the comments and general support, although I understand that it is inevitable that with a comprehensive miscellaneous order such as this one we cannot effectively do justice to all the changes.
</p>

<a name="50704-48_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>I am very upset about the issue that the noble Baroness raised on consultation. The outcome of the consultation is not yet on the website; I shall see that that is done forthwith, and apologise for that. There were 12 weeks of public consultation, although it is true that there was a low response rate, of 15 bodies. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC73"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC73</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Many of those who made substantive responses gave widespread support. Only four respondents&#151;the Human Rights Commission, the Northern Ireland Commission for Children and Young People, the Children&#039;s Law Centre and Include Youth&#151;raised the issues relating to the draft order. They concentrated, as the noble Baroness would expect, on the anti-social behaviour order legislation. The Northern Ireland Policing Board, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and the Northern Ireland Federation of Housing Associations supported the ASBO proposals. There were some objections in principle; others were minor points of detail.
</p>

<a name="50704-48_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>To be honest, such public responses&#151;because everyone is told when they give a response that it will be made public, so they had better say if they do not want to do so&#151;should be available before Parliament considers legislation. I do not know the full reason why that has not been done, but it should have been done. I believe that we are doing this order in advance of the Commons, so I hope that it can be done before MPs get to work on it, or my colleague in the other place will have a pretty rough time.
</p>

<a name="50704-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>On the proposal to extend the ASBOs to other bodies, if we go beyond the bodies such as housing associations that we have in mind and other bodies express an issue, we shall consult widely before adding other bodies to the list. I make that absolutely clear. There will be no thought of the Secretary of State simply adding bodies to the list that can go out and get an ASBO without consultation. The issue is far too sensitive to do anything other than that.
</p>

<a name="50704-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>As for speed cameras, I do not know the information. It is a very sensitive and contentious issue. I saw a headline in the paper today, about how some camera had made some council a million quid. There is a real issue here, but some of the evidence that we have says that there is a 35 per cent reduction in people being killed or injured at camera sites. The cameras are at accident spots&#151;that is where they are supposed to be. There is a 14 per cent reduction in personal injury collisions and an average reduction in speed of about 10 per cent, according to the information that I have. There is also a reduction of about two-thirds in the number of speeding vehicles. Averages are very misleading&#151;I realise that. One camera could destroy the lot in terms of averages and give a totally false impression, but those are the figures that were put before the board.
</p>

<a name="50704-48_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>On the issue of the change of name and function of prison visitors, they have lobbied for a while for that change. It has not been forced on them. The new board will have a monitoring role in what is happening, and recourse to the prison ombudsman is still available to people. The independent monitoring boards will have a monitoring role; in fact, one of the little functions that they have from the past, which has not been used since the 19th century and which we are getting rid of, is the power of the board to provide a sanction. It is not the function of the independent monitoring board to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC74"></a>

be involved in the management of offenders&#151;far from it. But they have requested that change, and we can understand the reasons why.

</p>

<a name="50704-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>On the issue of reporting restrictions and the ASBO being a badge of honour, there are no automatic reporting restrictions when an ASBO is made. The court has the discretion to impose restrictions of its own volition or on the request of the applicant or defence. Agencies applying for orders consider the issue of reporting restrictions on a case-by-case basis. To the best of my knowledge at the moment, unless it has changed over the past few days, there are only five ASBOs in force in Northern Ireland; one is on a young person and the other four are on adults. It is a small number, but it is a useful weapon&#151;I hate to use the word&#151;in the armoury to try to do something about anti-social behaviour, which is a nightmare for people. It is always difficult; I have had it myself. I wish we had had ASBOs when I was in the other place, because my constituents would have benefited greatly from them.
</p>

<a name="50704-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>Under the safe deposit boxes, Article 14, I saw a useful bit of information somewhere. My brief says, &quot;If pressed&quot;. I have not been pressed, but I gather that this is a better answer than I would have been able to give the noble Baroness. In 2004&#150;05 the Assets Recovery Agency obtained 11 customer information orders in Northern Ireland. The banks were not able to disclose as part of their compliance with those orders whether the customer had a safe deposit box. It beggars belief that we set up a very powerful body, for reasons we understand, and yet it does not have that power because the banks do not have the power to give that information. That is the reason for that measure.
</p>

<a name="50704-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>The noble Baroness asked me about giving evidence through live links. The accused would be required to return to Northern Ireland, but arrangements could be made by the Police Service of Northern Ireland for their protection, and court venues can be changed to provide greater security. Others can give evidence through television links and behind screens. Those are the possibilities.
</p>

<a name="50704-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>I apologise, because the noble Baroness raised the question about the website address on the Explanatory Memorandum. That is related to the public consultation. It should have been on there, but it is not. It shall be done forthwith, I am told&#151;I hope by the end of the day. Any chance? It had better be there before the other House deals with it.
</p>

<a name="50704-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>On the transfer of young persons to adult prisons, the governor of the young offenders&#039; centre will recommend to the Minister that an inmate could be transferred to an adult prison. The independent monitoring board will monitor such transfers; that is the reformed board of visitors. There will be an external; it will not be done in secret. The board will know what is going on. Of course, it will be able to express any concerns about the recommendations of the governor directly to the Secretary of State, who is accountable at the end of the day.

<a name="50704-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>I am happy to confirm for the noble Baroness that at present blood samples cannot be taken from people who are unconscious. There has been no evidence of support there for a drink-driving charge. I remember dealing with this. It was touched on in the then-Police Reform Bill, if I remember rightly, when I was the Home Office hack. But that is not to say that everyone who is unconscious will be tested. That is not the issue&#151;there must be reasonable grounds for testing.

<a name="50704-48_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>Under the existing arrangements in the magistrates&#039; courts, 17 year-olds requiring custody are sent to the young offenders&#039; centre where special provision is made for them.

<a name="50704-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>I have come to the end of my notes but I am not satisfied that I have answered all the noble Baroness&#039;s questions. I will read <i>Hansard</i> and cause it to be read for me. Where I have not answered the questions, I will make sure that a letter is sent to all noble Lords who have participated in the debate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_67"></a>
<a name="50704-48_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass: </b>   I apologise because I have come ill prepared, but I notice that in Article 23 (p) (5) it is now an arrestable offence to indulge in sexual activity in a public lavatory. Is that a reversal of the legislation that went through Parliament some time ago which decriminalised homosexual activity in public toilets, something that caused huge offence in Northern Ireland and probably wider than that? Is this a return to the situation that previously obtained? If so, it will be welcome.
</p>




<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="50704-48_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I hope that I can answer the noble Lord from my Q&A notes. These offences are being made arrestable to rectify an omission in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 which should have made the offences arrestable, as they are in England and Wales. When the 2003 Act was introduced, those offences were extended to Northern Ireland. The Act makes consequential amendments to Schedule 1A, which covers the specific arrestable offences of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, making such offences arrestable without warrant in England and Wales. A similar consequential amendment to the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 was overlooked at that time. I do not think that this covers the issue that the noble Lord raised. Therefore, the new offences as they apply to Northern Ireland are not arrestable without a warrant. The order provides the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC76"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column GC76</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

first opportunity to correct that situation. The notes refer to 1989. I am assuming that that is correct; 2005 is 16 years later, and I cannot believe that this is the first possibility there has been for dealing with this.
</p>

<a name="50704-48_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>These offences need to be arrestable without warrant is to enable the police to take immediate action to stop the offending behaviour and apprehend the offender. Why were these offences extended to Northern Ireland when so many were not? The answer is that Northern Ireland was not included in the review of the law which underpinned the Sexual Offences Act. Some offences were extended to allow for full operation of the notification requirements&#151;the sex offender register provisions of Part 2 of the Act.
</p>

<a name="50704-48_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>When will sex offence law in Northern Ireland be reformed? The answer is that work is ongoing and proposals will be published in due course. This is not the end of the matter.
</p>

<a name="50704-48_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>Unless I hear anything to the contrary, I do not think that what I have read out covers the issues raised by the noble Lord.

<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="50704-49_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Desai: </b>   I am sorry that I arrived late. My recollection is that the decriminalisation of the offence of cottaging, as it was called, was not extended to Northern Ireland. So I did not quite understand my noble friend&#039;s answer. I should have thought that it continued to be an arrestable offence in Northern Ireland, but I could be wrong. It is rather a murky area; it may be that propositioning was decriminalised, but the actual sexual act was not.
</p>




<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="50704-49_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I have an answer. The provisions are nothing to do with homosexual offences. They prohibit sex in public. The issues relate&#151;I can remember the debates&#151;to people challenging others for having sex in the back garden, on the lawn or in the swimming pool. The order prohibits that in public places, not only toilets. It does not mean only sex between same-sex couples, but heterosexual sex as well. The order does not cover the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, but covers the wider area dealt with by the previous legislation. So no sex in the back garden, I am afraid.

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="50704-49_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Energy (Malcolm Wicks) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="50704-49_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>The cleaner use of fossil fuels, including CO2 capture and storage and hydrogen, offer important options for the future UK and international sustainable energy mix. The project, announced by BP and its partners on 30 June, is one of a number of potential innovative project opportunities that offer the prospect of demonstrating cleaner fossil fuel technologies, driving forward the next generation of plant.

</p>

<a name="50704-49_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>The Government recognise the importance of incentives in encouraging the development of cleaner fossil fuel energy technologies. In this regard, the Government recently published their carbon abatement technologies strategy and their response to the UK hydrogen strategic framework, which involves a combined package of &#163;40 million for funding demonstrations of emerging low-carbon technologies <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS14"></a>

<b>4 Jul 2005 : Column WS14</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

including carbon abatement technologies and hydrogen and fuel cells. Further, the Government are also examining how they might support the development of carbon capture and storage in the climate change programme review, including the potential for new economic incentives. The Government will, in parallel, continue work to resolve the regulatory and legal issues related to CO2 capture and storage.

Immigration judges of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT), pursuant to Section   22 of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971, are provided with powers to release temporarily persons in detention under certain provisions of the Immigration Acts. The AIT does not categorise bail applications according to the immigration status of the individual applicants. Provisional figures show that a total of 3, 774 bail applications were promulgated by the AIT in 2004, of which 1,053 were granted. Figures on the number of asylum detainees granted bail by chief immigration officers in 2004 are not available and could only be produced at disproportionate cost, by examination of individual case files.

<p><a name="wa_st_48"></a>
<a name="50704w03_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   The Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) of October 2001 estimated that 468,563 oil storage tanks   in the commercial sector would be affected by the   Control of Pollution (Oil Storage) (England) Regulations 2001. Costs to a typical business were estimated at &#163;265 to &#163;487 and estimated costs for all sectors (commercial, industrial and institutional) discounted to 1999 prices were:


<table border=1>

</p>

<a name="50704w03_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_12"></a>The RIA did not seek to distinguish costs for the three sectors but it did make allowance for the fact that some tanks affected would already be wholly or partially compliant.
</p>

<a name="50704w03_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_13"></a>The regulations are being brought into force in three stages. The final date when all tanks must be compliant is 1 September 2005.

Deployability is determined by either the physical efficiency standard for Army or the medical employment standard for Navy and RAF.

In the RAF, of the 855 personnel permanently medically downgraded since April 2003, still serving in the RAF and still medically downgraded, some 15 are due to leave on redundancy terms. All personnel selected for redundancy are entitled to the appropriate redundancy &quot;compensation&quot;.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_37"></a>What discussions they have had with the government of Uganda about the forthcoming constitutional referendum and its openness, transparency and democratic credibility; what view they take of the reliability of the referendum; and what representations they have made about any shortcomings.

<p><a name="wa_st_72"></a>
<a name="50704w05_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   We have repeatedly underlined our support for a return to multiparty politics, and for a free and fair referendum and elections. We hold regular meetings with Ugandan Ministers to discuss the political situation, including the transition, the forthcoming referendum and the elections due next March. The high commissioner has also raised these issues with President Museveni, most recently when they met on 28 May 2005. To help ensure that the referendum and elections are properly managed we, together with other development partners in Uganda, are contributing to a basket fund to support the work of the Electoral Commission
