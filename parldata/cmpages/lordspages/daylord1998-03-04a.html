<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hogg of Cumbernauld </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80304-01_para0"></a>How many pupils in each of the past five years left full-time education in Scotland unable to read or write.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80304-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, this information is not available in the exact form requested. However, we hold information based on Scottish Qualifications Authority data on qualifications awarded and on the number of leavers who do not obtain qualifications. This provides an indication of those leavers who are unable to read or write. However, it is not possible to give a precise figure. For the session 1995-96, the percentage of school leavers who held a standard grade English award at grades 1 to 7 was 88.5 per cent. In addition, the Scottish School Leavers Survey showed that in the spring of 1995 4 per cent. of 18 to 19 year-olds had no qualifications.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hogg of Cumbernauld: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer. It has a remarkable similarity to the reply I received to a Written Question some three weeks ago. Therefore, may I commend the Government for their consistency? Does my noble friend agree that it is important to have such information? If the system fails so badly that some children leave school unable to read or write, we have a right to know how many there are. Surely, it would be in the interests of the education authorities for such details to be collected centrally. Will my noble friend ask the department to do so so that if I table the Question at the start of the new Session I shall receive the information?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, we are nothing if not consistent. I am afraid that the department has no proposals for gathering information on the precise number of school leavers who are unable to read or write. I can assure my noble friend that increasingly sophisticated screening processes and monitoring systems are in place to identify any pupils with educational problems and difficulties. There is professional back-up to deal with those cases. Where necessary, a record of needs is opened--that is the equivalent of a statement in England and Wales--and the vast majority would be identified and dealt with. It would be foolish to believe that no children slip through the net, but a sophisticated, closely woven net is in place and constant efforts are made to strengthen it.

<P>
<A NAME="80304-01_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister explain why no special measures are in place to ensure that the most fundamental skills of reading and writing are acquired by every pupil?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure why the noble Earl believes that no measures are in place to do just that. The 1996 HMI report, Standards and Quality in Scottish Schools, indicated good standards of reading in primary schools. Constant monitoring is carried out not only to identify the children who have specific educational needs and problems but to assure everyone that standards are maintained. Recently, we launched a paper setting targets and strategies to raise standards.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that focused resources should be available to deal with such a huge problem? One would then know the measure of it. Will the Minister assure the House that a system will be put in place to identify such children so that special educational resources can be made available to combat the problem?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid that I must repeat my reply, although I do not wish to waste the time of the House. Such monitoring systems are in place. The Question specifically asks how many pupils left full-time education in Scotland unable to read or write. Some may have slipped through the already closely woven net which is in place to identify the children with problems.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, if the teachers are doing their job, how is it possible for a child to pass through secondary school unable to read or write? Surely, the teachers will be marking the written work and must be able to see that the pages are blank.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, I do not wish to be too dismissive of the issue. I am not saying that anyone is leaving school unable to read or write. My noble friend's Question asked how many there are. I have said that constant monitoring takes place in schools. However, sometimes problems arise at the end of a school career when, for many reasons, children may become disturbed emotionally or in other ways and drop out of the school system. It is difficult to monitor such cases.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, at the risk of worrying the noble Baroness, perhaps I may help her. As regards collecting such statistics, is not one of the problems that many youngsters who cannot read or write have long since given up attending school? Will her department consider the reintroduction of attendance officers--they were more aptly called "whippers in"--who went out to ensure that children attended school? Local government could arrange that. Can the Minister also comment on the suggestion that central government could make attendance at school a condition of receipt of child benefit?

<P>
<A NAME="80304-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, I knew that I was right to be worried when the noble Lord said he was going to help me. Of course, he is quite right to say that some children have given up attending school by the end of their school career. In fact, that is what I was trying to point out in my previous reply. As I am sure the noble Lord is aware, the whole question of truancy is constantly being reviewed by the department. As regards the noble Lord's last point about child benefit, I am sorry but I have absolutely no comment to make in that respect.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree with me that, while reading and writing are essential skills for profoundly and severely deaf children, there is also a third one; namely, the ability to speak? As some profoundly and severely deaf children in Scotland leave their specialist schools without speech skills, can the noble Baroness assure me that she will look into the question of introducing speech therapy as an essential part of the curriculum for those children throughout their school careers?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for raising this point. In fact, during our consideration of the problem, we have found that some children have difficulty in communicating; indeed, it is not just a matter of reading and writing, as the noble Baroness so rightly says.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, if the Government really do not have these figures--it seems quite extraordinary when we consider the amount of time we have spent talking about this matter and concerning ourselves with it--can the Scottish Office refer to the voluntary organisation which attends to adult literacy which, I suspect, does have the figures?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-01_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, I hear what the noble Baroness says. However, I do not know why she finds it so extraordinary that we have not managed this in the past 10 months when it has not been done previously.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80304-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  My Lords, my honourable friend, the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning, will be announcing at 3.30 p.m. in another place that the Deputy Prime Minister has taken into account the responses to the <P>


<a name="column_1194"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1194</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consultation on planning policy on opencast coal conducted last year, and the announcement last December by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister of a full review of energy policy. In consultation with his colleagues he has concluded that there should be a full review of Minerals Planning Guidance Note 3 on coal mining and colliery spoil disposal. This will run in conjunction with the present review of energy policy, and will take into account its conclusions. The energy policy will, in turn, take into account the planning issues raised by coal extraction, including the issues on opencast coal dealt with in the 1997 consultation paper.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-01_spnew17"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Durham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that reply, especially as she has been able to take advantage of the extraordinary coincidence of a government announcement in another place and the tabling of this Question today. However, can the noble Baroness assure the House that the Government's guidelines to the mineral planning authorities will be consistent with their 10-point plan (which they published when in opposition) which stated, among other things, that opencast mining is one of the most environmentally destructive things in the United Kingdom?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the consultation which took place last July showed the Government's commitment to early action and our recognition of the environmental issues which are involved in opencast mining. However, we believe that it is necessary to look at these issues in the round and that we could not approach the problem properly unless we took into account the outcome of the Government's review on energy policy. We believe that the guidance we shall eventually be able to give to mineral planning authorities will be the better and the fuller because of that approach.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dormand of Easington: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend the Minister aware that the problem raised by the right reverend Prelate is a real one? However, is she also aware that it is only one of a number of such problems now facing the opencast mining industry? One of those other problems is the position of deep mined coal. Has my noble friend seen a report published last week by Reading University which emphasises not only the need for deep mined coal--coal in the round--but also that it is particularly necessary to have a supply of such coal during the next few years? Having regard to employment in the coal-mining industry, which is by no means dead, does my noble friend accept that I absolutely agree that the full review that she has mentioned must take place?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for that support for a full review. It is certainly a relevant consideration that opencast coal is at present a significant source of fuel in the UK energy market; about 16 million tonnes a year compared to 33 million tonnes from deep mines. This is a factor that the energy <P>


<a name="column_1195"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1195</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>review has to take account of in looking at future energy policies and markets for coal. We in the department are concerned that the land use planning considerations arising from coal extraction will be fully considered in the energy review.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Islwyn: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recognise that opencast mining invariably takes place in areas that have had deep mining over the generations? Does she realise that opencast mining has a major detrimental effect on the environment? Does she not feel that priority should now be given to improving the environment in these coal-mining communities, which have suffered so much for so long from the ravages of deep mining?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of those strong concerns about environmental effects. We have to consider sustainable development. Social and community issues also have to be considered, not simply the balance between the economic and the environmental issues. When we published our consultation on a sustainable development strategy on 4th February we recognised that we had to take account of that wider balance. I am sure that is the right approach for the former coal mining areas.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that during my period at the Coal Board opencast mining was regarded as supplementary to deep mining and not a replacement of it? Can we be assured that that policy will be continued by the Government in their forthcoming review?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord's comments show exactly why we need a thorough review of energy policy which considers exactly that balance between opencast and deep mined coal and between coal and other forms of energy.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Seccombe: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister's reply include Scotland? When will we hear more from her right honourable friend about the new policy as regards planning and brownfield sites?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I believe I gave a comprehensive answer as regards planning and brownfield sites and the work that is being taken forward by the task force, chaired by my noble friend Lord Rogers of Riverside, which considers the availability of brownfield sites, when I made a Statement in this House only two weeks ago. As regards Scotland, separate consultation exercises were carried out in England, Scotland and Wales last year on the review of opencast coal planning policy reflecting the different circumstances in each country. The announcement that my honourable friend is to make in another place today relates solely to conclusions in relation to England. My right honourable friends the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales are considering the best way to proceed in the light of responses to their respective consultation exercises.

<A NAME="80304-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80304-02_para0"></a>Whether they will grant an exemption from the review of energy sources for power stations to the Shotton combined heat and power station.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80304-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has said that she will be prepared to consider reasoned requests for exceptions to be made. These will be considered on their merits and she will bear in mind the environmental and other benefits of combined heat and power. A case has been made by Eastern Generation for the Shotton project to be an exception because of these factors. I can confirm that as a result the application is under active consideration.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that encouraging reply. But is he not concerned, as I am, that an excellent scheme such as this is being held up by this review? I am sure he is aware that the scheme was specially designed for Shotton Paper, one of our major newsprint manufacturers and a heavy energy user, and will assist the company in its international competitiveness as well as bringing obvious environmental benefits. In view of all that and the case for the scheme, will the noble Lord do his utmost to expedite the exemption and let the scheme be carried out?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, certainly it is a good application, and that is why it is being actively considered. The current situation is that there is a local environmental issue raised by Ellesmere Port and Neston Borough Council; namely, whether the mound on which the proposed station is to be built can be reduced. A study has been carried out and the position as of this morning is that the relevant officials are urgently trying to set up a site visit with the DTI, the Environment Agency and other people involved to discuss the relevant problems. If the purpose of the noble Lord's Question is to place this application under the spotlight, I can assure him that the intention is that this visit will take place within days, not weeks or months.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, is not the Shotton scheme one that should be held up as an example? If the Government are really keen on expanding the use of combined heat and power, this scheme, which has more than 70 per cent. efficiency and which will replace the burning of heavy fuel oil, is the type of scheme to go for. Therefore, far from being held up in any way--which I hope will not be the case--it should be brought into operation and developed as a model for others to follow.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, it is certainly a good scheme. However, there is a statutory process for assessing what are called Section 36 applications, as the noble Lord well knows. This process is being completed as quickly as possible.

<A NAME="80304-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that Neston and Ellesmere Port are in England, and that this application has the full support of the Welsh Development Agency and Flintshire County Council? Shotton has suffered terribly from unemployment in the past. Special regard should be given to the feelings of people in that locality that no jobs should be lost as a result of delay.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, that is certainly taken into account. That is why my noble friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is trying to speed up this application as much as possible.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that, for those of us who are concerned about sustainable development, this scheme from Shotton Paper and Eastern Generation appears to be a prime example of that very attitude towards environmental and energy management? Does he accept that Shotton Paper has invested substantially not only in production in North Wales, but also in the forestry industry, and that we have a fine example in mid and North Wales of sustainable forestry by that company? Will the Minister also take that into consideration and the fact that the whole cycle of energy production undertaken by the company is a positive one?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, it is certainly an admirable scheme. As I say, that is why the Government are taking it seriously.

I have here a list of 13 combined heat and power stations which may be threatened by the moratorium. Rather than recite the list, I hope I may send it to the noble Lord. Will he comment on the future of each station in writing and possibly place a copy of his reply in the Library? Will he also confirm that the British Sugar combined heat and power station at Bury St. Edmunds has just been given the go-ahead?

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80304-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Privy Seal   (Lord Richard): </B>  My Lords, it is unquestionable that this House plays an important and valuable role as a revising chamber and makes an important contribution to the legislative and political process. We envisage that this will continue after reform.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord the Lord Privy Seal aware that the Government are giving the impression that they have embarked upon a journey with little idea of their destination? The Lord Privy Seal's Answer today reinforces that. In order to dispel this unfortunate impression, would it not be better for the Government to publish a preliminary paper on the possible enlarged function of this House in the future? That surely will govern how the House is to be constituted. Alternatively, are we to look forward to a future where this House as a second Chamber will depend entirely on patronage?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, the answer to the noble Lord's last point is no. One should not look forward to a future where this House will depend upon patronage. I am happy to tell the noble Lord that the Labour Party manifesto was distinctly clear on the subject.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para1"></a>As regards the remainder of his questions, I do not think that we are on a blind journey. The Government are considering all the options, as one would expect a responsible government to do. When we have considered the options, we shall publish our conclusions. I hope that there will then be ample opportunity for public consultation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-03_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the last statement by the noble Lord the Leader of the House. I do not think that it was of great surprise to anyone who has followed his remarks in the past on this important question. However, he knows, as does the House, that the history of the reform of your Lordships' House has always foundered on the difficulty of deciding the form of stage two of the reform after the abolition of the rights of hereditary Peers. That is the easy part and constitutes stage one. Can the noble Lord the Leader of the House agree that the best guarantee of achieving the objective he has enunciated today is for any reform to take place simultaneously: that is, stage two simultaneously with stage one? We all recognise the temptation for any powerful government, in particular a powerful Prime Minister, to ride roughshod over the legitimate concerns of specific interest groups because <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, the picture that the noble Viscount paints of this poor, defenceless House in which about 500 Conservative Peers shrink in the face of a Government who have a majority in the other place is somewhat fanciful.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para2"></a>I am delighted to welcome the noble Viscount's statement that the abolition of the hereditary Peers' right to sit and vote is easy. It will be easy if the Opposition accept that in principle.

Is he further aware that on present form and indications it is likely that your Lordships' House will be in existence long after the European Union?

Speaking for myself, I find it inconceivable that any government even, if I may say so, one composed of representatives of the noble Earl's party, would wish to remove that part from our constitution.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Chalfont: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Lord the Lord Privy Seal at least say whether the Government expect to publish their views or intentions on the future composition of this House in the long term before any legislation is introduced into Parliament concerning the status of hereditary Peers?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I repeat what I said. The way in which the Government are approaching the issue is set out in the Labour Party manifesto which I have <P>

<P>
<A NAME="80304-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank: </B>   My Lords, I hope that the noble Lord the Lord Privy Seal will appreciate that he cannot rely for ever upon the terms of the Labour Party manifesto. Your Lordships' House will expect to see a development of those ideas very soon. Not all of us share the argument that stage one must be accompanied by stage two. However, my noble friend Lord Hooson made an important point which I hope the noble Lord the Lord Privy Seal will accept. When we have stage one--and the sooner the better; I hope preceded by a Green Paper for full discussion in this House at least before the Summer Recess--the Government must clearly point to the direction of stage two. It would be inadequate to go through the first stage of reform without knowing what the final destination might be.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I am well aware that that is the view held by the noble Lord and his party--indeed, it is a view which I have heard often expressed.

<A NAME="80304-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Taylor of Gryfe: </B>   My Lords, the Question refers to constitutional changes. Can I direct the Minister's attention to the major constitutional change that will take place in May of next year? Is my noble friend aware that from that date Scottish Questions will no longer be in order in the House of Commons? Can we have some assurance that similar strictures will not be applied in the House of Lords in these new constitutional arrangements?
<P>

<A NAME="80304-03_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor   (Lord Irvine of Lairg): </B>  My Lords, with the leave of the House I should like to make a Statement on improving access to justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para4"></a>At present the legal aid system is failing us all. It is failing the many millions of people on modest incomes who do not qualify for legal aid and who simply cannot contemplate going to law because of the potential legal costs if they lose. It is failing people on legal aid, because the Government cannot direct money to those who need it most and to those cases where there is a public interest in seeing justice done. Finally, it is failing the taxpayer who year on year is being asked to pay more and more, and yet can rarely get help from legal aid when it is actually needed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para5"></a>But even though legal aid is costing us all more and more with costs running away ahead of inflation, it is helping fewer and fewer people each year. It is, therefore, our intention to modernise the way in which civil cases are paid for. We want a system of civil justice <P>


<a name="column_1201"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1201</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which is there for everyone when they need it, not just for the rich or for the very poor. We intend to transform the legal aid scheme so that we ensure we get good value for money from those lawyers who are paid from legal aid; and so that we spend taxpayers' money on those who need it most and on those areas where it can do most good.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para6"></a>Achieving all of our reforms will require the approval of Parliament through new primary legislation. But even using existing powers we can start the process of change. It is this first stage that I wish to concentrate on today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para7"></a>The publication of this consultation paper marks the first stage of our modernisation of legal aid and legal services. When I announced the programme of reform at the Solicitors Annual Conference in October last year I said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> "it is essential that the details [of our proposals] are right ... We shall be consulting widely and openly". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para8"></a>That is precisely what we have been doing in the four months since October and will continue to do for a further two months of the formal consultation period. This is a listening Government and we are listening to views on these proposals--and we will continue to do so. We have had detailed discussions with the legal profession and with many interest groups. More are planned. Their comments have contributed to the development of these proposals. But we will not confine our listening to the legal profession, because our aim is justice for all.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para9"></a>The consultation paper invites views on a proposal that will allow the majority of people in England and Wales to secure access to justice. We propose to allow conditional fee agreements (no win no fee agreements) to be used in all except family and criminal cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para10"></a>Conditional fees offer a new way for people to bring their cases. Lawyers share the risk of litigation with the client by agreeing to work without a fee if the case is lost. If the lawyer is successful he or she is entitled to claim a success fee in addition to his normal fees. Although the maximum success fee can be up to 100 per cent., normally it is 50 per cent. or less. In nearly all cases the lawyers also voluntarily limit the success fee to no more than 25 per cent. of the damages in any event. Conditional fees have been available since 1995 for a limited range of proceedings--personal injury, insolvency and human rights cases and they are working well.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para11"></a>Over 30,000 people have taken advantage of this approach to bring personal injury claims. Many of them would have been unable to afford to pursue their claims at all without conditional fees--people only just above the legal aid limit, people who are far from well off. They are the great majority of the population who are in work--with families, mortgages, savings, or other assets, which mean that they are not eligible for legal aid, but who cannot contemplate the open-ended <P>


<a name="column_1202"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1202</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>commitment of meeting lawyers' bills. Only the very rich can face the thought of lawyers' bills without any financial fears and even they must worry sometimes. To continue to restrict narrowly the use of these agreements is to deny an avenue of access to justice to the majority of the people in the country.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para12"></a>The consultation paper also seeks views on any changes to the current law and practice that might improve the operation and use of conditional fees, for example by allowing the success fee and the insurance premium to be recoverable from the losing party.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para13"></a>Secondly, the paper invites views on the Government's plans to begin modernising legal aid. Over the past seven years, the cost of civil and family legal aid has tripled to &#163;671 million. The average cost has grown from &#163;1,442 to &#163;2,684--53 per cent. above inflation. The number of acts of help funded in 1996-97 fell by about 39,000. Taxpayers are paying more and getting less. That cannot be right and it cannot continue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para14"></a>We need a modern legal aid system in which only cases which cannot reasonably be funded in any other way and which have the necessary priority are backed by the taxpayer. It has never been our intention to abolish civil legal aid, as has been wrongly claimed. We want to focus taxpayers' money where it is most needed and can do most good: on social welfare matters--employment; housing; debt; state benefits; and actions against officialdom and bureaucracy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para15"></a>To achieve this clear focus on social welfare issues, the Government therefore intend that, in future, most money or damages claims will be funded through conditional fees. Consequently, they propose to transfer most money and damages claims currently supported by legal aid to conditional fees.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para16"></a>However, as I told the House on 9th December, we do not intend to remove legal aid from housing cases where very often the main purpose of the action is to achieve a home fit to live in. That is precisely the kind of area to which legal aid ought to be directed. In addition, the ability to challenge public authorities through judicial review is a necessary check on the use of the power of the state, and a positive encouragement to maintain high standards in public administration or by public bodies. The poor must also be able to exercise this right of challenge. Legal aid will remain available for those who qualify. We also believe that legal aid must continue to be available where a person claims to be the victim of wrongdoing by public authorities; for example, the police. Here too, the ability to challenge misdeeds is an encouragement to maintain high standards and proper behaviour to those over whom public bodies exercise authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para17"></a>The extension of the availability of conditional fee agreements will provide an alternative means for people to bring most money or damages claims without public funding. Our aim is to create the conditions in which anyone can use conditional fees to bring cases, regardless of their financial status, across the whole range of litigation in which money or damages are the main remedy sought. However, we recognise that <P>


<a name="column_1203"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1203</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>solicitors' firms may not presently be financially structured to do this, and that the insurance and finance industry needs time to develop products to assist in the expansion of the use of conditional fee agreements. The Government, therefore, propose a measured approach to encouraging this change to take place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para18"></a>The Government propose to remove from the scope of legal aid most personal injury actions by the middle of this year. Lawyers working in this area have considerable experience in taking cases using conditional fees. Similarly, the insurance industry has developed products with premiums which in most cases are &#163;155 or less. The Government will be working with the insurance and banking industries to help them develop more and still better products to allow everyone, regardless of their financial standing, to bring cases using conditional fees. This combination of the experience of lawyers in this area of litigation together with developed insurance products is sufficient to allow these cases to be alternatively financed through conditional fee agreements.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para19"></a>In addition, there are certain categories of proceedings which the Government believe no longer have sufficient priority to command continued public funding. It is important that scarce public funds are directed to where help is most needed. The Government are not persuaded that cases which involve, for example, disputes arising from running a business, inheritance, partnerships or trusts meet this criterion. Nor do they believe that taxpayers' money should be used to help neighbouring landowners to settle disagreements over disputed boundaries. In these cases there will be assets at issue which would allow the case to be taken with a conditional fee arrangement. In any case, the issues will generally be too narrow or too specific to deserve the use of public money, when such support means less for other matters of greater public importance. The consultation paper seeks views on the proposals to remove these categories from the scope of legal aid.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para20"></a>The Government have been listening carefully to the comments we have received in relation to medical negligence cases. The Government believe that many lawyers practising in this area need to modernise the way they run their firms, so that they can structure their finances to enable them to take cases on behalf of clients regardless of their financial standing. We accept, however, that this will take time. The Government do not, therefore, propose to remove these cases from the scope of legal aid for the present.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para21"></a>We do, however, intend to do what we can to reduce the high failure rate of these cases. It cannot be right that it is only in as few as 17 per cent. of all the cases that are supported by a legal aid certificate that more than &#163;50 is recovered in damages. Medical negligence cases should be conducted by practitioners who are experienced in this field of litigation. We cannot any longer allow inexperienced practitioners to take cases. I have no doubt that part of the reason that the failure rate is so high is that lawyers take these cases on without the necessary experience. They are, therefore, unable to <P>


<a name="column_1204"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1204</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>make timely, informed decisions on the merits of a case or whether an offer of settlement is appropriate or reasonable in amount.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para22"></a>It serves no one's interests if cases are brought with little prospect of success--least of all the victims of the alleged negligence. The consultation paper therefore invites views on a proposal to allow only experienced practitioners to be able to take cases on behalf of assisted persons in this field. We propose that the Legal Aid Board should establish contracts only with lawyers of sufficient experience. Anyone who is granted legal aid to pursue a medical negligence case will be required to use a lawyer who holds a contract with the board. We are keen to hear what criteria could be used to establish whether a lawyer is sufficiently experienced to hold a contract to take cases on behalf of those receiving legal aid.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para23"></a>We intend to remove the remaining money or damages claims from the scope of legal aid as experience of conditional fees among lawyers and insurers develops and they become more widely and readily available.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para24"></a>The Government recognise that help will be needed during a transitional period to assist in the change of funding away from legal aid. There may be some extraordinary cases among those categories to be removed which the lawyers may not initially be able to fully support on conditional fees. In time, the Government believe that these cases will be able to be financed solely through conditional fees. Therefore, the Government intend to establish a limited transitional fund. This fund would provide support in cases, for example, where presently few lawyers' firms are structured financially to carry a very high costs case, because they could not afford the risks of losing, or where there are high investigative costs of establishing the merits of the case. We would expect that the need for the fund to support this kind of case will cease because in the long term the Government believe these cases will find lawyers who are financially structured to take them on under conditional fee agreements. The transitional fund would also provide help in those cases which we exclude from legal aid which demonstrate a significant wider public interest. This would allow us to begin to provide assistance in this kind of case under the transitional arrangements ahead of primary legislation to establish a public interest fund. The size of the transitional fund will be set each year according to other priorities for spending legal aid money and the diminishing extent to which the fund is needed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para25"></a>The Government will develop a modernised legal aid system. We are working towards a system in which we can control expenditure; obtain good value for public money; and target legal aid where there is the greatest need and it will do most good. In future, the Government's main priority for using public money to provide legal services will be to assist those who are excluded from society because they are unable to exercise their legal rights. The Government will achieve this through the legal aid scheme and through the creation of a community legal service.

<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para26"></a>This consultation paper sets out the steps towards that goal which can be taken now. By making conditional fee agreements more widely available, targeting civil legal aid on social welfare matters and creating a special fund for public interest cases what we propose will significantly widen access to justice. We welcome responses on the consultation paper and will consider them carefully before we arrive at considered decisions on specific proposals to bring before Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para27"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_time2"></A><H5>3.24 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I offer my thanks to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor for coming to the House to make this important Statement on legal aid. I offer my apologies to the noble and learned Lord for the fact that it is I who is responding to the Statement rather than my noble friend Lord Kingsland, who is, I think all will agree, better versed to make such a response. My noble friend is, sadly, detained in court today--whether in receipt of legal aid, I do not know.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para28"></a>We share the concerns expressed by the noble and learned Lord about the ever-rising cost of legal aid. We also accept the point he made in the debate on 9th December, that any review of these matters should not be Treasury-led, as I believe he put it on that occasion, though I believe he would accept that when costs are rising in such a manner the Treasury has a perfectly legitimate interest in the size of the bill that the taxpayer is asked to meet.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para29"></a>Turning to the Statement itself, I believe that the noble and learned Lord will recognise that it was his predecessor, my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern, who introduced the concept of "no-win, no-fee"--conditional fee--agreements to increase access to justice, but did so by making it an add-on to the legal aid system. What the noble and learned Lord proposes is different. I would argue that, in proposing conditional fees agreements for personal injury cases, other than medical negligence cases, he is missing the point. Will he confirm that the overall legal aid costs are around &#163;1.6 billion gross, which I understand is &#163;760 million net? Is it not the case that the great bulk of those costs are incurred on criminal and matrimonial legal aid and immigration and that personal injury is the one area of legal aid which is largely self-financing? Can the noble and learned Lord say what the net costs would be without the medical negligence cases?
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para30"></a>Is it not the fact, that if civil legal aid is withdrawn from personal injury cases and replaced by no-win, no-fee agreements, little, if any, money will be saved and a complex system will result which will damage the poorest litigants, with little benefit to anyone else?
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para31"></a>Litigants will meet an elaborate system involving insurance against costs. We heard the noble and learned Lord talk about the insurance industry developing packages costing at most &#163;155. I imagine that that figure would be greeted with a degree of cynicism by a great many people in that field. If a system is developed which involves insurance against costs in cases which do not succeed, and a reduction in damages, will not the <P>


<a name="column_1206"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1206</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>poorer litigants, those who would not receive legal aid, be worse off and have less access to the courts? How much does the noble and learned Lord estimate the reductions will be? Will they not be significant, particularly in the more complex personal injury cases, where damages are badly needed?
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para32"></a>I wish to put a number of other points to the noble and learned Lord on which I should be grateful for a response. The first relates to his comments about medical negligence. I wonder whether the noble and learned Lord could say a little more about the system that he proposes for licensing practitioners. It seems rather odd. In his Statement he refers to the fact that as few as 17 per cent. of all cases supported by a legal aid certificate recover more than &#163;50 in damages, which he thinks is largely a result of cases being pursued by practitioners with insufficient experience. I should be grateful to know what evidence there is for that statement and what evidence exists to suggest that better figures would be produced if practitioners were licensed by the Legal Aid Board and were therefore more experienced.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para33"></a>My second point relates to some remarks made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in the debate on 9th December when they referred to what I understand is described as CLAF, the Contingency Legal Aid Fund. The noble and learned Lord makes no reference to those suggestions. I do not think I need to go into detail here because they are dealt with in considerable detail by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in that debate. The noble and learned Lord makes no mention of them in his Statement. Whether they are dealt with in the consultation paper I do not know because obviously I have not had it long enough to have studied it. But I know that the Bar Council has put further submissions relating to CLAF to the noble and learned Lord. I would be very interested to hear what his considerations are and what his conclusions are likely to be.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para34"></a>The final point I wish to make relates to timing. The noble and learned Lord referred to a consultation lasting some two months. The consultation paper itself refers to a consultation that ends towards the end of April, a little short of two months but very nearly two months.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para35"></a>Can the noble and learned Lord give us an assurance that we will at some point during the course of that two months, or possibly later on, have a full-scale debate in this House on these issues? They are very important issues, as the noble and learned Lord will discover during the course of the brief debate on this Statement. They are issues that need to be addressed in full by the House. I would be most grateful if he could seek through consultations with the usual channels an assurance that these matters will be given full debate at the appropriate time.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-03_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the much less precipitate approach to change that this Statement suggests and that the April date for the commencement of these changes, which was initially announced by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, has now been pushed back.
<P>


<a name="column_1207"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1207</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para36"></a>We also welcome the absence in the Statement of controversial and dubious rhetoric about overpaid legal aid practitioners. These proposals either stand on their merits or they do not. The absence of that rhetoric means that the noble and learned Lord can expect much greater co-operation in consultation with the legal profession.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para37"></a>We are also glad to note that the 75 per cent. merits test has been dropped and does not appear in the Statement or the accompanying document. As we said in the debate on 9th December, it is meaningless to aim at a particular percentage of risk. The percentage has now been replaced by the phrase "strong prospects of success". That is a much more acceptable way of approaching the difficulty that practitioners feel in this area. The practitioner, after all, is faced with an inchoate series of facts by his client upon which he has to put some sort of legal form and decide the proper route to pursue. From his own experience he will get a feel as to whether the ultimate outcome will be successful, but his appreciation of the chances of success will vary as documents are disclosed, reports are revealed and witness statements come forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para38"></a>Legal aid has been phased so that conditional certificates are granted first of all, and the various stages of the action do not usually take place until counsel's opinion has been obtained to ensure that the prospects of success are still there. One of the problems of conditional fee agreements is that presumably, once one enters into a conditional fee agreement at the beginning, there is no subsequent point at which one can assess the way in which the case will go.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para39"></a>We also welcome the retention of legal aid in medical negligence cases. I suspect that that is a response to the problems that arise from the cost of initial disbursements for medical experts and the high risk of those cases. It may be that insurance cover is not available or is completely unaffordable. The 17 per cent. success rate to which the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor referred in his Statement should not be thought to reflect upon inadequate advice or inexperience.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para40"></a>These are very difficult cases where, at the present time, the boundaries of liability are being pushed forward. It is very much the case that there are competing views as to whether there has been negligence in this type of case. It is only in this field that the noble and learned Lord has referred to block contracts. I would be glad to know whether he is now saying that block contracts are not suggested as the way to proceed in any other type of personal injury case. The problem with block contracts is that representation is confined to a number of firms. That means that there is liable to grow up a very narrow and tight industry in which there are professional witnesses on both sides appearing in case after case against each other. That cannot be in the interests of the public in the long term.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para41"></a>The retention of legal aid in housing and social welfare cases is also welcome, but what about the public interest cases to which the noble and learned Lord referred on 9th December, in particular issues arising under the Human Rights Act and multi-party actions <P>


<a name="column_1208"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1208</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>where a large number of people are damaged in drug-related disasters? Is there any prospect that public interest cases of this sort will be funded by legal aid regardless of the injured person's level of income?
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para42"></a>So far as concerns housing, a query still remains. It is not much good giving legal aid in housing cases if the small claims limit for housing cases is to be raised from the present &#163;3,000 to &#163;5,000. That means to say that there is no legal representation available if there is a claim that is below that &#163;5,000 limit. The vast majority of cases are below that &#163;5,000 limit. I hope the noble and learned Lord will take into account the representations made to him by practitioners in this field that the limit should be reduced from the current &#163;3,000 in small claims cases to &#163;1,000 so that there can be support for the poorest people who need representation to deal with issues such as enforcing landlords' obligations to repair, and resisting eviction proceedings or damages in housing cases. These are the people who are the most disadvantaged by poor literacy, very often poor English, and sometimes ill-health and mental health problems. For them, the small claims procedure, in which they must present their own case, is far more daunting than for middle income litigants.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para43"></a>Legal aid in personal injury cases, paid for by ordinary people out of taxation, redresses the balance between the most vulnerable groups in society and the insurance companies who are themselves funded by insurance premiums paid by ordinary people. Taxation is one way of getting money, but premiums paid to insurance companies who are on the other side is another. The ordinary people pay for insurance companies to defend to the utmost degree the cases that are brought against them. Conditional fee agreements do have their drawbacks. I would ask the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor what research has been carried out on the out-turn of conditional fee agreements since their inception in 1995. I know of only one firm which has evaluated conditional fee agreements. Of the 450 conditional fee agreements into which it entered it found them to be only marginally profitable. A small firm is liable to be very considerably disadvantaged if conditional fee agreements become the main way in which personal injury cases are brought. That means that those numbers of people, particularly in the areas that I know in Wales, will be very considerably disadvantaged if there is no local firm of solicitors able to take their case.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para44"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Henley, referred to the fact that there is no mention in the Statement, nor so far as I can see in its accompanying document, to the Contingency Legal Aid Fund proposals that the Bar Council has put forward in its report, Access to Justice. It may that the Government remain unpersuaded on that, but I can give the noble Lord, Lord Henley, notice of a debate. I have an Unstarred Question down for next Monday during which I will be going into that subject in some detail. I shall leave further queries on that matter until then, when I hope to see the noble Lord, Lord Henley.

It is not intended, as a result of these changes, either to increase or decrease expenditure on legal aid in real terms; so the object of conditional fees is not to provide savings to the legal aid fund but to focus limited resources on those most in need in the areas of social welfare law. It is estimated that with the extension of conditional fees the following amounts will become available to concentrate on social welfare cases: in 1999-2000, &#163;69 million; and in 2000-2001, &#163;100 million.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para45"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Henley, mentioned personal injury cases. What he must remember is that the eligibility limits are such that the vast majority of people in this country do not qualify for legal aid in respect of personal injury cases. The principal benefit which will flow from conditional fee agreements is the expansion of access to justice which they will bring. I understand that later today the biggest personal injury firm in the country is to make a statement to the effect that, having considered the Government's proposals, it judges that it will significantly expand access to justice and hopes that it will be supported in the interests of the public. I, too, hope that it will not be undermined because of a reluctance on the part of the profession to change.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para46"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Henley, asked about medical negligence cases. A 17 per cent. success rate in cases that go to trial is a very, very poor success rate. What it suggests is that legal aid is being granted in too many cases which are too weak to go forward. The likely reason for this abnormally low success rate is that lawyers of insufficient experience are undertaking these cases. That is why the Legal Aid Board should contract for the expenditure of public money with those of proven expertise in this field. I do not think one does any favours to those who have suffered severe injury for medical negligence, if their case is weak, to drag them through the courts for disappointment at the end of the day. Litigation that fails is a very traumatic experience for those who are involved in it. It is the fact that legal aid is currently being used to support cases which should not go forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para47"></a>After I made my Cardiff speech, if I may be a little anecdotal--I know the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, will permit me to refer to the Principality-- I heard on the radio a solicitor from the Principality complaining about my proposals, which I had presented in outline. He said that he was very, very experienced in medical negligence cases, that he had brought many of them, that they almost always failed and that he could not possibly have brought them unless backed by legal aid. He was very frank, but that is the point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para48"></a>I was asked about a conditional legal aid fund. We will be consulting on it and the consultation paper will deal with it. We envisage the possibility, and will consult on the possibility, of even taking powers to that effect. But I remain very sceptical about a conditional legal aid fund for this reason. I think the inevitable tendency would be for the profession to cream off the strong cases under conditional fee agreements and leave the weak cases for a conditional legal aid fund. I require persuasion that a <P>


<a name="column_1210"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1210</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>conditional legal aid fund could work without outlawing conditional fee agreements, which I do not think anyone is proposing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para49"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, asked about the 75 per cent. merits test having been dropped. He is right, of course, that to specify an absolute figure is very difficult. He will, from his great experience, be the first to know that lawyers frequently advise without quantifying the prospects of success. They do not actually commit themselves to a prediction. I remain unrepentantly of the view that only really strong cases should go forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-03_para50"></a>I also submit that contracting is the way forward, and contracting at fixed prices. Contracting is a means of guaranteeing quality assurance. I can assure your Lordships that nothing would concentrate the mind of a lawyer more wonderfully than if he had to contract at a fixed price. Any incentive to delay, any incentive to spin out a case, since paid on a time basis, would be gone.

<A NAME="80304-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may ask the noble and learned Lord one question which relates to medical negligence cases. He referred to the 17 per cent. success rate at trial. My experience--and I did a fair amount of medical negligence cases during my career at the Bar--was that most of them settled. Does he have the statistics for cases that were started off under legal aid and were successful to the extent that they were settled? My experience from appearing for defendants was that one really fought the case if one was fairly certain of success. There is a difference between the cases that are started off and settled and those that are eventually fought. I have no idea what the statistics are, but I would be interested to know.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980304/text/80304-04.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I do not believe that such statistics exist. On the other hand, I would be ready to accept that a 17 per cent. failure rate at trial says nothing at all about cases which succeed in the sense of leading to a satisfactory settlement. However, if the noble Lord is right, on the basis of his experience, that a very high proportion of these cases settle because they are strong, that adds to the argument that they will in due time prove suitable for conditional fee agreements. But one cannot be complacent about a statistic for cases that go to trial when only 17 per cent. succeed because, again as the noble Lord will know from his experience, the really heavy costs of litigation arise out of protracted trials.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, before asking my noble and learned friend one simple question, might I remind him of the following matters? The first is from the Labour Party's proposal at the 1995 conference with regard to access to justice. The quite short quotation reads,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We regard conditional fees as an experiment to be monitored closely, and in the light of the Scottish experience, do not expect their introduction to make a significant improvement to access to justice. They are, at present, little more than a gimmick designed to mask the chaotic state of the legal aid scheme and the court service". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para0"></a>The next short matter to which I ask the noble and learned Lord to apply his attention is again in 1995 when his own advisory committee impressed on him that in view of the novelty and potential risk to the litigant inherent in setting <P>


<a name="column_1211"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1211</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>up conditional fee agreements, there must be effective monitoring of the results and that the committee did not believe that monitoring would be effective if it had to rely on a sample that might well be unrepresentative.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para1"></a>The third and penultimate matter is that there was commissioned, as your Lordships may recall, a very small sampling by the Policy Studies Institute. In its report it said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"However, on the basis of the evidence so far available, there is potentially cause for serious concern about the way risk is being assessed and uplift calculated [and that] this could cast doubt over the fairness of the entire scheme". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para2"></a>The last matter before I come to the question--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the noble and learned Lord will allow me to observe that there is very limited time. There should be very brief questions or comments to allow as many speakers as possible.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, this is very brief and I have only one question. The last matter to which I refer is an Answer by my noble and learned friend as recently as 18th February to a Question for Written Answer which I asked him about monitoring. The Written Answer states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the five months since the Policy Studies Institute report was published, I have not commissioned further research on the practice of conditional fees ... the Policy Studies Institute report concluded that many of the potential problems identified with conditional fees before they were introduced appear to have been successfully addressed. I accept that further research, at the appropriate time, may be necessary and I plan to seek views on what further research might prove useful in the consultation paper".--[Official Report, 18/2/98; col. WA 49.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para3"></a>My short question, in the light of that preparatory material, is this. Can my noble and learned friend agree that as matters now stand we do not know enough about the manner in which conditional fee agreements are operating to switch to a system for which they are primarily a means of funding litigation?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-04_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, out of consideration for other noble Lords who desire to ask questions in the limited time available, I shall attempt to make a brief answer. In the PSI research to which the noble and learned Lord referred, there was certainly some concern about the ability of solicitors to assess risk. But the report also said in terms that many of the potential problems identified before conditional fees were introduced seem to have been successfully addressed. In most cases the uplift was under 50 per cent.--I believe that the average which emerged was 43 per cent.--and far less than the 100 per cent. maximum that is allowed. So that the overall picture that emerges is that the scheme seems to be working as intended.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para4"></a>I want to make a short point. As long as the availability of conditional fees remains limited, a very large number of people are, in practice, denied access to the courts. All the available evidence suggests that while there may be some areas where more research may be necessary, conditional fees are working as intended and clients are not being charged exorbitant sums. We have no evidence whatsoever in my department and none is reported by the Law Society, that clients are dissatisfied with the <P>


<a name="column_1212"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1212</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>agreements that they have entered into. On the contrary, all the requests to my department have been to extend conditional fees.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I ask the noble and learned Lord one question on a point of clarification. What has happened about the proposals of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, which were put forward by the Bar Council? Can the noble and learned Lord deal with that?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-04_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, that is the CLA that I have already referred to. I have myself met personally with the Bar and discussed it with them. I have already expressed my reservations about it. However, in the consultation paper, which this Statement presages, we are consulting on it further.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   My Lords, as I may ask only a short question I shall resist making a lengthy statement about the excellence of the Statement made by my noble and learned friend, especially on the changes that have been announced towards a measured approach. My question concerns what were referred to, if I remember correctly, as "financially well-structured lawyers" and "experienced lawyers" in the field of medical negligence. I hope that I am not being flippant when I say that, given that only 17 per cent. of the cases brought in this field on legal aid have been successful, there would seem to be more inexperienced lawyers than there are experienced ones. How does one become experienced except through practice? Therefore, I am really concerned about the use of the word "experienced" in this field and the use of the phrase "financially well-structured lawyers", which may mean that there is a severe reduction in the choice available and a narrowing down of those firms of lawyers--presumably, only substantial firms--that will be in receipt of legal aid in these cases.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-04_spmin3"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, if I as plaintiff had a medical negligence claim to bring, I do not believe that the state would be doing me a great service if it pointed me in the direction of an inexperienced lawyer. The fact is that there are many experienced lawyers in medical negligence cases. I repeat what the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, said, that the picture is not as bleak as the success rate at trial suggests because of settlements. However, it appears to me to be right in principle that scarce public funds should be spent on medical negligence cases where they are used to secure the services of experienced lawyers.

<P>
<A NAME="80304-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever </B>   rose to call attention to the importance of the work of charities; and to move for Papers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, charities play a huge and vital part in the life of this country. They are tremendously varied, ranging from household names like RoSPA (the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents) of which I am president, to local community trusts. They have little in common other than that their reason for existence is to advance some aspect of the welfare of the community. The size of the sector is impressive. There are more than 180,000 charities and a new one is registered with the commission every 12 minutes. The charity sector has 440,000 full-time employees backed by an army of 3 million individuals providing voluntary services. I have no wish to blind your Lordships with statistics but wanted to highlight some of the indicators that show how important is the charity sector; not simply because of the social purposes that the sector is fulfilling but because it makes a real contribution to the country's economy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para8"></a>This debate is timely for several reasons. Despite the Prime Minister's exhortation to make the advent of the Labour Government the start of a "giving age", charitable giving is in a state of decline--especially among the young generation. The charities Acts and the lottery brought about great change in the charitable sector. The Government are due to produce their own consultation paper on charities in the next few weeks. The charity tax review was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the summer, and I know that a number of charities have submitted their views to that review. I have received a copy of the submission by the Charities Aid Foundation. I wish that more people would use its services, which are a most convenient and efficient way to give to good causes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para9"></a>The Government also have a draft Bill to restrict the frequency of on-line lottery draws--in effect, a ban on Pronto! Doubtless my noble friend Lord Mancroft will speak on that matter. I look forward to the Minister's reply--particularly as I am a trustee of the Hearing Research Trust, which had hoped to raise &#163;100,000 through Pronto! this year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para10"></a>In January, the Government announced plans for a compact with the voluntary sector on the lines proposed by the 1996 Deakin Commission. That would set out principles for the relationship between the government and charities, against the background of the voluntary sector being increasingly identified with government because of the amount of work that charities do under contract to Government agencies.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para11"></a>This debate also provides the opportunity to review the need for measures to support the sector's development and independence, and I much look forward to hearing the maiden speech of my noble friend Lady Fookes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para12"></a>First and foremost, as the roles and responsibilities of charities and the Government are drawn ever closer, we must be vigilant to protect the independence of charities <P>


<a name="column_1214"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1214</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>from governments of all political colours. With so much of the charities' money coming from government sources, many charities lack genuine freedom of action. The vitality of charities and community groups comes about precisely because ordinary people feel strongly about particular causes or issues and get on with doing something about them. That personal commitment untrammelled by politics, is the lifeblood of the sector. It is not the place of the Government to silence the voice of charities, who tend to know a great deal more about people's problems and needs than any government. As an unfortunate example, a couple of years ago Barnardos was embarrassed by accusations that it delayed publication of research that it had commissioned, which conflicted with government policies.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para13"></a>Charities are now providing a whole range of mainstream services for people in need. They are no longer on the margins or simply the province of the original idea of the amateur do-gooder. It is no exaggeration to say that many local authorities and health authorities are now dependent on charities for providing services as part and parcel of their overall provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para14"></a>Many of your Lordships are aware that reform of the welfare state is on the agenda and that a Green Paper will be published on 26th March. No one is afraid of change, and undoubtedly we cannot go on as we are indefinitely, but there must be positive discussion with charities and voluntary groups about their contribution to change which ensures that their independence is protected and also encourages partnership and participation. The current Administration claim to want to develop that relationship, but ill-thought through taxation policies recently introduced are having the reverse effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para15"></a>The current charity tax review is in full swing and a consultation paper is expected shortly. I hope that paper will look widely at the options for change in the tax regime for charities and that the Government will not forget that they take 12 per cent. of the lottery's &#163;5.8 billion turnover. I hope also that early commitments will be made to simplifying covenants and gift aid procedures. In addition, I look forward to the proposals for dealing with irrecoverable value added tax paid by charities on their non-business activities. That would particularly help Britain's ecclesiastical buildings, from our marvellous parish churches to the great cathedrals. I declare an interest as a trustee of Canterbury Cathedral and, with my noble friend Lord Mayhew, Rochester Cathedral.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para16"></a>Value added tax bears particularly heavily on cathedrals, with expensive programmes of building maintenance. Most cathedrals pay out more in VAT than they receive in grants, which is quite absurd. They have been seeking either a lowering of the VAT rate on repairs or extra grant from the Government through English Heritage, but to no avail. Will the Minister say what the Government intend to do to compensate cathedrals for those losses? Perhaps the right way is for the Government to decide and publish the net contribution that they wish to make to the built heritage, then top up that sum with the amount of VAT collected from it.
<P>


<a name="column_1215"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1215</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para17"></a>With regard to advanced corporation tax, it appears that charities have been the victims of changes aimed principally at pension funds. That will eventually cost UK charities &#163;400 million a year. Will the Government consider treating charities separately from pension funds in respect of ACT and other corporate taxes? We would welcome it if the Government were to reconsider the position of charities in respect of ACT, even if they are not prepared to consider the changes made in relation to pension funds. The transitional relief announced by the Government will only give charities a soft landing. Make no mistake. They will lose out.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para18"></a>Given the importance of public confidence in charities and in the proper use of the money that they are given, the Charity Commission's role in providing public reassurance through its monitoring of charities is most important. Constant vigilance is also needed to prevent abuse of charitable status. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has been warned by the Charity Commission that the society's links with the animal rights movement must be broken, which I welcome. We need to be clear that other charities are not abusing their status to run political campaigns.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para19"></a>That spotlights the need for clarification of the application of charity law. Case law is so vague, as to what is or is not acceptable conduct by charities, that a climate of uncertainty exists. On the one hand, the RSPCA brazenly pushes its luck and hopes to get away with it. On the other hand, the threat of penalties for possible unlawful activity tends to stifle other charities. I shall be grateful if the Minister will say whether the Government have any plans to clarify that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para20"></a>The Conservatives introduced the National Lottery, for which they should be praised. In my opinion, it has been a quite remarkable success in tapping major new funds for good causes. It has been extremely popular; given a welcome fillip to the retail trade; strengthened communal ties; promoted economic regeneration and enhanced equality and opportunity. I regret to see already that money that was dedicated to charities through the lottery is to be creamed off to support, what everyone can see but the Government will not admit, is revenue spending on Labour's pet projects. The beauty of the National Lottery was that it was an independent source of funding for charities and other good causes. Any charity could apply to the National Lottery Charities Board for a grant, but the initiatives paid for through the new opportunities fund will be specified by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para21"></a>According to the Office of National Statistics, there is no evidence that the National Lottery has had a significant impact on charitable giving. To date, the National Lottery Charities Board has made 12,200 awards, amounting to &#163;640 million, to charities and voluntary organisations. Charities have also been successful in applying for lottery grants to the Millennium Commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para22"></a>However, that is not to say that the lottery does not need some fine tuning. The detailed research and administration necessary to make a bid for major funding has taken RoSPA six working days on each occasion when it has applied. Unfortunately, both bids <P>


<a name="column_1216"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1216</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>were unsuccessful. Charities cannot afford to invest at that level for very long, which becomes a deterrent to applying for lottery funds. Perhaps applications could be dealt with in a two-stage process so that if a bid is clearly not going to be successful it can be filtered out before too much work is done.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para23"></a>If there are to be major preparations for activities to celebrate the millennium, the charitable sector needs to know quickly how it is to be involved. It is essential that a whole range of community and voluntary activities are encouraged in a way that will have a lasting impact on future generations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para24"></a>When we were in government we sought to promote private giving to charities. We eased the regulations surrounding covenants. We introduced the Gift Aid system to allow one-off gifts, tax free. We extended tax concessions for charities and gifts to them. We created the National Lottery and ensured that charities were among the major classes of beneficiaries. I hope that those attitudes will be carried forward by the present Government. The Government must play their part in reinvigorating the culture of giving in this country and set a positive economic and fiscal environment within which charities can thrive. My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.

<A NAME="80304-04_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, for the welcome opportunity to debate the importance and the work of charities. I should declare an interest. I am--at least for the next two months--the chief executive of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, one of this country's largest charities and certainly its most effective. I am also on the president's advisory council of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and was a member of the Deakin Commission on the Future of the Voluntary Sector, to which the noble Lord referred. Those of your Lordships who have not recently read the work of the Deakin Commission will find that it is well worth revisiting. It is important that the commission's recommendations are followed through.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para25"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Astor, rightly pointed out the economic and social importance of the charity sector in public life in this country. It provides a large, diverse and ever-growing range of services across many areas. It provides an essential focus for community action and for people getting together, both locally and nationally, to make a real difference to issues that concern them. Most importantly, it provides a voice of advocacy for those who cannot speak for themselves. I do not just mean, in my case, the birds, but the disadvantaged, the marginalised and the persecuted. It is a fundamental part of a civilised society and democracy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para26"></a>One could almost say that charities are more democratic than key political institutions including, with respect, your Lordships' House. After all, politicians in the other place are elected only once every five years, but charities are subject to a form of election virtually every day when a member or supporter decides to renew a subscription or to give time or money in support. Therefore, I believe that charities have a great <P>


<a name="column_1217"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1217</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>legitimacy for both action and advocacy. However, one sometimes gets the feeling that successive governments wish that charities would sometimes go away.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para27"></a>Charities in this country have key characteristics which we must protect and for which we must fight. I refer first to the diversity of the sector. The voluntary sector was once called "a loose and baggy monster". We have 125,000 active registered charities. Some are very large and highly professional while others are small, struggling and, frankly, chaotic. We should not have concerns about the range, diversity and struggling nature of the charity sector. Tidiness is not a virtue in this sector. The idea that we should have mergers to avoid duplication or that small, struggling organisations should disappear flies in the face of the importance of local, individual, value-driven personal effort. Charities spring up from the conviction of their founders to meet perceived needs. Their ability to work in the way best suited to themselves is essential for their vitality and appropriateness. Let us celebrate the glorious diversity of the charity sector and defend the loose and baggy monster.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para28"></a>Charities are also adaptable. They certainly show greater creativity than the public sector, and greater flexibility to respond to challenges and changing needs. We need to foster that. The noble Lord, Lord Astor, also pointed out the importance of the independence of charities. They represent different interests and views in an independent fashion. Charities are, of course, very driven by their values. They allow people to give expression to the values that have brought them into existence. I hope that I can persuade your Lordships that the charity sector is a good thing and that it has characteristics that need safeguarding.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para29"></a>Charities have to operate within certain frameworks: a framework of relationships; a framework of regulation and within a financial framework. On relationships, we need a partnership with the public sector, including government, and with the private sector, including business. The growth of the contract culture whereby the Government were buying services from the charity sector began to jeopardise that partnership and produced a master/servant relationship. We see the work on the compact between government and the voluntary sector which the Deakin Commission recommended. I ask the Minister to assure us that the Government will lay out not only the key principles of the relationship between the voluntary sector and government, but that they will also enshrine a commitment (shown by the Government in their early days) to involve the knowledge and experience of charities in designing, as well as implementing, policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para30"></a>The framework of regulation is important. It is important that the public have confidence in charities--and they generally do. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations recently carried out a survey. It showed that 91 per cent. of the public respect the work of charities and that 89 per cent. believe that they play an essential role in society.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para31"></a>However, the public and particularly the press are now tending more towards criticism of institutions than was the case in the past. The press particularly has an <P>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1218</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>increasing habit of "having a go", almost in direct proportion to the worthiness of the bodies concerned. I am sure that my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor would recognise that phenomenon.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para32"></a>There is a need for a framework of regulation-- not only external regulation, but also self-regulation. I commend the work of the Charity Commission in developing measures to enhance the credibility of the charity sector overall. The commission is developing its computerised register that will give all of us access to more information about the range and functions of charities and allow us to judge the appropriateness of their work. But there must be regulation with a light touch that does not stifle some of the characteristics that we value--the spontaneity, independence and value-driven nature of the sector--or put the loose and baggy monster into a straitjacket. In particular, small charities would find it difficult to cope with heavy regulation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para33"></a>I also commend the work of the Charity Commission in giving advice to charities to foster standards of good practice, particularly the advice it has given on political activity. The role of advocacy by charities is fundamental in this country and must not be stifled illegitimately. But self-regulation must be the main form of regulation for this wide and diverse sector. All organisations in the charitable sector must embrace standards of conduct, governance, accountability, service and management. I ask the Minister to give an assurance that the balance between light formal regulation and strong encouragement and incentives to charities to self-regulate will prevail.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para34"></a>Charities operate within certain financial frameworks. The noble Lord, Lord Astor, pointed out some of the difficulties. I take issue with him on the impact of the lottery on charitable giving. There is conflicting evidence, some of which appears to demonstrate a downturn in individual fortuitous giving to charities as a result of the lottery. In this country in general charity income is stagnant apart from investment income. The recent changes in ACT that have already been referred to will shortly hit that hard by as much as &#163;350 million each year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para35"></a>The Government have the opportunity to review the tax treatment of charities. A vital element of a civil society is that charities need support financially. As part of the review the opportunity needs to be taken to consider the tax burdens of charities and reinvigorate the environment for charitable giving. Charities require a reduction in their annual &#163;400 million burden of irrecoverable VAT. They need simpler arrangements to allow them to trade on a tax-free basis. Most of all, individuals and companies need to be incentivised by effective tax breaks to encourage tax efficient charitable giving. It is bizarre that in this country compared with the United States the level of charitable giving both by individuals and companies is so low. I ask the Minister to give noble Lords an indication of how he sees the tax review proceeding. Charities are a vital part of an effective civil society in this country. This glorious loose and baggy monster deserves all the support that we and government can give it.

<A NAME="80304-04_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Fookes: </B>   My Lords, I rise with considerable trepidation to address your Lordships' House for the first time. Although I was in the other place, for the past five years I was unable to speak from the green Benches because from time to time I occupied the Speaker's Chair as a Deputy Speaker. It means that I have become something of a connoisseur of others' speeches, but it is a different matter now that I am making one myself. It is probably a case of the biter bit. I am emboldened to make this speech this afternoon because I have believed passionately in the value of charities from the time I was a very timid teenager who rattled a box for the local lifeboat appeal to the time that I became involved in other charities in which I was either a participant or ran. In the presence of my noble friend Lord Astor perhaps I may dare to mention the RSPCA which I chaired for two years.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para36"></a>As a Member of Parliament I came to realise the immense breadth and value of charities both locally and nationally. More than one lord mayor of Plymouth said to me after a year in office that he thought he knew the city but had been staggered by the amount of charitable and voluntary work that had taken place in his time as lord mayor. From my position I say a fervent amen to that. One should not overlook the value to the some 3 million volunteers, not just those on the receiving end of the charitable work, who gain tremendous satisfaction from dealing with a cause that they hold dear. Sometimes it arises through tragedy or unhappy circumstances. Perhaps a loved one has died or become handicapped and the volunteer wants to do something to save or help others. That is a great motive for many charities. I have witnessed this in the MENCAP organisation in Plymouth of which I am proud to be a patron.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para37"></a>I have also been grateful for help that is readily available. Perhaps I may deal with a matter that is very close to my heart. Two years ago my mother died of cancer. In the last month or two she was able to remain at home. Hospitals could do no more for her. But I did not know whether it would be possible even with nursing assistance and my help for my mother to remain at home, which was what she wanted. But I knew that the local hospice, St. Michael's Hospice in St. Leonard's on Sea, had a bed ready if I needed it. It was not needed but it gave me tremendous support to know that it was there if it was wanted. Local community nurses came in and supplemented the work of the district nurses. I was very grateful for that. I am now a very happy fund-raiser for that particular hospice, even to the extent that I took part in a marathon "aqua fit" session which lasted for three hours--it felt like three days--to raise funds. For those noble Lords who are unaware of that particular activity, it involves vigorous exercise in a swimming pool, but not necessarily swimming. There are very many volunteers who have exactly the same kinds of reasons for doing it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para38"></a>I believe that the role of charities can be seen also at community level. Charities are great fosterers of community relations with people acting together locally or otherwise. I vividly remember one small charity in Plymouth. It tries to give holidays to children who have <P>


<a name="column_1220"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1220</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>never had much. I refer to the Mayflower Children's Charity that has done sterling work year after year for some very disadvantaged children with little publicity. Perhaps at the other end of the scale is the London Marathon which has become a tremendous national event but with the same charitable instinct. One can also think of the Hampton Court flower show organised by that great charity the Royal Horticultural Society. We must never underplay the value of charities in fostering good community relations, especially at a time when there is so much talk of that going out of the window.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para39"></a>There is also the traditional pioneering role of charities. I refer to the promotion of education and the relief of poverty. Historically, they have been great matters for charities. But I still believe that there is a pioneering role for charities today because they are unhampered by the kinds of restrictions of the state or even local authorities. I should like to give one example taken from the body that I know best, the RSPCA.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para40"></a>A little while ago the RSPCA developed what it termed "freedom food". Many of us who are not vegetarians want to know that the food that we eat has been produced from animals that have been treated humanely and in a manner that goes far beyond what the state requires for the care of animals. That society has developed a very ingenious arrangement whereby it vets food producers and has an arrangement with retailers. Any food that comes up to scratch bears its logo so that consumers can be satisfied that the animals have been treated humanely during their lives. I always buy those goods when I shop in a supermarket. It would not be possible for the state to undertake that function because it would be yet one more thing for it to do and it would have to be done on a universal scale, whereas this can be done almost as an experiment. It happens to be working extremely well, but, if it was not, it would be very much easier for an individual charity to withdraw it than if the state had embarked upon it. There is a continuing role for charities in reaching out and doing things which are thought to be good and necessary, which the state cannot entertain.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para41"></a>There is a role for charities, as an arm of the state, in providing services. I very much approve of that in one respect and I think that it is a valuable use of charities, but I share the view of other noble Lords that it could become a straitjacket. I hope that we will hear from whoever winds up for the Government tonight that the Government will not be putting them into such a straitjacket, which would be a great shame and diminish the value of charities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para42"></a>Charities already have considerable tax advantages. I hope that those advantages will continue because much of the work of charities would come to an end if they were taken away. I welcome the review that is taking place, but I have been in public life long enough to be wary of reviews, especially when a government may be a bit strapped for cash. That is just a gentle warning within the limits of not being controversial. I hope that the Government will not go down that path.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para43"></a>There may well be good reasons for altering the system; indeed, a professor at Royal Holloway College, my own college, has put forward the view that the tax <P>


<a name="column_1221"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1221</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>arrangements or breaks for charities should be on their expenditure rather than on what they receive. Be that as it may, I hope we will not see any attempt to undermine the valuable work that charities do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para44"></a>I very much look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on charities. In my youth it was thought that they were almost passe, that the state had taken over. Happily, I believe that to be quite wrong and I look forward to a strong and important role for charities in the years ahead.

<A NAME="80304-04_spnew9"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Lichfield: </B>   My Lords, it is a convention of your Lordships' House that the speaker following a maiden speech has the privilege of congratulating that speaker. I congratulate the noble Baroness on her maiden speech. It was impressive that someone who confessed trepidation should nevertheless give a maiden speech extemporary and with such panache. We congratulate her very warmly. Her speech revealed her wide experience as a Member of Parliament and as Speaker in another place. I warmed to her passionate advocacy of the charitable principle not least in relation to the City of Plymouth and her reference to appeals for lifeboats. I was fascinated to hear how the noble Baroness can indulge in vigorous exercise in a swimming pool without swimming! We hope that the noble Baroness will appear often in this House and look forward to her future contributions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para45"></a>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the importance which the Churches attach to the work of charities not only in this country but throughout the world. The Churches have often been at or near the forefront of endeavour in the charitable and voluntary sectors. During the 19th century the Church of England was central to the development of the voluntary sector. I worked for some years in Uganda and was deeply impressed by how Anglican medical missions had pioneered medical care as charitable voluntary institutions in so many regions across sub-Saharan Africa. This involvement still takes many forms; for example, the Children's Society, the Church Army and Christian Aid. It should be noted that Christian Aid supplemented the work of missions in a most imaginative way. The hard print is that last year Christian Aid raised &#163;39,344,000 for work in needy regions overseas. A year or two previously it had raised over &#163;40 million.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para46"></a>The extensive work undertaken more recently by the Churches Urban Fund, which was set up only 10 years ago, has now distributed more than &#163;27 million. This fund received a frosty response in some quarters when it was first launched, but the &#163;27 million has generated over twice that figure in partnership funding. Charities can prime pumps. Members of my own diocese--West Midland churchgoers--have raised nearly &#163;1 million for the urban fund, but in our region that has generated over &#163;15 million of partnership funding for urban regeneration in areas of post-industrial shock across regions like Wolverhampton, the Black Country and elsewhere.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para47"></a>It is particularly at diocesan and parochial level that there is the widest experience of direct involvement in charitable work. Last Sunday I visited Bilston, a Black Country town that has suffered very high levels of unemployment since the foundry and steel works were closed. Over lunch I spoke to a pensioner, a woman who had worked most of her life in Bilston's industries in an enamelling plant. She described to me how the closing of those foundries has removed the community glue of Bilston and its identity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para48"></a>However, in Bilston last Sunday a training community centre was opened, triggered by church leadership but in partnership funding between charitable trusts, the European Development Fund and the borough council. That partnership has created a training and community centre for bringing self-excluded post-industrial young people off the streets into worthwhile activity. It is providing facilities where young mothers, for whom jobs are available in that town, can safely leave children in order to go to work, and where life-long learning and appropriate work training for that area can be promoted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para49"></a>There is a pattern of involvement with local councils for voluntary service from the charitable sector, able to encourage and support the conduct of voluntary activity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para50"></a>I should like to emphasise the role of individuals in the range of activities that make up the voluntary sector, in church-based organisations and secular areas. This involvement is not undertaken as a formal representation by the Church. Such individual involvement, often in a sense private or even hidden, is hard to measure, but a survey of almost any local congregation would demonstrate the point. For example, I know of a long-term Alzheimer's sufferer whose family struggled to support her in her own home for as long as possible. That has inspired a group of volunteers to come for parts of five days a week to hold her hand and give a break to the principal carers in order to keep her at home. That kind of endeavour by individuals provides a vital channel for people to answer a call to help the weakest and neediest in our society.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para51"></a>I have a further important point to make about the fact that even the voluntary sector needs funding. There has been considerable provision in the past for tax relief from various forms of taxation, as other speakers have said, because of the recognition of the public benefit of charitable work. Back in 1973, when VAT was introduced, it began to be charged at the rate of 8 per cent. on repairs to our Church buildings, to which the noble Lord, Lord Astor, referred. That rate is now set at 17.5 per cent. The Churches are now paying out more on VAT than they are receiving from such welcome sources as English Heritage grants.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para52"></a>Annually, &#163;16 million is paid out on repairs to listed buildings. Only &#163;10 million comes back in heritage grants. Indeed, Churches of all denominations pay out annually &#163;25 million on repairs--a figure far in excess of English Heritage grants. That applies also to cathedrals which have commitments, as the noble Lord, Lord Astor, said, to things such as sustaining their great musical traditions which are of such interest to large numbers of the general public.
<P>


<a name="column_1223"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para53"></a>The work out there, in Bilston and such places, suffers while energy is taken up on such issues. That problem can also damage our schools. The DfEE has recently given approval to the Stoke-on-Trent City Council to proceed with a public/private partnership scheme for the maintenance and repair of school buildings in Stoke-on-Trent, but because of the current arrangements for VAT payment it may not be possible for our crumbling schools to benefit from that arrangement. It is vital that Church schools, which in Stoke-on-Trent are popular with parents, should have the same opportunity to participate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para54"></a>This is a crucial moment for me to be raising these issues. The time for change over the VAT issue has come. The UK occupies the presidency of the EU. The date for the revision of the VAT system is close. Tax relief for labour-intensive occupations is currently under discussions. I urge the Government to start the ball rolling now.

I must declare that I am concerned with about 50 charities, as, I imagine, is the case with many of your Lordships. I declare also a special interest in the rapid-draw lottery game PRONTO, run by my noble friend Lord Mancroft.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para55"></a>My wife started her national charity Help the Hospices 13 years ago. Its title is self-explanatory. It mainly funds training in palliative care for the terminally ill, following the principal recommendation of the 1994 House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics. Help the Hospices is one of the charities due to benefit from PRONTO by possibly up to &#163;200,000, which is about one-fifth of the charity's income.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para56"></a>The draft Bill that the Government have published on lotteries (frequent draws), if carried, would kill PRONTO, which is not viable if the draw is limited to one per day, as proposed. I am not speaking merely on behalf of my wife's charity, but for many others. Most charities have appealed, more than once, to the National Lottery Charities Board. Most, like Help the Hospices, have received not one word in reply to their appeals. I hope that the Government are feeling guilty about some of these things.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para57"></a>Each PRONTO game is played in the name of the charity due to benefit. That is good publicity. The proceeds of the game can be spent on the charity's objectives, as the trustees think fit. The trustees are not constrained by rules which the lotteries board requires them to follow. Those are some of the advantages of PRONTO. Once chosen, a charity is certain to gain.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para58"></a>The Gaming Board, the Government's adviser on gambling, granted a licence to PRONTO in March 1997. The board, in discussions with PRONTO, made no comment about the frequency of draws, until a day or two before PRONTO was launched at the end of November. I find it disgraceful and abnormal to wait from March until then. I hope that there will be an <P>


<a name="column_1224"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1224</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>explanation for that later. The Government have not responded to inquiry about the Gaming Board's views on the frequency of draws.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para59"></a>The Government's case against PRONTO is that the frequency of draws will make it addictive. Playing PRONTO is under much closer supervision than any other form of gambling in pubs, such as scratchcards and one-arm bandits. There is plenty of evidence that those are addictive, especially when played by youngsters of 16. The recent Fisher Report makes that clear. There is no evidence of the effects of PRONTO which is limited to 18 year-olds and above, according to the direction given by my noble friend Lord Mancroft.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para60"></a>I am not in favour of unrestricted gambling. I believe that the Government should review all gambling in pubs and postpone consideration of the draft Bill. In a few months' time, there will be evidence of the implications of playing PRONTO, to contribute to the other findings in their review.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para61"></a>In the meantime, the Government have failed to make their case. Charities, above all, should not be penalised by legislation based on opinion which is purely speculative. PRONTO has the capacity to make a significant amount of money for charity. Until the review is complete, PRONTO should be allowed to continue. If a problem develops and legislation is thought desirable, it can be introduced next year. I hope that the Government will come clean. The suspicion is that their reason for trying to harness PRONTO is that they are afraid that it is a rival for the National Lottery.

I, too, add my congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, for an absolutely wonderful maiden speech. I feel that we are all more or less singing to the same tune. I hope that noble Lords will forgive me, if, on occasions I echo, or even repeat, what some have already said.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para62"></a>Charities have played a major part in my life. I have been on the boards of several and have founded or co-founded three charities. One in the late 1960s which was the first visitors centre for prisoners' families at Pentonville. In 1985 I set up the Butler Trust which gives recognition to people who have done outstanding work within the prison services. It is concerned with standards of practice. Five years ago I founded a small secondary school near my home in Scotland called The New School Butterstone from which I proudly take my name. It was founded in response to the perceived lack of provision for a particular group of children; educationally fragile children who find the experience of mainstream education overwhelming, but would not be appropriately placed in a special school. It is the classic motivation for charitable initiatives. Since then, it has been greeted with considerable interest from the Scottish Office and a range of other bodies and professionals in the education field. This, too, is characteristic of activity in the charitable sector when links are made with other sectors and the charity acts as a catalyst for new developments and provision.

<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para63"></a>When I started my professional life as a child care officer, I had come fresh from university where I read from the works of my noble friend Lord Dahrendorf. I leant about the development of the welfare state and the vital influence of, among others, that great Liberal Sir William Beveridge who laid its cornerstone in the new post-war world. I believed that I would play my part in that statutory safety net through which no one was meant to fall, and that there would be provision from the cradle to the grave for all our citizens with the state replacing the "do-gooding" of the unprofessional Victorian past. Those simplistic expectations were quickly adjusted in the light of the reality of the Children's Department of Tower Hamlets Council.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para64"></a>My first stop in the charitable world was at Pentonville, where we saw the daily queue of women and children, standing in the street in all weathers outside the prison, waiting for the moment when the prison officers came back from their lunch to start visits. Here was a very visible group of vulnerable people who badly needed help and for whom no one was taking any care or responsibility. Now, I am glad to say, there are similar centres throughout the country. This was the first of many holes I was to encounter in the safety net.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para65"></a>Today, it is fully acknowledged that the voluntary sector in general, and the charitable sector in particular--and there is an important distinction here--is a vital part of our society and a major force in its own right. Independent voluntary associations have been portrayed as the backbone of civil society and their presence as the essential precondition for the health of democracy. That is a major claim. The charitable sector is a kind of organic link between the state, private and personal sectors of society, filling gaps, challenging values and brokering links between the other sectors.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para66"></a>Its real strength is its flexibility and diversity, its ability to respond to perceived need--such as my school--and to changing needs. These may be small scale specialist services which fill a gap, such as the visitors centre. They may be a challenge to current thinking and statutory provision; my school again. They may push against institutional boundaries and put a brake on uniformity. They come in an infinite variety of shapes and forms and, above all, they contribute to the wellbeing of society outside the confines of the state and the market.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para67"></a>A key element is the presence of volunteers, who are as varied and diverse in their interests, input and motivation as the organisations for which they work. They are the life blood of the sector and add value in a multitude of unquantifiable ways. By and large they are unsung, unseen and unpaid and therein lies their great strength. At the visitors centre, the very fact that our volunteers were neither from the prison nor the social work department was a real bonus, and they were a complete cross section from former prisoners' wives, to lawyers, to people like myself. They brought with them a commitment which could not be measured in money terms.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para68"></a>In fact, the charitable sector is not only very important it is surprisingly large, with 125,000 active, registered charities, 27,000 of them in Scotland. No fewer than <P>


<a name="column_1226"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1226</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>23 million people are involved in volunteering in some way or other, and in Scotland there are 700,000 regular volunteers which, out of a population of 5 million, is a remarkable figure. What this reflects is the high value that is placed on charitable bodies in this country, not only in terms of the work they do but in the desire to participate in their work.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para69"></a>I am privileged to have an overview of what is going on in the charitable sector as a trustee of one of the major grant-making trusts, the Esme Fairbairn Charitable Trust. It is one of about 8,800 grant-making trusts and foundations in the UK which give about &#163;1.25 billion a year to charitable causes. Esme Fairbairn is the 12th largest in the UK, one of only four generalist trusts, and last year it gave &#163;11.55 million in grants; 866 in all. In so doing, we become aware of the truly remarkable range, diversity, imagination, commitment and generosity of spirit of people the length and breadth of this country, which is really very humbling. They include schemes to help the homeless and unemployed; to teach better parenting skills; to support the underachieving, vulnerable youth of our country; to help people to help themselves; and to mitigate the problems of childhood and the difficulties of old age, just to mention some in the field of social welfare alone. To imagine that the state could or should be able to do what we see is to dream the impossible and the undesirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para70"></a>There is now a wish on the part of this Government to work in some form of partnership with the voluntary sector in a "compact", as it was called by the Deakin Commission which was set up last year to look at the future of the voluntary sector. I have read parts of it and can say that it is a model of clarity. This desire comes from a recognition of the scale and importance of the sector and is also a reflection of the fact that much of its work not only impinges on but overlaps the activities and responsibilities of the state sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para71"></a>There are potential opportunities for the future of the voluntary sector through the chance to contribute to government policy thinking and also in developing further the quality of its own delivery. In theory, both government and the voluntary sector could gain more and bring more clarity into their relationship. But what is absolutely crucial is that the voluntary sector retains both its service and advocacy role and remains distinct, vibrant and independent. Without the flexibility and diversity which the charitable sector enjoys today, its role and position could be dangerously compromised. Government must start to promote a climate in which the charitable sector can thrive and its activities develop for any partnership to be meaningful. There are at the moment some worrying signals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para72"></a>Those signs have been referred to, but perhaps I may reiterate two. The first is the phased withdrawal of the Advance Corporation Tax credits. Overall, this will result in the sector losing as much as &#163;350 million each year. As regards the Esme Fairbairn Trust, it means that its annual income available for grantmaking will be reduced by 2 per cent. next year. By the time the transitional relief ends in 2004, its annual loss of income is likely to be about 18 per cent. or &#163;2.3 million in 1997 terms. That is a huge loss to the sector. In terms of a partnership, this seems a very one-sided relationship so <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>far. The irrecoverable VAT charged on charities is another: it affects my school. To see money given in good faith stopping, touching base with us and moving on to the taxman seems to me to be mad.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para73"></a>We all owe it to the charitable sector to support, sustain and promote the activities of these groups and individuals who make such an important contribution to our society and to our lives. We must protect its freedom, nurture its diversity and recognise the profound value that it has in promoting a better quality of life for all the people of this country.

<A NAME="80304-04_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Vestey: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to my noble friend Lord Astor of Hever for initiating this debate. I should also like to add my congratulations to those already expressed to my noble friend Lady Fookes on her maiden speech. As I understand it, she is likely to be longer in this House than I am, but I hope that I am allowed to remain long enough to hear more of her speeches. I believe she said that some of the regulations which are laid down in this country should be laid down by charities and not by government. As a fourth generation butcher, I hope that we can find some charity which will allow us to eat beef on the bone again.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para74"></a>I should like to declare an interest in charities as I am the Lord Prior of the Venerable Order of St. John, whose two active foundations--St. John Ambulance and the St. John Ophthalmic Hospital in Jerusalem--have done so much invaluable work for well over a century. I welcome the chance to contribute to this useful debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para75"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, of Tunbridge Wells and Clerkenwell, will describe after me the work of St. John Ambulance in England. She is well qualified so to do because she is our Chief Officer for nursing. I honestly do not know how she has the time to do all this and also carry out her other work, but I can assure the House that she does it extremely well.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para76"></a>St. John Ambulance is an entirely independent operation without any state subsidy. Although we co-operate closely with the statutory services, and increasingly provide commercial training, we remain substantially dependent upon the generosity of the public we serve. Your Lordships will hear today--and have already heard--about the problems that most charities are having with fund raising, in particular because of the National Lottery. Of course, there is funding available from the lottery but so far, in my particular charity, we have not yet balanced what we have lost with what we have gained.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para77"></a>St. John is one of the largest youth organisations in the country. Its young people from the age of six upwards, acquire skills to equip them as adult citizens of the future. At the same time, they make a dedicated contribution to public service. Moreover, from the traditional "core business" of first aid, St. John Ambulance is now expanding into social care, which we see as an area of growing concern in the 21st century with an ageing population in Britain.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para78"></a>However, our work does, of course, extend even further than that, both around the world and back into history. For our order is in effect an international <P>


<a name="column_1228"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1228</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>network of charities. Autonomous priories operate not only in Scotland and Wales, but also in South Africa, New Zealand, Canada and Australia. Then there are St. John Councils in over thirty other Commonwealth countries and territories, which carry out St. John Ambulance work. We are now embarked on a major reform which will result in this network being operated more along Commonwealth lines. Simultaneously, for the first time, a distinct English priory will come into existence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para79"></a>This great St. John family throughout 40 countries in both hemispheres has been spreading "best practice", over first aid and healthcare training and duties, all around the world for many decades now. Recently, for example, we have been developing a new training course tailored to the needs of developing countries, particularly in Africa. During last year's catastrophic volcanic eruptions in Montserrat, we were able to get an ambulance shipped there quickly from Bermuda. We also sent money which helped the islanders considerably in their hour of need.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para80"></a>When Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule last year, although the authorities in Beijing could not accept a continued formal link with our Royal Family, they strongly encouraged St. John to continue its charitable work in Hong Kong. Indeed, we have been discussing whether first aid training might not be extended to the mainland of China. St. John first aid training has also just started in Japan--an entirely new venture. St. John's training packages in first aid and social care are starting to become available on CD-ROMs and via the Internet; for we intend to enter the 21st century as a practical and forward-looking charity using the latest techniques of communication, while never losing sight of the caring mission that we have had for so many centuries.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para81"></a>St. John goes back a long way. Although our present order was created by Queen Victoria, we shall next year be celebrating 900 years of the "hospitaller tradition" of caring for the poor and sick. That great tradition is maintained not only in the United Kingdom and in most Commonwealth countries, but also in the Holy Land--where it all started. Our Ophthalmic Hospital in Jerusalem has been providing top quality eye care for the people of that city and the surrounding area, regardless of race, creed or ability to pay, for over 100 years. Regimes have changed in Jerusalem, but the need for eye care remains as great as ever.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para82"></a>In all this, the order has tremendous international support from all round the Commonwealth; from the United States; and from our friends in the European Alliance of the Orders of St. John. It gives us great encouragement that the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Mr. Fatchett, visited our Jerusalem hospital last month. We see that as evidence of the Government's continued support for our endeavours in that volatile but key part of the world.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para83"></a>We are also proud that our order has been based in Clerkenwell since 1140 (despite a short interruption of 350 years caused by King Henry VIII); that we enjoy such wholehearted support from Her Majesty the Queen, our Sovereign Head, the Duke of Gloucester, our Grand Prior, and indeed all the members of the Royal Family; <P>


<a name="column_1229"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1229</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and that for the past hundred years our St. John Ambulance volunteers have been on public duty to provide first aid cover to the public at virtually every major event in this capital city.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para84"></a>On the sad event of the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, St. John had over 1,400 personnel on duty from early in the morning until late in the afternoon. Moreover, for the week before the funeral and the week after, we had 25 people a day at St. James's Palace looking after the vast crowds signing the condolence books. I am sure that many of your Lordships will have seen the St. John personnel at the countryside March last Sunday. We are confident that the sign of St. John volunteers on duty will be as familiar in the 21st century as it has been in the 20th.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para85"></a>However, apart from fund raising, we have another worry in this age of increasing litigation: the spectre of unreasonable lawsuits being brought against our first-aiders simply doing their duty. The matter was raised five years ago in an Adjournment Debate in another place on, "The Volunteer in the Community". The question was raised as to whether the time had not come for so-called "Samaritan legislation" to enter our statute books to protect good Samaritans, such as first-aiders, helping people who have had accidents. I regret to say that, despite the support of the then Minister of Health at a meeting which I attended with other senior volunteers from St. John, the previous Lord Chancellor turned that suggestion down. I trust that this Government will be prepared to re-examine the question in a more positive spirit.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para86"></a>Finally, I have an offer to make. I should be pleased to arrange training for any noble Lord who is interested. We are, in St. John, the leading providers of first aid training. To show your Lordships why, I will arrange, completely free of charge, a three-hour first aid course at the headquarters of the London District of St. John Ambulance in York Street, W.1. If any noble Lords are interested, would they please contact me here.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para87"></a>I hope that your Lordships will have gathered from what I have said that St. John, as a charity, plays a very large part in the fabric of our country. I thank your Lordships for being able to speak in this debate to call yet further attention to the importance of the work of charities in this country.

<P>
<A NAME="80304-04_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Emerton: </B>   My Lords, I, too, should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, for opening this debate on such an important topic in such a comprehensive way. I should also like to congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, on her excellent maiden speech and on her enthusiastic support of charities. I should, first, declare an interest. As has already been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Vestey, I am the Chief Officer Nursing and Social Care for St. John Ambulance, and have been a member since 1946 when I joined as a cadet.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para88"></a>I want to speak for a few moments on the St. John Ambulance Foundation. The mission of St. John Ambulance is to provide first aid and medical support <P>


<a name="column_1230"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1230</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>services such as caring services in support of community needs and to provide education training and formal development of young people.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para89"></a>It is well known by most members of the general public that St. John Ambulance provides first aid cover at activities ranging from the village fete, to football matches and the London Marathon, which has already been mentioned. But what is often not recognised is that 68,000 adults and young people between them provide in an average year 2.4 million hours of public service, 207,000 hours in transporting patients, 12,000 hours in hospital duties and 240,000 hours in nursing and social care, in addition 1.4 million hours in community work. The noble Lord, Lord Vestey, has already mentioned the duty that was undertaken at the march organised by the Countryside Alliance last weekend. That was a comparatively small duty. In 1997 1,469 St. John Ambulance first aid and medical personnel were on duty at the London Marathon. Some 6,000 competitors were treated and 36 were taken to hospital. Some 110 members of the public were treated, six of whom were sent to hospital.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para90"></a>There are 1,000 doctors and 2,000 registered nurses, all of whom are volunteers, within the membership of St. John Ambulance who assist with training and who support first aiders on public duties. Specialist doctors and nurses in the field of resuscitation are involved in the formulation of protocols, training, and are accountable for the training of selected first aiders in the use of defibrillators. Gone are the days of "do gooders" referred to by previous speakers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para91"></a>These are a few examples of volunteers providing a service to the public of the highest quality of first aid and care performed by professional first aiders, all free of charge to the public. The organisation is dependent on donations for providing these services which are costly to mount. The duties mentioned require precise management in collaboration with the police and local ambulance trusts. The operational plan is set out as a military operation, the aim being to provide the highest quality of first aid when required.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para92"></a>St. John Ambulance is also well known as a training organisation--as has been previously mentioned--training volunteers in first aid and care. But in addition St. John Ambulance trains 200,000 members of the general public each year, including those trained to provide first aid in the workplace to fulfil health and safety requirements. This latter part of our operation is designed to raise funds to keep our volunteers active in the community. An organisation such as St. John Ambulance has to balance carefully its charitable mission with its commercial enterprise in order to survive in a competitive marketplace.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para93"></a>One matter which is causing considerable concern not only to St. John Ambulance but to other charities such as the British Heart Foundation and the Royal Life Saving Society is the question of VAT relief on medical training goods. As a result of some considerable campaigning by the Charities Tax Reform Group in the 1990 Budget, provision was included for zero rating to apply to medical equipment used in training. Since then this relief has been worth up to &#163;75,000 a year to <P>


<a name="column_1231"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1231</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>St. John Ambulance alone and our local divisions have been the beneficiaries. Overall relief to the eligible charities involved in resuscitation training has been estimated to be &#163;350,000 a year. A Customs and Excise notice published in March 1997 contained a new detailed list of eligible and ineligible items and resuscitation training models appeared on the ineligible list. Subsequent inquiries to Customs through the Charities Tax Reform Group established that in their view such models are not items of medical equipment. St. John Ambulance and the British Heart Foundation intend to challenge this ruling jointly at a VAT tribunal which is likely to be held later this spring.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para94"></a>The Government have stated their commitment to charity. Withdrawal of this relief will cost St. John Ambulance &#163;75,000 a year and the purchase of vital life saving training equipment has already slumped. How does this demonstrate commitment to charity? Furthermore, as fewer models are being purchased, inevitably fewer people will be trained. Her Majesty's Customs and Excise were in no doubt about the eligibility of the relief until the production of the 1997 listings. Why have they reneged on their previous rulings? It is unfortunate that valuable and much needed charity funds, and, indeed, taxpayers' funds, will have to be expended to challenge the ruling at the tribunal. I understand that this matter has been raised today in another place and I hope that the support of this House can be given to examine this matter because if resuscitation training models are not items of medical equipment, what are they?
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para95"></a>First aid is only one aspect of our work. The second I wish to mention is that of our nursing and social care role in the community, which is by the year 2000 to be recognised as a core activity of the organisation. While training in first aid has been the lead role, there has always been training for members in home nursing and more recently caring for the sick. Members have carried out a variety of basic nursing and care activities for many years but within the past seven years St. John Ambulance has worked towards developing a strategy to meet the requirements of the elderly, physically or mentally handicapped, and their carers to assist them in living an independent life with the appropriate care and support giving an enhanced quality of life.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para96"></a>The services range from the most simple to the more skilled; for example, taking an elderly person to the doctor, hospital, library or on holiday; taking the dog for regular walks; tending the garden; preparing a meal; cleaning the house or just befriending; organising individual care programmes of bathing; assisting someone to get up or to go to bed and rehabilitation; applying simple dressings and assisting people to the toilet. This allows people to retain independence to live at home and to retain their dignity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para97"></a>A more recent development is to provide first aid and care to the street homeless who, in the main, are marginalised by the primary healthcare services and hospital services. Many of the homeless have real healthcare needs. We provide respite care for carers by running day centres in four social services' premises at weekends for 60 Alzheimer's sufferers and also day centres for the elderly, providing reminiscence <P>


<a name="column_1232"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1232</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>therapies, laundry and bathing facilities and transport to and from home. These programmes are set up through service agreements with social services.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para98"></a>There are 6.8 million informal carers in England as well as those who provide care in residential homes and nursing homes as care assistants. St. John Ambulance together with the British Red Cross Society and St. Andrew's Ambulance Association has recently published a carers handbook. This is designed to meet the basic needs of carers. St. John Ambulance has produced a modular course for carers which is designed to provide a knowledge and skill base which will produce a competent carer able to deliver care to the client. It is also hoped to attract social services, residential home and nursing home carers to buy into the course. In addition, courses will be mounted at local level for informal carers with St. John Ambulance volunteers providing a sitting service to clients while they attend the course.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para99"></a>The third aspect of the work of St. John Ambulance I wish to highlight is relative to our youth movement which currently has 39,000 members, of whom 17,000 are between the ages of six and 11 and 22,000 between the ages of 11 and 18. Our work with young people aims to develop their skills in team work and to develop them to become responsible young people. We also run a training scheme in schools and we would like to see first aid included in the national curriculum.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para100"></a>In 1099 the Knights of St. John provided first aid, transport and care in the crusades. Today St. John Ambulance members provide first aid, transport and care delivering quality through well trained members. I suggest that the role of a voluntary organisation such as St. John Ambulance deserves the support of government and the public as it seeks to meet the mottoes of the Order of St. John; namely, pro fide (for the faith) and pro utilitate hominum (in the service of mankind).

<A NAME="80304-04_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Mancroft: </B>   My Lords, I, too, wish to thank my noble friend Lord Astor for initiating this important debate. I join with him and other noble Lords in congratulating my noble friend Lady Fookes on her excellent maiden speech. I hope that she will not delay too long before speaking to us again. I hope she realises that it will not be necessary for her to jump around in swimming pools every time she wishes to speak in your Lordships' House. I suspect that those of us who have charitable interests might keep our interests to a minimum if we were forced to do that every time we were involved in charities!
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para101"></a>I wish to restrict my remarks to issues surrounding humanitarian charities. I refer to those charities which look after the most disadvantaged in our society--children, the ill, the old and those whom we call the most under-privileged within our society. I speak as chairman of the Drug and Alcohol Foundation. Like many others, it is a small charity doing its work within a local community. It may be interesting to your Lordships because it is based in Westminster. For 24 years the Drug and Alcohol Foundation has provided <P>


<a name="column_1233"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1233</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>care in the City of Westminster to those who suffer from drug and alcohol problems. I believe that it is the only provider of day care for drug and alcohol sufferers in the City of Westminster. As noble Lords will appreciate central London will be a magnet for drug addicts.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para102"></a>Last year we gave 3,500 counselling sessions. We undertook 240 school visits educating people on the problems of drug and alcohol addiction. But, as we all know--it has been said today and on numerous occasions--charities are only as good as their income allows them to be. A small charity such as the Drug and Alcohol Foundation receives about half its funds--in this case it is about &#163;65,000 to &#163;70,000--from donating trusts such as those of which the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, spoke. I am delighted to be able to thank the noble Baroness. The Drug and Alcohol Foundation has received many donations over the years from the Esme Fairbairn Trust. We are enormously grateful for those. Other grant giving trusts such as Smith's Charity and the Tudor Trust are well represented in your Lordships' House. They are enormously important to us.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para103"></a>Like many other charities in different fields up and down the country, we receive some help from local authorities because we now care for people from local authorities. We received &#163;8,500 last year in return for 3,500 counselling sessions. It is a drop in the ocean. However, in the past two or three years we have benefited from charity lotteries and scratch card lotteries, from which we did not previously benefit. I declare another interest. It is a financial interest. Not only did I act for the Drug and Alcohol Foundation as the promoter of its charity lottery under the 1976 Act, but, thanks to the amendments moved in your Lordships' House in 1993-94, I also act as the manager under a licence granted by the Gaming Board for Great Britain. It is a company which I chair and of which I am a shareholder. I am proud to have founded it. Between 1995 and 1997 the little company that I chaired sold 28 million scratch cards across Britain and raised &#163;5 million for charities. Those were small humanitarian charities which would not have received that money otherwise. My noble friend the Duke of Norfolk referred to the charity, Help the Hospices. I refer also to charities such as the Royal British Legion which is not so small but well known; the Chemical Dependency Centre which also offers drug care and is chaired by my noble friend Lord Parkinson who, sadly, is not in his place today; and MENCAP, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, who, again sadly, is not in his place today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para104"></a>The bad news is that what we did between 1995 and 1997 is not commercially viable. We cannot do it. It does not work. We cannot compete against the National Lottery, and against the enormous monopoly that the Government have set up. Last year we set up a new company which I also chair and of which I am also a shareholder. I am proud therefore to declare an interest. It was set up to run other lotteries for charities in the UK. We have been developing the business over two years. We have injected &#163;30 million worth of capital. We are licensed by the Gaming Board for Great Britain. <P>


<a name="column_1234"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1234</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The activities in which we indulge are legal, and have always been legal. They are approved by the Gaming Board, and confirmed by the Home Office.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para105"></a>Yet two weeks before we launched, after an injection of &#163;30 million of capital, and two years development, with the objective of raising &#163;100 million a year for individually named charities--that is not a drop in the ocean by any means--the Government announced that they will ban us on social policy concerns: the raising of &#163;100 million for UK humanitarian charities is not justified by the means of compulsive gambling, linking alcohol to gambling in pubs, and all those wicked things. The argument sounds convincing, but the Home Office has not been able to produce one single shred of evidence to back its case. The gaming board, its official adviser, which raised those concerns has not been able to produce one single shred of evidence. It has been asked to do so; it has no research data to back it. The Home Office has no research data to back it. In the past two weeks the Home Office's own adviser, Dr. Fisher of Plymouth University, has released a report. Noble Lords may have seen articles in the press last week. It does not indicate that the small charities are causing a problem or that there is a social policy concern as regards our undertaking. But it does indicate that the Scratchcards from the National Lottery, the weekly draw of the National Lottery and, more importantly, the slot machines are causing serious problems among young people in this country. Seventy-five per cent. of people under the age of 16 are gambling on slot machines; and 40 per cent. are gambling in pubs on slot machines. Slot machines are taking &#163;3 billion a year out of those pubs. And we are causing problems, my Lords? It is a serious problem. The Government's case has been pulled from under them like a rug.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para106"></a>It is important that noble Lords see the issue in its full context. Currently your Lordships' House awaits the Report stage of the new National Lottery Bill which creates the sixth good cause. That will remove &#163;60 million per annum from charity. That is what it will cost the National Lottery Charities Board. It is not an insignificant sum. I remind noble Lords, if they did not know it before, that when the Bill hits the statute book, as it undoubtedly will, the United Kingdom Government will be taking more money out of their national lottery than any other government or state in the world. State and national lotteries are not for governments. They are set up for charities, sport, the heritage, and so on. This lottery, more than any other lottery in the world, now goes straight into the Treasury's coffers; and that is not what was intended.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para107"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, mentioned the NCVO report of 1996. It states that there has been a 20 per cent. decline in charitable giving since 1993. If the voluntary sector is to continue to fulfil its role, it must be properly funded. The role of Government is to facilitate and help. The Government's draft Bill is opposed by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. It is opposed by the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers. It is opposed by almost every charity, and by the 70 charities which hope to benefit.

<A NAME = "80304-04_para108"></a>Introducing non-manifesto legislation without adequate consultation, in response to a knee-jerk reaction, legislation which will destroy the single biggest initiative in charity fundraising in Britain today, is strange action for a Government which claim a close relationship with the voluntary sector. I hope that upon sober reflection the Government will realise that they are making a silly mistake and will decide to allow us to carry on raising the money the voluntary sector needs to do the work it does so well.

<A NAME="80304-04_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede: </B>   My Lords, when I looked at the list of speakers today I noted that I was to follow the noble Lord, Lord Mancroft. I wondered whether he would raise the issue of the gambling game, "Pronto!". I took the trouble to look up the Companion to this House. The Companion states clearly about noble Lords declaring a financial interest, which the noble Lord has done. However, it also states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Lords should, however, be especially cautious in deciding whether to speak or vote in relation to interests that are direct, pecuniary and shared by few others". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para109"></a>I question whether the noble Lord has crossed the line set out in the Companion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para110"></a>In opening, I wish to thank the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, for initiating this debate. The voluntary sector faces a fundamental debate about its identity and the role it will play in the future. Over recent years, the state has shifted its responsibilities and many charities have responded by adopting new responsibilities, primarily in the field of social welfare, as the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, said in her excellent speech. It is to those additional responsibilities that I wish to address my comments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para111"></a>I wish to concentrate on two aspects: first, the funding mechanisms of the voluntary sector; and, secondly, its independence from government as part of the building of greater partnership. I should declare an interest in that my wife is chief executive of a charity that is currently facing many of the problems that are so typical within this sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para112"></a>The introduction of the National Lottery has highlighted the increasing trend on the part both of government and other funders away from core funding towards project funding. By core funding, I mean funding that is not restricted to a particular project but which can be used by the organisation for whatever it sees fit within the general purposes for which it was set up. By project-based funding, I mean funds that are allocated for specific projects which are seen to be new and innovative and have clearly defined objectives that can be easily measured.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para113"></a>I understand that trend, but I believe it has gone too far. I understand that funders want to know how many pieces of equipment they have bought for a hospital, or how many mouths of starving children they have fed. But what happens when successful projects come to the end of their funding period? They are no longer new or innovative. Many charities have great trouble raising on-going funds for routine work.

<A NAME = "80304-04_para114"></a>I shall give one example from my wife's charity. For the past 10 years it has run a telephone advice line, providing advice for working parents on childcare problems. It has been an extremely successful and popular advice line over the years, but now it is neither new nor innovative. The charity has found it impossible to obtain on-going funding for that service and has had to downgrade it to an answer-machine service simply in order to cut down the cost. It is a small example, but is entirely typical, I understand, of the difficulty that many charities are experiencing through relying excessively on project-based funds while perpetually seeking new and innovative funding ideas.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para115"></a>Funders say again and again: be more efficient, effective, accountable and open; have higher standards and better systems--and so it goes on. Yet nobody wants to fund routine administration costs, overheads and the tried and tested services that have stood the test of time. Without those, charities cannot function.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para116"></a>If the Government want to encourage and develop the voluntary sector, the single most beneficial action they could take would be to reverse the trend from unrestricted funding to restricted funding, and to encourage funders to give charities whose work they value the flexibility to allocate funding where it is needed most.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para117"></a>I turn now to the relationship between the Government and the voluntary sector. One of the greatest strengths of the voluntary sector is that it can reach parts of our society that neither the public nor the private sector can reach. It should be recognised that independence is vital to these organisations, and that they have a key role and duty to act as an advocate on behalf of their beneficiaries, speaking on behalf of those who would otherwise have no voice--and that includes birds, I would say to my noble friend Lady Young.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para118"></a>I recognise that the Government place a high priority on developing and strengthening the partnership between government and the voluntary sector, and that the main vehicle for that will be the compact to which many noble Lords referred, on which the Government are currently collaborating with the sector through a working group which I believe is chaired by Sir Kenneth Stowe.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para119"></a>My honourable friend Alun Michael wrote in a Labour Party document entitled, Building the Future Together, that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is not the job of Government or Opposition to determine the future of the voluntary sector. That must be for the sector itself". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para120"></a>I agree with that view. However, I am sorry to have to report to my noble friend that I have heard the view expressed in the voluntary sector that the proposed compact will be an attempt to get the voluntary sector to speak with one voice while in partnership with the Government. I hope that my noble fiend will be able to reassure me that that is not the intention of the working group; and that he will acknowledge that diversity in the sector is its strength and that many voices are needed and many channels of communication. If true partnership is to develop between government and the voluntary sector, then the sector should be involved not only in assessing the likely effects of policy changes but <P>


<a name="column_1237"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1237</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>also in the policies themselves. It will be a challenge to go down the road of partnership between government and the voluntary sector while at the same time recognising the voluntary sector's diversity and independence. I believe that the Government have started on that road with openness and ambition and I wish them well for the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para121"></a>Finally, as demonstrated this afternoon, there is a special relationship between this House and the charitable and voluntary sector. I urge that, whatever changes are seen in this House in future years, we try to preserve that special relationship. It is to the benefit of both the charitable sector and this House.

<A NAME="80304-04_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Westbury: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend Lady Fookes on her maiden speech. Sadly, she has left the Chamber. I had intended to tell her that it would be her worst experience of speaking in this House, but that it would be fast.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para122"></a>I thank my noble friend Lord Astor of Hever for calling attention to the work of charities. I have been involved with various charities for the past 30 years, and therefore feel eligible to give my views. There is no doubt that the existence of charities saves any government an immense amount of financial relief in welfare for the needy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para123"></a>Today, charities have become big business, and I do wonder whether the voluntary contribution is diminishing and the paid sector is taking over. For instance, if you pay a fundraiser, the volunteer in the organisation will not feel so keen to raise funds as somebody else is being paid to do it. In addition, the cost to charities is escalating as a result of the high wages paid to administrators. Headquarters are becoming too large and are therefore not servicing the organisations that they exist to serve. Money raised is therefore spent on administration, not on the specific needs of the charity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para124"></a>Fundraising has changed a great deal from personal giving to corporate giving, whereby big businesses are prepared to support charities through sponsorship, which is invaluable. I believe that trusts and organisations are prepared to give money for specific projects, rather than money going to general funds--in other words, overdrafts.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para125"></a>There are too many charities carrying out almost the same activities. There should be more amalgamation of charities doing similar work.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para126"></a>Sadly, covenant giving is not being encouraged by Her Majesty's Government; nor was it by the previous government. It is all right for the charities, but not good for the donor. In the United States, the individual receives good tax relief when he or she supports a charity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para127"></a>The great cry has gone up that charities have suffered as a result of the lottery. I do not believe that; I think it is an excuse. The person who buys a lottery ticket has never been a big spender to the benefit of charity.

<A NAME = "80304-04_para128"></a>A great accolade should be given to volunteers. They are the salt of the earth and receive so little recognition--for instance, in the Honours List. Why should people who have made an enormous amount of money be honoured, and not the volunteer in a charity who has worked so hard for the organisation to which he or she belongs? Her Majesty's Government should give a great deal more money and consideration to charities to encourage the continuation of their wonderful work.

<A NAME="80304-04_spnew17"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Hereford: </B>   My Lords, I add my own thanks to those expressed to the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, for initiating this debate on a subject which is of enormous importance, as is obvious from the speeches so far made. We can, as a country, be rightly proud of our remarkable commitment to charitable giving and charitable work.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para129"></a>I echo what the noble Lord, Lord Astor, and my right reverend friend the Bishop of Lichfield said about the enormous burden on cathedrals, churches and church schools of VAT. Noble Lords may know that last month there was a debate on this subject in the General Synod, when a motion was passed overwhelmingly, by 423 votes to 2, calling on the Government to reduce this intolerable burden.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para130"></a>The Church is not in a privileged position, receiving money from English Heritage, but is in fact disadvantaged. The figures have already been given. Despite considerable support from the faithful and the wider community and the help from English Heritage, churches up and down the land are heavily penalised for maintaining the nation's heritage and community treasures. This punitive taxation affects rural and poor urban parishes and church schools alike. All repair work and improvements are subject to VAT. While local education authorities can reclaim VAT, church school governors cannot. That is unjust and unreasonable. Although the Church of England is famous for having room within itself for eccentrics, I find it remarkable that in that debate two people were so enthusiastic about VAT that they voted against the motion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para131"></a>I wish to speak about something much more general. Four years ago I became a trustee of a new trust set up to serve mainly Herefordshire and West Worcestershire, established by the generosity of a farmer's widow who left an estate worth &#163;49 million and who had seemed in her lifetime to be unaware of the fact that she was, even by lottery standards, a remarkably wealthy woman.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para132"></a>My first and overwhelming impression as I tried to discharge the work of a trustee, inevitably being on the receiving end of a large number of applications for help, was of the scale and range of charitable activity in our communities. I thought that, after many years in the Church's ministry, I knew a good deal about voluntary and charitable effort; but it was an absolute revelation to me to discover the vast number of excellent projects which exist in our area alone, sustained by the energy, imagination and devoted work of tens of thousands of good people, part of that army of 3 million mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Astor. Every conceivable <P>


<a name="column_1239"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1239</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disability and need seems to have elicited an appropriate charitable response. Whether it is physical or mental illness, whether it is social deprivation, exclusion or homelessness, whether the victims are young or old, whether it is a case of ambulance work to pick up the pieces or preventive work to try to stop a disaster happening, the network of voluntary agencies is immense and deeply impressive.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para133"></a>Of course, some of these agencies may be misguided; many are under-resourced; almost all are under-funded; but the existence of these organisations is a magnificent tribute to human generosity and good will. That was my first and strongest impression. It is not only the Lord Mayor of Plymouth who has been amazed and humbled to discover the level of generosity, devotion and good will.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para134"></a>The second conviction which has been strengthened by my recent experience is that some good things are best done, ideally done, by voluntary, charitable effort rather than by statutory agencies. I should like to mention briefly two examples.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para135"></a>One is the organisation called Lifestyles, a remarkable charity which seeks to release disabled people from the imprisonment of their disability, where the normal, decent level of care provided by the welfare state would leave them. Lifestyles has depended on the vision and pioneering and innovative imagination of one or two people who have seen that it is possible to give disabled people real choices, to enable them to start to come back into the mainstream of life rather than remain on its fringes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para136"></a>The second is that excellent body Homestart, which celebrates its silver jubilee this year, which recruits and trains volunteers to accompany struggling young parents, support them, befriend them, encourage them, give them time, in a totally relaxed and unthreatening way, and teach them, where necessary, the basic skills of parenting, budgeting, or even cooking and housekeeping. Homestart needs to work in partnership with the statutory agencies because most referrals come by that route; but Homestart volunteers are real friends in a sense that social workers cannot be and probably should not try to be.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para137"></a>That is a word of praise and appreciation for those projects as two examples among many of the need for charitable activity and voluntary effort. It is extremely cost-effective and prevents untold misery and exceedingly expensive social disasters.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para138"></a>My third point is a very different one. If Lifestyles and Homestart represent examples of charitable and voluntary work at its best and in its element, other demands which have increasingly been made on our trust funds have been seriously worrying for us. In the past three years we have been asked for &#163;900,000 for purposes which should properly be part of core National Health Service funding. Stroke rehabilitation, cardiac after-care and head injury rehabilitation are matters of such importance and urgency that the trustees, having to weigh these applications against hundreds of others that we receive, and assured by the health trusts that no statutory funding exists for these purposes, have felt bound to make at least some of the grants requested of <P>


<a name="column_1240"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1240</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>us. We have allocated nearly &#163;400,000 to the acute and community trusts in Hereford and &#163;100,000 in grants to hospitals in Birmingham and Dudley.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para139"></a>We feel deeply uneasy about that and about the fact that nearly 10 per cent. of hospital equipment is paid for by charitable giving: that in 1994-95 no less than &#163;500 million of total NHS income came from charitable sources. It is true that many hospitals were originally charitable institutions, and there are still many areas where extras can properly be provided by voluntary giving, through the league of friends or some such organisation; but core funding for urgent and essential treatment should not have to come from charitable sources. I very much hope that the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, will be able to respond with some assurances that that position will not have to continue, not least because reliance on charitable funding for basic healthcare turns the National Health Service into even more of a lottery than it is already, with widely differing standards of treatment available in different places.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para140"></a>We are, of course, glad that we have been able to offer much-needed help to the victims of strokes, heart attacks and head injuries, help which, disgracefully, was not previously available in anything like adequate form. We are in the fortunate position of being able to help. There are many places where such funding does not exist. My urgent plea is that such basic needs should not in future have to be met from charitable funding.

<A NAME="80304-04_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Hayhoe: </B>   My Lords, I add my thanks to those expressed to my noble friend Lord Astor of Hever for initiating this important debate, not least because it gave me the opportunity to hear the splendid speech of my former honourable friend in another place and now my noble friend Lady Fookes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para141"></a>I begin by declaring an interest. I am a somewhat inactive president of Help the Hospices and a trustee of medical charities, the Liver Research Trust and the British Brain and Spine Foundation, as well as being involved in other charitable activities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para142"></a>I wish to concentrate today, rather narrowly, on fund-raising and financial questions. I deal first with taxation. Successive Chancellors have in the past helped charities with favourable tax breaks, but they have also hurt and handicapped them by the imposition and incidence of VAT and the changes in advance corporation tax in the Chancellor's first Budget last year, which was referred to by previous speakers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para143"></a>I warmly welcome the Government's review of the taxation of charities announced last July and I look forward to the consultative document promised for publication in spring this year. I hope that this review will not preclude favourable measures being included in this year's Budget on 17th March.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para144"></a>The National Lottery, as has been said by others, has been very successful, some &#163;4.5 billion already raised for the five good causes. As a former Treasury Minister I confess I am not surprised that Treasury eyes look covetously at this largesse. Pressures to replace or enhance Exchequer grants with lottery money will grow and must be resisted. I must say that the Government's <P>


<a name="column_1241"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1241</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provisions in the National Lottery Bill, which comes before this House at its Report stage next Tuesday do not augur well. In a similar vein I recall the special trustees of charity funds at London hospitals being expected to take on projects which should rightly have been covered by NHS funding.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para145"></a>Without doubt, the National Lottery has led to some switching from direct charity giving to the detriment of the charities. As a result of these pressures many of the larger charities seem to be employing more professional fund raisers and techniques than ever before. The whole business--and it really now is big business--of charity fund raising embracing sponsorship and merchandising is growing and expanding. Computer based direct mail appeals, coupled with what one could call direct blunderbuss type deliveries of charity appeals in selected postal districts where the residents are thought more likely to give than in others, are already in danger of becoming self-defeating.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para146"></a>While I appreciate the technical problems, I wish those concerned could clean up their computer lists so as to avoid repeated postal requests to the same family at the same address--very irritating indeed. Sometimes one needs great strength of will to overcome that irritation and go on contributing to that particular charity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para147"></a>But this is a relatively minor gripe which must be set against the enormous efforts of so many dedicated and concerned individuals who organise and support charitable fundraising for so many different and worthwhile causes in so many different and appealing ways.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para148"></a>I mentioned the Government's National Lottery Bill a moment ago. I want now to refer to the draft Lotteries (Frequent Draws) Bill, which was issued by the Home Office for consultation on 7th January, although I notice that this draft Bill carries an endorsement "10 December 1997 (Second Print)". No doubt there is some quite reasonable explanation of the difference of date from 10th December when it appears to have been printed to 7th January when it was sent more widely for consultation. I should be grateful to hear the explanation from the Minister in his wind-up speech.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para149"></a>While I welcome the publication of this Bill in draft I wonder if more detailed evidence of the views of those organisations consulted by the Home Office before publication could not have been made available. The information given in the Draft Regulatory Appraisal document dated 7th January which accompanied the draft Bill is helpful but rather sparse and not all that persuasive. For example, I note that the views of the Methodist Church, the Church of England, and the National Council for Social Concern are prayed in aid of a statutory limit on the frequency of on-line lottery draws. I seem to recall that these important bodies were not all that enthusiastic about our National Lottery, yet that has become a great success. Just imagine how much would have been lost to good causes if the National Lottery plans had been strangled at birth.
<P>


<a name="column_1242"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1242</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para150"></a>I am now very concerned, as was my noble friend the Duke of Norfolk in his important contribution to the debate, about the potential loss to many charities. I have a list here of some 70 or so humanitarian charities which could be affected by the Pronto! lottery. That was referred to in considerable detail by my noble friend Lord Mancroft. Incidentally, I hope that the procedural point that was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, will not in any way detract from the very powerful arguments that my noble friend Lord Mancroft made in his speech. I am worried by the potential loss to the charities if this scheme is effectively killed off in its infancy by this Bill. Help the Hospices, as has been said, hoped to receive &#163;200,000 but the prospect of this highly restrictive legislation has knocked this down to about &#163;50,000. The end result, if the restrictive "one draw a day" is implemented, could be nothing at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para151"></a>Government sympathy, as expressed in paragraph 7.5 of their Draft Regulatory Appraisal, is of little comfort to the charities who were expecting substantial funding from the Pronto! scheme. I am not much impressed by the Government's attempts to justify this proposed legislation. The arguments are tentative and smack of special pleading on behalf of the National Lottery, though I understand this is denied.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para152"></a>I hope that Government Ministers will have second thoughts, that they will listen to the voices of the charities directly affected. Surely the legislation should not be rushed. Rushed legislation, as we know to our cost, is nearly always bad legislation. At the very least a longer period of consultation should be allowed. It has been far too short. From 7th January to 13th February was quite inadequate to give full consideration to the "one draw a day" proposal. Why not establish a carefully monitored trial so that hard evidence can be collected and assessed and a proper and fair balance struck between benefits and difficulties? Why "one draw a day", an arbitrary limit without any solid basis behind it? Why not one an hour or more frequently, as Pronto! promoters propose? Let us have a sensible trial and a realistic decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para153"></a>I very much doubt whether this Bill would make any progress in another place if free votes are allowed. No doubt Government Whips could drive it through in another place but perhaps not in your Lordships' House. I hope that the Government will think again about their plans. It would be a grave omission not to say something about fundraising for charities without mentioning the Charities Aid Foundation. I endorse entirely what my noble friend Lord Astor said about that remarkable body, splendidly conceived, extraordinarily effective. It allows people to have their charity giving enhanced by simpler tax rebates and allows a more flexible operation by the use of CAF vouchers, their credit card, or their charity card.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para154"></a>Let me end as I began by referring to taxation. Perhaps the Chancellor will give greater encouragement to charities in his Budget or perhaps, like some of his predecessors, he will wait until nearer the General Election to exercise the Treasury's compassionate concern, if that is not a contradiction in terms.

Like her, I spent some 15 years in the Chair but I am afraid I am not as confident as she in being able to deliver my speech today without a note. I am far too nervous for that. It is a great attribute, but I think both she and I, as former occupants of the Chair in the other place, will know that the trouble with those who speak without a note is that one brilliant thought tends to lead to another.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para155"></a>Some 15 years ago I presided at the annual general meeting of the Croydon Council of Voluntary Organisations. Wondering what on earth I was going to say to that excellent body, I picked up the Evening Standard and found a leading article which proclaimed, "Utopia--you may be surprised to know that you're living in it now". The article went on to draw attention to all the good things going on in society and said that we should not be bamboozled by the reports of all the bad things that the newspapers so regularly report.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para156"></a>When I was in the other place I used to keep a note of speeches which had particularly pleased me--and there have been many today. One speech, by the honourable Member Ron Brown, who had the misfortune to drop the Mace one day, was on the press. He summed up his speech with this quip: "You can sum up the modern press in three short phrases; make it brief, make it juicy and make it up". In this debate we have an opportunity to redress that balance between good and bad.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para157"></a>In my alleged retirement I am connected with a great many charities, some of them of national standing and others very small, such as Bridges in Edenbridge, which the noble Lord, Lord Astor, has so generously supported. In particular, I am very proud to be a vice-chancellor of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. It has been a special pleasure to hear the speech of our Lord Prior, the noble Lord, Lord Vestey, this afternoon, and the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, who spoke about the order's worldwide activities. But in this debate I should like to use my few minutes to draw attention to the work of the Prince's Trust.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para158"></a>Most of us take for granted the opportunities we have had in life--a good home, a good education and security--but we all know that this is not the experience of everyone, as we have heard this afternoon. The Prince's Trust aims to help and to inspire young people, particularly the disadvantaged, to develop their full potential and to serve the community. For 21 years it has had a track record of considerable success. For example, it has established 500 study support centres where young people can go to do their homework. We all know, particularly those of us who have been in the other place, that young people can have great difficulty in going home, frequently to council houses with very few rooms, and finding a room in which they can quietly do their homework. These study centres enable young students--there have been 80,000 of them--to study and to be helped in their homework in order to increase their chances of getting good O-levels and A-levels and entry into universities.

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1244</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para159"></a>Then there is the Prince's Trust Volunteers, which I was privileged to launch with His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in 1990 in my capacity as Founder President of the Institute for Citizenship Studies. The Prince's Trust Volunteers has helped some 20,000 young people to develop their characters and personal leadership qualities and potential by serving the community, working together as a team. Sixty-five per cent. of them subsequently have gone on to get good jobs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para160"></a>Next there is the Prince's Youth Business Trust, with which I am most actively associated. In the past 11 years, 40,000 young people between the ages of 18 and 30 have been helped to establish their own businesses, thereby creating some 60,000 new jobs. Because the trust provides them with a godfather or a godmother to whom they can go for advice, 60 per cent. of them remain in business after they have been trading for three years. This is far better than the track record of the banks.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para161"></a>The trust, through the PYBT, is able to take young people off the unemployment register and help them to establish their own businesses for an average of &#163;3,000, which is far less than the annual cost of individual unemployment benefit. Of those we help, 60 per cent. are long-term unemployed, 10 per cent. come from the ethnic communities, 10 per cent. are young offenders and 20 per cent. come from other backgrounds, notably the disabled. Although many of the businesses remain small businesses--some of them do fail but we do not go in for failure in the PYBT because we know that a large number of those who do not continue trading find other employment--we have had a track record of setting up some large businesses. Indeed, our largest businesses have a combined turnover of &#163;20 million and employ more than 1,600 people.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para162"></a>Time does not allow me to mention other charities with which I am connected. In his admirable opening speech the noble Lord, Lord Astor, mentioned that charitable giving is in decline. I am in no doubt that this is partly due to the National Lottery, and I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, that lottery money should not be used for activities which are properly the responsibility of government. Furthermore, application for lottery money is very difficult to make, largely because the application forms are so complicated. In the Committee Stage of the National Lottery Bill I joined with the noble Lord, Lord Howell, in moving an amendment which would establish a fast-track procedure for small applications--up to, say, some &#163;5,000 for small charities, which would be a pot of gold to many of them. I hope that this will be successful.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para163"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, mentioned the motto of the Order of St. John: pro fide, pro utilitate hominum--"In the service of mankind". We politicians regularly draw attention to getting the balance right. We shall hear a good deal about the balance of trade, the balance of payments and other balances on 17th March, which is Budget day. But we all know there is another balance which is even more important--the balance between material welfare and spiritual welfare. There must be a balance between what the state can and should do and the obligations of citizens in a free society to <P>

<A NAME="80304-04_spnew20"></A><B> Viscount Mackintosh of Halifax: </B>   My Lords, I should like to thank my noble kinsman Lord Astor of Hever for initiating this debate. The variety of contributions from noble Lords so far has drawn our attention to the importance of the role of charities. I should like to make a short contribution this afternoon about some of the ways in which charities raise money. However, before doing so, I should like to congratulate my noble friend Lady Fookes on her maiden speech. It was a most impressive contribution to this debate and we look forward to many more speeches from her in this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para166"></a>The amount of good work which any charity can do is dependent upon how much money it can raise, by whatever means and from whatever source. Charities nowadays must, and have, become increasingly professional and resourceful in facing the challenges of fundraising. There is much competition for the charitable pound and charities know this. Whilst there is the danger of "charity fatigue", generosity is also sometimes overwhelming when the cause is appealing and when, importantly, the request is made in the right way. New ideas abound--even a glance at some of the charity post which comes through the letterbox shows this. The variety of charitable events, too, has increased enormously in the past few years; much imagination has been at work, and it has been needed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para167"></a>One very interesting development in the field of charitable fundraising, which has tapped a new pool of money, has been in relation to the giving of unwanted small change left over from foreign trips. The odd coin is of no use to its owner; it cannot be exchanged back. Who has not found themselves keeping jars or envelopes at home of coins in various currencies, in the vain hope that they will be remembered for the next trip? British Airways, in its "Change for Good" campaign, has raised huge sums of money for charity by pooling these individually useless small coins.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para168"></a>In theory, the same could be done for other leftover or otherwise unwanted assets--shares for example. Many many millions of pounds are tied up in shareholdings too small to be worth selling; the cost of commission would be higher than the value. The biggest source of these odd lots is scrip dividends where the underlying shareholding has been sold.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para169"></a>The hitch is that, unlike a coin, one cannot simply give a share away, to a charity or to anybody else. Documents must be signed; registrars provided with the proper pieces of paper. Even destroying an unwanted share certificate does not do any good. The shareholder <P>


<a name="column_1246"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1246</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>remains on the register and will still receive all communications from the company. Tiny dividends are received and must be scheduled on tax returns. Companies spend large sums of money servicing holders of perhaps a single share, many of whom would rather not own it at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para170"></a>In a word, these small shareholdings can be a nuisance to all concerned. In aggregate, though, they represent an enormous reservoir of potential cash, which could go towards charities, if unlocked. Many an owner would be only too delighted if their useless bits and pieces could go to good causes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para171"></a>But transferring small holdings direct to a charity is often not the answer. The charity, though grateful for the generous intention, may find itself equally unable to deal with a holding worth less than the minimum commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para172"></a>A charitable scheme now exists (Sharegift) which can collect these small parcels of shares and make something of them, unlocking their value. If the cost of selling a shareholding is, say, &#163;20 (it can be much more!), and one holds shares in that company worth only &#163;15, one has nothing. By donating them through the Sharegift charity, one's small holding can be combined with others in that company, making enough to be sold.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para173"></a>Here I should declare an interest. The scheme was devised and is run by my wife, after a career in the City in pension fund management and stockbroking, and I am a trustee of the charity which administers it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para174"></a>Sharegift functions by aggregation. Though laborious, it works because there is a critical mass of many donations. Holdings of shares are re-registered, then pooled and sold when they are large enough and the proceeds are distributed to a growing number of charities. Donors are invited to suggest their favoured charities for consideration if they wish. Charities are encouraged to enter into partnership with Sharegift by mentioning the existence of the scheme in their newsletters to supporters and so on.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para175"></a>The beauty of it is that there is no conflict with any other form of charitable fundraising. Donors have, at a stroke, got rid of something which is a nuisance to them, and given to charity, without relinquishing any hard-earned, tax-paid cash at all. Charities are benefiting from the releasing of otherwise frozen assets.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para176"></a>There are so many admirable causes, but there is never enough money. What is important for charities is not just to continue to raise funds from the same or similar sources, though this is vital of course, but to be aware of the possibility of new ways altogether--entirely different sources of revenue.

<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para177"></a>I came to this country 42 years ago. On the very first day, walking with my host in Brighton, I was confronted by a number of people rattling tins. For a minute I was <P>


<a name="column_1247"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1247</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>puzzled. I then saw my host put his hand in his pocket, take out some money and put it in the tin. I said to him, "Why did you do that?" He said, "I have enough: others don't and there is great joy in giving".
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para178"></a>I came from the third world, which was always the recipient of such help. For the first time I realised that it is not only receiving aid, but also giving that gives great pleasure to a great many people. From that day onwards I have been associated with a number of charities in this country. The three that I value most are Save the Children--I am a trustee--the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders and the Mental Health Foundation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para179"></a>On many occasions people give money without realising what precisely some of the charities do. Quite often we are confronted with television pictures within which we see some of our resources being used. That gives the opportunity for a few minutes to highlight the work of just one of these charities, Save the Children. Perhaps I may quote the director-general of that fund, Mike Aaronson. He said in the last annual report of the charity,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In a world which is changing at a breathtaking pace, the gap between rich and poor is now wider than ever before, and it is children who are, as always, the first to lose out". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para180"></a>It is not a new charity: it began as early as 1919. It has done pioneering work with, and making a difference for, children. It has grown to become the United Kingdom's largest international children's charity which works to help to meet the needs of children around the world, regardless of race, creed or nationality. The programme for this charity covers over 50 countries including the United Kingdom, which is often forgotten. The work is highly regarded not only in terms of effective emergency relief programmes, but much more than that the focus of the work is long-term development. Save the Children helps governments and communities to bring about long-term improvement for children and their families.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para181"></a>The situations that we work in around the world may be very different, but our aim is always the same; namely, to ensure that the rights of children are met. For example, the rights of children to healthcare and education; to be protected from harm; the chance for children to express themselves and to be listened to are at the heart of all the work that we do. Our programme is enhanced by the fact that we are an international agency so that we are able to learn from our experience with working with children in different settings and we can draw on our experience and expertise from around the world.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para182"></a>The work in the United Kingdom includes helping children and young people to represent their views, giving them a chance to have a say on how services are provided in their area and helping parents from low-income families gain new skills so that they have a better chance of finding work and breaking out of the poverty trap.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para183"></a>I shall give one or two further examples in a minute. Our work overseas also includes projects designed in terms of improving healthcare and education services; schemes that address the poverty experienced by <P>


<a name="column_1248"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1248</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>families or that address the impact of HIV/Aids and also programmes that reunite children who have become separated from their families during war.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para184"></a>As we move towards the new millennium, the needs of children and young people are as pressing as ever. In the UK, poverty now attacks one in three children, and that figure rises significantly in some parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, larger cities and post-industrial areas of England. Save the Children believes that is unacceptable, given the wealth available to our society.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para185"></a>Poverty is only part of the problem. Save the Children believes that it is unacceptable that many children in the UK suffer from homelessness, sexual exploitation and abuse, addiction, inadequate care when separated from their families, bullying, school exclusion and discrimination. All too often, society labels children as a social problem and feels that they must be controlled. Save the Children believes that children should not be labelled that way and sees it as part of its role to challenge harmful preconceptions about children and young people.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para186"></a>In many developing countries in which Save the Children works, war and conflict have, following the ending of the cold war, taken on new forms. Such wars are frequently caused by a struggle for resources and are rooted in ethnic conflict and environmental change. The legacy of previous conflicts continues to damage the lives of millions of people through uncleared land mines, refugee movements, the dissipation of families and the destruction of social institutions. The 1980s and 1990s saw the dominance of the model of economic and social development across the world whereby market forces were seen as the answer to alleviating poverty and social problems. Many former socialist countries are in the process of making an often painful transition to a market-led economy. At the same time, the integration of the global economy has led to fierce international competition in previously under-developed parts of the world.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para187"></a>The Save the Children Fund has found that substantial economic growth goes hand in hand with rising levels of poverty, ill health, homelessness and insecurity. Women and children form the majority of the poor in developing countries in which the fund operates and are increasingly consigned to the margin of society, with few adequate safety nets to protect them. I will give two examples.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para188"></a>The St. Mellons project in Cardiff is an example of the fund's work to help local communities tackle problems by promoting the benefits of involving children and young people in the planning and implementation of projects and by supporting community initiatives in demonstrating how that approach can produce sustainable solutions. An international example with which your Lordships will be familiar is Sialkot in Pakistan, where the fund is working to influence child labour practices. Save the Children joined an international initiative to phase out child labour in Pakistan's football manufacturing industry, to prevent an immediate ban on child labour that could dangerously lower family income and force children into more hazardous jobs.

<A NAME="80304-04_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Quinton: </B>   My Lords, I want first to thank my noble friend Lord Astor of Hever for raising the work of charities as the subject for debate, which is just the sort of thing for which this House is partly designed. Its other role is to instruct the government of the day, but its Wednesday role is to air topics with which the other place is far too busy to deal but which can enjoy some rational consideration in the less hurried atmosphere of your Lordships' House. I too want to congratulate my noble friend Lady Fookes on her maiden speech. I hardly like to say "maiden speech" because she was, so to speak, previously married to the other place. I feel that I have to say that that showed. The seven-year Trappist vow as Deputy Speaker to which my noble friend referred seems to have had nothing but a beneficial effect on her oratorial powers. I look forward to hearing her often.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para189"></a>When I saw my name rather far down the list of speakers, I thought that the matter that I want to talk about would be utterly obliterated by the time that my moment came. In fact, the topic has barely been touched upon. I refer to the method by which tax relief is accorded to charitable donors. The covenanting system reminds me of egg rationing, gas mask cases and 98 per cent. income tax at the higher rate--a relic of wartime thinking. What are the main objections to the system? First, it is complex for the donor. Here is where one speaks from the heart. There is quite a lot of filling-in of forms to do. In some versions, small pieces of paper regularly appear at certain times of the year, which one has to sign and return--I cannot remember whether to the charity or the tax office--guaranteeing that one is paying tax in the current year. I am often aware of having incurred an obligation to a charity but the piece of paper does not appear. I am too lazy and disorganised to pursue the matter. Whether the charity is seriously disadvantaged, I do not know. It seems fatuous that I should have to worry about it and fatuous that the charity--if it is the charity--should have to pester me with little pieces of paper. It is like those offers that one sees in evening newspapers, for extraordinarily inexpensive meals at very good restaurants. One needs resolution something like that of the Princess Royal, if one is to manage to make any kind of charitable donation in the face of a distraction of that kind.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para190"></a>That is not the only thing wrong with the covenanting system. The administrative inconvenience to the donor is no doubt matched and multiplied by that caused to the Inland Revenue. It may be that authority feasts on it but, if so, it is an unhealthy diet and the Inland Revenue should be cured of it. All that is absolutely unnecessary. Also, entering into gift aid is, for persons of relatively straitened means, a relatively large commitment. The minimum payment is &#163;250 and one may not want to dish out that sum in one dollop to a particular charity. Covenanting is too much like marriage, not like a <P>


<a name="column_1250"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1250</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>friendly weekend relationship. It stretches out much too far into the future. I say that because I am recommending, proposing and deeply hoping for a shift to something like the system in the United States. There, one makes a charitable donation and the charity sends one a receipt. No doubt that is an authoritative-looking form bearing the charity's registration number, so that one can present the document to the tax inspector. Like any allowable or non-allowable expense, it has to be scrutinised and if the tax inspector does not like the look of it, he will not allow it. If he does, the sum given should be subtracted from one's taxable income.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para191"></a>I would not want to recommend some of the more baroque extravagances of the American system, whereby one can have a 500 dollar dinner at some swish hotel, about 40 dollars of which goes to charity. The allowance should be confined to that part of the payment that goes to charity. I am entirely happy with the restriction of that kind. There is always a slight, weird fringe in charitable activities, with incompetents giving themselves huge meals and the prime beneficiaries being neglected.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para192"></a>On the three grounds of complexity for the donor, presumed administrative inconvenience to the Inland Revenue and the way in which the covenanting system is so oddly shaped, temporarily speaking, that it discourages middle-range donations, I strongly urge that the system be abolished and replaced by a simple deductibility system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para193"></a>I believe, for reasons that I shall outline briefly, that doing such a thing would considerably enhance charitable donation. After all, the social structure of this country has very materially changed in the past 50 or so years. We now have what one might call a very large mass of middle income people. We no longer have a great cone with the noble Duke, the Duke of Westminster, on the top and the underclass, poor souls, at the bottom. As everyone says, our social structure is now a blob, like some sort of fruit, with a largish number of very badly off people at the bottom, a fair number of pretty well off people at the top, and a huge number of reasonably well off people in the middle. Many of those people would be prepared, like Americans, to make larger contributions to charity than they are currently accustomed to doing. There seems to be plenty of charitable impulse about in the world, but it is not adequately provided for by the covenanting system. However, your Lordships have probably heard enough about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para194"></a>I now want to move briefly to a topic of enormous generality which is not unrelated to what I have just been talking about. There seems to be a frame of mind behind the persistence of the covenanting system, which is somehow a statist hostility to the institution of charity as such. Perhaps I should describe it as a Benthamite hostility to it which says, "It must be inefficient, so surely it would be better for the state, through the tax system, to raise the revenues required for all these eleemosynary purposes". I hope that Hansard can spell that! It seems to be felt that all the money could be raised by tax and be competently and efficiently distributed to the points of need.
<P>


<a name="column_1251"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1251</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para195"></a>A number of serious points have been made this afternoon which together add up to a refutation of that. First, I believe that it was the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, who said that charities pioneer. They operate on a smaller field than some huge ministry and can thus identify small areas of need.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para196"></a>Secondly, charities can act much more rapidly than can a government. After all, government represent the community. They have to be sure that there is a very broad consensus in that community behind spending tax revenue on certain sorts of abstractly desirable things.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para197"></a>Thirdly--in a way, I think that this is the most important of all, but I hope that I do not sound too edifying in saying that because a number of other noble Lords have mentioned it--charities are important because of the voluntary principle. It is not just money that is given to our charities. There is also an enormous amount of unpaid work involved. Many people are in a position to give quite a bit of unpaid work who may not be able to give substantial donations. However, when costed out, what they are giving in the way of unpaid work adds up to a very substantial donation. We should not think of the vast donors as being the only heroes of charitable giving; we should also remember all those people who give unpaid work. I was thrilled to hear the number of 27 million people mentioned. I shall say it once more and then sit down--27 million. It is extraordinary.

<A NAME="80304-04_spnew23"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich: </B>   My Lords, I too extend my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, and congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, on her maiden speech.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para198"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Quinton, has just said, promoting the voluntary sector is a bit like advocating fruit, fresh air or clean water. There is a lot of it about, and it is good. The voluntary sector is now one of our major employers, turning over an estimated &#163;13 billion last year. Fortunately, we have not yet institutionalised it and I, too, hope that our charities will safeguard their independence during the forthcoming review.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para199"></a>Periodically we hear from charities, just like any other sector, that their income has fallen, that the public have lost interest or that the Government are doing too little to help them. I worked in charities for 20 years and it was part of our job to beat the drum and to draw attention to ourselves, especially when a new government came into office.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para200"></a>The new Home Office Minister, Alun Michael, has recently spoken of the "active community" in which there is to be a new triangular partnership with business and the voluntary sector. This happy honeymoon is to be welcomed, but the charities remain cautious because they are still unsure of the Government's intentions. This is a time of uncertainty, and whatever the achievements of the charities, their staff remain vulnerable to policy changes, public opinion, and the market. That is perhaps the price of preserving their identity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para201"></a>Charities' general income has been falling in recent years, as we have heard, although there have been some increases in trading, investments and legacies. Some <P>


<a name="column_1252"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1252</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>studies point to a decline in regular giving. I have seen that happen in the overseas aid sector--now a substantial proportion, representing one-fifth of the top 500 charities' voluntary income. The three or four largest aid agencies have recently had to make drastic cuts in their staff and their overseas programmes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para202"></a>The lottery has played a role in that, although it is hard to quantify. However, the lottery has also brought considerable benefits. The international grants element of &#163;25 million was a good start and it has been responsibly administered, but I am sorry that it was a Cinderella fund representing only 5 per cent. of the charities board distribution. It is hoped that that will be made up in the forthcoming round.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para203"></a>I am not convinced that the public are any less interested in charities simply because, partly owing to tax changes, they seem less able to support them. The Live Aid and Princess Diana phenomena showed how far people willingly respond to emotional but well planned appeals. The Henley Centre survey two years ago showed that the public have more confidence in charities than in the law or the Church. One could hardly expect more. Charities are highly valued for their contribution to education. The principle of volunteering remains intact. There seems to be no shortage of volunteers. As has been said, 4 million are involved formally with a further 23 million working informally. The problem lies in ensuring that charities' employees are fairly rewarded and that anomalies in pay scales are minimal. The recent difficulties encountered by VSO in attracting younger volunteers relate mainly to the high quality of the professionals that are now being sought.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para204"></a>One factor in the decline in income may be a loss of identity and purpose. Some of the most innovative social work--in education, prison reform and foreign aid--has been pioneered by charities, often with the intention that government should take it over. However, there is a danger that local and central government will swallow up that work and bureaucratise it. Government funding can be a mixed blessing unless the integrity of the work and the relationship with the community can be preserved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para205"></a>There are two sides to the Government's policy towards charities. The first, which is long term and philosophical, is to improve relations along the lines of Professor Deakin's Commission, and to go beyond service-providing towards a more equal partnership, with the special aim of reducing mistrust between the voluntary and private sectors. We should all pay more attention to that. It need not cost the charities any money and is already being well received.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para206"></a>The second is short term and financial. I refer to the improvement of the tax environment, as already signalled by the review of charitable taxation and a reform of the Trustee Investments Act 1961. That will be some compensation for the phasing out of the ACT tax credit which is bound to harm charities with investment income. High street trading by charities--demonstrated by the noble Baroness, Lady Ryder--has become a source of grievance to the private sector, but it should not be penalised where there is a genuine charitable purpose. In fact, if anything, it should be <P>


<a name="column_1253"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1253</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>further simplified with the business rate relief being fully protected. As has been said, VAT on genuine charitable trading should also be revised in favour of charities, especially churches. More consideration should be given to the tax system so that tax relief can be shifted from the charity to the donor.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para207"></a>There is an almost permanent debate, not to say tension, between the voluntary nature of most charities and the growing professionalism and accountability demanded of them. In every sector there is now a high level of expertise, envied by many countries abroad, some of which now seek the advice of our voluntary associations. I believe that we have great potential in exporting our long experience of charitable work and that that has an important function in terms of imparting democratic values. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, will mention that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para208"></a>The links between charities and politics have become more sophisticated and less threatening than they used to be. The two can be closely entwined as the high quality professional briefings now provided to parliamentarians demonstrate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para209"></a>In my experience political education is much more powerfully conveyed through charities than political parties--which is one reason why I have not joined one. To work inside a charity gives one a sense of motivation and direct contact with the public which the political parties rarely provide, least of all in an age of political consensus. In my own field I have noticed the gradual transformation of overseas aid charities. It began as an emotional response to need and gradually acquired skills in public affairs, information, education and what is now recognised, as the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, pointed out, within the limits of their charitable status as lobbying and advocacy. However, I disagree with the noble Baroness that the large charities are likely to be more efficient. Supporters have come to grips with topics such as enhanced structural adjustment and post-Lome negotiations. The NGOs have come to realise that they are themselves no angels and must be much more self-critical in their work overseas.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para210"></a>The number of aid charities has grown as has their relationship with government. In 1993 the organisation British Overseas NGOs for Development was formed by 61 charities. That number has now grown to 166. Simultaneously, as the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, has pointed out, smaller networks of aid agencies have been formed on issues such as debt, fair trade and child labour. The DfID, having encouraged greater evaluation of its NGO programmes, now involves NGOs at a high level in the department.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para211"></a>The Government are committed to new international development targets. They will need the aid charities not just as a channel of funds but increasingly as a means of informing public opinion. Another encouraging example of partnership is the ethical trading initiative. All of these matters are evidence of the dialogue encouraged by the Home Office, but I hope that the Government will not overreach themselves in their ambitious programmes and involve charities too intimately in the policy process. Charities have proud traditions and sometimes their staff on the ground are <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>less enthusiastic than their executives in the rush to the corridors of Westminster and Whitehall. The best presents that the Government can give in the review or the Budget are more, not less, tax reliefs and greater mutual respect for and understanding of the objectives for which the charity was established.

Car telephones, mobile telephones and fax machines in the air and on the railway contribute to--some may say detract from--our daily lives. But what of those who cannot partake of this orgy of self-expression--those who are physically and/or mentally isolated by the rigours of work, unemployment, depression or illness? My theme today is helplines--national, regional and local--known countrywide, nay even internationally, like the Samaritans or those struggling to gain the trust or recognition of the people they seek to help, like the Victim Support helpline launched only last week by the Princess Royal.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para212"></a>I should first paint a brief picture of the charity sector on which I believe some noble Lords have already touched. At the end of January 1998 the Charity Commission's register listed 180,000 charities with a total annual income of &#163;18.3 billion. Most of that money is raised privately but local authority support has risen steadily in absolute money terms from about &#163;606 million in 1983-84 to over double that figure 11 years later in 1994-95. That is equivalent to about 2.9 per cent. of total revenue spending.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para213"></a>The National Council for Voluntary Organisations covers about 2,500 charities. Of these, 263 are helplines. Additionally, the Telephone Helplines Directory published by BT lists over 800 helplines, some national, some regional and some local, but they do not include the smaller helplines operated by larger charities. The use of helplines has increased dramatically over the past 10 years, and they are still coming on stream. They are manned either totally by volunteers or by a combination of salaried staff and volunteers. In either case there is a need for intensive initial and on-going training. Funding is required to meet the cost of the premises, the phone line installation, rent, usage and publicity. In many cases to attract funding from various sources the helpline provides anonymised data to health authorities, researchers and planners, thus incurring computer costs. Most lines operate on the basis of local call rates and have to meet any differences between those and national rates. Some lines offer a call-back service.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para214"></a>One national line established in 1992 has attracted core funding from the Department of Health to the tune of &#163;125,000 in 1996-97, falling to only &#163;5,000 in the third year (1998-99), after which it must be self-supporting. Over half its callers suffer from mental illness. One quarter are carers and two-thirds are aged between 25 and 44 years. There are about 40,000 calls a year, and the charity Saneline provides the health services with analyses of the calls to identify unmet needs and to aid planning.

<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para215"></a>Probably the most famous helpline of all is that of the Samaritans. That helpline receives 4 million calls a year and combines various initiatives to meet specialised needs in particular sectors or regions. For example, increasing isolation and financial pressures in the countryside led to local outreach programmes supported by videos aimed at the farming community. In Leicestershire such an initiative was partnered by the NFU and the diocese. In December 1996 the NFU in response to statistics showing that the rural suicide rate was higher than its urban counterpart helped to set up the Rural Stress Information Network to co-ordinate the efforts of some 13 to 14 charities working to publicise the level of deprivation in the countryside and ameliorate its effect on the rural population.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para216"></a>At a meeting in mid-February of this year these charities confirmed that demand for their help was still rising. If these demands are not met the resultant mental and physical breakdowns which must be dealt with by health and social services departments will rise. Funding comes from government agencies and bodies like the Lotteries Board. Each operates within a set of rules and according to a timetable that normally allows for diminishing financial support over three or four years. Moreover, most of the help is available for work at the cutting edge which leaves the logistical support short of money. This results in the failure of helplines, sometimes just as they are achieving the recognition and trust of the community that they try to serve. It is particularly difficult in rural areas where the public's perception of charities like the Samaritans, Sane and MIND is not conducive to discussing with them incessant, mind-numbing worries.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para217"></a>There is also a conflict between the ethical position of health and legal bodies who cannot discuss an individual's situation with a third party and the fact that many of the callers to the helpline are carers, partners, neighbours or relations of a sufferer. It is surely more cost effective to put relatively small sums of money into preventative services that are manned largely by unpaid volunteers than to have to cope with full-blown crises in hospital and use paid staff. I ask Her Majesty's Government to review the rules for the support of helplines and give consideration to increasing the proportion of funding that goes on logistics, lengthening the duration of support and recognising that the problems of the countryside can be summarised in one word, "isolation", which may be defined as the absence of communication.

I confess that, as somebody who is involved at the sharp end of fund-raising and constantly trying to bring more money in, I am tempted to spend my few <P>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1256</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>minutes tonight whingeing about how difficult it is, in the hope that at the end of the debate noble Lords would offer me large amounts of money. However, rest assured that I do not intend to do that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para218"></a>I will concentrate on only two of the many virtues of the charitable sector--its ability to campaign for and facilitate social change and its ability to help disadvantaged people to speak for themselves.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para219"></a>We have heard about the increasingly important role which the charitable sector plays in our society and we know that charities face many changes because of the shifting role of the state and the fact that voluntary organisations are increasingly being drawn into provision of services.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para220"></a>But we should never forget that there are many charities which do not undertake service provision and which only focus on helping individuals gain access to information and helping them to develop. Sometimes this development can be quite spectacular, as it was with Doris, a carer who, finding it impossible to obtain any support in her local area in her caring role, set up her own carers group. At first the group was simply focused on mutual support, a chance to share troubles and find someone else who had the same difficulties as herself. Gradually, Doris found that she was developing her own knowledge about benefits and services to such a degree that other members of her group were turning to her for advice. As their strength and confidence grew, the group, led by Doris, began to look outside and to get its voice heard in the local media and by the local authority. They became a branch of CNA and, with advice from our head office, began to operate very effectively as a campaign group. At this point Doris's husband, for whom she was caring, died and she withdrew for a while to cope with her grief and bereavement. Later on, she returned to the group, and as she was no longer caring, was free to do even more work and to attend even more evenings. She became a representative of carers on the social services committee and, eventually, having joined a political party, successfully stood for election to the council. The last time I talked to her she told me she had hopes of becoming an MP. Lest any of your Lordships feels I am making a party political point, I should point out that she hopes to represent the Conservative Party in another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para221"></a>Noble Lords will be aware of many similar examples where self help activity leads to active citizenship--thus benefiting not only the individual but society itself. Not every individual can represent themselves and it is for them that the campaigning charities exist. As well as alleviating distress, the campaigning charities have a proud record of bringing social, health and environmental issues to public attention. Abuse of children, protection of endangered species, the plight of the homeless, and rights for people with disabilities would not have come to public attention without the work of charities. I hope it is not immodest to claim that the contribution of the 7 million carers in the UK and their recognition now in public policy is almost entirely due to the work of Carers National Association and our colleague organisations in the Carers Alliance.

<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para222"></a>I am sure that noble Lords were moved, as I was, to hear the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, speak of her own caring experience in her splendid maiden speech.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para223"></a>It is frequently claimed that the campaigning role of charities is threatened by the so-called contract culture. If you are dependent for your survival on the local authority contract, can you really be pro-active in criticising that local authority for the quality of services? It is, I believe, a problem we must acknowledge and it is the reason why my own organisation, CNA, has set its face very firmly against becoming a service provider.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para224"></a>I confess that I used to be very depressed about this situation. I used to think that the campaigning aspect of charitable work would be unable to grow and develop because the only way in which charities would be able to survive financially would be by taking on service provision contracts. I am happy to say I am more sanguine about this than I used to be for three main reasons.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para225"></a>Charities are realising that contracts can be withdrawn as quickly as they can be agreed--indeed more quickly. There are around us too many sad stories of charities which are on the point of closure or bankruptcy because contracts have suddenly been withdrawn. The staff of the charity has been increased to cope with the demands of the contract, but income and staffing levels cannot be maintained unless the contract continues.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para226"></a>The second reason is that campaigning charities are finding that money is available to fund these activities, contrary to the popular wisdom that no one will give money to campaigning activities because of their so-called political connections. Charities, however, are increasingly learning that if you become politically sophisticated you can be "small p" politically active and politically effective while remaining "large P" politically neutral. Increasingly, partnerships are being developed between charities and the commercial sector which will provide funding for campaigning activity, because the thing which campaigning or, as we often call it in terms of private sector partnerships, "awareness raising", can provide is public profile which companies need.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para227"></a>These partnerships are proof that the relationship between charities and the private sector is increasingly a two-way street. The days of charities just expecting a donation from the private sector are perhaps coming to an end and I for one will not mourn that if we gain, as a replacement, a more equitable situation. I am extremely grateful for the support CNA receives from many companies in the private sector. Increasingly I negotiate with these companies with much more confidence about what CNA can bring to the table too. A company may wish to have a caring image, to be seen to be supporting a group in society which is well regarded, to meet politicians and policy-makers at events. There is no problem with that because CNA needs access to the companies' consumers to help them recognise that they may be carers, and we need funding for our publications and our events. The end result is better information and more profile for carers. I am glad to say that CNA's partnership with Centrica (British Gas) to help us reach <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>more carers has been sealed recently with the appointment of its chief executive, Roy Gardner, who is our president.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para228"></a>The third reason why I am increasingly confident about the role of campaigning organisations is the increased emphasis on user control of charities. Let us admit that many charities are still paternalistic, even patronising, in the way they are run, but the move to user control is gathering pace and most people would applaud that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para229"></a>User control is not without its challenges, indeed conflicts, for charities. On the one hand, we are all told we must operate effectively, efficiently, compete in the market place and use business techniques. Trustees are expected to bring skills in these areas, but they must also be prepared to take on the serious responsibilities which the Charities Act made explicit. On the other hand, as the movement to user control gathers pace, it may soon be difficult to raise any statutory, trust or lottery funding without being able to prove that users are adequately represented, if not in control.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para230"></a>For most charities the challenge of user involvement can be viewed as developing particular kinds of partnership, rather than a take-over by users. The exciting thing is that we can view it as a model for society itself for pushing forward the agenda which will enable hitherto socially excluded groups to become empowered and to become real stake-holders in our society. Charities must embrace this concept as they show every sign that they wish to do, otherwise they will lose the support of the very people they are there to serve, their own beneficiaries.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para231"></a>I have every confidence in the ability of the charitable sector to make these changes, enabling charities to continue at the forefront of social change, as they have been for over a hundred years.

<A NAME="80304-04_spnew26"></A><B> Earl Haig: </B>   My Lords, I would like to add my thanks to my nephew, the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, for initiating this debate. He has rendered great service to a number of charities and has not escaped the mantle of his grandfather in ex-service organisations. I am sure those organisations will benefit greatly from his participation. Charities must ask themselves three questions: does our charity do a job that is necessary; does it do it well; and do the public respond? All charities have to look at the situation and consider whether some of their systems and institutions need to be reformed, or whether some of their initiatives need expansion and others need to be quietly withdrawn due to the change in habits and needs of contemporary society. They should always aim at improvement. My purpose in joining in the debate is to portray some of the work of the Haig Foundation and in particular its work north of the Border. Although it is the smaller sister of a much larger organisation south of the Border, it has its own autonomy. It plays a role which is smaller than that of what we term the "other legion". Any figures which I give for Scotland are approximately one-tenth of the figures for the rest of the UK.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para232"></a>In Scotland, the legion and the Haig Fund have shouldered jointly much of the heavy task of rehabilitating ex-servicemen since the First World War. They were set up slightly differently from our sister organisation south of the Border. Our benevolent funds, our grants to individuals and to institutions, our buildings and properties, our poppy factory and our homes are the responsibility of the Haig Fund and independent of the legion. They are administered by committees throughout Scotland upon which serve people who are good at business matters--lawyers, accountants, bankers and so forth. Thanks to their guidance, the benevolent money has always been well supervised.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para233"></a>Although the Poppy Appeal is not their responsibility, much of the poppy collection is organised by legion branches. The legion's share of that collection is used to assist in legion welfare and pension work which is conducted on behalf of all ranks in conjunction with the War Pensions Agency. The structure of war pensions, which is the responsibility of the state, must always be maintained. They are awarded to veterans of past wars and the many younger men coming out of the services who find difficulties when they enter civvy street.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para234"></a>As the numbers of ex-servicemen decrease, our three organisations have to concentrate available funds where the needs are greatest. There are many cases of hardship. I am always impressed by the courage and dignity of those in need. They are part of a population of service and ex-servicemen and women which currently numbers in Scotland 0.6 million. A further 0.9 million dependants are eligible to seek assistance from all or some of our charities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para235"></a>Although the Scottish ex-service population is likely to fall in the next 10 to 15 years, demands on the charities' services and resources could increase if we assume that the remaining veterans of World War Two and National Service will be in their 80s by then. The joint secretariat was established 15 years ago under my presidency in order to streamline our three organisations and to avoid wastage due to duplication of staff. That system enables our management to plan ahead and to receive maximum information about the cost of our various enterprises.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para236"></a>Apart from our income from investments, the main source of our funds is the Poppy Appeal which brings in over &#163;1 million a year. Part of that is allocated, as I have said, to the legion and the Officers' Association. All three organisations have their own capital, their own accounts and their own constitutions. The main difference between the legion and the others is that it is democratically elected.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para237"></a>From time to time outside advice is obtained about cost and salaries and ways to streamline the three organisations. The cohesion between them is satisfactory, and there is little duplication and wasted effort. But in Scotland there is a need for closer co-operation between all the various ex-service organisations, of which there are over 80. Those different organisations are not always aware of the way sister organisations are handling similar problems to their own, work in some cases being duplicated, particularly in matters concerning housing and homes.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para238"></a>There is a need for ex-service people to have a single point of contact, from which government departments could also benefit. With the changing political structure in Scotland, ex-service charities will need to be able to address issues directly to a Scottish parliament. One point of contact does exist, although still in embryo; namely, an amalgamated body called SESCO (the Scottish Ex-Services' Charities Organisation). An expansion of that agency would be beneficial with the setting up of Select Committees on housing, healthcare, welfare, benevolence and finance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para239"></a>I understand that there will be a tightening up of the law and accounting rules governing charities in Scotland to bring us more in line with the Charity Commission in England. I understand also that SESCO is considering making an application for charitable status to the Inland Revenue. Although I am in favour of developing that system of centralisation, I would not want to undermine the present system where individual organisations retain their autonomy. Much strength is gained when people involved in committee work have their own particular concerns at heart, and their individual experiences enable them to address those concerns.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para240"></a>The links between the Royal British Legion Scotland and the Royal British Legion south of the Border are strong. We have a co-ordinated policy for the benefit of ex-service people throughout the UK. Those policies are helped by office bearers from both legions attending one another's meetings. We also share membership of the British Commonwealth Ex-Service League which helps to succour men and women who fought under our flag and who suffer severe hardship.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para241"></a>The two legions marched together on the VE 50th Anniversary parade when the Scottish representatives flew down in a jumbo. The national coverage of the ceremonies at the Cenotaph and in the Albert Hall on TV enhances our image. The publicity work of both legions helps the public to maintain a generous response to the Poppy Appeal. The fact that so many people wear poppies in indicative of that response.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para242"></a>My father's appeals for legion membership retain their meaning today, although the numbers of disabled and the extent of the suffering is mercifully less. In a speech in 1919 he said:

<A NAME = "80304-04_para243"></a>The other legion's membership stands at 620,000 which, together with our membership of about 60,000, constitutes what my father described as a "great society".
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para244"></a>Headquarters, down to the rank and file, can communicate with one another by computer. The legion's reorganisation has made possible the removal of one tier from the national structure. It has installed a specialist fund-raising division to broaden the scope of its fundraising. In order to support the increasing demand on its welfare services, fundraising is now an all-year round activity. Like us, it has improved the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of providing welfare. It has created a full-time county field staff to make the <P>


<a name="column_1261"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1261</B></P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para245"></a>The British Legion has thrown off the perception that it is an outdated institution devoted mainly to beer and skittles. It is, as it always has been, a caring institution, inspired by its motto "Service not Self". This debate will help to promote the purpose of its work in the minds of the public.

<A NAME="80304-04_spnew27"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, for initiating this important debate, enhanced by the excellent maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes. Your Lordships' House must be the biggest reservoir of knowledge about charities in the world. Today's debate has illustrated that. It gives us an opportunity to bring to your Lordships' notice some of the concerns facing many charities at present.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para246"></a>Charities can often provide small scale, specialised services, particularly in the field of personal care, which would be technically more difficult, and thus uneconomic, for public sector social services to provide. They can also respond rapidly to changing social conditions in a way that governments sometimes cannot. Charities can respond quickly to changing patterns of need. The volunteering factor adds value to the charitable sector, not just in terms of time but in the commitment and enthusiasm of volunteers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para247"></a>I have a very serious plea to make to the Government. The countryside, with its enormous march in London on Sunday, has been in the headlines. Today, I wish to bring to the notice of your Lordships the problems of very severely disabled people who live in the country and who cannot even walk. I have not heard that mentioned in any countryside debate. They cannot use public transport if it exists and sometimes cannot even use a car.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para248"></a>There are in some local areas small charities providing buses or minibuses with ramps for wheelchairs which, with volunteer drivers, give severely disabled people some means of getting out of their homes or hospitals. If more tax is levied on petrol it will put that much extra expense on to the small charities which provide a meagre amount of transport for blind and disabled people. I hope that the Government will realise the extra expense which will be imposed on transport in rural areas and the loneliness and isolation which, if they are not helped by those local charities, some disabled people suffer.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para249"></a>The variety of disabilities is very complex. Over the years, many disabled organisations have emerged which are organisations of disabled people rather than for disabled people. These self-help, specialised organisations can promote their members' unique needs. This has been one of the changing faces of charities. Of course, some people with certain illnesses or disabilities have to have able-bodied people speaking for them. Therefore, there has to be a clear definition and constitution for each charity and the individual needs of <P>


<a name="column_1262"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1262</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>members should be taken into consideration by the Charity Commissioners. An example of that has been the Charity Commission being tough in demanding in annual company returns details of the expense claims of all governing council members. Yet it appears to have been lax on some big issues. That matter has been brought to my attention by the Spinal Injuries Association, whose council members have all had broken necks or backs and are paralysed and whose travelling expenses will therefore be greater, as often public transport cannot be used.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para250"></a>Trustees of charities seem to have piled on them many worries and fears that they will be liable if their charities get into serious debt. Therefore, charities have had to change into very professional organisations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para251"></a>The tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales, has left a deep vacuum in many of the charities dealing with drug addiction problems and HIV and Aids. Not only did she bring understanding and compassion to the unfortunate sufferers, but she gave an important impetus to the charities' fund raising. These charities are very important, but they often have difficulties in procuring funds. As was said by the noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, there is concern about the funding through special lotteries. I hope that the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to this issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para252"></a>Many charities which undertake residential or nursing home care for a variety of severely disabled or ill people, such as people with HIV and Aids, are having particular difficulties making ends meet. If health authorities or social services withdraw their funding for beds, those charities will go under and then the patients will be returned to statutory care. That may lead to hospitals without palliative care and a home-like atmosphere, and hospitals returning to having their beds blocked by patients with a long-term condition. I hope that the Government will realise this as the charities' residential homes come under threat of closure. Indeed, some have already closed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para253"></a>What worries me is that many excellent projects which have had money given to them by the Government and from voluntary fund-raising in a pump priming three-year exercise will then have their funding withdrawn. A great deal of time and effort goes into planning. When the funding ceases and the charity has to close its doors, the patients are thrown back on to the statutory services. The needs then re-emerge and the whole cycle starts all over again.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para254"></a>That does not inspire confidence in people who give their time, money, energy and expertise to these projects. It also wastes much needed public funds. Many charities have struggled on for some time, going from crisis to crisis. Will the Government look into these combinations of providing residential care and find a better long-term solution, so that the serious matters can be better provided for without so much wastage of human resources? Charities providing accident prevention do an excellent job in highlighting many dangers which emerge in a fast-moving society. They should work very closely with government departments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para255"></a>I conclude by asking the Minister whether he will give an undertaking that charities will be listened to. I am sure that society can benefit when charities and <P>

It is clearly important to many of your Lordships, but also to the many people up and down the country who generously give time, energy and support to an amazing variety of activities which enrich and improve not only the lives of other people, but also the welfare of birds, animals and other creatures, and, indeed, the preservation of our heritage, whether buildings or the natural environment.

<A NAME = "80304-04_para258"></a>GAP stands for Gap Activity Projects. It is an educational charity which assists young people to broaden their perspective and experience by travelling overseas and working as volunteers in communities where they are needed. In most cases, the young people or their parents make a contribution to the costs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para259"></a>The GAP organisation is essentially run by volunteers for volunteers and is currently sending 1,300 young people overseas to assist in such areas as teaching, caring, conservation and outdoor education. On arriving in the Falkland Islands last December, I was rather surprised to discover that there were no fewer than eight GAP students working in various ways; for example, in the local museum, on farms, and so on. In addition, GAP will be bringing over 300 volunteers from overseas to this country and wishes to increase and develop that aspect of its work.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para260"></a>From the stories that those young people are able to tell of their experiences, it is clearly a personally enriching period in their lives and one which prepares them, in many cases, for making more of their university and other career opportunities. However, it is also a scheme which can provide help and service to people in remote countries and communities throughout the world. This is greatly welcomed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para261"></a>There are three issues which I have been asked to raise. I appreciate that the Minister may not be able to respond to everything that has been said in the debate. If that is the case, I should be grateful if he felt able to write in reply to my questions. The first issue is the <P>


<a name="column_1264"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1264</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>need to encourage the broader educational experience to which I referred and which the GAP programme represents. I think, in your Lordships' House, that the need and importance of this is self-evident, especially when there is increasing anxiety about young people and their disengagement from society. There is a need to encourage them to play a more active part in citizenship. However, notwithstanding the fact that I believe that that is generally appreciated, it would be most welcome if the Government (who campaigned so successfully during the election last year under the banner, "Education, Education, Education"), felt able to recognise that this type of broader educational experience is important and should be encouraged and developed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para262"></a>The second issue is the subject of post qualification application to university, which, again, the Government are currently considering. The main concern is that the current time-scale allows young people to apply for a GAP year one year in advance, giving time for selection, training, fund raising, and so on. In that way, a young person can make his or her commitment to the organisation or community in which he or she plans to spend the GAP well in advance. Currently, most decisions about applying to university and the GAP organisation are made concurrently and that works.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para263"></a>Therefore, it would be helpful if the Government, in moving to a system of post qualification application, would provide those in the GAP organisation with a clear means of communication to the Department for Education and Employment in terms of being able to provide information from their experience and being able to explain clearly their needs. They should also be included in the consultation process which is taking place as well as being involved in any pilot schemes that are envisaged.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para264"></a>My final issue relates to the Government's announcement of their Millennium Volunteers programme, which is a most welcome initiative. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me and the GAP organisation that the Government will be flexible in their approach to that programme and that they will incorporate overseas volunteering in part of that programme.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para265"></a>I am not asking for funding this evening, although all that has been said about that, about tax and about other issues will be of interest to the GAP organisations. I am asking for understanding and appreciation of what organisations such as GAP are doing and for the role of volunteers in giving time and the benefit of their experience, as my noble friend Lord Quinton so clearly emphasised earlier. As my noble friend said in his opening remarks, charities are about giving and that does not only mean giving money. I fully support the Motion.

<P>
<A NAME="80304-04_spnew29"></A><B> Lord Chorley: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, observed earlier, today's debate has shown that we are discussing a subject of which we in this House have quite unrivalled experience. I believe that every noble Lord who has spoken has had an <P>


<a name="column_1265"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1265</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>interest of one sort or another to declare. I am no exception in that respect. For nearly six years I was chairman of the National Trust, and I am currently deputy chairman of the British Council. I believe that they are probably Britain's two biggest operating charities. Although the British Council is about twice the size of the trust, they both constitute quite big businesses.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para266"></a>As I listened to the debate, two points struck me most forcefully: first, the sheer size of the charitable sector; and, secondly--this is perhaps more interesting--the sheer variety in terms of size, especially in terms of activity, and the way that charities are, so to speak, leaders in innovation as regards penetrating and opening up new areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para267"></a>The latter was forcefully brought home to me when I visited the European Commission in Brussels. The continental concept of a charity--and the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, will correct me if I am wrong--seems to be much narrower. Indeed, I am not even sure whether they have a proper concept of charity as we do. Perhaps for that reason, and also because, typically, the continentals rely much more on state provision than we do, the range of activities pursued is far less rich than is the case in this country. At any rate, people in Brussels found it a little difficult to come to terms with the size of the National Trust--for example, the fact that we own nearly 2 per cent. of the land of England, Wales and Northern Ireland and that we have today over 2.5 million members or 3,000 permanent staff--and the sheer range of our activities. Indeed, they found it most difficult to understand how we fitted in with the rest of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para268"></a>I make that observation solely to make the point and emphasise the need to keep a close eye on what goes on in Brussels, so that policy formulation and prospective directives are not inimical to us due to ignorance of the charitable sector in Britain. I do so also to draw their attention, and sell to our continental colleagues, the sheer richness and vibrancy of the sector as it has developed in the UK.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para269"></a>The second preliminary observation that I wish to make is to note the importance of the sector's regulatory body, the Charity Commission. The 1992 Act in that regard was a major milestone, and this House played a significant role in the passage of the legislation. The Charity Commission was given new and much clearer powers and purposes and, to match its new responsibilities, much greater resources. There has been a huge increase in the number and range of charities. Therefore, the legislation was timely and the revamped Charity Commission has, in my view, operated both effectively and sensitively. It has been a positive force seeking to help the sector develop sensibly and properly rather than creating a bureaucratic straitjacket, as so easily could have been the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para270"></a>The other arm of government which concerns us and about which we have heard much this evening is, of course, taxation. Frequent reference has been made to VAT. I shall add but one slightly different observation. The Byzantine nature of the VAT legislation is quite <P>


<a name="column_1266"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1266</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>extraordinary. I shall give your Lordships one example. If we in the trust incur VATable expenditure on the maintenance of our open space properties, we pay that at the 17.5 per cent. rate. However, if a local authority carries out exactly the same work (and sometimes such authorities do so as our agents) no VAT is incurred. If that is not an anomaly, I do not know what an anomaly means. We have taken this matter up on several occasions with the Treasury but have got nowhere. Coupled with that is the sheer complexity of the VAT legislation which creates a huge administrative burden on the taxpayer. For example, our internal VAT manual in the National Trust runs to 200 pages.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para271"></a>The withdrawal of ACT has been mentioned. I shall not say any more about that except that it will cost the trust about &#163;3 million a year. I am confident that if a cost benefit analysis was done it would show that the loss of revenue to the charitable sector--or the gain to the Treasury, shall we say--would be more than offset by the additional expenditure that, one way or another, the Government would be bound to incur to fill in as it were the hole that is left.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para272"></a>I shall turn briefly to two quite different aspects of running large charities: the use of volunteers and the remuneration paid to staff. Volunteering has been touched on in the debate. It is often associated with charities and has grown enormously in recent years. It is an important part of our social and economic life. I do not suppose that it figures at all in the GDP statistics as it is unpaid. Yet in the trust well over 30,000 people, young and old, give a significant amount of their time each year to a whole range of activities. No doubt the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers has even more volunteers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para273"></a>Using volunteers is not always a straightforward matter if one is to get real value from them and they from the volunteering. First, they need to do proper and necessary jobs. Therefore their work needs to be planned and they need to be managed. They work alongside and are supervised by paid staff. So there is always a relationship which is very different from that in the normal workplace. This can demand careful handling. But if one gets volunteering right, it is hugely productive and satisfying to both sides. The voluntary effort is worth millions of pounds a year to the trust.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para274"></a>I now wish to touch on the remuneration of staff who run a charity. I believe that point has not been mentioned this afternoon. I have particularly in mind the senior staff of large charities. They need to be properly paid. That may sound a blindingly obvious statement but it is nonetheless surprising how often otherwise sensible people have absolutely no idea of what this means. Partly this is due to ignorance as they often have little idea of what is involved in running large organisations, or of pay levels. Somehow they assume that a charity must be run differently. One detects, too, a sense that the senior staff should, as it were, be part of the charitable ethos. However, we have to recognise that the larger the organisation and the greater its complexity, the higher the calibre of management that is needed. Charities are no exception to that. One needs management that is commensurate with the nature of the job. I am not talking about commercial or City pay <P>


<a name="column_1267"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1267</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>levels, but I am talking about reasonably adequate pay for people who are doing just as demanding and responsible a job as those in organisations of a comparable size and complexity in industry and commerce. It is unwise to overtrade on the goodwill of one's staff. One should always be mindful of the old adage, "If you pay peanuts, you will get monkeys".
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para275"></a>I should also like to see these large charities show a wider acceptance that it is both proper and desirable for trustees--who devote a considerable proportion of their time to the charity--to be paid a reasonable honorarium. This applies particularly to the chairman of the trustees who carries the ultimate responsibility for good governance. The reason for this is simple; namely, to rely on people who are rich enough to do the job unpaid is to restrict the field from which the chairman can be found. There is a real risk of getting people who are either too old or past their "sell-by-date". I do not wish to labour those two points but I should like to see a wider recognition of what is involved in running these big charities. Ultimately it is for those of us who are involved in this world to educate our constituencies, but recognition and support by the Charity Commission would be a great help.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para276"></a>I have one final thought and that is that the relationships and constituencies involved are far more complex than those in the commercial world. I refer to the notion that because there is no "bottom line" and no profit test, running a charity is less demanding, which is, in fact, the reverse of the truth. The bottom line is a tremendous discipline. No bottom line means that performance is much more difficult to monitor and to manage. Despite this, if one manages to get things right in a charity, it is hugely rewarding to be in that business and to be responsible for running a charity.

<P>
<A NAME="80304-04_spnew30"></A><B> Lord Annaly: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Astor for instigating this debate this afternoon. I also congratulate my noble friend Lady Fookes on her excellent maiden speech.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para277"></a>Those in this long list of speakers have highlighted a range of charities, their aims and the challenges which they face. First, I wish to say a few brief words about charities in general and the vital role they play in many cases in providing services to the disadvantaged and sick. Charities normally carry out work of a caring nature but tend to come from a different direction from government. Charities are generally willing to take risks where a health authority or statutory sector body may not dare to do so. For example, a charity may try all kinds of ways to find a cure for some illness, or they may try out a completely new service. Charities will often operate where no one else wishes to do so; for example, in war torn zones. Charities will work with client groups that others find difficult or unpleasant, for example with those who are dependent on drugs and in "wet" hostels.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para278"></a>Charities are often experts in a highly specialised field; for example, like SIGN--Campaigning for Services in Mental Health and Deafness. It is the charity for which I am a trustee. I here declare another interest <P>


<a name="column_1268"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1268</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as I have a sister who falls within the SIGN client group. My late father and my stepmother were responsible for setting up this charity. SIGN aims to offer a range of services to deaf people who have experienced mental health difficulties and who are striving to live independently. The charity was formed in 1986 to address the needs of this neglected and disadvantaged group of people. Of some 8.7 million people in England and Wales--that is, one in seven of the population--with some degree of hearing loss, about 62,500 (that figure is supplied by the British Deaf Association) rely on sign language as their first or preferred language. These people suffer from prejudice and discrimination. The hearing public do not easily recognise that someone may be deaf as there is probably nothing visible to show that that is the case. These people are also unable to speak up for themselves. SIGN is the only organisation which exclusively seeks to improve the provision of facilities for profoundly deaf people with additional needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para279"></a>In 1993 SIGN opened its first supported housing project in Balham, London. The large Edwardian house was converted into six studio flats with access to a communal area. Serving as a home to six residents it has been the basic model from which SIGN has developed other similar units around the country. There are two in Manchester, one in High Wycombe and a second one in south west London. Others are currently under development. The benefits to residents, many of whom have moved from long-term institutional care, are clearly measurable. With the aid and support of dedicated carers clients have learnt new life skills and, in addition to their mental health conditions having stabilised, they are moving towards a greater degree of independent living. This is an example of a charity in a specialised field working alongside government departments, providing services--care in the community--for marginalised groups for whom statutory services are either not provided or are not appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para280"></a>Government reports and social services inspectorate reports have indicated how poor statutory services can be for such groups. SIGN has long been concerned with the severe lack of facilities for deaf children suffering from mental illness or mental health problems. In 1995 SIGN agreed to develop a national psychiatric service for deaf children in partnership with Pathfinder, a mental health trust based in Wandsworth, London. Central to the proposal was the building of a single unit combining a psychiatric in-patient unit and long-term residential treatment centre, both specifically for deaf children, and both unique in the UK.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para281"></a>At the moment--noble Lords may not believe this--there is only one psychiatrist in this country who works specifically with deaf children, and he is in London. A suitable property was purchased in May 1996 and planning permission for the 10-bed intensive therapy unit and an associated six-bed residential treatment centre was granted in October 1997. That is an example of how charities can work in a collaborative way. There is currently no such service in existence and without SIGN there would still be no service. It is SIGN's expertise and money which will get this service <P>


<a name="column_1269"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1269</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>developed. But in conjunction with the Department of Health, an NHS trust and other charities a new national service will be developed filling a current void. The funding of that &#163;3 million plus capital project of the National Children's Service will be a challenge.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para282"></a>That brings me to my final point. I ask the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, to convey to the Government my strong belief that Pronto!, the charity lottery, should not be restricted as proposed by the Government to one draw a day, as Pronto! would in due course be of great benefit financially to many charities. In the three months that it has been in existence, I believe that it has already raised &#163;300,000 for five charities, with other donations due to a number more. SIGN is not on Pronto!'s list of contracted or registered charities, so I have no interest to declare although financial support from Pronto! would undoubtedly help SIGN get the National Children's Service off the ground.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para283"></a>I understand that the Government have some concerns about Pronto! but I have not read one which really stands scrutiny, taking into account the availability of scratch cards and the easy access to gaming machines for those under 16 years of age. I understand that Pronto! outlets would be in pubs, and only for use by those aged 18 and over. I would very much like to associate myself with the remarks in this regard made by my noble friends the Duke of Norfolk and Lord Hayhoe. It would appear that the Government's real but unstated objection to Pronto! is in fact the potential impact it might have on the National Lottery, of which they are taking, seemingly, a larger cut. I hope that the Government will think again and consider the benefits that Pronto! will provide for many charities like my own.

<P>
<A NAME="80304-04_spnew31"></A><B> Lord Dahrendorf: </B>   My Lords, we are nearing the end of a wide-ranging, important and, in some ways, rather moving debate. Perhaps I may explain why I use that word. When we reach the end of the debate, 28 Members of your Lordships' House will have spoken. With no disrespect intended, perhaps I should say that 27 volunteers and one government Minister will have spoken. Everyone has referred to charities in which he or she is involved. Twenty-eight other Members of your Lordships' House might well have spoken in addition, and many would have liked to do so. In itself it is a rather significant fact. No doubt some of us are here for the good things we have done. I assume that that is most certainly true for the right reverend Prelates on the Bishops' Bench. But it is quite striking--is it not?--that many of us are invited to take part in the life of charities not least because we are here.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para284"></a>In some ways it has become one of the unspoken functions of your Lordships' House that many Members should be involved in voluntary and charitable activities of many kinds. I cannot think of a second chamber anywhere else for which the same statement could be made. I for one would regard it as deeply regrettable if that strength of your Lordships' House, along with others, were lost.
<P>


<a name="column_1270"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1270</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para285"></a>Much has been said about the motives of charities. I found memorable the maiden speech by the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes. She spoke about community formation as one of the effects of a strong voluntary sector, and about pioneering. My noble friend Lord Dholakia added an important motive: that people want to give. They do not want just to obey or make money; they have other motives. We are all complicated and have a range of motives. One is that we wish to make a contribution to the community. That does not fit readily into the language of either the state or the business sector, if I may use that essentially ugly sector language.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para286"></a>I can confirm what the noble Lord, Lord Chorley, said in comparing this country with others. One must be careful not to lump all continental countries together. For example, Holland has many similar features to the United Kingdom, as has Switzerland, in another way. But there is a clear distinction between what I sometimes call civil societies on the one hand and state societies on the other. It is a fact that the institutions of liberty, the rule of law, and democracy are better anchored in countries in which there is a vibrant sector of activity which does not readily fit into the dichotomy of business on the one hand and state on the other. That is why it is so important that we preserve the voluntary sector, the charity sector, with which we are concerned today thanks to the splendid initiative by the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para287"></a>I can associate myself with many remarks made, notably by the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, and the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich. Many others have spoken in a similar vein. I wish to pick up two points on the relationship between charities and the voluntary sector in general, and Government. It is a sensitive area. Some topical developments have rightly been touched on by many who have spoken. One topical area relates to finance. I am the chairman of the Council for Charitable Support. It is a voluntary, non-representative umbrella organisation, and a place for, I hope, intelligent and useful debate. In that capacity, I have been slightly worried recently about contradictions in statements about charity income. It does not help the charities that it is not entirely clear whether there has been a decline in income in recent years. It is high time that the charities and Government got their act together and produced reliable statistics. I am pleased to hear that the Home Office is co-ordinating an exercise to find out the effects of the lottery. I understand that the first publication is expected fairly soon. I hope that organisations such as the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, and the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) will make their contribution in getting the facts right.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para288"></a>Having examined the evidence, on one item I have no doubt at all. There is a gap between actual giving and potential giving. It is probably quite a large gap. A recent study by Professor Pearce of University College, London, suggests that the gap is enormous. It is hard to quantify. To do so, one has to use methods which need effective scrutiny. However, I am convinced that there is such a gap. The question is: what can those <P>


<a name="column_1271"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1271</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of us who believe in a vibrant charitable sector do to close that gap; and is there anything we can ask the Government to do to help?
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para289"></a>A great deal has rightly been said about the tax review. The Minister will correct me if I am mistaken, but I understand that the current tax figure in so far as it relates to charities is fairly technical. It is quite unlikely to come up with proposals which even close the gap that will be opened up by the losses from advance corporation tax. However, apart from the current tax review, there is now an increasingly lively debate on more radical changes in the taxation system. Those of us who would like to see significant changes should not fix our attention on the immediate review, but should contribute to a wider debate which, as sometimes happens, may lead to results earlier than a detailed examination of a whole lot of Customs and Excise questions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para290"></a>In that connection I want to associate myself personally and without reservation with the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Quinton. If we want to close the gap between potential and actual giving, the easiest way to go about it is to turn the incentives for institutions into incentives for individuals, and enable individuals to deduct from their own tax the donations that they wish to make to charities. Like the noble Lord, Lord Quinton, I am well aware of the abuses of that system in the United States, and also of the difficulties of transition from one system to another. Nevertheless, one could make a start. I hope that the notion of a start of this kind will be high on the agenda for the wider discussion of tax reform in relation to charities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para291"></a>Another point that is topical and important has to do with the famous "compact"--in other words, with an agreement, a text, a treaty almost, between government and the charitable sector. I am in favour of a compact, but of one which is light and generous. By "light", I mean that the text must be short; it should contain a few principles; it should not be detailed. And by "generous", I mean that it should be liberal; it should recognise what so many noble Lords have said--namely, that charities need the air of independence if they are to get anywhere at all. They must not become para-governmental institutions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para292"></a>I know enough about the charitable sector to realise that there are charities which are very close to government. I understand that certain rules have to apply to them which do not necessarily have to apply to many of the others mentioned. I hope, therefore, that the compact will not be forced on unwilling charities. I hope that, when it is concluded, it will be possible for charities to opt in and opt out, so that we retain the large number of independent, perhaps idiosyncratic, charities--those based on an idea which not many people share but which nevertheless has its place in the free country in which we are fortunate enough to live. In other words, I should like to see a compact that respects the basic principle so generally supported in this House that charities are, after all, as I described it in a previous debate, a world of creative chaos. They are not, and should not be, wholly organised; they are a <P>


<a name="column_1272"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1272</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>creative ferment in a free society. I very much hope that the compact will not change that, and that the tax debate will help it.

<A NAME="80304-04_spnew32"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, as the 27th and final volunteer before the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, comes as a conscript to the Dispatch Box, perhaps I may say what great pleasure it gives me to thank my noble friend Lord Astor of Hever, and to congratulate him on introducing the debate and persuading so many Members from all parts of the House to offer their experience of the charitable world. The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, talked about this House having the largest reservoir of expertise on charities anywhere in the country or anywhere in the world. She is absolutely right. A vast array of different subjects and different charities have been mentioned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para293"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, began the debate with the RSPB, and it ranged through lifeboats, the RSPCA, Christian Aid, to the Church Urban Fund, hospices, Butterstone School, the Drug and Alcohol Foundation--I could go on. We have covered a very great deal in four or five hours of debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para294"></a>It is right that a great many noble Lords have brought their own personal experience to the debate. I particularly commend my noble friend Lord Mancroft giving the House his views. I have to say to the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, that it is absolute nonsense to suggest that in doing so my noble friend breached the rules of the House. He quite clearly declared what his interests were, and made those interests clear to the House. If we followed precisely the noble Lord's interpretation of the Companion to the Standing Orders, we might be deprived of the expertise of salaried chief executives of charities and many others. I do not think that is the wish of this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para295"></a>As many noble Lords made clear, the moving of this Motion by my noble friend is highly timely. He stressed the importance to all of us of the charitable sector. Other noble Lords stressed its size and the sheer number of directly salaried employees--the figure was quoted as some 440,000. We then heard that there are about 3 million voluntary workers. My noble friend Lord Quinton referred to the 27 million others who were involved. That is an enormous figure of which we can be proud.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para296"></a>The charitable sector is of vital importance not only for economic reasons but for social reasons too. My noble friend Lady Fookes, in an excellent maiden speech--if we can call it a maiden speech from someone of such expertise and distinction coming from another place; but perhaps it was a maiden after so many years of self-imposed silence in the other place when acting as a Deputy Speaker--stressed just how much charities can do, at both local and national level, in fostering community values. She also spoke very firmly of what they can do given their flexibility. The noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, also stressed that their very flexibility, and--dare I say it?--disorganisation on some occasions, gave them advantages against which governments could not compete. We all accept that <P>


<a name="column_1273"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>governments have a great deal to do. The vast mass of these matters must be dealt with by government. However, there are a great number of matters that are not best addressed by governments but by charities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para297"></a>Perhaps I may give an example from my own personal experience in these matters. I remember taking round the collection tin for poppies for the British Legion in my own village. Perhaps in passing I may tell my noble friend Lord Haig how greatly I enjoyed working with him, and with the Royal British Legion and the Royal British Legion Scotland during my time as war pensions Minister some years ago, and just what an excellent job is done by the Royal British Legion. It is sad that we were deprived of the presence of the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, on this occasion. He would have been able to inform the House in detail of the excellence of their work.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para298"></a>When taking the collection tin round on that occasion I was greeted by a gentleman who agreed to put some money in but who said that he felt it was something the Government, rather than the voluntary sector, should be doing. He asked why the Government were not helping war pensioners and those disabled in the various conflicts of this century. Fortunately, being the war pensions Minister at that time, I was able to assure him that the Government did a great deal for war pensioners. I believe a little over &#163;1 billion a year is spent on war pensions. But I had to say that, however much the Government do to help those in need, a great deal more needs to be done by the more flexible organisations which help war pensioners throughout the country. It is not just the Royal British Legion; a host of other organisations provide help and support of the kind that it is not always possible for governments to provide.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para299"></a>The other reason why I believe this debate is timely, as was mentioned by my noble friend when introducing the debate, and by others, is that we are perhaps seeing a long-term decline in the incomes of a number of charities. A study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies published in 1997 confirms the long-term downward trend that has continued for a number of years, but is not related to the lottery. For example, the proportion of households making charitable donations every fortnight has shrunk from 34 per cent. in 1974 to 29 per cent. in 1997.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para300"></a>As is also evident from last year's National Audit Office report, to which I shall briefly refer later, as a result of the decline in donations from the general public, charities have increasingly had to rely on grants from government, contracts with government agencies, tax reliefs, the sale of goods and services and especially investment income.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para301"></a>Investment income has also suffered, as a number of noble Lords have said. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, will deal with the question of how charities can make up the &#163;300 million or &#163;400 million that they have lost as a result of the changes to ACT announced last year. That is an enormous sum of money for individual charities. As the noble Lord, Lord Chorley, said, &#163;3 million was lost to the National Trust purely as a result of that change. I believe that that is a matter for the noble Lord to address.
<P>


<a name="column_1274"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1274</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para302"></a>This is, rightly, a timed debate, and in the time available to me there is a limit to the number of points I can put to the Government; and, as my noble friend Lady Hooper made clear, there is a limit to the number of points that the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle can answer. In fact, I do not believe that very many questions have been put to him but, even so, I suspect that there are far more questions than he can answer in the time that the House will allow him or the present composition of the House will tolerate at this time of night.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para303"></a>The first question I wish to put to the noble Lord relates to the charitable status of schools in the independent sector. This is an important matter on which we should like assurances. I should like to know whether the Government have any plans to change the status of the provision of education as a charitable object. As far as I know, education has been a charitable object since the charities Act of the early 17th century. I forget the date of the Act, but no doubt the noble Lord's officials can look it up and confirm that education has always been a charitable object. I should like confirmation that that will continue to be the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para304"></a>Secondly, I should like to underline the points made by my noble friend Lord Mancroft and many others. Do the Government intend to ban the Pronto! lottery? If so, when will they do it, and why will they do it when it is seen to be raising so much money for charity? That money is much needed when we have seen other sources decline or dry up over the years and when there is likely to be a further decline as a result of the changes to ACT.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para305"></a>I now come to questions of taxation and other revenue matters. The noble Lord will be glad to hear that I shall not deal with the question of VAT on churches. I have had the dubious pleasure of answering questions on that subject from the Dispatch Box opposite and I know what a tricky task it can be. The noble Lord has been asked that question and no doubt he will wish to respond to the right reverend Prelate in due course.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para306"></a>I should be grateful if the noble Lord could say something about the Government's review of charities tax law, which was announced in last year's Budget, and whether there is likely to be a response in the Budget on 17th March. The noble Lord will not be able to comment in detail but I should be grateful for any assistance that he can provide.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para307"></a>I wish to raise one other detailed point, which was touched on by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, relating to the Trustee Investments Act. As the noble Lord will be aware, that Act was introduced in 1961 to compel charities to spread their investment risks across a range of different investment vehicles. It was recently described by the Association of Charitable Foundations as a costly and out-dated straitjacket, which it claimed cost charities some &#163;40 million a year. Before the election the previous government announced plans to scrap that Act, but because of the constraints of the 1997 election was unable to get the measure through the various parliamentary processes. It is my understanding that what was announced at that time was not considered <P>


<a name="column_1275"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1275</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be politically controversial and I should be grateful to hear whether the Government are prepared to move on that matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para308"></a>My last question relates to funding. From the National Audit Office report of May last year we see that some 18 per cent. of funding for charities comes from the Government by way of contracts and tax reliefs and some 16 per cent. from grants. Much of that obviously comes in the form of core grants. There has been a degree of concern over the years that there has been a gradual shift away from core funding, on the occasions when government or local government provide support, to funding by use of specific grants. I very much hope that in any review of charities the Government will consider that matter very carefully indeed. I believe that it has considerable implications for charities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_time27"></A><H5>8.8 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-04_spnew33"></A><B> Lord Hoyle: </B>   My Lords, like other noble Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, for securing this worthwhile debate. In view of the number of Members of your Lordships' House who have participated, it is unnecessary to say how much attention the debate has attracted. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, was right to point to the number of charities which have been referred to; it shows the wide interest of noble Lords in charities. That is important, and it has been a very valuable debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para309"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Fookes, and I were colleagues in the other place. I did not realise that she was maintaining a Trappist silence whenever she was in the chair; we all trembled when she got up and addressed us! I am delighted that she has joined us and I look forward to hearing many more speeches from her from those Benches. They will all be worthwhile contributions. We all admired her contributions in the other place--when she was allowed to speak--and the great work that she does for charities. I am pleased that she took this opportunity to make her maiden speech on the subject.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para310"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Henley, was right, of course, that I cannot answer all the points that have been raised with me. In fact, I cannot attempt to answer all of them. But I would say to him that I have no intention, and neither would he if he were on this side, of pre-empting the Budget in any way. Nor would he expect me to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para311"></a>I will try to answer some of the specific questions which have been asked, but first I should like to deal with general points. I think there has been general agreement, certainly shown tonight in the debate, that voluntary organisations and volunteers are vital to the United Kingdom. They are not fringe activities but are central to the fabric of our society. We all owe a debt of gratitude not only to the full-time employees, who number over 300,000, but to the volunteers, who number over 3 million. I am sure I carry all parts of the House with me in saying that we all wish to thank them for the work they do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para312"></a>I now come back to the Government's position in relation to charities and volunteers. We believe that volunteering and community involvement are essential <P>


<a name="column_1276"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1276</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>acts of citizenship. The role charities are playing in the modern world, and the demands placed upon them, are ever increasing and changing. We, in the Government place great value on their work: their contribution to the lives of millions of people has been immense. I think everyone would agree that they are essential, not only in the provision of services, but also because of the vital role they play in society. The voluntary sector has an enormous range and diversity. In the past, many of us have rather taken that role for granted. We aim to redress the balance as a government and to give it the recognition that it so richly deserves.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para313"></a>That is why, as in many other areas, we are committed to a partnership approach. We are developing a compact with the sector on this basis, as has been referred by many speakers tonight. Our belief is that the Government and the voluntary sector share many values and goals and that we can achieve far more by working together than by working apart.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para314"></a>The compact will be a statement of the principles which will underlie the relationship between the Government and the voluntary sector. Initially, of course, it will apply to central government but we hope that ultimately it will extend to all public authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para315"></a>What I can say, here and now, is that that will be a very light touch on the rudder. There is no intention of interfering with charities as such. Charities must be independent. What we are offering them is a partnership between them and the Government. But, as has been emphasised so often, we have to take into account the diversity, and the difference between charities. That has to be recognised. I would hope that the benefits of the compact will be seen and that most charities, having seen what is happening, will want to join.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para316"></a>All speakers have agreed that the Government, in drawing up a framework, must encourage and support voluntary activity. A part of that framework must be provisions that ensure that, where appropriate, policy affecting volunteers and voluntary organisations is co-ordinated across Whitehall. On the other hand, as I say, charities' independence must be retained, and they must remain at arm's length from government. That will be achieved by good working relationships both informally--and I stress informally--and by regular bilateral liaison. Formally, a ministerial taskforce and working group will be set up. That will be chaired by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary. It will oversee and monitor the way in which the principles of the compact are put into practice and the way in which the principles of partnership are implemented across all departments. That is very important. The responsibility cannot rest with one department: it spreads across quite a number of departments. The working group held its first meeting two days ago.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para317"></a>For charities, a legislative framework is required. It only takes one scandal affecting a well-known charity, one question mark over the propriety or even efficiency with which voluntary organisations are run, to put in jeopardy the public's support and money. So we must bear that in mind as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para318"></a>Our aim is to ensure that the legislation meets current requirements without overburdening charities with unnecessary requirements. That is a matter which has <P>


<a name="column_1277"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1277</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been raised time after time by speakers. We do not want, in any way, to interfere with the particular nature of charities or the diverse work that they do. So we have set up the Better Regulation Taskforce. It has been established as an independent advisory body and will advise the Government on measures which improve the effectiveness of government regulation in relation to charities. The task force has a sub-group for charities and the voluntary sector. The main thrust of its current work is to review rules and regulations relating to government funding of the voluntary sector. We look forward to receiving its recommendations later this year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para319"></a>I move on to the review of charity taxation. There, I may say that I take issue with the noble Lord, Lord Mancroft. It is not just a technical matter. It is the first time a comprehensive look has been taken at all charity taxation. The review includes both VAT and direct taxation. It has been widely welcomed by the charities themselves. Its aim is to see whether there is scope for the simplification of charity taxation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para320"></a>Secondly, and again this relates back to the Churches, I understand what the noble Lord, Lord Henley, says in talking about this as a European matter and our difficulties in relation to VAT, which, once put on, cannot be reduced. But we are aiming to make Europe aware of our position on VAT as applied to charities and to see where we can go from there. We are hoping to publish a document for consultation in the spring. Obviously, and I say this to Lord Henley, I cannot pre-empt the outcome of the review, but the points that have been made in the debate will, of course, be brought to the attention of the review body. That review body is an inter-departmental one. It includes the Treasury, Customs and Excise, the Inland Revenue, the Charity Commission and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. So we are intent on helping the charities themselves. The main thing is to ensure that all the matters are considered in depth and the report will go out for consultation with the charities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para321"></a>I shall now try to reply to some of the points that have been raised with me. The noble Lord, Lord Astor, and the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, asked whether the Government will compensate charities for the losses in relation to ACT. I may say in relation to that--and again the noble Lord, Lord Henley, was another who asked me--that the reason for the abolition of tax credits on UK dividends was that it was part of a wider budget package, including a substantial cut, as has been said, in corporation tax rates. This was designed to promote economic stability and rebalance the tax system in favour of investment and long-term stability.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para322"></a>However, the Chancellor recognised the impact of the change upon charities in two ways. First, it was deferred for charities until April 1999. Secondly, we have provided for special compensation payments on a sliding scale over a further period of five years which will be worth nearly &#163;1 billion. I know that it is a blow, and we do sympathise, but charities have nearly seven years to adjust to the change.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para323"></a>Many noble Lords asked about independence. I have already said that independence must be at the forefront in relation to the compact. The noble Lord, Lord Astor, <P>


<a name="column_1278"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1278</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reaffirmed the uncertainty of the law in the area of political activities. The law may be complex but the Charity Commission has published guidelines explaining within these rules what charities can and cannot do. The guidelines themselves were prepared after consultation with the charities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para324"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, and others asked about the lottery position. We sought advice on this and asked people for their views. Noble Lords have asked why there can be only one draw per day. All the views we received are being considered at the moment. The noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, is aware that his views will be considered before the response comes out. Many noble Lords have asked about the Pronto! lottery and have pointed out that it brings great benefits to many charities. I will ensure that all your Lordships' views are brought to the attention of the Minister and his advisers when they are considering this matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para325"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, asked about the compact and partnership. I cannot say too often that the Government recognise the need to balance support for voluntary organisations with their independence. But, again in relation to the tax review, I cannot pre-empt anything that will come out of it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para326"></a>I have already referred to the maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Fookes. She said, like many others, that government help must not be in the form of a straitjacket. I think I have made the Government's position clear. In attempting to help charities, we must do nothing that interferes with them or puts them in a straitjacket.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para327"></a>The right reverend Prelates the Bishops of Lichfield and of Hereford asked about VAT relief. I shall attempt to go over some of the ground which the noble Lord, Lord Henley, covered. The Government are sympathetic to the problems the Churches face with such costs but there is no possibility of removing VAT. Under European legal agreements, in the form of the sixth VAT directive, the UK does not have the option to create any new zero rates or to extend the scope of existing zero rates. To change European law would require the unanimous agreement of all finance ministers of the European Union. However, one of the main aims of the Government's review of charities' taxation is to inform the Government of the views of the charitable sector prior to any future debate with our European partners on VAT social reliefs. The concerns of the Churches have been clearly expressed not only here today but during the first phase of the review in which ideas and suggestions have been asked for. We will be taking up the matter again to see whether we can secure any way forward. I recognise the tremendous difficulties in which this places churches and cathedrals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para328"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford referred to the charity funds raised and to the core services that ought to be rendered by the National Health Service. I shall certainly see that the point he was making is brought to the attention of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State. However, in saying that, I think he would agree with me that the demands on the health service are many and varied. We have put extra funds into the health service, but there will always be great demands on the service.
<P>


<a name="column_1279"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1279</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para329"></a>Many noble Lords said that the ban on the on-line lotteries is hitting small charities. However, I have said that the views expressed so forcefully tonight will be brought to the attention of the Minister drawing up the Bill. We have heard many varied speeches in the debate. It was right that noble Lords who are involved in charities and are proud of them should bring that to the attention of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para330"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, referred to the Order of St. John and asked what is medical and what is not medical in relation to the review. The case of St. John has been raised as part of the review and it will certainly be looked into. We did not bring the problem about but inherited it from the previous government. Nevertheless, that does not make it any less painful to the noble Baroness. She is right in saying that an appeal has been made to the VAT tribunal. We are awaiting a date for the appeal. We shall have a comprehensive look at it because there is a need to clear up this matter. I hope that we can get a satisfactory outcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para331"></a>My noble friend Lord Ponsonby asked about the compact between the Government and the voluntary sector. I have dealt with a good many of the points of concern in that area. He also asked about core funding, a matter which was mentioned by a number of speakers. It is certainly something that needs to be looked at. It is not much good going for a project and, when it ends, the charity being left without the funds necessary to carry on its normal business. That can be a hindrance to the charity and it is certainly one of the points at which we shall be looking.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para332"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Westbury, referred to administrative costs. The Charity Commission monitors administrative costs and it will challenge any charity whose costs seem unjustified or markedly out of line with similar charities. That is an important point. It is very necessary that we keep these matters under review. The noble Lord, Lord Hayhoe, raised similar points and asked about "Pronto!". I say again to him that he would not want me to pre-empt what may come out of the review. He has raised the matter with me before tonight. I shall ensure that his views are brought to the attention of the people concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para333"></a>We seem to be well-fitted as regards ex-Speakers of the other place tonight. I admire all the work done by the noble Lord, Lord Weatherill. He was quite right to talk about the Prince's Trust which he represents which helps the under-privileged and also the Action Trust which sets up young people in business. I know that the matter has been looked at, but we need to see whether there can be a fast track procedure. Once again, I shall bring that to the attention of those concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para334"></a>I now pass to the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, who raised quite a few points. He asked what were the aims of the review and I have already explained that. He asked about the simplification of charity taxation and to inform the Government's negotiating position in any EC review of social relief. He raised a number of points. The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, asked about telephone helplines. I may be able to give him some good news because the Home Office will be providing a <P>


<a name="column_1280"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1280</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>grant towards the core costs of the Telephone Helplines Association, which as many noble Lords know, is the umbrella body. I hope that is welcome news to him.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para335"></a>I now refer to the noble Baroness, Lady Hooper, who asked me a number of questions. She spoke quite rightly about the efforts that go into educational trusts and taking people overseas. That is very important indeed. She spoke about the Millennium Fund. I say to her that at the moment discussion is taking place about that. I hope that those points of view will be made known and put in the paper. It is a matter that should be looked into. I certainly undertake to bring it to the attention of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para336"></a>I shall now try to deal with several matters raised by Lord Chorley. He asked why local authorities have tax advantages which are not available to charities. Local taxation has to bear the costs of many services which local authorities undertake. Council taxpayers also have to bear the burden of those services. If what the noble Lord suggests was done, it would reduce the services which local authorities can provide. The only alternative would be to increase council tax to cover that. However, charities have a different range of tax concessions unique to them, which are designed to support their valuable role. Charities also undertake some activities in which they are in competition with the commercial sector for local authority contracts. Therefore, it would be difficult to treat charities differently for tax purposes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-04_para337"></a>I hope that I have dealt with as much as I can in the 25 minutes that I have had to address the House. There was a great deal of common ground among all speakers. I hope that I have said enough tonight to demonstrate that the Government are determined to play their part in making charities not only important and a cornerstone, but to work with them in order to create a better climate for them to work in. We hope that we shall make this vision a reality. I once again thank all noble Lords for their very valuable contributions.

<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am most grateful to the House for allowing me to bring before it once again some of the complexities of time, perhaps to make the public more aware of just how complex they are and also perhaps to give an opportunity to the Government to correct them before the millennium starts.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para1"></a>I must make clear at the outset that this Question has not been raised as an indirect means of criticising the Dome at Greenwich, its costs or its contents. I see the Government's objective regarding the Dome as a genuine attempt to divert, satisfy and educate the general public in the year of the millennium--a goal which I heartily support.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para2"></a>Am I not correct in saying that it follows a long tradition in populist government, which was commented on as long as 2,000 years ago by the Roman poet Decimus Juvenal? Did he not use the immortal phrase, pane et circenses to describe bread and games of the circus with which the Caesars used to divert the people from the anxieties of everyday life?
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para3"></a>I believe that the Dome is something along the same lines. As I say, I support it but with two possible provisos to this approach. By all means let the Government help us enjoy the occasion to the fullest, but does a government of today, in order to remain popular, have to feed the people with scientific facts, as they are perceived, rather than with the scientific truth? I believe that the majority of noble Lords are aware that the sun is perceived to revolve around the Earth. The scientific truth is otherwise, as we all know. Galileo Galilei in 1633 risked his life and virtually lost his reputation by making the public statement,

<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para4"></a>I shall return to this question later.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para5"></a>Meanwhile, there is another problem, of how best to maximise the national income from the promotion of these celebrations. How can this be achieved successfully if Britain remains outside the European time zone? Is the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, not aware of the loss of potential franchise income to the British communications industry, which is just one example, which will arise by celebrating the arrival of the new millennium at least one hour later than the rest of Europe? I am sure that the noble Lord is aware that the world may be unable to watch the celebrations in the Dome, as has been predicted by the Minister without Portfolio, because Europe will have gone to bed and the Americas will not yet be awake.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para6"></a>Is the noble Lord also aware that the world may be surprised that the so-called "modern" Britain still apparently wishes to retain an outdated time scale on its statute book and that the Dome displays an architect's model with the historic rather than the correct prime meridian?
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para7"></a>The focus of my Question is to try to ensure that visitors to Greenwich and the Dome are given correct rather than perceived scientific and historic facts about the millennium celebrations on 1st January 2000 and in particular the co-ordinates of time, place and date with which Greenwich has been historically linked for the <P>


<a name="column_1282"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>past 300 years. For example, the prime meridian, or the longitude line zero, is not--and I quote from the new Millennium Experience pamphlet,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"defined by the line drawn on the eye-piece of the large 'Transit Circle' telescope in the Old Royal Observatory", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para8"></a>as it was defined in the Treaty of Washington 1884. That information is out of date. The Ordnance Survey customer information sheet of September 1997 states more correctly that the new prime meridian for the millennium will be defined by the IT and ET reference frames of 1989.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para9"></a>I am asking the Government to ensure that the new prime meridian--now calculated to an accuracy of centimetres by global positioning system satellites--will be clearly indicated on the ground to visitors to Greenwich and the dome. Furthermore, I am asking the Government whether they will have the courage and imagination during the term of the British presidency to persuade the European Union to adopt a new European time zone based on the ETRF89 prime meridian at Greenwich.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para10"></a>After all, is not time intended to be the main theme of the dome? Was not Greenwich selected in preference to Manchester, Edinburgh or Cardiff because of its 300-year history of accurate timekeeping? Then why does there appear to be so much confusion over this subject? I wonder whether it is because the Government apparently require two senior Ministers to be responsible for time--the Minister with responsibility for science and technology, for the leap second of the national time scale and the Minister of State, Home Department for summer time? Is not that the equivalent of having one Minister responsible for the big hand and another for the small hand of public time? Does that anomaly explain why noble Lords, including myself, received a negative response to suggestions in previous debates? Is it incomprehension or the duality of departmental responsibility that is the root cause of that silence?
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para11"></a>Will the Minister confirm that the Prime Minister has stated on a number of occasions that it is his intention that the New Millennium Experience should bequeath a permanent legacy to not only the citizens of Greenwich but the nation? Does the Minister consider that the rebirth of GMT as Greenwich meridian time, as a new local time for both Britain and Europe, would be a fitting legacy after the celebrations are over? Would not that be a more permanent legacy than the empty marquee on a desolate mudbank that will await the removal vans on 1st January 2001?
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para12"></a>As the Government are aware, 1st January 2001 is the real beginning of the third millennium, but most people have indicated that they wish to celebrate the occasion from 1st January 2000. I do not argue with that because I shall be joining them. The difference in dates is historic rather than scientific and was recognised as such at the beginning of this century. The newspapers of the period reported that the 20th century was to be publicly recognised as starting on 1st January 1901, not 1900. That was because the official date of Christendom should have been 0 AD not 1 AD--whereas the historical birth is put at between 4 BC and 7 BC, according to Lambeth Palace.
<P>


<a name="column_1283"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para13"></a>The first year of the new Christian calendar, which I think was designated by Pope John I, was 1 AD--anno domini, in the year of the Lord--rather than 0 AD because the zero was not available in Europe until about 200 years later. Interestingly, the term BC, meaning before Christ, to register the years prior to 1 AD was not created until about 1,000 years later, in 1681. The terms BC and AD to define the years of Christendom are, I understand, about to fall out of use. Perhaps the right reverend Prelate will put me right, but that is what I have been told. I understand that new terms--BCE and CE--might be possible replacements, with BCE standing for Before Christian Era and CE for Christian Era. Non-Christian countries and, I suppose, agnostics may prefer to interpret the letter C as standing for the "common" era of all humanity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para14"></a>Might not the Christian Churches call a special ecumenical committee to agree those terms before the start of the new millennium, so that the year 1 CE could be internationally recognised as the official start of the Christian or common era? The years before 1 CE would be known as BCE--before Christian or common era. My concern is that if there is no general clarification or standardisation, software organisations such as Microsoft might select terms of their own choosing. It is unlikely in my view that such terms would pay deference to Church history. The millennium bug, which is causing so much trouble in IT systems in Government and the private sector, has been caused by the failure of designers correctly to identify the co-ordinates of time and date. I hope that clarifying BC and AD to BCE and CE will allow them to become a standardised IT protocol that will see us through to the next millennium.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para15"></a>I understand that more than &#163;1 million per day is being spent and will continue to be spent on the dome celebrations, until 1st January 2000. They are primarily intended to illustrate in dramatic form "modern" Britain's achievements past, present and future. Can the noble Lord the Minister say why we as a nation will not be celebrating that momentous occasion together with, and at the same time as, the rest of Europe? Why will so-called "modern" Britain still have an outdated time scale on the statute book, when the rest of Europe and the industrial world have accepted as the default time scale since 1975 atomic or co-ordinated universal time? Is not this the moment, while there is still time before the new millennium, to ask the Select Committee on Science and Technology to form a special sub-committee to investigate the question of how British time is presented to the public, Europe and the outside world?
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para16"></a>Does not the noble Lord agree that if such a sub-committee were to be formed, it should have the widest possible terms of reference? They would of course include the ability to recommend rationalisation of the responsibilities of the two departments currently responsible for time into one--the most suitable being the Department for Trade and Industry, which has a scientific section. Does the Minister agree also that such a sub-committee could investigate the best methods of harmonising British civil time with European time--either by introducing a new civil time scale, as I have <P>


<a name="column_1284"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1284</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suggested, or equalising the values of the existing time zones between Britain and Europe? Does the Minister agree that the sub-committee could also have powers to recommend whether or not the referendum on entry to the European monetary system should include the question of time harmonisation?
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para17"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will not be advised by his department to ignore suggestions, as has happened on previous occasions, and that he understands that matters of deep principle underlie the specific questions that I have raised in this Unstarred Question. If I receive a negative response regarding recognition of the scientific facts, that will merely confirm the situation for me this evening--just as it did for Galileo Galilei some 365 years ago. The date of 1st January 2001 CE may mark the birth of a new Dark Age--an era of virtual reality in which Church and state could find it more convenient to replace factual reality with their own perception of what is real. I hope that I am proved wrong.

<P>
<A NAME="80304-05_spnew0"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Lichfield: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to say that I have not had the benefit of listening to previous debates or discussions on this subject, but I had been made aware that a word from the Churches would be welcome. I believe that there would be general agreement among the Churches that we may not know the precise date of Christ's birth at Bethlehem. It is very possible, therefore, that we may celebrate the third millennium on the wrong meridian, with the wrong time scale and in the wrong year. But perhaps the wrong year may not be that far out.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para18"></a>My friend and colleague the Dean of Lichfield, in my own diocese, is both an eminent New Testament scholar and an ancient historian. He informs me that, as the noble Lord said, a date between 4 BC and 7 BC is favoured by many scholars for the birth of Christ-- 4 BC being the same year in which Herod the Great died. If 4 BC is correct and if we are concerned about the particular year of Christ's birth, it means that the 2,000th anniversary of His birth already happened in 1996, so the Dome is therefore already four years behind schedule--if 4 BC is correct.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para19"></a>Other scholars within the Churches and Christendom generally would look at it from another point of view. Although the event of Christ's birth is of great importance to Christianity, there would be general agreement that the climactic events recorded in the New Testament are not Christmas Day, but Good Friday and Easter Day. In those events, so the Church believes, death itself was defeated and evil routed. But, again, those key events probably took place in AD 30 or thereabouts, so that a strong body of opinion which sees those events as the centre of the Christian era would hold that there is still a generation to go before an even more important celebration is due.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para20"></a>My real point is this: such issues as the precise dating of Christ's birthday--I shall be interested to hear what the Minister says about the suggested committee to consider the scientific issues--as raised by the noble Lord's Unstarred Question are secondary to the <P>


<a name="column_1285"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1285</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Church's understanding of the heart of the matter. The heart of the matter for a Christian mind is the coming of Christ. I must advise the noble Lord that I have no news or evidence of a discussion in the Churches about switching to BCE and CE. The key issue for a Christian mind is not whether we can put an exact date on the coming of Christ, but the meaning which the coming of Christ gives to human history in terms of new personal purpose, new direction and new hope.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para21"></a>Recently at Question Time, a Member of your Lordships' House asked bluntly, "Whose birthday is it anyway?" A lot of heads turned towards these Benches. The answer now from this person on this Bench is that, in the Church's view, it is the birthday of the Son of God into the course of human history, thereby giving to all time and all history, including our own individual lives, new purpose, new priorities and new hope.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para22"></a>On a Christian view, time is not to be killed. Time is a highly precious commodity. Even a new millennium is a time not merely to be celebrated, which is why arguments about dates and domes are secondary in the Christian view. Instead, all time--not just millennium time--is precious because it can be used for the greatest benefit to mankind and for the loving purposes of God.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para23"></a>All the Churches in England have therefore set themselves this task as the millennium draws near: to forge a living link between the fact of Christ's birth, the year 2000 and, even more importantly, the possibility of personal meaning and public hope. In the Churches' strategy there are three clear messages, which have been widely accepted by all the Churches in these islands: "A New Start at Home"; "A New Start for the World's Poor"--that is the practical issue relating to the preciousness of time--and "A New Start with God".
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para24"></a>In my own West Midlands diocese, for example, we plan to make "A New Start At Home" in those areas of the diocese which have suffered the large collapse of manufacturing industry. I refer to places such as Wolverhampton, Walsall and Black Country communities such as Tipton and West Bromwich. In those areas brave efforts have been made by agencies such as the Black Country Development Corporation with regard to land reclamation, the detoxification of old mine shafts and the creation of new prime sites to attract Japanese, European and American investment. Those are examples of using the preciousness of time to benefit people's lives. However, as the Church sees it, in my area, urban regeneration with its new roads and prime sites leaves one huge task unfinished. I refer to the task of "people regeneration" and to the regeneration of community life, family life and personal life. That is what, for us, the millennium is about.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para25"></a>In my own diocese, therefore, the year 2000 does not mean arguments about dates and domes; it means developing the splendid work of Christian truancy workers, guiding truanting children and neglectful families back to the community of the school. The millennium in my diocese means the strengthening of our partnership in relevant industrial training schemes. It means the opening of community care centres, like the one I opened last Sunday in Bilston with the local Member of Parliament, where life-long learning, <P>


<a name="column_1286"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1286</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>industrial retraining and care for the well being of families and children can grow. For us, that is what the millennium is about.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para26"></a>Finally, aside from the scientific debate which is important in its own way, if the millennium truly is to honour the one whose birthday it is, we need to set up another signpost--of greater freedom for the world's poor. We need a new start not only at home, but also for the world's poor. More than a century after slaves were officially freed, millions in the world are now in bondage because of crippling debt, compounding itself over and over in a dark spiral. I lost a daughter in a place near the Equator in East Africa where no medical facilities were available to save her life. There are still no medical facilities there--and that is because that country is too busy repaying its debts instead of spending its money on those vital issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para27"></a>In conclusion, I am suggesting that our minds need not be too greatly preoccupied with precise questions--but I wish the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, good fortune with his scientific committee--concerning the right meridian, the right time scale and the right year. Rather, at this new millennium, I suggest that our minds might be more profitably addressed to the deeper implications of whose birthday it is in terms of more effective action for justice, peace and the greatest benefit for mankind.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, I must first congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, on the ingenuity of his Unstarred Question. He asks about the claims by three different bodies about three different things, so in theory there could be nine different answers. However, I think it important to state at the outset that at least some of the bodies in question have not made a claim in quite the way he expresses it. Noble Lords have gone beyond the apparently conflicting physics of the millennium into more spiritual considerations and deliberations on society.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para28"></a>However, the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, raised serious points of science and I should like to deal with those first. I start with the question, "What is the year when the next millennium starts?" The noble Lord is absolutely right that the next millennium will begin on 1st January 2001. The Government are aware of that, but the decision has been taken to concentrate millennium celebrations across the country throughout the year 2000 as all inquiries indicate that that is the year in which the public wish to mark it. There is some logic in this. One might say that the year 2000 is an extended New Year's Eve for the year 2001. After all, it is on 31st December of each year that we see the maximum amount of celebration, not the first day of the new year. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, that the remainder of Europe also appears to be celebrating the new millennium with us in the year 2000.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para29"></a>I move to the scientific question of what is the right or wrong meridian. Certainly, there are two meridians at Greenwich but, unlike lines of latitude where nature provides us with an obvious reference in the equator, the reference point for lines of longitude is arbitrary. I do not say that all lines of longitude are equally good <P>


<a name="column_1287"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1287</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because it is important that the reference is well defined and capable of being measured, but within these constraints we have a choice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para30"></a>The noble Lord has mentioned the prime meridian. This is the most familiar meridian which is indicated by a brass strip in the courtyard of the observatory. But this is not the only meridian at Greenwich. To demonstrate that this does not matter the noble Lord will be aware of what happened about 50 years ago when the Ordnance Survey repeated the triangulation of the country which originally took place in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. As part of the new survey, observations were taken to connect other stations with the instrument sitting on Airy's meridian, the one indicated by the brass strip. To the surprise of the surveyors there was a discrepancy in longitude equivalent to about eight metres--far greater than could be attributed to errors in observation, even in the 18th century.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para31"></a>The discrepancy was explained by the Royal Observatory's then chief assistant. In 1840 the seventh Astronomer Royal, Sir George Airy, had decided to install a larger meridian instrument and wished to operate both instruments for a while to ensure continuity of measurement. As a result, Airy's instrument was installed six metres to the east of Bradley's. To this day, Ordnance Survey maps still use Bradley's meridian. But the fact that different meridians are in use does not matter as long as we know the relationships between them. Physics has moved on in the past century, and it continues today. Because the earth's crust is constantly moving, a meridian line firmly fixed to the ground in one place is not ideal for work of the highest accuracy. The scientific community therefore now uses for practical purposes a frame of reference known as the Terrestrial Reference Frame of the International Earth Rotation Service. This reference frame is based on observations of satellites and celestial radio sources known as quasars made from various co-ordinated stations around the globe. It is designed so as not to rotate as the tectonic plates move around with respect to each other. The effect of this is that any meridian fixed to the surface of the earth will move with respect to the reference frame.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para32"></a>At the latitude of Greenwich the meridian of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame is about 100 metres to the east of Airy or prime meridian. The movements of the tectonic plate on which we sit are quite small--only a few centimetres a year--and do not explain the 100 metre difference. However the International Terrestrial Reference Frame was a successor to an older reference frame that used about 80 observatories around the world. The positions of these were determined using the astronomical methods and time measurements available at the time, and it appears that an error crept in somewhere along the way. But, as with the meridian used for Ordnance Survey maps, it does not matter which meridian is used provided we know where it is. I hope that that deals with the noble Lord's concerns about the meridian.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para33"></a>I turn to the question of time. Time and longitude were for centuries intimately connected. The noble Lord is an expert on time. He will be aware that for most <P>


<a name="column_1288"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column 1288</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>practical purposes we now use a time scale based on atomic clocks. In theory this is independent of position. I say "in theory" because the time scale in question, Co-ordinated Universal Time, is not pure atomic time, but a timescale which, by adding occasional leap seconds, has been kept to closer than one second of what I shall call familiarly Greenwich Mean Time. By these means the link between time scale that we all use, often without realising it, and longitude has been maintained.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para34"></a>I cannot speak for the British Horological Federation, but I do not think that either the National Physical Laboratory or the Ordnance Survey, which is the body that I believe the noble Lord means when he refers to the national mapping agency of Great Britain in the title of his debate, has ever claimed that we will be celebrating the next millennium on the wrong meridian with the wrong time scale. What they have done is to describe what happens for scientific purposes, and that may not be the same as people's perceptions. I ask the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, to be a little tolerant of people's perceptions. The Government have to be, and perhaps that explains some of our actions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para35"></a>When and where will the 1st January 2000 begin? The basis for the beginning of the universal day was decided at the International Meridian Conference in 1884 when it was decided that the universal day would be a mean solar day beginning at the moment of mean midnight at Greenwich. Today, this can be interpreted to mean many things. On the one hand, perhaps it means that we should refer to the time according to a mean sun on the meridian currently used for astronomical purposes; namely, the one that is 100 metres to the east of the brass strip. On the other hand, perhaps we should apply the same principle as we apply to Ordnance Survey maps and Bradley's meridian and refer to it as the meridian in use in 1884. If so, we would refer to the brass strip in the courtyard. Whichever meridian we use as our reference, at most it is 100 metres from the brass strip in the courtyard at Greenwich. A difference in longitude at Greenwich of 100 metres is equivalent to a difference in time of about one third of a second. Moreover, whichever time scale we use--Co-ordinated Universal Time or one of the three forms of universal time--we would be within one second of Greenwich Mean Time. All in all, there may be an uncertainty of a second or so at the start of the millennium celebrations, but I join the right reverend Prelate in asking: does it really matter?
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para36"></a>No one can deny the important role that the Greenwich Observatory has played in time, measurement and navigation. Greenwich is still synonymous with time throughout the world. What is a second or so in the context of something which only happens once every thousand years?
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-05_para37"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, spoke of the advantages of our being on European time. He pointed out that if we were to harmonise time across the European Union we would be celebrating the beginning of the millennium at the same time as the rest of the Continent. I understand from the Secretary of State for Home Affairs that there are no plans at present for the United Kingdom to move to central European time.

<A NAME = "80304-05_para38"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, also suggested that the Committee on Science and Technology could look into the question of time. I should point out that that committee is independent of the government. This matter is best raised with its chairman, Lord Phillips. I met him today in the corridor and mentioned the matter to him. He asked me to write to him and although the Select Committee is very busy on other matters I am sure that he will take the noble Lord's suggestion into consideration.

<A NAME="80304-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Tanlaw: </B>   My Lords, that is not what I suggested. I suggested that a time zone, British civil time, be called Greenwich Meridian Time, based on the Meridian at Greenwich, which would cover 15 degrees east or west of Greenwich, that is the central parts of Europe. I did not confuse it with UTC.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for pointing out that matter. I shall write to him regarding that suggestion when I have looked at it in detail.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-06_para0"></a>The millennium is an important occasion and it is only right that we look at what may happen. A thousand years ago ignorance and superstition were such that people thought the world would end at the end of the first millennium; indeed, preparations were made for that event. At the second millennium we are at least looking forward to the future. We are using the power of our knowledge, curiosity, imagination and audacity to see what the future holds in store. We can anticipate the future, but we cannot necessarily predict it. That is what we hope the Millennium Dome and the Millennium Experience will do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-06_para1"></a>As the celebration of the millennium is also a time to celebrate technological and engineering achievements, it is right that the celebration should be in Greenwich, which is the birthplace of the science of accurate navigation and time measurement; and this was achieved in a wonderful spirit of enlarging and extending science. Over the centuries it has effected every aspect of our lives.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-06_para2"></a>I urge noble Lords to look up from the strips marking the lines of longitude at Greenwich and join the right reverend Prelate in recognising what a wonderful feat of engineering and technological achievement the Dome will be. I cannot agree with the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, that it can be likened to Roman games because the Dome will be the largest cable and fabric building ever built, covering 20 acres and standing 50 metres high. It will reflect those things that will make a difference to our lives, not only science and technology but pride in our achievements, our ingenuity and creativity, our bravery and sense of justice and fair play, our modernity and confidence in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-06_para3"></a>I agree with the right reverend Prelate that dates and times are secondary. He is concerned that the Churches should be involved in the plans for a national millennium celebration. The Lambeth Group has been set up to ensure that the millennium celebrations are accessible and of relevance to all parts of our multi-faith society. The group involves the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Millennium Commission, the New Millennium Experience Company, the main Christian denominations, ecumenical bodies and representatives of other faiths.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-06_para4"></a>The right reverend Prelate spoke of the Churches' new start. They have their own full programme of events focused on Pentecost 2000. The government are discussing with the churches the timing and location of national church services to mark the millennium.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-06_para5"></a>The Millennium Commission is funding a wide variety of church projects which benefit the entire community and will help with what the right reverend Prelate called "people regeneration" in the Church and elsewhere. The necessity to create jobs and improve the environment, to which he referred, are not just matters for the millennium but for all time. The Government take that as a serious part of their task.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-06_para6"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, for putting down this Question and giving us the opportunity to explain the scientific facts. I thank the right reverend Prelate for introducing the more spiritual aspects of celebrating the millennium. That is a topical and important matter. I thank noble Lords for their contributions.

However when I read "the House of Commons" in the Bill I assumed this was simply an oversight rather than a deliberate attempt on the part of the draftsman to insult your Lordships. It seems to me that the Government must have meant "Parliament", and therefore I put down this amendment in order to make the Bill say what the Government must have meant. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="80304-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I support the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, and the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. Indeed, if I had noticed it I would have added my name to that amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-06_para9"></a>My amendment, Amendment No. 21, which is grouped with Amendment No. 20, is simply an attempt to draw out from the Minister the timing involved. One could imagine laying a copy of this letter before the House of Commons or Parliament some considerable time after it had been written, so I have put in,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"as soon as practicable after the notice has been issued to the Bank". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-06_para10"></a>That is very broad. I accept that it may not be practical to do that the next day or the next week, and there may be compelling reasons for not doing so, but I would like some indication from the Government, even an assurance on the record, that the Government would lay the letter before Parliament as quickly as possible.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Let us start today's proceedings in a good spirit. We accept my noble friend's amendment. Whoever it was--and I do not know--who put "the House of Commons" will be taken out to the courtyard in the centre of the Treasury building and publicly flogged, and your Lordships will be invited. However, I emphasise that we have not yet found out who it is, and probably will not.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-06_para11"></a>The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, deals with the same subject. It would not otherwise have been grouped with Amendment No. 20. However, it is unnecessary. Typically, we stated that we would be <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>announcing changes of this sort, as has been the practice, in the Budget and, as the noble Lord knows, the Budget is accompanied by full documentation--excessively full documentation--which is made available as soon as the Chancellor sits down. We do that in the context of strenuous efforts by the Government to improve the transparency of policy-making. We have introduced the Pre-Budget Report in which many of the issues which will arise in the Budget are discussed. In particular, in the Pre-Budget Report we have announced our intention to publish a code for fiscal stability, which will enshrine in legislation rules for reporting on the public finances. It will also include a statement of how the Government intend to operate fiscal policy, both in the short term and in the long term. I believe the Committee would agree that we are not being negligent on the issue of transparency.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-06_para12"></a>With the assurance that we will always do this as soon as practicable, and when, as is normal, it is done in the Budget it will be done immediately. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

Page 5, line 37, leave out from ("Bank") to (", and") in line 38.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80304-06_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: We now move to Clause 13, where the Bill outlines details of those who will be the members of the Monetary Policy Committee. This is one of three amendments which are linked, which are all concerned with the method of appointment of the members of the committee. As I pointed out on Second Reading, the appointment of all the members of the committee seem to involve the Chancellor's hand, either directly or indirectly. I have tabled a number of amendments which I hope might achieve a slightly more independent look to the Bank--that is, independent of the Chancellor.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-06_para18"></a>Amendment No. 22 is the first of those amendments. It deals with the two members who are to be appointed by the Governor of the Bank after consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Those two members are described in Clause 13(3) which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(a) one shall be a person who has executive responsibility within the Bank for monetary policy analysis, and </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>

<A NAME = "80304-06_para19"></a>I am puzzled as to what point in time the Chancellor will have a hand in the appointment. Will he have a hand in the appointment of the executive whose responsibility within the Bank is for monetary policy analysis, or will he have a hand in the appointment of taking that executive, or perhaps another, and putting him on the MPC, or will it be done simultaneously? It seems to me that if the Bank is appointing somebody who will have these executive functions, appointments <P>

"after consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80304-07_para0"></a>After all, if the Chancellor of the Exchequer has appointed the Governor and the deputy governors, he has decided that they are sufficiently reliable men and women to be able to appoint these two executives to these two senior positions and the Monetary Policy Committee, without the Chancellor having a further role in their appointments. It is not much of a change, but it would go some way towards taking out the hand of the Chancellor as regards those appointments. I can see no harm in this, given that the kind of people who will fill these two posts will clearly be defined by their need to be experts in monetary policy analysis and monetary policy operation. I would like to think that the Government might be able to make some sympathetic noises to that amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-07_para1"></a>The next amendment, Amendment No. 23, deals with Clause 13(2)(c). I shall call these the away members of the team as opposed to the home members--the Governor, the deputy governor and the two employees. I have no problem with the four current away members, aside from a problem which I shall draw to your Lordships' attention later, in that they are drawn from a fairly narrow band of people. They all share some common factors, and I shall address that later with the noble Lord, Lord Montague of Oxford. However, here I am concerned with how they are appointed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-07_para2"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, is here today, I shall not quote him on the different kinds of monetary theorists and how they have changed our mind over time so that yesterday's received wisdom is today's heresy and vice versa. However, the way in which the appointments are made is important. They could indeed come from the same stable of economic thought--perish the thought--which has the Chancellor's ear, or worse, they could come from the stable of the members' supporters or donors of the Labour Party.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-07_para3"></a>The last government decided, with the total support of the Opposition--and indeed, some may say under pressure from the Opposition--to change the whole way in which people are appointed to quangos. The report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nolan, certainly brought that about: adverts are placed, interviews are conducted, and names are suggested to Ministers. It is a simple fact that Ministers can no longer appoint people to quangos in the way they once did; namely, from a list of the great and the good. They have to go through a selection process. The same should be done here.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-07_para4"></a>There is not a more important quango in the land than the Monetary Policy Committee. It has been given a very special and important role by the Government, and we ought to look at the possibility of the appointments being made along the lines suggested by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nolan. Indeed, in Committee in the other place, Mr. Geoffrey Robinson, after congratulating my honourable friend Tim Boswell, who introduced a similar amendment there, on the manner and tone in which he had moved his serious amendment, indicated that the Government would like to consider <P>


<a name="column_CWH72"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH72</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the matter and if my honourable friend would not press it to a vote they would consider what had been said, without commitment, and I appreciate that he said "without commitment". I should be interested to hear what the Government now think about the way in which we should appoint the four away-team members of the Monetary Policy Committee, and whether we should be using a more Nolan-like procedure with adverts and appointments. The adverts, of course, would clearly state the skills and expertise that would be required of anybody who applied.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-07_para5"></a>The last point returns to a matter I talked about yesterday regarding the court, but here it is more important and more serious than the court; that is, whether or not members of the away team--if I may continue to call them that--should be appointed for only three years, or if they should have appointments lasting five years, as do the members of the home team--the Governor, the deputy governor and the two deputy governors who are appointed for five years. I am putting this down because, again, it reinforces the independence of the four outside members. As noble Lords know, the Fed, for example, is a 14-year appointment--and I should not dream of suggesting anything as long as that--the Bundesbank is eight and the Bank of France is nine. Therefore, I am being quite modest in my suggestion of five years. I know we discussed yesterday that perhaps in five years the person appointed might get out of date, or might leave the employment or the field of expertise that led to the Chancellor appointing him. However, that is very unlikely and, if we are not appointing those people along the lines of the Nolan Committee, I hope that the suggestion will not be prayed in aid that other committees of non-executive directors last for only three years before they are re-elected, or, in this case, reappointed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-07_para6"></a>The Minister told us about the staggering of appointments yesterday and I presume the four appointments will be made in exactly the same way in order to have some kind of rolling programme. Perhaps he might say something about that because there are only four members here, unlike the courts where there are 16 members, and it is easier to have a rolling programme with 16 members than it is with only four.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-07_para7"></a>It would certainly look better and more independent if, first, the Governor could be relied on to appoint the two employees of the Bank appointed for their expertise; secondly, if the Government would consider using the Nolan procedures for the appointment of these important people; and, thirdly, if they would consider a five-year term rather than a three-year term, which, as I said yesterday, would take people beyond the length of the lifetime of one Parliament, or indeed one Chancellor. It would also mean that it would not be so easy for a Chancellor to clear out the whole lot if he did not particularly like what they were doing, and put in his own men over the space of only three years. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Much of what the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, has said strikes a chord with me as being something one would not obviously wish to oppose. If he is mistaken, I certainly would like to hear from my noble friend why he is mistaken.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH73"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH73</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-07_para8"></a>As regards five years, it seems to me quite reasonable that five years rather than three years is the sort of period for which people should be appointed to the Monetary Policy Committee. My general view is that people serve on committees for far too long. The last time, many years ago, that I had an influence on these matters, I learnt that people could serve on committees for 20 or more years and it was still felt that it was premature to suggest that someone should replace them. Therefore, I am not one who believes in indefinite membership of committees. As noble Lords will know, in connection with at least one of the things I have done in your Lordships' House, I am a great believer in resigning before people ask, "Why is he still doing this job?". I would, therefore, prefer five years rather than three years. I am not going for an indefinite period and I certainly do not believe that there should be any presumption, having appointed someone to this committee, that he should be reappointed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-07_para9"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 23, I have taken it for granted that from now on all future appointments will be precisely along these lines. It is sad that our society is such that we need all these Nolan guidelines, but I have certainly taken it for granted that that would happen generally across the public sector and so on. Even if it has not happened in this specific case, bearing in mind the informality (because the Bill is not yet law), I had assumed that in future--we are talking a little way ahead now--these posts would be advertised. Again, I shall be interested to hear what my noble friend says about likely future arrangements.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-07_para10"></a>Let me emphasise that the reason for this is not that I distrust the Chancellor, nor for one moment that I would have thought he would be choosing people who had the same view of the way the economy works as he has--assuming that he has such a view to start with--but simply that nowadays we have to behave in that way. I am not suggesting for one moment that the people currently appointed are not properly appointed and would not meet the Nolan guidelines, but I should like to think that in future we would do it anyway.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-07_para11"></a>If those views are mistaken, I should like to hear from my noble friend why they are mistaken, but they do strike a chord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Cobbold: </B>   I should like to support the amendment. I believe very strongly that the wording of subsection (2)(b) suggesting that the appointment of the two members by the Governor should be after consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer compromises the desire for independence of the Bank. It implies that the Chancellor has the ability to interfere with executive appointments within the Bank. That, I believe, must be wrong, and it would be detrimental in any large organisation. It is certainly important that the Bank should be seen to be generally independent and that the Governor should have full rights to appoint, together with the court, the executive directors.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Eatwell: </B>   Could I urge my noble friends to reject Amendment No. 22 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish? One of the <P>


<a name="column_CWH74"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH74</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>characteristics of the Monetary Policy Committee is that the payroll vote, so to speak, of the Bank of England has a majority on the committee. That is what I consider one of the more unfortunate aspects of the committee in the sense that it diminishes the impact of independent members. To accept Amendment No. 22 will simply reinforce the position of the Bank of England in the control of the payroll vote and diminish the committee's perceived independence.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980304/text/80304-08.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Montague of Oxford: </B>   I remind the Committee that yesterday I mentioned that I had been present at the Treasury Select Committee when it cross-examined the members of the Monetary Policy Committee. The Governor, when asked whether it was likely that members from the Bank would always vote as a block, said that was absolutely inconceivable: there were bound to be occasions when they would differ.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-08_para0"></a>That is very healthy. I suggest that we might mute that if we were to accept the noble Lord's amendment. The fact that those people are secure in the knowledge that they have been appointed by the Chancellor and are not beholden to the Governor will ensure that there is a degree of independence on their part and they will be far less likely to vote as a block.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I shall preface my remarks on these three amendments by saying that this is not a Bill to provide for the privatisation of the Bank of England. If it were, we could in theory have repealed the 1946 Act. That might have done the trick and we would not be spending time here. What we are doing here is introducing a rather more complex procedure for establishing a degree of independence where it is important to maintain the ultimate responsibility that the Chancellor has to have on behalf of the people of this country for monetary as well as fiscal matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-08_para1"></a>The Bank has a statutory responsibility to conduct monetary policy to meet the Chancellor's targets. The Bank is accountable to the Chancellor and, through him, to Parliament, so it is appropriate that the Chancellor should be involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-08_para2"></a>I recognise, in response to Amendment No. 22, that it is a fine line. What we are saying is that the ultimate decision on the two home-team, inside members is that of the Governor. We are providing only that there should be consultation with the Chancellor, rather than that he should make the decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-08_para3"></a>Incidentally, in case of any confusion over this, it is not necessarily that one or both of these should be directors of the Bank of England. The Bill states only that they should have executive responsibility. They are at the moment the executive directors but they could, in fact, be any one of a number of Bank employees. I say that to the noble Lord, Lord Cobbold, who made a related point. It is up to the Governor to decide who to appoint to the Monetary Policy Committee. The purpose of the requirement to consult is to ensure that the Chancellor can express a view about which of the officials the Governor wishes to appoint. It is, therefore, a fine line but we have arrived at the right side of it, rather than the wrong one.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH75"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH75</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-08_para4"></a>As far as Amendment No. 23 is concerned, the noble Lord is, in general, pushing at an open door. He is well aware that we have objected for many years to the practice which did exist of Ministers saying, "Well, we've got a vacancy here"; preferably a nicely paid vacancy, "and we will go to the Whips' Office", by which I mean the Government Whips' Office, "and see who is available to fill this vacancy". We are determined that that should not be the case. The Cabinet Office did publish a paper opening up quangos, which I recommend to your Lordships, proposing the extension of the remit of the Commissioner for Public Appointments to nationalised industries and public corporations. At the moment, he oversees appointments for executive, non-departmental public bodies and for executive National Health Service agencies. This is out for consultation. We are expecting to respond to the consultation document in the course of the next few months.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-08_para5"></a>The important point is that any proposal which extends the remit of the commissioners and, therefore, might affect the issue of the Monetary Policy Committee, does not and would not need primary legislation. It could and would be dealt with by an Order in Council. Indeed, it would be thoroughly undesirable to deal with it in primary legislation, because no doubt literally hundreds of Acts of Parliament would have to be amended in the way that is proposed now. Given our firm intention to open up public appointments generally, we think it inappropriate to put on to the face of this Bill a particular requirement for this particular committee at this particular time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-08_para6"></a>The argument for Amendment No. 29 was covered when we considered the earlier amendment relating to the court. My arguments will be similar to those I put forward then. Again, it is a matter of judgment. There are those--including some of my noble friends--who are sceptical about the Hampel Committee and the Cadbury Committee and whether they have performed any useful function. In so far as there has been consideration of this issue of corporate governance, the conclusion has been that three years is a suitable term. I recall that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, tabled an amendment which would provide for the Chancellor to cut the salaries of members of the Monetary Policy Committee if they misbehaved. I prefer a shorter term of appointment and the possibility of not being reappointed, to the more violent means apparently preferred by the noble Lord. I am, though, generally opposed to unnecessary conflict if I can possibly avoid it!
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-08_para7"></a>I can confirm that, as with the court of directors, there will be staggered timing of appointments and there is the possibility--but no presumption--of reappointments. Thereby, members could remain on the Monetary Policy Committee for three, six and--dare I say to my noble friend Lord Peston--nine years or more. I am quite sure that he would think that thoroughly undesirable.

<FONT SIZE=3>not serve excessive terms, we have come down to three years and, on balance, we feel that that is the right judgment. I would urge the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, to withdraw all the amendments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Stewartby: </B>   May I ask the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, a couple of questions? Regarding subsection (2)(b) he referred to the non-executive directors and their being appointed. Are they directors of the Bank? The second question is that if they are internal experts within the Bank of England and are appointed, and their responsibilities within the Bank change, is there a mechanism for them leaving the Monetary Policy Committee, perhaps to be replaced by the individual who took up their previous job which was specifically connected with monetary policy?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The answer to the noble Lord's first question is that the requirement in the Bill is that they should be persons who have executive responsibility. They could--but need not--be directors of the Bank.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-08_para9"></a>The answer to the second question is a matter for the Governor. If he takes the view that somebody is appointed to the Monetary Policy Committee in virtue of his particular appointment and that appointment changes, he could no doubt prevail on that person to resign his appointment and hand it over to his successor. That is not laid down, and I am not sure it ought to be laid down, as a matter of internal management on which the Chancellor would be consulted--provided that Amendment No. 22 is not carried.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-08_para10"></a>The executive directors the noble Lord refers to are on the court at the present time, but they will not be on the court when the Act comes into force.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   If I may deal with the three amendments, taking the second one first, on the Nolan Committee, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, for his explanation of where the Government are, and I appreciate that they are waiting for responses to a consultation. It sounds rather like another review, but one must not complain about that--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I should hope not.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am not sure. I think I heard the first review of a review this afternoon at Question Time, but I will leave that to one side. I appreciate what the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, has said and I hope that if the commissioner decides in the consultation to point in the direction of using the Nolan principles for major appointments like this, the Government will accept that when it comes to the Monetary Policy Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-08_para11"></a>Regarding the length of time members serve, I would be attracted to five years with no possible reappointment. I was worried when the Minister said that the appointment should be for three years and they could be appointed for another three and yet a further three, making it nine years. We are getting towards the Bank of France, the Bundesbank and even after another three years it is the Fed. I would be concerned about that. I indicated in my introduction that I did not feel <P>


<a name="column_CWH77"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH77</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that 14 years was sensible. We may have to explore this further. Even if one went along with the three years, I would be unhappy if somebody sat on the Monetary Policy Committee for more than six years considering there are only four members from outside.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-08_para12"></a>Turning to the first amendment, I am not sure whether I should not rename this the "Chancellor's Bank". It is certainly not the people's bank. The defence of the way it was worded by the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, was interesting. They did not want it to look like the Governor's Bank, yet we have just learnt that the Governor will appointment the pool from which the Chancellor will select, with the Governor's approval, the member of the Monetary Policy Committee. That is what I understood from the answer of one of the people who has executive responsibility in the Bank for monetary policy analysis--that there are a number of people in the Bank responsible for monetary policy analysis and they will have been appointed by the Governor and the court over time. The Governor will decide, "We shall have one of those on the Monetary Policy Committee", and the Chancellor will say "Yes, I am quite happy with that". That I believe is what the noble Lord said, which was in response to my question about whether the Chancellor would have a say in the original appointment to the job in the Bank, not the Monetary Policy Committee. I hope I am making myself clear about that, but I believe I understood what the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, said.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-08_para13"></a>I am a little disappointed that we did not make a little progress on even one of those amendments. All of them are designed to do the same thing, and even the Government's acceptance of one of them would help; but with the small crumb of comfort that perhaps the Nolan Committee's rules might apply to the four members of the away team, I shall rest my case.

<P>
<A NAME="80304-08_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Before the noble Lord withdraws the amendment, I am sure it is benign, but he was putting words into my mouth which I did not say. I did not say that the Chancellor can say yes or no. The Chancellor can express an opinion but ultimately it is the Governor who decides.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-08_para14"></a>It seems to be a feature of this Committee that a number of noble Lords, particularly those on my side, attempt when they are summing up the amendment to put words into my mouth or to encourage me to re-phrase what I have already said. It reminds me of this. Anybody who has ever been interviewed by "World in Action" knows the trick is to ask you the same question 10 times and then use the most damaging answer. I will try to refrain from saying things more than once.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 6, line 8, at end insert (", especially in connection with the likely impact of monetary policy on the regions of the United Kingdom").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: In speaking to Amendment No. 25 in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Barnett, I note that it is also grouped with Amendments Nos. 26, 27, 31 and 32. I say to my noble friend the Minister that I am a firm believer that if something is worth saying, it is worth saying at least 10 times during the course of your Lordships' Sitting as a Committee, but I always say it in exactly the same way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para3"></a>With respect specifically to Amendment No. 25, I was aiming to hit two targets at the same time. I originally thought that something of this sort should go into Clause 11(b) where the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"including its objectives for growth and employment", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para4"></a>appear. I was trying to find wording that would refer to growth and employment in the economy as a whole and in the regions of the United Kingdom. However, listening particularly to our Second Reading debate, I reflected that many of us had views on the composition of the Monetary Policy Committee, so it seemed to me that if I put this amendment in where it is, I could both emphasise the importance of the regions of the United Kingdom and the importance of members of the Monetary Policy Committee having that kind of experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para5"></a>On the straightforward economic policy, what we have here is that if monetary policy is working, as it seems technically to do, in this country via, say, raising interest rates, that has at least some effect via the exchange rate, which in turn has some effect--adversely, of course--on manufacturing industry, which in turn then has differential effects on different parts of the country. Therefore anybody formulating monetary policy and trying to take account of Clause 11(b) must have a view of the differential effects on the regions and the importance of those regions. As I emphasised yesterday, because the word "including" is there, this seemed a fair point to make under that rubric.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para6"></a>It also struck me, as it may have struck other noble Lords, such as the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, and my noble friend Lord Montague, that at the present time the four that have been chosen look both narrowly chosen in geographical terms and also in experience terms. By geographical terms, I do not mean their country of origin or their place of birth, because I do not know either of those, but where they have lived and worked.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para7"></a>If I had ever been an inhabitant of some of the outer regions of this country, which I define as anywhere on the other side of the M.25, I would be somewhat resentful, not only here but in many other areas, about the sorts of people who are chosen in terms of their location.

<A NAME = "80304-09_para8"></a>Equally, I am sympathetic to both Amendments Nos. 26 and 27, even though it might mean less employment for academic economists and more employment for other people. One of my main criteria in deciding anything is whether this is good for academic economists, particularly those whose view of the economy is the same as mine. If we were to proceed along these lines, it might not be good for academic economists and it might not be good for old-fashioned Keynesians in particular. Occasionally, in the national interest, some of us have to rise above these things, so that I have at least some sympathy with Amendments Nos. 26 and 27. The crux of my contribution, however, is Amendment No. 25. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Montague of Oxford: </B>   I ask the Committee to be patient with me as I rehearse, yet again, some of the points that I have made earlier in support of the belief that the Monetary Policy Committee would be best served if there were a requirement on the part of the Chancellor to appoint two people who have practical experience of business and industry. Indeed, I am slightly more in favour of that view after what my noble friend Lord Peston has said. I thought he was going to say that there are plenty of economists who have practical experience in business and industry. But he did come forward to say that he is sympathetic to the view that perhaps some practical experience would be helpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para9"></a>I would just remind noble Lords of two incidents in relation to the existing Monetary Policy Committee which have worried me. The first is in respect of its view regarding increases in interest rates and the effect on wage inflation. I should point out to the Committee that, running factories as I have done up and down the country, my experience of increased interest rates is that the moment they arise, particularly when there is a subsequent increase in mortgage rates, the unions are in with a case for an immediate increase in wages. I did not like to read what I read in the last published minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para10"></a>Because I was disturbed by that, I attended the penultimate meeting of the Treasury Select Committee when it was examining the Monetary Policy Committee. Once more, based on my practical experience, it left me confused because it was being said that one of the reasons for the possibility of an increase in interest rates at the present time is the effect on asset values. I sat there thinking that that must mean housing. The members of the Treasury Select Committee were as bewildered as I was, and, when they asked for clarification, they were told that what this particular economist had in mind was the then rising price of shares. The implication was that one of the things that would help curb inflation would be a dramatic reduction in the price of shares, which I again found a little mystifying.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para11"></a>The Bill does not say that the Chancellor should only appoint economists. However, it might be argued that he is likely to do that anyway and, if so, it would be just as well if he were obliged to do it and then there could be no misunderstanding.

<A NAME = "80304-09_para12"></a>We have heard reference to the Fed. One-third of the Fed's existing membership are not economists. They come from all different strands of business and commercial life. The equivalent committee in the Fed works very well. Those are the reasons behind what I hope will have the support of your Lordships and the Government.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   In speaking to Amendment No. 27, I shall reinforce the points already made by the noble Lord, Lord Peston, and the noble Lord, Lord Montague of Oxford. There is no doubt that the Monetary Policy Committee will be important and that it will have an important impact on manufacturing industry, on business and on all parts of our country. As I said in the last debate and at Second Reading, it seemed that the furthest northerly member of the current Monetary Policy Committee came from whichever was further north, Oxford or Cambridge--in my view, neither is very far north, and certainly neither goes into the industrial areas of England, the Midlands or into Scotland or indeed Wales. We should address this problem, as the Government should address it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Montague of Oxford, homed in on the question of manufacturing industry and business. Two letters which appeared side by side in The Times on 18th February caught my eye. One was from Professor Sidney Pollard, who is not in the magic circle, living as he does in Sheffield. I will read the first and last paragraphs:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Once again the productive sectors of the economy are waiting to see whether a small committee meeting at the Bank of England will inflict further damage on them by another rise in the interest rate ... The object behind it being to hold down inflation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para14"></a>He concludes:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Altogether, the picture of a small group of people sitting around a table and raising interest rates by a minute amount, and then looking in the following weeks to see whether that has lowered inflation by a similar minute amount, must seem among the most bizarre spectacles visible in London these days". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para15"></a>I am not sure how many other spectacles might fall into that category.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para16"></a>The other letter was from a noble Lord opposite--not opposite me today in the Committee--the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Macclesfield. On 18th February he wrote that the Monetary Policy Committee:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"appears to be gearing itself up for a further interest rate increase of a quarter per cent to 7&#189; per cent on the basis of guessing rather than hard evidence". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para17"></a>He went on to talk about the question of wages, and what impact a stronger pound would have on the rate of inflation and on more and higher wage claims--exactly the point that the noble Lord, Lord Montague, has made.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para18"></a>There is a reasonable case for the Government to address on the question of somebody on the Monetary Policy Committee having some knowledge and experience of the business sector and manufacturing industry. But more than that, as I have said, there is much more to the United Kingdom than the triangle of Oxford, Cambridge and London, especially when we are moving towards a new geography in the United Kingdom of having a government in Wales and a <P>


<a name="column_CWH81"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH81</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>government in Scotland. It is certainly true that the government in Scotland will have much more power and responsibility than the government in Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para19"></a>The problem over many years has been that Scotland, Wales and the north of England have certainly suffered in times past when decisions have been made on matters such as interest rates entirely because of the position in the south-east of England. It was said in Scotland that when the south-east of England sneezes, Scotland catches a cold. It was certainly true for a number of decades after the war that the Scottish and Welsh economies would be at different stages of their economic cycle than the south-east of England. The economies of Scotland and Wales would be attempting to recover, but if the dampers were put on in the south-east of England the net result was that the recovery in Scotland and Wales would be stopped dead in its tracks.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para20"></a>I am happy to say that in the last five years the Scottish economy has done rather better than that and the evidence in this decade and towards the end of the last would suggest that the Scottish economy had broken free. However, I am not sure that that evidence is continuing. As I said yesterday, unemployment in Scotland on the last monthly figures had begun to increase, after having decreased month after month and year after year. So there is a problem there.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para21"></a>I have a similar problem with the single currency and a single interest rate over the whole of Europe. I know from my personal experience and interest in politics in Scotland over many years that a single interest rate for the United Kingdom has sometimes been of considerable disadvantage to Scotland. I have put down a marker about Scotland and Wales because much of what I have said for Scotland can certainly also be said for Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para22"></a>I accept that monetary policy may be a bit of an academic expertise. If that is the Minister's answer, I must tell him that the universities of Scotland certainly have more than their fair share of high-powered economic dons. I am pretty certain that the Chancellor could pick from one of the Scottish universities an academic expert in those matters who would be equally able to take a place on the Monetary Policy Committee. Coming, as he would, from a Scottish university, he would have knowledge and experience of what was happening in the Scottish economy at first hand.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para23"></a>I hope that the Minister will not try to say that the only decent academic monetary economists are to be found in Oxford, Cambridge or London. I am sure a few are, but I am sure that other universities have the same.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para24"></a>I have to find the appropriate page in order to introduce my other two amendments. According to Schedule 3, a person is disqualified,

<A NAME = "80304-09_para25"></a>I have suggested in Amendment No. 31 that it should not only say "is" but also "has been". That clearly indicates that I do not consider myself as a candidate for the Monetary Policy Committee, no matter the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>number of hours I have spent listening to the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, telling me about the economy and how the last government were getting it wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para26"></a>The second amendment, No. 32, is more important--if,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"he is a member of the court of directors of the Bank or has been". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para27"></a>My worry stems from this. I am sure the current members of the Monetary Policy Committee are all excellent people and I have no problem about that. However, when one looks through them, apart from the geography of where they live, there are some interesting common factors. Professor Goodhart, for example, is now the Norman Sosnow Professor of Banking and Finance at the London School of Economics, but he worked in the Bank of England for 17 years as a monetary adviser and became the chief adviser in 1980. He is hardly one of the away players, having been that closely involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para28"></a>Dr. DeAnne Julius does not have any kind of baggage of that nature. However, Sir Alan Budd has been the Chief Economic Adviser at the Treasury since 1991. That is quite interesting and on anybody's guess he is not an away player. Professor Willem Buiter I think I can excuse as well because I do not believe he has any experience. However, there are two out of the four: one who has been closely involved with the Treasury and the other closely involved with the Bank of England. Those are the four members of the away team to balance the five in-house people.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para29"></a>Without reflecting in any way on those gentlemen--the lady does not actually come into it--I believe I have made my point about the closeness of the team of people who are the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee. I started off just being concerned about Scotland's manufacturing industry, but when I read the press release from the Treasury telling me who the four members were, I became even more concerned about the independence--if I can call it that--in more general terms of the away members of the team.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para30"></a>I hope that the Minister can give me some comfort on all of those issues. They are important, and if the Monetary Policy Committee has to make difficult decisions--which indeed it will have to do, otherwise the Chancellor would not have passed the buck to it; if the decision about interest rates was easy he would have kept it for himself--these important decisions have to be made, in my view, by people who are seen by the whole of the United Kingdom to be knowledgeable and broadly based.

<P>
<A NAME="80304-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   I should like to express support for Amendment No. 25 in relation to broadening out the experience on the Monetary Policy Committee. There is absolutely no doubt that one's view of the economy, if one has based one's entire existence in the south-east of England, is very different from if one is based in the north, in the Midlands and certainly in Scotland and Wales. There is always a temptation in this kind of appointment, it seems to me, that people appoint people that they know, who tend to be people with whom they come into contact, who tend to be geographically <P>


<a name="column_CWH83"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH83</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concentrated in the same region. Therefore, I support that amendment. Incidentally, it is common practice with other central banks that equivalent committees often have a formal requirement of a regional base--far more of a formal requirement than proposed in this amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para31"></a>I do not, however, go as far as the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, in suggesting that there should be a Scot and somebody with an understanding of Wales within this group. We have here four appointments. If two are taken up by Scotland and Wales (says he, speaking as a Yorkshireman!) I suspect there will be virtually nobody appointed from the English regions, or indeed from Northern Ireland. That seems to me an unnecessary constraint. Equally, while I support the idea of having a representative from business and industry on the committee, again if that is two out of four, somewhat tight constraints begin to arise. Were I to pick out part of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, it would be that one person with that specific knowledge would be sufficient.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-09_para32"></a>The final point I make on Amendment No. 31, which I do not support, is that it seems that whereas there is a danger in relation to home players, as has been suggested, equally there is a danger of ruling out people who may have spent some time (in their youth, as it were) as a member of a government department. Although I do not aspire to be a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, the fact that I worked for HM Customs and Excise for a few years immediately after leaving university does not seem of itself to be an adequate bar, 20 or 30 years later, to being appointed to this kind of committee. As a general principle, we should be encouraging more people to spend time working both inside and outside government, rather than pigeonholing them into one or the other. Again, this amendment has an unnecessarily constraining effect.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80304-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sefton of Garston: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Peston, made a statement when opening the debate on Amendment No. 25. He referred to people from outside the area of the M.25. At one time, in the north of this country, we used to say, "Those people down there don't know what is happening north of Watford". There used to be a row about which Watford they were referring to. I always subscribed to the viewpoint that it was Watford Gap--just below the Midlands--but I am glad to hear it confirmed now that it is considered to be within the M.25. For many years we forecast that if the question of monetary policy and so on was not looked at in a national sense, that is what would happen. The concentration that was beginning to occur from the north to the south would become so bad that--as I said in my first speech in the House of Lords--the south-east would become a stranglehold and a barrier to the rest of the country taking part in Europe.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-10_para0"></a>The implication of these three amendments is that not enough attention is being given to the outside regions, or to sectors which will have problems arising from a decision by the Monetary Policy Committee on the Bank of England. Before we had the proposals for the independent Bank of England, the Government made the <P>


<a name="column_CWH84"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH84</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>decisions as regards interest rates, among other things. Therefore, the Government and the machinery whereby the decision on interest rates were made were the same. But now they are going to be different. The Bank of England will be deciding interest rates. What concerns me is the effect on the regions, as the noble Lord opposite said. My experience in this springs from 43 years in which, first, I was an active member and once leader of a major city which has suffered severely from the change in industrial transport. Secondly, I was the Chairman of the North-West Planning Council. I was a regional officer in another movement dealing with regional matters. On every occasion--we have watched it happen--we have seen a change in monetary policy. Perhaps the worst was when Liverpool was beginning to recover from the depression caused by the change in transportation. We at last convinced central government that we needed some large-scale investment in a field that was not affected by transport, and the government kindly agreed that they would send in 5,000 civil servants. One can imagine the effect that that had on the city centre of Liverpool, spreading out across that particular region. Then there was a change of mind. Everyone decided that the economy was over-heating and they had to go back. The consequence was that we lost all that investment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-10_para1"></a>I am not asking, and certainly would not suggest, that we should have a committee comprised of the people mentioned in the three amendments. That would be a very big committee indeed. I do not disagree with the proposals for the Monetary Policy Committee. It would be wrong of me and would not have the slightest effect. When the Minister finally decides to reply to the amendments, which he will ask Members of the Committee to withdraw, perhaps he would consider asking whoever takes on the position of monetary policy or any other kind of fiscal policy to report to the Government any possible adverse effects their decisions might have either on sectors such as manufacturing or on regions such as Liverpool. I would then be satisfied that the matter was being looked at.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-10_para2"></a>Over 45 years I have known people responsible for that policy admitting the deleterious effect their decisions have had upon the regions I have spoken about, but they have never offered any solution. They forgot all about it and waited until the next time, when they decided on their future policies, instead of looking at the adverse effects of their decisions and doing something, or telling the Government to do something to rectify the situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-10_para3"></a>I hope I have made myself clear. I do not usually participate in these high-sounding ideas; I leave it to the experts down here. But the country should not have had the economic problems that it has experienced so often from decisions taken in the south-east of England. Would the Minister give consideration to imposing upon the Bank of England or the Monetary Policy Committee a duty to inform the Government of any possible adverse circumstances that may arise in certain sectors or regions from the decisions they recommended?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Perhaps I might just take one moment of the Committee's time. I should like <P>


<a name="column_CWH85"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH85</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to make a comment on my own experience as a member of the Scottish Economic Council over a number of years, where I represented the interests of education and training, and where I watched the procedures of that council and its study of Scottish Office figures of how the economy was moving in Scotland in relation to the economy of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-10_para4"></a>I do not know whether Members of the Committee realise the extent to which separate economic analysis of the Scottish economy has been done, and the resulting effects of the particular arrangements for bringing into Scotland industry inward investment and the somewhat separate arrangements for education and training. During that time, it interested me how frequently the economy of Scotland diverged and differed from the economy of the United Kingdom as a whole. Indeed, there were frequent comparisons, for example, with the south-east where competition between Scotland and the south-east interested industrialists very much. There are enormous differences which are partly cultural. For example, for a long time it was explained that people in Scotland saved more. I am not sure they still do, but at that particular time they were saving more, which affected the economy of Scotland. Expert members of the committee will understand various differences.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-10_para5"></a>It seems to me that with the advent of the Scottish parliament, it is likely that there may be increasing divergence as regards legislation and arrangements, funding and costs for local government. I can understand what the noble Lord, Lord Newby, was saying--and I am sure the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, was thinking it. But it is very welcome to hear it said that we do not want too many people on the body from specific areas of interest. One wants flexibility to achieve a balanced body. At the moment Amendment No. 27 is saying to the committee that these interests must be there. I am sure if there is nobody on that committee who knows what is happening in Scotland--one-ninth of the economy of the country, which may be doing something a bit different--it may be neglected. It might be that one of the industrialists or one of the academics is a Scotsman, as long as somebody is there to do that. It seems to me important, and I cannot imagine such a body working without it. It is a very amateur contribution, but I hope it is of interest.

<A NAME="80304-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Before I start on the meat of the amendments, may I take advantage of the almost chance remarks of my noble friend Lord Peston, who said that he had considered tabling his amendment to Clause 12 because he thought it was as much about the objectives of the Bank as about the membership. If I look at the debate on Clause 12, I see that I am recorded as saying,

<P>

<A NAME = "80304-10_para6"></a>I meant to say "We are setting the proximate target" and not "the approximate target". Indeed I believe I did say that but it was recorded wrongly, and I am glad to have an opportunity to put that right.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-10_para7"></a>I have a great deal of sympathy with the objectives of the first three amendments, which seek to provide for special expertise, knowledge and experience on the Monetary Policy Committee, and rather less with Amendments No. 31 and 32 which seek to deny the Monetary Policy Committee particular forms of knowledge and experience. I perfectly well understand why there should be concern that the interests of Scotland and Wales, and of the English regions, of business in general and most particularly of manufacturing business, should weigh heavily with the Monetary Policy Committee in making its decisions. However I am not convinced that in a body of this size, with four outside members, this should be expressed in the membership of the committee itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-10_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, exposed the contradictions and constraints which are involved in a number of these amendments. If one were to have somebody with particular knowledge of Scotland and another with particular knowledge of Wales, one would only have two for England. If one were to have two with experience of business and industry, one would only have two others. The amendment of my noble friend Lord Peston is less prescriptive but leads very much in the same direction, as we all recognise. It is much more important that, rather than restricting the membership of the Monetary Policy Committee, we should be sure that this committee has the interests of the regions and of the home countries and of business and industry in its sight when it is making decisions. That is why, in Clause 16(2) of the Bill, it is provided that the court shall have the responsibility for,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"determining whether the Committee has collected the regional, sectoral and other information necessary for the purposes of formulating monetary policy".
In other words, it is part of their concern for the procedures of the Monetary Policy Committee that they should have the interests of the regions and of the sectors--which means business and industry--at heart. That is the way in which we prefer to secure that the interests of business and of the regions and of the home countries are protected in the deliberations of the Monetary Policy Committee.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "80304-10_para9"></a>Noble Lords may feel that that is an indirect approach. I know that it will not satisfy my noble friend Lord Sefton, though I am relieved to find that he concentrates not so much on the membership of the committee, but on the way in which the committee reaches its decisions. I hope that that reassures him to some extent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-10_para10"></a>The fundamental view that we take about these amendments is that we want the best people, and the more restraints we put on where the members should come from, the more chance we have of sub-optimising and having people on the committee who are not the best people.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-10_para11"></a>I have another concern which relates to the way in which our society operates. Of course I see the point that we do not want to have a charmed circle of London, Oxford and Cambridge, still less within the M.25. However, people in this country have a wide range of different experiences and have lived in different places. Would the noble Lord, Lord Newby, be qualified under <P>

Would Professor Patrick Minford be qualified because he used to be a professor at Liverpool, or disqualified because he now works in London, or because he has never been, so far as I know, in manufacturing business? We are not like that these days. We live in different places; we work in different places.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-10_para12"></a>The professor from Sheffield who wrote to The Times on 18th February--I do not know him; he may have been in Sheffield only for this academic year--but he might come to work in London in the next academic year, in which case he would lose his qualification. The point is that people move around; they change their jobs and their knowledge and experience change throughout their lives. We have already had a debate on the membership of the court, and it was widely recognised that the court, the larger body, contains much better representation of business and manufacturing industry and of parts of the United Kingdom outside London. We should be satisfied with that and with the provisions in Clause 16(2) that the court shall ensure that the Monetary Policy Committee has the information about the needs of the regions and the needs of manufacturing industry at its disposal when it makes the decisions it has to make. However, the membership of the Monetary Policy Committee should consist of the best people in accordance with the criteria laid down in the Bill.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80304-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   I thank my noble friend for his answer, though I have to tell him, for once, that I am not entirely satisfied. He referred to the "best people", but the range of best people is quite large. I must be careful not to put words into the mouth of my noble friend, but I somewhat interpreted what he was saying about how we make appointments in future in a general way. If those posts were advertised, we might well gain access to a much larger group of people, which is worth reflecting on. Professor Minford, as far as I know, is in Cardiff and not London nowadays, having left Liverpool, so that even though his views on the economy and my own are slightly different, he would meet some of the relevant criteria.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-11_para0"></a>I shall make two more remarks and the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, also wishes to make a remark. There was a third target for me--and one reason for my putting this down was slightly mischievous--that as the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, pointed out, what we observe here will be observed on a much larger scale when we have the single currency and the Central European Bank. Not least for our country, the regional impact will be vital in the monetary policy that they conduct there. I support a move in that direction, but underlying my view is the fact that we will need very powerful regional intervention if it is to be made to work. So I did have a third string to my bow there.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-11_para1"></a>My last point, and I would like my noble friend to reflect on this, is that a relevant word here is "credibility". Anyone who reads the press locally, and indeed the national press in the form of the Financial Times, cannot but doubt that the people out there--I do not apologise to my noble friend Lord Sefton in so <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>calling them--do not believe that their interests are taken care of by this committee. Indirectly, I am trying to advise my right honourable friend the Chancellor that when making these appointments in future he should bear in mind the words "what is credible" in terms of regional interests and business interests. Credibility is extremely important here.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-11_para2"></a>I will not quite withdraw the amendment until the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, has spoken.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Perhaps I can start on a note of agreement with the Minister. Yes, I am indeed pleased to see that the new members of the court have been widely drawn. That is very welcome. As I indicated yesterday, however, there is a difference between the court and Monetary Policy Committee. We teased out the relationship, and it did not seem to me as though the court would have any influence over the decisions of the Monetary Policy Committee. I am therefore left with the feeling that, although the court may correctly represent the wide interests in the United Kingdom, that still leaves me with a problem in the Monetary Policy Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-11_para3"></a>I accept the criticism that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, made of my Amendments Nos. 31 and 32 that for somebody who might have been in the Bank or in the Treasury for a year or two in their early careers, it would not be very fair to knock them out if in their subsequent career they had become quite serious players outside either the Bank or the Treasury. The trouble with the noble Lord's argument is that the two people I have prayed in aid on the Monetary Policy Committee were not just casual employees of either the Treasury or the Bank of England. Professor Charles Goodhart was the Chief Adviser to the Bank and Sir Alan Budd was the Chief Economic Adviser to the Treasury since 1991. If I may say so, they were not just middle rank people gaining some experience on their way through.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-11_para4"></a>While I agree with the point the noble Lord made in criticising my amendment, I was more aiming at people who were senior or serious players in either the Bank or the Treasury then finding themselves translated--in one case an immediate translation--to be considered one of the away team. My concern still remains, although I accept that perhaps my amendment is too widely drawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-11_para5"></a>On the question of manufacturing industry and the various parts of the economy, I would be just a little more reassured by the explanation by the Minister if the Chancellor had made one of the four appointments from outwith the particularly tight circle from which these people are drawn. Anybody reading their CV will see that they have not done much moving around. I have read their careers and, apart from time abroad--which may be important, and the noble Lord, Lord Rees, was about to correct me--because two were born abroad and two have worked in very serious positions abroad, I am actually talking about the United Kingdom. There did not seem to be much moving about in the United Kingdom by any of them in the small CV put out in the Treasury biography. They do move abroad somewhat to take great tasks, but they return to the "magic triangle" in order to undertake their tasks in Britain.

<A NAME = "80304-11_para6"></a>If the Chancellor appointed somebody from Sheffield University--I know nothing about the professor who wrote to The Times, and I may thoroughly disagree with his economic position--or somebody from Newcastle (the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, has indicated that I probably would) or somebody from Wales, I would be rather happier. Perhaps even the noble Lords, Lord Sefton and Lord Montague, would be happier if someone from Scotland were included. If there was just one person from outside this magic circle or magic triangle, I would be encouraged, but I am discouraged by the fact that there is nobody.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-11_para7"></a>My noble friend Lady Carnegy is quite right about the position of the Scottish economy, and I suspect that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendments. However, I say this simply to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. He can take it to his right honourable friend the Chancellor, and it will nor surprise the Chancellor. Once the government of Scotland is up and running, the Westminster Government will not get away with a Monetary Policy Committee without somebody from Scotland. I give him that warning. When that day happens I shall look out for the noble Lord in the corridors and he can buy me a very large wine of my country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Before my noble friend winds up the debate, I recognise that I did not respond to Amendments Nos. 31 and 32 which were grouped with the main amendment. I should have done so because they show such a nobility of spirit on the part of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, that the matter should not pass. What he is doing in Amendment No. 31 is to exclude himself, as he recognises, from consideration, and so reluctantly I withdraw the nomination which I had had in mind of putting forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-11_para8"></a>More seriously, he talked about people who have extensive responsibilities in a senior position. He has had extensive experience in a senior position and it would be paradoxical if we were to make the kind of exclusion that he is proposing. We should also have excluded John Maynard Keynes from consideration as a member of the Monetary Policy Committee as a former employee of the government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-11_para9"></a>I do not in any way want to underestimate the importance of the thrust of the amendments. It is absolutely fundamental that we should show solidarity between regions and countries of the United Kingdom and that our monetary and economic policies generally should be concerned with the support of those regions and not concentrated on the south-east and on the financial sector. That is fundamental.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-11_para10"></a>It also follows from what I have just said that we must be concerned with business generally and with manufacturing industry in particular. The only query that we have with that thrust, with which we agree, is that we do not believe that it can or should be carried through into the membership of this very small Monetary Policy Committee.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80304-11_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: I felt I might withdraw the amendment. On the other hand, it is the only amendment that will give the Minister the opportunity to explain to us what will happen if the Monetary Policy Committee fails to meet the Chancellor's target of 2.5 per cent., plus/minus 1 per cent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-11_para17"></a>I have suggested in the amendment that if it fails to meet the target we might have some negative performance-related pay with regard to the members of the Monetary Policy Committee: they should have some of their pay docked. It is a slightly serious point because it would concentrate their minds. More importantly, it seems to me that it would be interesting to hear from the Minister exactly what will happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-11_para18"></a>As far as I understand, the Monetary Policy Committee will send a letter to the Chancellor and say, "Whoops, sorry, Chancellor, we've got it wrong and this is what we are going to try to do about it". It does not seem to me that much will happen to the members of the committee. Will they be told to write out 100 times, "I must not go beyond 3.5 per cent."? What is going to happen? I read a book recently about the family who built Richmond Terrace where, in the now becoming dim and distant days of ministerial life, I had my office. One of the daughters married Charles James Fox and what I found interesting was the way government Ministers, or people who appointed the government Ministers, had a measure of performance-related pay. They were allowed to keep a small portion of what they collected or distributed or, while they had the money in, they invested it and were allowed to keep the interest. They built some very grand houses and ran some very grand estates on that. Unfortunately, I understand that that was all stopped early in the last century and I doubt if it would be acceptable today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-11_para19"></a>Performance-related pay is not unknown and this is a suggestion that, if the committee fails to meet its targets, it receives a little more than just a letter; a little more than just an explanation, and some reduction in members' pay might be considered by the Chancellor.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The first and most obvious answer to the noble Lord is that to do that would be the most gross political interference and I cannot imagine that the Opposition would let such an occasion go by without severe censure.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-12_para0"></a>The second answer is that the noble Lord is proposing a very curious management style. In my experience, having spent 30 years in business and therefore being thoroughly qualified as a potential member of the Monetary Policy Committee, if somebody is not performing adequately, we do not tell them to take a cut in pay; we get rid of them. Otherwise we are building up resentment and keeping that resentment in the team, which seems to me to be an undesirable way to approach the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-12_para1"></a>I am not taking the amendment of the noble Lord at face value. But I am taking his speech seriously and I am taking seriously the point that he makes about the open letter and the way in which the Chancellor would react to a letter which indicated that the Monetary Policy Committee had failed to meet its broader targets.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-12_para2"></a>Monetary policy is not the same as selling cars. In particular, getting the specification of a performance- related element right would be tricky. Would it apply immediately the Bank had gone outside its limits and had to write the open letter? Given the time lags involved in setting monetary policy, it might take a year or more for the effects of the Monetary Policy Committee's decisions to be felt, though the letter has to be sent straight away. The current inflation target, through the open letter system, explicitly recognises that, in some circumstances, it may be acceptable to deviate from the target but that the Monetary Policy Committee must be explicit about how it plans to deal with such shocks.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-12_para3"></a>In answer to the noble Lord, that is exactly what the open letter is designed to do. Those circumstances would necessarily be unpredictable and it would be difficult to get right the contract that the noble Lord wishes us to draw up with the members of the Monetary Policy Committee, to make sure that we did not introduce undesirable incentives for monetary policy. We might land up saying, "You will be preserved from having your salary cut provided you get back within three months". It might be that economic conditions in Europe or inflationary conditions in other countries of the world did not make that possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-12_para4"></a>I am convinced that the open letter system, with its requirements that the Bank and the Monetary Policy Committee should emphasise not so much what went wrong, but what they are going to do to put it right, is a more effective method than that which is proposed in Amendment No. 13.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Taverne: </B>   I hesitate to speak when I have been unavoidably absent from the deliberations of the <P>


<a name="column_CWH92"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH92</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Committee. I should just like to say that my fear is that there is too much rigidity in the interpretation of the targets. This amendment underlines that tendency and it would be better to retain some flexibility, as indeed the noble Lord indicated.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the letter, of what he envisaged would be in it and the kind of assurances the Monetary Policy Committee might give. I am sure that the Monetary Policy Committee will be relieved at his vigorous defence of the salaries and positions of its members and equally relieved that I am not going to push it to any kind of Division either here--which I cannot do--or elsewhere when the opportunity arises. I am not sure that losing part of members' salaries would do anything to reinforce what will be a banker's caution, to ensure that they meet this target.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-12_para5"></a>My concern is the one that I expressed at Second Reading: that they will attempt to make it so certain that they meet their target, that they will probably tend on the robust side when it comes to interest rates. The consequences of that for our economy may well be damaging, but that is another issue. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-12_para6"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<BR>
("( ) Statements published under this section shall record, in relation to any decision of the Committee, the voting preference of the members who took part in the vote on the decision.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80304-12_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: I beg to move Amendment No. 33 and with it I shall speak also to Amendment No. 34. Clause 14 is about the immediate publication of the decisions of the Monetary Policy Committee. The public have a right to know and it is right that there should be public accountability on the part of the Monetary Policy Committee. This particular clause is not about the minutes of the meeting, to which I will come in a second. That involves Clause 15, to which Amendment No. 34 relates.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-12_para11"></a>Clause 14 concerns decisions that are made in the committee and have to be announced either on the same day--meaning the day after tomorrow, because the Monetary Policy Committee meets this week--or early next week. It refers to the announcements it has to make then, in contrast to the minutes some six weeks hence. The minutes six weeks hence, we know, show the voting preference of the members who take part in any vote on any decision. We saw that in the January meeting, when we saw which five people had voted to keep interest rates the same and which three had voted to raise them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-12_para12"></a>I may now be running out of time from my months, but I think it is right that in last month's meeting, whose minutes we still do not have--I do not know how it got out--there was an indication which I read about in the papers, that there had been a five-three division as well. <P>


<a name="column_CWH93"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH93</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>What we do not know is whether it was the same five-three or whether there had been some movement around. I do not suppose that the Minister will confirm or deny whether it was five-three, but I certainly saw that speculation in the newspapers. I do not know the grounds for the speculation, but that was the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-12_para13"></a>My first amendment would have the effect that, when the Monetary Policy Committee announced in February that interest rates were to remain the same, it should then have stated the voting preference for anybody who took part in the vote. The second amendment relates to the wait of six weeks. Why do we wait, in fact, for a week or two after the next meeting before we read the minutes? I am sure that they are written fairly soon after the first meeting. I hope the noble Lord is not going to say that the Committee, at its subsequent meeting, have to agree to the minutes before they are published? If that is the case, they could be published rather more quickly than in six weeks. Depending on the length of the month, they could be published in five or four weeks--rather more immediately.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-12_para14"></a>I am teasing out from the Minister why it is six weeks. I know he will tell me that that is the way Kenneth Clarke decided it should be. But Kenneth Clarke was dealing with a different kind of meeting. He was dealing with a meeting between himself and the Bank, where he took a full part in the decision-making process on whether or not to increase interest rates and the minutes were then published. That was the first time the minutes of those meetings had been published. When creating a Monetary Policy Committee which is independent, on which the Chancellor does not sit, where the decisions are not made by the Chancellor any more and he is not involved in the making of the decisions, it is worth considering why we should not do the same as that which we did with the "Ken and Eddie Show", as it was called, and wait six weeks.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-12_para15"></a>My two points are these: first of all, in the immediate decision announcement should we not know what the vote was and who did the voting; and, secondly, do we really need to wait six weeks, until after the next meeting, before we read the minutes of the last one? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The noble Lord is quite right in saying that I intended to refer back to the "Ken and Eddie Show", not quite in the same terms in which he did but because I must confess that when the "Ken and Eddie Show" had its premier, I was puzzled by this six-week delay. As a complete outsider, and somebody who is used to having the minutes of meetings available immediately afterwards as a normal business procedure, I could not understand why this should be so. I have to say that the argument which I assume Kenneth Clarke and the Governor used at that time still applies today. The meeting is not that different. The reason is that these meetings take place on a monthly basis--they do not need to take place on a monthly basis but they do--and any further information, particularly information about the nature of the votes, <P>


<a name="column_CWH94"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH94</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>could well be destabilising and could limit the options open to the next meeting if they became available before the next meeting.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-12_para16"></a>We agree with the process started by Mr. Kenneth Clarke when he made these meetings more open and transparent, and we have extended the openness and transparency by proposing that the voting record should be published, and this, as the noble Lord recognises, has now happened. But the publication of the voting record immediately when the decision was taken might be destabilising, particularly if there is a split decision as there was in January 1998. It might well be that the publication of the voting record in January, taken before the February meeting, might have forced the members of the Monetary Policy Committee into a false sense that they had to be consistent with their previous view, even when their economic and policy judgments could have been otherwise.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-12_para17"></a>The noble Lord has been reading speculation about decisions in February. They are pure speculation and to the best of my knowledge no statement has been made with any authority which breaks the six-week rule which has been set up.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-12_para18"></a>The arguments are the same as they were when this first arose under Kenneth Clarke's Chancellorship. The important point is to ensure that the minutes do not come out before the meeting, or "not more than six weeks after the meeting" is the phrase. This is designed to cope with the vagaries in the calendar, but above all it is designed to make sure that the subsequent meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee takes place without any external or internally-imposed constraints on reaching the right decision. I fear that the noble Lord's amendments would damage that.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80304-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Before the noble Lord replies, may I ask my noble friend a question which has only just occurred to me, for which I apologise? Clause 15(4) refers to the voting preferences of the members. I do not recall seeing anywhere else in the Bill anything else about voting, or about the internal procedure of the Monetary Policy Committee. It may be somewhere else and I have just missed it, but two questions occur to me. First, is there any obligation for this committee to take decisions by majority voting? Could they not, for example, have a rule that it has to be complete anonymity as to their voting preference? Is there somewhere in the Bill that tells us it must be majority voting? That is my first question. My second depends on the first.

<a name="column_CWH95"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH95</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>troubles me wearing my academic hat. There are three possibilities at any meeting: raise interest rates, leave them the same or lower them. It is a well known proposition in voting theory that where there are three possibilities you can have cyclical preferences so that any proposition can have a majority against anything else. Therefore, the person who controls the agenda--the most well known of all the propositions--controls the outcome. The question of voting is not as trivial as I thought it was. I ask my noble friend to reflect on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-13_para1"></a>To take the obvious point, if the voting of some people is that they most want down and they most dislike up, and there is another group who most want up and dislike down, they may both for protective purposes vote for the status quo even though that is not their first preference and is not, in their judgment, the best thing for the economy. I ought to come back to this when we meet on Report. I realise that technically this is not a trivial matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-13_para2"></a>I thank my noble friend for drawing my attention to the part of the Bill which covers this point and ask him to get his expert advisers to brief him, and therefore in due course to brief me and other noble Lords, on whether there could be problems of serious errors in policy arising from a voting system.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I suspect that my advisers, with all their admirable qualities, are not academically qualified in the theory of games. I shall reflect on the point that my noble friend Lord Peston has made.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Peston, makes a good point. I can see that the voting might be awkward for the Governor to conduct if there are members looking at all three options. It is probably straightforward if nobody is in favour of one of the options, but if some are in favour of all three, then it could be a difficult decision and you could achieve a muddled compromise which did not satisfy anybody. That is another matter. I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say once the Treasury has reflected on it, as no doubt it will do.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   There are not just three options. There is an infinite variety of options. Rates can be raised by different amounts. I know how I would handle it as the chairman of a meeting which is to attempt to secure agreement on the least objectionable alternative, but that does not give a great deal of power to the chairman of the meeting. My noble friend recognises this; let us talk about it again.

<A NAME="80304-13_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   We had better because it is beginning to sound like the lowest common denominator, which might not be the best way. I am pleased I pursued this because it has raised an interesting issue. I have listened with interest to what the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, has said. I am not entirely sure that having a six-week gap will remove the pressures from the members two meetings ahead when it comes to looking at what they have done two meetings behind. We know who voted in the January meeting. I <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>am not entirely sure we would know how they voted when it comes to the March meeting if there were no pressures on them, whereas if we knew how they voted in the February meeting, there would be undue pressures on them. I am not entirely sure that I was convinced by the argument of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, when it came to that part.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-13_para3"></a>I see the problems. It is a matter of balance between being open and allowing everybody to see what happened, and the problems which could occur in the money market and the economy if in fact people realised too soon what was happening. They might then take steps to guard themselves against what looked like an adverse decision as far as they were concerned at the next meeting. We may well return to this in some form or another. Someone will have to devise a suitable amendment. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<A NAME = "80304-13_para11"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 16 shall stand part of the Bill?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-13_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   Before we move to Clause 16 stand part, perhaps I may say to the noble Lord that I certainly felt there was some attraction in the argument that he advanced in response to the group of amendments beginning with Amendment No. 25. He implied that if one was looking to the way that the committee conducted itself and one wished to ensure that it did not have regard only to opinions in London, instead of prescribing residence or domicile in other parts of the United Kingdom a more appropriate approach might be to give some direction or impose some requirement on the committee that it has regard to other parts of the Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-13_para12"></a>The noble Lord made particular play with what is found in Clause 16(2), namely, that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the court's function under subsection (1) shall include determining whether the Committee has collected the regional, sectoral and other information". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-13_para13"></a>One thing, it seems to me, that this committee will not lack is bumf. It is unlikely to have too little information before it, and it would seem to me, accordingly, that the court of directors of the Bank would have an extremely light duty to discharge if it only had to look to see how much information was made available to the committee in coming to its view. It seems to me that we should at some point look to some strengthening of that provision along those lines that the court of directors might have some duty to ensure that "it shall have regard to" that information on regional, sectoral and other matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-13_para14"></a>I hope that the noble Lord might reflect on that and not simply restrict it to ensuring that the information is collected.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-13_para15"></a>The other point I want to make on this clause is this. Is Scotland a region? I would advise the noble Lord to think long and hard before he answers that question. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland regards England as a region for the purposes of its activities there. I am not aware of England being described as a region in any condescending fashion other than in that context.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-13_para16"></a>This is a general point but, I believe, an extremely important one. This is the first time, so far as I am aware, since the Scotland Bill got under way that we have had a chance to consider the use of the word "region" in relation to legislation. The draftsman would seem to be well advised to change this drafting to acknowledge what has been put forward by the Government in their White Paper Scotland's Parliament, which led to the referendum and has now led to the Bill. It is simply incorrect in future to describe Scotland as a region.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-13_para17"></a>I shall not be very helpful in offering any alternative word other than to say that Scotland and Wales have to be included. In my time in government the vogue was to describe Ministers from Wales, Northern Ireland or Scotland as "territorial" Ministers; and a description of Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland as a "territory" probably would provoke quite as much irritation as the description of those parts of the United Kingdom as "regions". I do not invite the noble Lord to give me an answer now. I am just putting him on notice that there is a very real issue, not only in this legislation but more generally.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-13_para18"></a>The Minister will be well aware that his right honourable friend Mr. Donald Dewar found himself in considerable difficulty recently about an alleged withdrawal of a knighthood for Sean Connery. Those issues are extremely raw in Scotland at the present time and it seems to me incumbent upon this House, in looking to the drafting of legislation, particularly United Kingdom legislation, to ensure that no unnecessary affront is caused to Scotland.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-13_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I do not know whether the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser, was here half an hour or so ago when we were discussing Amendments Nos. 22, 23 and 27. If he was, he would have observed that I very carefully used the phrase "home countries". This is a new phrase to me but it is what is used in Whitehall, and possibly even in Holyrood or St. Andrews House, to distinguish Scotland and Wales--the Kingdom of Scotland and the Principality of Wales--from the English regions. If there is a problem, as there may be, with the use of the word "regions", then we must look at this again. I shall write to the noble and learned Lord, but I must warn him that I have just written a very dense five-page letter to him about the Scottish dimension of the National Lottery Bill, and I do not think he will want another like that in short order.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-13_para19"></a>The noble and learned Lord's worries about the duties of the court, and not having anything to do if that is all it does, are readily dispelled. The court has many more <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-13_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   Either I have expressed myself poorly, or the noble Lord has misunderstood me. He made great play of the fact that, if my noble friend and others were concerned that the committee would not have proper regard to regional sectoral interests, our fears ought to be allayed because there was the duty to ensure that it collected information. My point is that I have no doubt that it will have more than sufficient information about the regions, about Scotland, about England and about sectors, but it seems that that is not sufficient. If it were to look, for example, at the piles of papers to be provided to members of the Monetary Policy Committee, I am sure it would very quickly discover that there was more than sufficient information. That is not quite the answer. We are trying to ensure that there is a duty upon the committee to address the issue of the potential differences within the United Kingdom economy as a whole as it affects Scotland, Wales and the regions of England.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-13_para20"></a>I am sure that my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish is correct in saying that we should look specifically at Scotland, because one necessary consequence of the establishment of a parliament in Scotland is that there will certainly be some features where there will be homogeneity in the economy. We want to ensure that the committee has regard to that development.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I was going to come to the third point made by the noble and learned Lord. I was only dealing with his concern that the court and the committee would have nothing to do if it was only a question of ensuring that information was available.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-14_para0"></a>His more fundamental point, which I recognise, goes to the heart of the relationship between the Monetary Policy Committee and the court--the distinction we have made--and the responsibility for monetary policy, which lies with the Monetary Policy Committee. If he cares to read the record of the debate yesterday, he will see that, although noble Lords disagreed with me, I was very insistent that there should be no greater complication in the statement of objectives of the Bank other than that it should primarily be price stability and, subject to that, the economic policies of the Government. I resisted all attempts to extend that definition, and I would have resisted any attempt to add to it so that it should have regard to any other particular factors, on the grounds that I stated then, that you must have one proximate target rather than having a whole range of targets with the potential for conflict between them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-14_para1"></a>On the question of devolution, which both the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, and the noble and learned Lord mentioned, political consideration will have to be given to this, as to all other matters, when the Scottish parliament is formed. I shall be interested to see how concerned the noble Lord and his party are about the effective pursuit of devolution.

<P>

<A NAME = "80304-14_para3"></a>Clause 17 [Power to obtain information]:
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-14_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Home </B>   moved Amendment No. 36:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 7, line 25, after ("undertaking") insert (", such information being solely that").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80304-14_para4"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving Amendment No. 36, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 37. These amendments largely concern costs and I make no apology for continuing to emphasise the need that we all look for, which is that costs are kept to a minimum. There is in this clause a danger that the institutions will incur extra costs over and above what might be necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-14_para5"></a>Both the Bank and the authority will naturally want to have their own ideas about the form and the manner in which they collect the information anticipated in subsection (2)(a). In addition, it is quite possible that either of them might want the same information but in a rather different form. The Bank has, for a considerable length of time, been receiving information and it is only human nature that they have developed a good system which works for them and with which they are comfortable, and they will not necessarily want to change it. The requirements of the authority may need the information to be in a different form.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-14_para6"></a>I entirely accept that the Bank and the authority will do their best not to duplicate, and indeed their intention not to do so is enshrined in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the MOU between the Treasury, the Bank and the authority. Those paragraphs refer to the desire to minimise the burden on companies. Amendment No. 36, however, seeks to concentrate the minds of those in the Bank to ask only for information which they really need. Ideally, I should like the words "or expedient" to be deleted from that paragraph, and indeed my colleagues in another place asked for that, but their request was rejected by the Economic Secretary. My thesaurus gives "helpful" as a synonym for "expedient", and on that basis one can think of much information which the Bank might find helpful to have but which is not strictly necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-14_para7"></a>Amendment No. 37 covers the eventuality whereby the Bank asks for information which may be expensive for an institution to provide without apparent good reason. The Bank must be seen to have a good reason for requesting information but it should tell the institution why it wants it. In addition, the Bank should have some idea about what the costs are of producing that information.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-14_para8"></a>Institutions take any request from the Bank very seriously indeed, and I know from my own experience that, if anything, banks go overboard and provide more information than the Bank in the past technically needed. Although the Bank might imply in a notice that it only wants a back-of-an-envelope calculation, unless told otherwise institutions will provide a lot of information and at considerable expense. This amendment would ensure that there are fewer misunderstandings on that topic.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-14_para9"></a>It is everybody's intention that the City of London and other financial centres in the UK must be kept as competitive as possible and minimise costs. I fear that <P>


<a name="column_CWH100"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH100</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>over-enthusiasm in fact-gathering, while understandable and indeed laudable, could impose extra costs on institutions and reduce our competitiveness overall. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My answer to Amendment No. 36 is very simple. My answer to Amendment No. 37, however, is rather more complicated, so the Committee will have to forgive me. Amendment No. 36 is strictly unnecessary. The effect of Clause 17 is that the Bank can only request the relevant financial information which it considers necessary or expedient for the purposes of its monetary policy functions and the amendment adds nothing to that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-14_para10"></a>The noble Earl referred to his disquiet about the word "expedient", and he talked as if "helpful" was a thesaurus synonym. I do not believe a thesaurus has synonyms; it has related words, and if we started to use a thesaurus to interpret the wording in legislation we would rapidly find ourselves in considerable difficulty. I hope the noble Earl is persuaded that Amendment No. 36 would not help his cause.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-14_para11"></a>Amendment No. 37 is more complicated because it refers both to reasons for the need for such information and to an estimation of costs, and these arguments are very different. First, let me make it clear that there is no change here proposed in existing legislation. The review of statistics which was carried out in 1997, and I believe was instigated under the previous government, came to the conclusion that no change was necessary and no change is therefore proposed. Indeed, Clause 17(6) provides that if any change were proposed in the future there would be consultation on such a change before it was imposed, so I can give the noble Lord that assurance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-14_para12"></a>As to giving reasons why the information is needed, it will be clear why the Bank will need the information, because the Bank will make it clear on the statistical form which is used under which power it is seeking the information. That will give the supplier of information the undertaking, the reasons which are necessary and which are called for in the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-14_para13"></a>The issue of estimating the cost is much more difficult. Frankly, the amendment is unworkable. It is unreasonable to expect the Bank to estimate for every individual institution--which is what is called for--the costs of providing additional information. How do we know what are the costs of an individual institution, as the amendment would require us to provide?
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-14_para14"></a>Behind these amendments, however, is the fundamental concern which the noble Earl has expressed throughout this Committee stage that somehow the costs will increase. We are fully aware of the need to keep the cost of supplying information to the minimum consistent with meeting the information needs of the Bank. The Bank's code of practice for statistics commits the Bank <P>


<a name="column_CWH101"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH101</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to place the minimum load on data suppliers and to keep data suppliers' costs to a minimum. I hope that gives the noble Earl the reassurance that he seeks.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Stewartby: </B>   May I just ask the noble Lord one question? Will the Bank be in a position to require this information before the Treasury has made the order referred to in subsection (4)?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   We have to make the order first, before the Bank can require the information.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-14_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Home: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for his reply to my two amendments. I accept the rather sloppy use of the word "synonym". Even so I retain some residual concerns that overenthusiasm in asking for information could be difficult. In accepting that the Bank will make clear on its statistical form why it is needed without seeing exactly what is the shape of these statistical forms, it is a bit difficult to be able to tell exactly what that is.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I can answer that readily. I have already said that there was a review of statistics. No material change was recommended and no change is taking place. The statistical forms will be as they are now.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-14_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Home: </B>   I thank the Minister for that indication. Moving on, I accept the fact that the Bank cannot know what the entire costs of each individual institution producing information such as it might ask for. However, there is a difference between the Bank saying, "Please give us some information but don't take long doing it; it really can be on the back of an envelope", and saying, "We really need a full-blown, totally documented answer to this request". I would hope that the Bank at any stage would have some idea of the importance, and therefore the amount of time and therefore cost, that the institution might be expected to spend on producing any particular piece of information for it. However, on the assurances given on that by the noble Lord, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="column_CWH102"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH102</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-15_para1"></a>The basis of the amendment is a request or suggestion that when the Monetary Policy Committee reports it should report on any constraints under which it feels it has laboured because of other parts of the Government's economic policy. Professors of economics would probably call that an interaction between fiscal and monetary policy. It seems to me that it might be useful for the Government to know, and for the rest of us to know, whether the Monetary Policy Committee found it difficult to operate within its constraints resulting from other parts of the Government's policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-15_para2"></a>I am not sure whether there will be secret communications between the Monetary Policy Committee and the Government or the Treasury. I had the impression that there might be such secret interchanges of view when I listened to the President of the Board of Trade, who was being interviewed this morning. Unfortunately, I did not find a paper and pen quickly enough to take down her words in detail, but I rather felt that she said we would have ways of telling the Monetary Policy Committee what is happening in manufacturing industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-15_para3"></a>The whole piece revolved round interviews with people in manufacturing industry who were concerned about the rise in interest rates and its effect on the exchange rate. It is interesting that the person was asked whether he blamed the Bank of England and he said, "No, I don't blame the Bank of England. It has only been given one tool with which to do the job". It will be interesting to see how long that lasts. Even somebody as obviously knowledgeable as that gentleman may some day start to blame the Bank of England and forget that the Chancellor and his fiscal policy played a part in the whole process.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-15_para4"></a>My point is that I had the impression from Mrs. Beckett--though I may have picked it up wrongly and I stand to be corrected--that there will be ways by which the Government can send messages to the Monetary Policy Committee. I am more concerned about whether the Monetary Policy Committee can send messages to the Government. Also, I shall be interested to know whether it does it in secret or whether it does it openly in the report. I should like to think it can be done openly in the report so that Parliament can judge, when it looks at the report, what happened and hold the Government to account for any rises in interest rates that occurred because of problems caused by other parts of the Government's policy. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Before speaking to Amendment No. 39 in my name and in the name of my noble friend Lord Barnett, let me say that after reading Amendment No. 38 from the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, I had assumed--and I may have misinterpreted the Bill--that what he had in mind was covered by Clause 18(2)(c) which says that the report shall contain,
<P>
<BR>

<P>

<A NAME = "80304-15_para5"></a>Following our debate yesterday on Clause 11, though subsection (a) seeks "to maintain price stability", there is still the "subject to" bit of subsection (b) to consider. I do not see how they can wriggle out of not covering that. It means what the noble Lord said it means and I look forward to hearing my noble friend's response.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-15_para6"></a>Turning to my own amendment, this is one which I take extremely seriously. It is not that I have not taken all the other amendments seriously, but this is at the top of my priorities. The Governor himself, who has recently been reappointed, emphasised transparency in his recent Mais lecture. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Transparency ... can only encourage a better informed public debate and a more sophisticated public understanding of the issues. That in turn can only help to strengthen confidence in the process". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-15_para7"></a>The Governor clearly favours transparency. The former Chief Economist, Mervyn King, who I think is or will be a deputy governor, said only a couple of years ago:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Central banks can try to accelerate the learning process by teaching by doing, in other words, making clear their own preferences and explaining their own view of how the economy behaves ... and the product of this learning should be communicated to the public at large". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-15_para8"></a>Excellent economic work is done in the Bank. The Bank of England's quarterly bulletin contains some astonishingly good articles of the very highest quality. Equally, the inflation report is a document of outstanding merit. I assume that when the Bill becomes law, it will still produce documents of this kind.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-15_para9"></a>My problems start from the inflation report itself. Every time it appears, the inflation report contains the Bank's inflation forecast--in an extremely sophisticated way, I might say, without remotely criticising the Treasury where I used to work as a very young man. The inflation report forecasts are much more sophisticated in form than anything the Treasury produces by way of documentation or forecast. I am not criticising the Bank, but the problem with the inflation report is that it is the only forecast it publishes, unless I have misread parts of it. Any sensible person, on looking at those forecasts, says, "What else is it forecasting? What is it not telling us?". If you wish to take an intelligent view of what is being said--and that is vital to the whole operation of monetary policy--it is impossible to make sense of that unless you know what else it has in mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-15_para10"></a>Let us compare this with what happens in the Fed. Let me remind my noble friend of the Fed's mandate--the so-called Humphrey-Hawkins Act, which I intended to read out yesterday, but forgot. This is an interesting contrast with Clause 11. The Humphrey-Hawkins Act provides that the Fed must,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"maintain long-run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long-run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-15_para11"></a>Notice, there is no "subject that". They are all on a par. Therefore the Fed, which many would regard as the most successful of the central banks, has a mandate not only to achieve inflation but also to stabilise economic activity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-15_para12"></a>I read that into the record but the main reason I do so is that, in connection with the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, there is an annual occasion of testimony by Mr. Greenspan to both Houses of Congress on the meeting of these matters. Again, this is not unrelated to certain remarks made yesterday about parliamentary scrutiny of all these matters.

The Fed publishes its economic forecast twice a year, precisely to meet the requirements of testimony in connection with the Humphrey-Hawkins Act. In other words, the Americans, with their great emphasis on an open society, just take it for granted that the Fed, doing forecasting, will publish those forecasts. It is a source of sadness to me that somehow we do not take this for granted, but we have to argue for it. Normally, our wish is not granted when we ask for forecasts to be published.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-15_para14"></a>There is an economic theory that says that the only way governments manage economies is by misleading markets--essentially by surprising them, tricking them, and so on. I hope that is not the view of the present Government. My own view is that, although there are models that achieve that end, they are overwhelmingly erroneous. I take the view that, for all sorts of reasons, not least those concerned with credibility, we want to be able to believe that what the Bank is doing is the best for the economy. By "we" I do not just mean a few academic economists, but the public at large.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-15_para15"></a>I am convinced that the Bank should publish its forecasts, but not immediately. I would not die in the last ditch for six weeks; I chose six weeks because it is the standard period which appears in the Bill. I commend the amendment very strongly to the Committee, and I hope I have convinced the Minister that as a minimum he ought to say that this is important and that he will not resist the amendment, even if he cannot yet accept it.

<P>

<A NAME = "80304-15_para16"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, seemed to open the argument for his amendment with a conspiracy theory. He thinks that there may be secret contacts between the Bank and the Treasury. I am not sure whether he approves of that or not. Let me assure him that contacts are not secret. A Treasury representative attends all the Monetary Policy Committee meetings, and that is provided for in Schedule 3, paragraph 13, of the Bill. In any case, I am sure he will acknowledge that the Chancellor has been very transparent about all aspects of government policy, particularly fiscal policy. The introduction of the pre-budget report is evidence of that.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80304-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I fully appreciate that an official from the Treasury attends. I just wonder what his views are and whether what he has expressed to the Monetary Policy Committee will be contained in one of the paragraphs of the minutes.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I think the minutes are the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee, which he attends as an observer and not as a member. It has to be the minutes of the members of the committee. If I am wrong, I will write to the noble Lord, Lord Mackay.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para0"></a>When I read the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, quite apart from the admirable <P>


<a name="column_CWH105"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH105</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>word "inhere", I am puzzled by whether he is saying in the amendment what he really thinks. He talks about
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"constraints experienced by the Monetary Policy Committee". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para1"></a>I think he is really seeking to get the Monetary Policy Committee to say that it wanted to do the right thing but was stopped from doing so by "this wicked Government who set us these terrible economic policy objectives so we could not do what we intended. It is not our fault; it is Daddy's fault". I am not at all convinced by that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para2"></a>Even taking the amendment literally, it is not necessary. The inflation report will cover the impact of government policy on developments in inflation and how this affects the Monetary Policy Committee's expected approach to meeting its objectives. This is laid out, as my noble friend Lord Peston pointed out, in Clause 18(2).
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para3"></a>The whole point of the framework is to give the Monetary Policy Committee operational autonomy to achieve the target, to enhance credibility and give a long-term commitment to price stability. The Government set both the monetary policy objective and their other economic policy objectives. They certainly have no intention of making them inconsistent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para4"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 39. I am afraid that my noble friend Lord Peston is not up to date. He is quite right in saying that the Bank of England has for a long time published inflation forecasts, but since November of last year it has also published forecasts of growth. The growth forecasts have probability distributions around them. In other words, they are fan charts, in the same way that inflation forecasts are presented as fan charts. That is a considerable advance on the situation that we had before and I hope goes some way to meeting my noble friend's objectives. Let me, however, recount to him the exchange of views between the Treasury Select Committee and the Bank of England, in the hope that it may reassure him.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para5"></a>The Treasury Select Committee, in its report, asked the Bank to clarify,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the key assumptions which the MPC makes on foreign interest rates, the exchange rate, and domestic and international growth rates and the Bank's assessment of the likely impact (bearing in mind timing and lags) of interest rate decisions on the real economy". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para6"></a>This was point vi of its conclusions in its report of 23rd October. The Bank replied, and I am sorry to read this out in full but it is appropriate to this amendment:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For the Inflation Report forecast, the Bank takes its forecast assumptions on overseas interest rates from forward market rates--ie, the market expectations of future rates (see charts 2.9 and 2.10 on page 13 of the November Report). The exchange rate profile, too, is described in the Report (see page 46 of the November Report). We are now publishing the domestic growth rate projection in the report (see page 48 of the November Report). The forecast of international growth is based on IMF and OECD forecasts, although we modify this to reflect information published after those forecasts were prepared. Our assessment of the likely impact of interest rate decisions on the real economy is reflected in the domestic growth projection mentioned above and the surrounding commentary in the Report". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para7"></a>That may not be a full set of economic forecasts. I have no doubt that my noble friend could find more information that he would like to have, but it does at least show that the Bank is responding positively to pressure to make public the basis of its forecasts. I am <P>


<a name="column_CWH106"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH106</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sure that if there is continuing expert pressure, such as that which my noble friend is well capable of exerting, it could respond further. I am not answering for the Bank but I think one can see the direction in which it is working.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_time0"></A><H5>5.45 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   This is a rather more technical point, which I should like to raise. I have the February 1998 Inflation Report in front of me, which contains fan charts of the inflation projection and the GDP projection, as well as a couple of similar charts based on market interest rate expectations. What is there, therefore, is not uninteresting but is not what anyone would call a full set of forecasts.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para8"></a>I want to know what underlies all that. My point is that I cannot see why I should not be able to. There is no serious reason why the Bank, anxious to establish its credibility, would be doing two things where it used to do one. I assume that is what my noble friend means by my being up to date. I have noticed chart 6.1 as one of the other charts I had, but it is not the full set of forecasts. I do not see why it should be up to the Bank whether or not to do it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para9"></a>To refer back to the Fed, it should be up to Parliament--in this case, particularly as this is the only Bill we have before us--to legislate and to say to the Bank that it ought to do this. We are not requesting this in a threatening way. We are asking for it in the national interest because such transparency, which, as I quoted, is favoured by the Governor, is enormously helpful to the conduct of macro-economic policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para10"></a>Having said that, I hope my noble friend will reflect on it. I have not said at any earlier point in these proceedings that this is something I shall raise at Report stage of your Lordships' deliberation, but in this case, it is certainly something I feel noble Lords may wish to look at in more detail. I do not suggest that my noble friend has not been helpful, but I would like to return to the matter and go into it further.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I always reflect on things, but perhaps my noble friend would also reflect on what statutory definition he could give to the phrase "a full set" and whether he means the forecasts or the forecasts and the assumptions behind them. As he says, these are technical matters which require thought.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for the points he made in response to my amendment. I was trying to tease out a two-way relationship, largely thanks to the interview I heard this morning from Mrs. Beckett. I appreciate that the Treasury official will be at the Monetary Policy Committee and that he will, therefore, tell it what, if any, messages he has to bring from the Government. However, the rest of us are not to know what those messages may be. Usually, all the matters that take place in the committee go into the minutes, including the views of anybody who is attending as an observer. However, perhaps that is the kind of organisation to which I have always belonged. I suppose we may be able to tease out from the rest of the minute what the Treasury official may or may not have said.

<A NAME = "80304-16_para11"></a>We are clearly not going to be told in the report what we are talking about under Clause 18. However, I am interested and reassured that, in the Minister's view, any problems which the Monetary Policy Committee was having with the rest of the Government's policy and any difficulties these were causing it in keeping to its monetary policy and targets would be covered by subsection (2)(b) which refers to,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para17"></a>The noble Earl said: This amendment relates to the concerns which other noble Lords and I expressed on Second Reading as regards the words "extreme economic circumstances". We speculated at that time on a variety of possible scenarios which might be covered by this phrase. I simply want to introduce this part of our discussion by referring to one event in the past.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para18"></a>During the Committee stage in another place, the Economic Secretary said that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"all Honourable Members would hope that the powers in the clause could be used rarely, if at all". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para19"></a>She said further on that occasion:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We are talking about extreme economic circumstances--a major catastrophe, for example, that affected the nation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para20"></a>However, when she was asked whether the calling in of the IMF by the previous Labour Government, which immediately sought to influence the course of government policy, would constitute extreme economic circumstance, she replied:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"That is an interesting point". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para21"></a>Surely having to call in the IMF is an extreme economic circumstance, if ever there was one. Short of war, I can hardly think of a worse situation. I would ask the Minister not to sit on the fence like his colleague. I ask him to tell us whether that event, for instance, would have qualified as an extreme economic circumstance. At least then we should have some yardstick by which to judge that phrase.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para22"></a>I have added in the words "or financial" for a good reason. It is not just an excuse for a probing amendment. I returned on Sunday from South-East Asia, where some countries are suffering very badly from a knock-on effect of being grouped with Thailand. While it is true that the economies of some of these countries were over-heating, they were not in severe economic circumstances. However, they were plunged into a considerable financial crisis--much more a financial crisis than an economic one. Indeed, at least one of them is still in great financial difficulties.

<A NAME = "80304-16_para23"></a>A similar circumstance could happen here. Both major parties have worries that the single European currency might not work. If it does not work, it could blow up into a mammoth financial crisis, and it could blow up very quickly if there were to be a flight from the euro by central banks and investors worldwide.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-16_para24"></a>There need be nothing wrong with our economy or indeed necessarily with the economies of most of the other members of the European union, or even all of them. However, such an event would have a dramatic effect on sterling. Surely that would be an extreme circumstance, albeit financial and not economic, and the Government might well have to act with great speed. In proposing this amendment, I am giving the Government greater latitude in how they might respond in these circumstances. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80304-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Before speaking to Amendment No. 41, which is grouped with Amendment No. 40, may I make a comment on Amendment No. 40? I hope the noble Earl will not accuse me of arrogance, but I had assumed the word "economic" includes "financial", and therefore the amendment is not necessary. I was not listening as closely as I should have been when he mentioned the 1976 IMF crisis--I believe I am right in thinking he was referring to that--but it is an interesting question whether, under this heading, that would count as "extreme economic circumstances". I also cannot remember whether the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, was Financial Secretary at the time.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Taverne: </B>   It was 1968, when we thought Armageddon was upon us because the Germans would not revalue.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   What I remember most clearly, as an adviser to Ministers in 1976, is that there was no panic at that time. It compared favourably with Black Wednesday and the debacle of the noble Earl's right honourable friend Mr. Lamont. Although we did not like it at the time, the situation was completely under control, if I remember rightly, even though there were certain bitter pills to be swallowed. But that is just en passant. My noble friend will say whether he agrees with me that "economic" includes "financial", but that is certainly my view.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-17_para0"></a>On my amendment, I do not believe that I am engaged in mischief-making. I have been sitting here wondering whether I am just making a bit of mischief. I have been trying to think to myself what circumstances we could have in mind that would be regarded as "extreme economic circumstances". The ones that would most bother me, but curiously would not be ones on which I would expect the Bank to be overruled, would be if we suddenly plunged into a major depression of the kind that Keynesian economics was invented to remove. However, given more recent developments, the world is quite capable of plunging back into those depressions, but I cannot believe that the Monetary Policy Committee in those circumstances would have to be overruled in order to engage in intelligent monetary policy. My judgment is that it would probably do that without being overruled.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-17_para1"></a>If I were asked to reply to the question, "What do you mean by extreme economic circumstances?", I am not at all sure what I could answer that would satisfy me. I thought therefore, "My noble friend is on the payroll. It is not my job to answer these questions; he is paid to answer them, and he has a lot of very sophisticated advisers. They would not have allowed the Bill to be drafted unless they knew the answer to the question". Therefore, although I am still a little worried that I am making mischief--which I would never do given my great loyalty to the present Government--I thought I would plod on a little bit just in case my noble friend can enlighten me. I assure him that neither now nor subsequently would I dream of dividing on an issue of this kind.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Taverne: </B>   I am a little puzzled by this clause. First, I suspect it will not be a clause that will last very long, because it will probably have to be removed if we join European monetary union. I hope there will not be any dramatic crisis of this kind before then, and therefore I suspect this is rather an academic clause. However, what puzzles me is the fact that it has a reference to the order taking the form of a statutory instrument. Legislation, even in the form of a statutory instrument, is a most inappropriate way of dealing with monetary management by the Treasury. Although this goes rather against the grain of trying to seek greater parliamentary accountability for the Treasury, I would have thought the last thing one wants to do is to have these kinds of directions enshrined in statutory form of one kind or another, which makes the whole process much more rigid. I would much rather see this take the form of a public statement by the Treasury which could be debated, rather than a statutory instrument, which will create all sorts of difficulties.

<P>
<A NAME="80304-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Let me deal first with Amendment No. 40, and reassure the noble Earl that my noble friend Lord Peston is entirely right. I am advised, at least as far as the Treasury is concerned, that "extreme economic circumstances" in this sense would incorporate extreme financial circumstances. In the example that he gave of the collapse of Asian economies, if that were to cause the collapse of the financial services industry in this country that could be an extreme economic circumstance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-17_para2"></a>I should be careful about saying that sort of thing, because the nature of extreme economic circumstances is that we cannot predict them and we cannot define them. That is why the Economic Secretary to the Treasury replied, in response to the question about the intervention of the IMF, "That is an interesting question". I suppose I should have said that it is an interesting question. However, there is no doubt that the collapse of the financial services industry in this country would have an economic effect which could produce extreme economic circumstances and could, under certain circumstances, trigger this clause. The noble Lord need have no fear that financial economic circumstances would be ignored for the purposes of Clause 19.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-17_para3"></a>My noble friend Lord Peston is not making mischief with his amendment. He is technically wrong in the sense that the order that is called for is a legal instrument and is therefore not the right place to set out the factual circumstances which, in the Treasury's view, would justify the making of the order. However, I cannot conceive of any circumstances in which the Government would wish to be, or get away with being, silent about the nature of the extreme circumstances and why it would be in the public interest to give directions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-17_para4"></a>Turning to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, the Government might well do so by introducing the order. The order itself will be very simple. It is not complicated or technical. It seeks parliamentary approval for what is a very important step. Parliament has justifiably been very twitchy recently about making sure that parliamentary approval is sought for major policy changes. I myself have been under a misguided attack for seeming to breach that principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-17_para5"></a>I can give my noble friend the assurance that the Government would be keen to make such a statement in the unfortunate event that the use of this power was ever contemplated. I can give the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, the assurance that the way in which that would be done would be by the statement which would accompany the order that is provided for in Clause 19. The two go together.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   Before the noble Earl, Lord Home, says what he is going to do, may I follow on from what the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, said? It was in my notes to raise a similar point and I am glad that he has raised it instead.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-17_para6"></a>Anything like this clause disappears when we go into European monetary union. Again, as somebody who favours that move, my concern is that the Maastricht Treaty contains nothing corresponding to such a clause. However, if economic policy is to evolve in Europe after Maastricht and we are to be part of that--and I put that conditionally despite my own views on what we ought to do--someone, somewhere, will have to have the equivalent of that clause because we cannot believe that Europe will never be hit by an economic and/or financial crisis that would not require an ability to intervene beyond what a central bank might be willing to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-17_para7"></a>I want to thank the noble Lord for reminding us that it has to go. I also want to add the point, with which I hope he will agree, that in due course we have to evolve something of that kind in Europe.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-17_spnew6"></A><B> The Earl of Home: </B>   I think I shall have to look through my old university notes, going back longer than I care to remember.

<A NAME = "80304-17_para11"></a>The noble Earl said: We have talked about "extreme economic circumstances", though I am not quite sure what they are. In moving Amendment No. 42, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 43 and 44, which cover the eventuality of a crisis blowing up when Parliament is in recess. As drafted, the government of the day could perfectly properly act rapidly by issuing an order under Clause 19(1). It is anticipated that that order would lapse after 28 days unless Parliament is recalled and approves the order.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-17_para12"></a>We have been told that the circumstances would have to be extreme and the country potentially in dire economic straits. I know and accept that it is difficult to recall Parliament in a great hurry, but as we are here talking about a major emergency and given the gravity of the situation, it must be right that, as soon as it is physically possible to recall Parliament, the Government should explain the reasons for overriding the Monetary Policy Committee's decisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-17_para13"></a>As drafted, there is nothing to stop a government issuing a further order followed by yet further orders until such time as Parliament might resume naturally anyway. As drafted, we could have three months' worth of continuing orders between the end of July and the beginning of November. While the amendments do not necessarily stop the issuance of further orders, albeit on a fortnightly basis, they do at least indicate to any government that Parliament really should be recalled if a crisis turns out to be ongoing. It must be right therefore that Parliament should have a chance to debate and consider an order and to make a positive approval of it at the earliest possible opportunity.

<P>
<A NAME="80304-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The first point I should like to make may appear semantic. The Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation noted that the procedure contained in the Bill was the common emergency procedure, which seems appropriate here. The period within which the order must be approved is also in line with Cabinet Office guidelines as set out in the statutory instrument practice. They say that the period within which such an order must be approved is usually 28 days, though sometimes it is a month or 40 days, and therefore allowing only 14 days is very unusual.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-18_para0"></a>Clause 19(5)says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In reckoning the period of 28 days for the purposes of subsection (4), no account shall be taken of any time during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued or during which either House is adjourned for more than 4 days". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<A NAME = "80304-18_para2"></a>The fundamental point is that the order takes immediate effect. It has to be approved within a specific period, but there is no delay in it taking effect, otherwise we could not have such an order. We would have to say, "We are not going to have any extreme economic circumstances during August and September". Bearing in mind that the whole definition of "extreme economic circumstances" is that they are not predictable, that would be tempting fate. So the noble Earl's fears are really unjustified.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-18_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Home: </B>   On the basis of those assurances I accept what the Minister has said; namely, that we shall be informed of these things very rapidly. On the question of period, it is no bad thing every now and then to question what seems to have been set in tablets of stone. I accept, nevertheless, that we have had assurances from the Minister that these points will be taken seriously, and he will no doubt want to bring them before Parliament. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "80304-18_para5"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 19 shall stand part of the Bill?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Taverne: </B>   I do not know whether this is an appropriate time to mention this, but one of my concerns about the Bill is that there is an important role which still has to be played by the Treasury in the control of inflation. One of the problems which faces the Monetary Policy Committee is that it does not have in any way within its brief--and it is quite understandable why not--any question related to the exchange rate. The problem of the exchange rate might conceivably be a cause of great embarrassment to our economic circumstances. For that reason, it is very important that the reserve powers should be maintained because they give the Treasury overriding powers in certain circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-18_para6"></a>I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Peston, said earlier. It is a worrying aspect that again there is no brief for the European Central Bank to have any regard to exchange rates in the future. There may have to be some similar plan, although I accept that exchange rates will be much less important to the European monetary union as a whole than it is to individual countries within the monetary union now.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-18_para7"></a>I want to put down a marker here. It is a grave omission from the five economic tests that the Chancellor laid down when he considered the future of economic decisions on whether or not we should join EMU, that he made no reference to the exchange rate. It is the most difficult of all the problems we face because he may well find that we have a high exchange rate at the time when we enter the two-year period of stability relating to the euro if we want to join EMU. Exchange rate policy will be a very important part indeed of the overall management of the economy over the next few years, something to which very little public attention has been paid.
<P>
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="80304-18_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Home </B>   moved Amendment No. 45:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 9, line 35, leave out from beginning to ("transferred") and insert ("As soon as the condition mentioned in subsection (2) below is satisfied, the following functions of the Bank shall be").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80304-18_para11"></a>The noble Earl said: In speaking to Amendment No. 45, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 48.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-18_para12"></a>These amendments are unashamedly probing. In this and future clauses we shall be discussing the Government's intentions as regards the transfer of banking supervision to the proposed Financial Services Authority and the assumption of some other responsibilities by the Bank. I say first that nothing I say in relation to this amendment or any future amendments hereafter should in any way be construed as criticism of the existing management or staff, either of the Bank or the new authority. We are now looking to the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-18_para13"></a>The first amendment is designed to ask the Government to define more clearly what happens in the event of the failure of a major British financial institution. My noble friend Lord Stewartby and I raised this point on Second Reading but have not yet received an answer on this point.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-18_para14"></a>The Economic Secretary said in Committee in another place that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it is for the Bank to take the lead with respect to developments in its field of responsibility, which includes not just the stability of the monetary system but payment systems and the financial infrastructure". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-18_para15"></a>Please note the words "the financial infrastructure". The collapse of a major British bank would undoubtedly affect the financial infrastructure, and from what she has said, one can only assume that in that circumstance, the Bank would lead any rescue or lifeboat operation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-18_para16"></a>Further, Mrs. Liddell went on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"That means that the other role for the Financial Services Authority is to take the lead where problems in an institution may pose a wider threat". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-18_para17"></a>These two statements seem to be contradictory, and frankly I do not see that at the moment we know who does what in such a crisis.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-18_para18"></a>These amendments also contain something of an exhortation, for in this Bill we are considering only the transfer of one of the nine disciplines for which the authority will be responsible in due course. I am not so concerned that there will not be a carefully prepared critical path analysis of the steps that have to be taken to <P>


<a name="column_CWH114"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH114</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>transfer the Bank's supervisory powers to the authority, although obviously to get that right is vital. However, noble Lords will remember the case in the United States when the transfer of the Thrift Institutions Advisory Council from Arkansas to Dallas led to serious problems and confusion. That problem was probably intensified by geography, as a lot of new staff had to be trained from scratch, which one hopes would not happen in this case. However, I am concerned that this transfer must be seen to be done 110 per cent. correctly, otherwise the unscrupulous may well believe that they can take advantage of any slipshod transfers of other regulatory bodies in future.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-18_para19"></a>I am here obviously talking about the increased potential for fraud. Sadly, deliberate attempts to buck the system, however good one might hope that system might be, sometimes succeed. I do not see any particular point here in debating the rights and wrongs of any incident which has happened in the past. But incidents such as the Barings case do flag up the point that even when a system is working, there are ways and means of bucking it. How much more opportunity will there be if the transfer of the supervisory functions of all the regulatory bodies is not done with the minimum disruption.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-18_para20"></a>There is one further point which concerns me about the transfer. One of the great attractions of the City of London--and as a Scot I must mention Edinburgh as well as there seem to be a lot of Scottish Members on this side of the Committee today--is that the Bank has in the past supervised institutions with a much lighter touch than the authorities in other major European cities which would like to compete with us for financial predominance. The UK has several advantages: geography, language and costs to name but three. However, the way that the Bank has regulated institutions in an almost paternal way has been a great advantage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-18_para21"></a>Traditionally institutions have come very rapidly to heel following a nod and a wink from the Bank, an action which is sometimes referred to as "the Governor's eyebrows". Such action does immediately stop a bank in its tracks, and potential problems have been nipped in the bud. I am not quite sure from the way this is set out, or indeed from the Memorandum of Understanding, who will be responsible for this type of action. Will the authority be the new institution which gives advance warning, in which case it must grow some eyebrows rather rapidly? The danger is that the authority will act more like auditors, with its powers set in tablets of stone, and some of the attractiveness of the UK will be lost.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-18_para22"></a>In the past the UK has benefited from over-stringent regulation elsewhere, and it is vital to achieve a balance between tight supervision to protect the depositor and no supervision such as we see in tax havens. Assurances from the Minister on these topics would be most welcome, and I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80304-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The noble Earl made an interesting speech about a whole range of issues concerning transfer. He has hardly spoken at all about the amendments and I am somewhat at a loss to know <P>


<a name="column_CWH115"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH115</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>how to respond. I shall start by saying something about the transfer of supervisory functions, why we think it is necessary and what stage we reach with this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-19_para0"></a>We believe that there is a general need to modernise the regulatory structure for financial services. Since the Financial Services Act 1986 was passed, huge changes have taken place. Some of those were anticipated and provided for by the 1986 Act and some occurred since then and led, among other things, to a considerable increase in complexity of the boundaries between different financial institutions. We need, therefore, to bring regulation of banking securities and insurance under one roof in order to secure more effective and efficient regulation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-19_para1"></a>What we are proposing reflects the way the sector itself is developing, with the traditional boundaries becoming increasingly blurred. The existing system is too complex and too fragmented. There is too much scope for gaps and costly duplication. We are, therefore, proposing reforms aimed at bolstering public and international confidence in the British regulatory system and hence the British financial sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-19_para2"></a>I acknowledge that this Bill is only the first legislative step. We are taking the opportunity of this Bill to transfer banking supervision to a new single regulator--the Financial Services Authority. It makes sense to transfer banking supervision as other changes are taking place within the Bank. It will allow the Bank to concentrate on its new range of functions. At the same time, we recognise that this is only the first step in the process. There will be wider regulatory reform to follow in the second Bill, which is now being prepared and which will be published in draft before it is included in any Queen's Speech. The extra time we have in preparing that second Bill gives us more opportunity to consult and to achieve lasting reform. We will be consulting on a draft of this Bill in the course of this summer.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-19_para3"></a>I cannot go any further in responding to the more general points made by the noble Earl. I do, however, have to respond to his amendments, because Amendments Nos. 45 and 48 in particular call for an estimate of the cost to businesses of complying with the regulatory requirements of the authority transferred under this section. We have made such an estimate and have included it in the Financial Memorandum, which is found with the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum of the Bill, and I read that in full:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government's expectation is that the overall cost to business under the new arrangements in respect of the transferred functions and cash ratio deposits will be no greater than under the current arrangements". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-19_para4"></a>I hope, therefore, that I can persuade the noble Lord that Amendments Nos. 45 and 48 are unnecessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-19_para5"></a>Amendments Nos. 46 and 47 are also unnecessary, in that it is perfectly obvious, from everything that has gone before in this discussion of the Bill and indeed from its drafting, that the Bank will retain its responsibilities under Parts I and II. All references to transfer in Part III are to that part alone. It is also <P>


<a name="column_CWH116"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH116</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>obvious that the authority will assume those powers immediately on transfer. There can be no other interpretation of the Bill as drafted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-19_para6"></a>Amendment No. 49 asks for no change of substance to the memorandum of understanding unless notice of such change has been given to both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-19_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Home: </B>   I have not yet moved Amendment No. 49.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I beg the noble Earl's pardon. I hope I have reassured the noble Earl that his Amendments Nos. 45 to 48 are unnecessary.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Stewartby: </B>   There is one point that I wish to raise with the noble Lord for clarification. Although I take comfort from the penultimate paragraph of the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to which he has referred, that appears to me to refer to the direct costs to business of the expense charged by the authority and the implications of cash ratio deposits.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-19_para7"></a>As I understand Amendment No. 48, my noble friend is talking about the costs of complying with the regulatory requirements, which are generally regarded as being a substantially higher figure. It would be nice to have a reassurance that the pattern of supervision is not to be altered in such a way as to impose even greater costs of compliance on the institutions concerned. For example, Section 39 reports under the existing Banking Act involve an enormous amount of work by the institutions concerned. They have to pay auditors to produce them. I should like an assurance, if the noble Lord can give it to me, that the sentence in this memorandum covers, so far as a reasonable assessment can be made, the actual costs which the institutions themselves incur in complying with their responsibilities.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The Financial Memorandum means what it states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government's expectation is that the overall cost to business under the new arrangements in respect of the transferred functions and cash ratio deposits will be no greater than under the current arrangements". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-19_para8"></a>I can give the assurance that the noble Lord seeks in the sense that the Bank does not create any new regulatory requirements. It merely transfers the existing supervisory function to the Financial Services Authority. Of course we cannot anticipate how efficient and cost-effective individual institutions are in the way in which they comply with regulations. What they need is the assurance I have just given that there are no regulatory requirements.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-19_para9"></a>I can also give the noble Lord the assurance that the Bill places on the FSA a legal requirement to consult on its fees, as on any other rules that it makes for the financial services industry, on the basis of an analysis of costs and benefits.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-19_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Home: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for kindly saying that I made an interesting speech which had nothing to do with the regulations. I was advised that that was the best way of bringing the points I was <P>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH117</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>making into the debate, although I repeat what I said at the beginning that it was an unashamedly probing set of amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-19_para10"></a>I accept what the Minister has said about the costs being referred to in the Financial Memorandum. We are getting very close to the time when, in terms of pounds and pence, we ought to have some idea of what the costs at least of this transfer should be. However, for the time being we will leave it at that. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 10, line 7, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) The Treasury shall ensure that no change of substance is made to the Memorandum of Understanding of June 1997 between the Treasury, the Bank and the Authority, unless notice of such change has been laid before both Houses of Parliament.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80304-19_para13"></a>The noble Earl said: The Bill sets out the objectives of the authority in broad outline, and the memorandum of understanding between the Treasury and the Bank and the authority puts flesh on to that skeleton. There are parts of the MOU that I should very much like to see incorporated on the face of the Bill. Viewed in isolation, the Bill certainly does not meet the Government's own objectives, one of which is transparency. That word occurs, quite rightly, very early on in the MOU.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-19_para14"></a>The MOU is a very well thought out document and I congratulate those involved in its drafting. It sets out in detail more of the objectives behind the Government's thinking, which is also welcome. A great deal of what we have been talking about and shall be discussing is in the MOU, not on the face of the Bill, and it seems desirable that there should be some mechanism whereby the MOU should be tied into the Bill in one form or another.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-19_para15"></a>Any government can change direction quite radically in their thinking and the application of their stance towards financial institutions. They can do so simply by instructing the three signatories to re-write the MOU. It has, after all, total control over all these three bodies. Surely it is right that Parliament should be made aware of any significant changes anticipated to the MOU. By including the words "of substance" in my amendment, I acknowledge that from time to time it may be desirable to make some changes to it. I am even giving the Government the right to decide what is, or is not, of substance. The MOU is, however, such a fundamental part of this Bill that the formal link between the two should be worked out in one form or another. I am not sure that my wording is necessarily the most appropriate way of doing this, but I am concerned more with the principle. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="80304-19_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   We do not need to be too concerned with the detailed wording. The noble Earl has made a very helpful speech and he is quite right to say that the memorandum of understanding is important to the understanding of this part of the Bill. In his <P>


<a name="column_CWH118"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH118</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>position, in Opposition, I would have done very much the same. I used to do much worse things--I would have included it as a schedule on the face of the Bill and then amended it in order to have it discussed. The noble Earl is more gentlemanly than I was.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-19_para16"></a>The memorandum of understanding is a flexible working document rather than a legal instrument. Although we do not envisage changing it, if it were necessary to change it, and the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FSA needed to change the way in which they work, it is important that they should be able to agree to do so and to put the new arrangements into immediate effect.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-19_para17"></a>The noble Earl has recognised that point by including the phrase "of substance" in his amendment. Certainly, if the arrangements have to change, and in particular, if substantial changes have to be made, the Government would publish the revised memorandum of understanding. I am quite sure that the Opposition would seek an opportunity to have the matter debated in Parliament if it were of sufficient importance. Of course, I cannot promise that because it would be a matter for the usual channels, but it would seem an entirely proper request.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: Before moving this amendment, and also speaking to Amendment No. 52 which is closely associated with it and Amendment No. 51, I would like to apologise for not having had the opportunity to attend the Second Reading of the Bill due to teaching obligations in Cambridge on that day, and also for not having been able to attend yesterday's proceedings for the same reason. I have, however, studied noble Lords' speeches in Hansard and will refer to them in my remarks.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para4"></a>Let me say at the outset that I totally support the Government's objectives of placing more financial regulation, including the regulation of institutions previously supervised by the Bank of England, under the control of the new Financial Services Authority.

<A NAME = "80304-20_para5"></a>The amendments I have proposed to the Bill before us will assist the Government in ensuring that this policy is not just a success in the end but that it is a success in the difficult transition period to which the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, referred a few moments ago.

<a name="column_CWH119"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH119</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para6"></a>As the Committee may be aware, I am an independent member of the board of the Securities and Futures Authority and, while much of what I have to say this afternoon is motivated by my experiences in that position, my remarks are made and my amendments put down in a purely personal capacity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para7"></a>Before outlining the argument for these particular amendments, I wish to comment on the underlying rationale for moving both Amendments Nos. 50 and 52, and Amendment No. 51, with which I will deal afterwards. All three amendments refer to Section 43 of the Financial Services Act. It is that section of the Act which resulted in the listing of firms which, being so listed, have up to now been regulated by the Bank of England. Listed firms have been regulated by the Bank both as regards their banking business and, in almost all cases, as regards their investment business as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para8"></a>As the Committee will be further aware, the Bill in Clause 21 transfers all supervisory activities, including the listing of firms, from the Bank of England to the Financial Services Authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para9"></a>My amendments are an attempt to enhance regulatory coherence among listed and unlisted firms with respect to all investment business (I am not concerned with banking business at all) during the period commonly known as N1 to N2; that is, from the enactment of this Bill in early summer of this year to the enactment of the more general financial services reform Bill, to which my noble friend referred, in about two years' time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para10"></a>These amendments will ensure that the listing of all institutions under Section 43 follows criteria which are more nearly in line with the registration procedures used to regulate firms conducting identical investment business which are currently regulated by the SFA. Accordingly, the investment business conducted by listed firms will be regulated in a manner more nearly akin to the manner of regulation of investment business by unlisted firms.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para11"></a>The criteria I propose will replace the essentially informal procedures used up to now by the Bank of England in listing, and which are indeed preserved, regrettably, in the Bill. Those informal procedures may have been appropriate for a regulatory authority which is also responsible for the conduct of monetary policy and the maintenance of liquidity; they are totally inappropriate to the new FSA.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para12"></a>It might be suggested that all this is unnecessary. After all, in a few months' time a new Bill to reform the regulation of the financial services industry will be introduced, and when that Bill becomes law, the whole process of listing firms under Section 43 will disappear and be replaced by new listing criteria which are the same for all investment business. That is, of course, quite true.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para13"></a>However, Part III of the Bill already provides for important interim measures to cover the period between the transfer of the Bank of England's regulatory powers to the FSA and the transfer of the powers of the other SROs, including the SFA, to the FSA--I am sorry about the alphabet soup which I am afraid bedevils discussion of these financial regulations.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH120"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH120</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para14"></a>Everyone acknowledges that this interim period is a dangerous period, and that it is vital that during it the regulatory structure should be as competent, as thorough and as coherent as it is possible to make it. My amendments, deriving as they do from my experience on the board of a financial services regulator, are designed to achieve those goals of competence, thorough regulation and coherence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para15"></a>I should be grateful if the Committee would consider the impact of three facts: first, the transfer of the responsibility for Bank of England regulated institutions to the FSA will mean that the investment business of the Section 43 listed firms will be the responsibility of the FSA. By the Bill, FSA staff will regulate listed firms according to Bank of England rules and procedures.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para16"></a>Secondly, according to the working agreement between the Securities and Futures Authority and the FSA, virtually all the staff of the SFA will be transferred to the FSA in June at the same time as Bank of England staff are transferred. Their services will then be contracted back to the SFA in order for it to maintain its statutory duties under the Financial Services Act--up to such time as the new financial services reform Bill is enacted and becomes operative in a couple of years time. By this Bill, FSA staff will regulate SFA firms according to SFA rules and procedures.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para17"></a>Thirdly, the FSA is organised along functional lines--supervision, enforcement, authorisation and so on--and not along old type of business lines. It is after all the recognition of Her Majesty's Government that the boundaries between types of financial business are becoming blurred to the point of irrelevance that is the rationale of the creation of the FSA in the first place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para18"></a>Let us take those three facts together: first, under this Bill SFA staff will regulate listed firms according to Bank of England rules; secondly, FSA staff will regulate SFA firms according to SFA rules and procedures; and the third point concerns the functional organisation of the FSA. What do these three things amount to? They mean that the same staff will be responsible for the authorisation, enforcement and supervision of the same sort of investment activities by listed firms and by non-listed firms. And yet the listing criteria, and hence the regulatory procedures, currently employed by the Bank of England are quite different from those applied by the SFA--but not always.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para19"></a>In the interim period, the same people will be regulating the same sort of business but in quite different ways. The difference is due entirely to the accident of history as to whether firms were regulated by the Bank of England or were regulated by the Securities and Futures Authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para20"></a>This is, I believe, not only incoherent but confusing and even dangerous. It is exactly the sort of regulatory incoherence which can be exploited by wrong-doers. It is exactly the sort of regulatory incoherence that is the great danger facing the UK system of financial supervision in the interim between N1 and N2.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para21"></a>Of course, there is no way in which the three amendments can result in a complete harmonisation of regulatory rules and procedures for all investment <P>


<a name="column_CWH121"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH121</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>businesses. There is no way we can achieve total coherence. That will require the next highly complex Bill, the draft of which we will see this summer.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para22"></a>But the two areas I shall be covering this evening, the criteria by which firms and individuals are deemed fit and proper to conduct investment business and the enforcement of conduct of business rules, go to the heart of the matter. Incorporating these amendments will remove a large proportion of the ambiguity and incoherence which, I am afraid, is the inevitable product of the gap between N1 and N2 if these amendments are not accepted by the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para23"></a>I make one final point before I proceed. My amendments embody some of the practical rules which have been developed since 1986 as an expression of the so-called SIB principles. I have presumed--and I should be grateful if the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, would confirm that this is the case--that since the FSA is just the SIB in modern guise, the SIB principles still hold and will apply to institutions previously regulated by the Bank of England once this Bill is enacted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para24"></a>I now turn to the specific character of the amendments. First, Amendments Nos. 50 and 52 deal with the definition of firms and individuals who will be fit and proper. These amendments are offered in support of my noble friend Lord McIntosh, who on Second Reading said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The key to the SFA's regulatory role will be the authorisation of those carrying on business in the relevant areas. It is consistent with having a single regulator that there should be a single authorisation requirement and a single process for considering applications".--[Official Report, 13/2/98; col. 1387.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para25"></a>The Bill before us does not achieve my noble friend's objectives; my amendments do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para26"></a>These amendments require that clear rules be formulated for establishing that institutions and the individuals comprising those institutions should be fit and proper to conduct investment business. They achieve coherence in the characterisation of what is fit and proper by requiring that rules which stem from the SIB principles should be applied to all investment businesses regulated by the FSA employees between N1 and N2. It is interesting that under Section 43 of the Financial Services Act there are at present no specific criteria for how firms are listed; that is, there are no specific criteria as to how the Bank of England should allow firms to join the list of firms which it supervises. It is essentially an informal procedure.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para27"></a>Amendment No. 50 replaces that informality by requiring that all institutions conducting investment business should, to be listed, be deemed fit and proper to conduct an investment business, according to the rules and practices of the Financial Services Authority; that is, according to the specific criteria which would and should be expected of a modern regulator. The listing procedure will no longer be informal. Amendment No. 50 will require that the procedure is clearly specified in rules and practices and is common for all institutions conducting investment business.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para28"></a>Amendment No. 52 requires that in order to be included on the list each institution must satisfy itself that its employees are fit and proper persons to carry out <P>


<a name="column_CWH122"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>their designated functions, and that, for such positions as the authority designates, persons appointed must be approved by the authority. Once again the procedures in place in the Bank of England are essentially informal. The Bank certainly requires that all senior management of listed firms should be fit and proper, but exactly how fitness and propriety are defined is not embodied in any set of formal rules. Amendment No. 52 ensures that the same rules will apply to all investment business.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para29"></a>I should make clear to the committee that Amendment No. 52 amounts to requiring the registration of individuals as fit and proper, something which the Bank of England has consistently opposed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para30"></a>It does not, however, amount to "kite-marking" of individuals. Section 43(2C)(a) of the Financial Services Act makes it clear that it is the responsibility of firms to satisfy themselves that individuals are fit and proper, and Section 43(2C)(b) makes it clear that an individual's registration is related to his or her post within a specific institution. In other words, the registration cannot be transferred from one firm to another; it is not a registration of an individual but registration of an individual within a specific post.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para31"></a>I should also make clear that by these amendments the burden of proof will be on the individual and on the firm which employs that individual. That is the case for investment businesses which are presently regulated by the SFA, and I believe that is entirely appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para32"></a>Amendments Nos. 50 and 52 replace the informality of Bank of England procedures with the more formal rules required of a modern regulator. They will ensure that coherent rules and practices will define which firms and which individuals are fit and proper for all investment business, not just some investment business. If these amendments are accepted, the same FSA staff will be regulating the same sort of business in the same way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para33"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 51, which applies to another dimension of the SIB principles, as developed in SFA rules, extending that to all investment business including that of firms listed under Section 43. In this case what is required is that the authority should ensure that listed firms obey conduct of business rules appropriate to the kind of investor it is dealing with and appropriate to the costs involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para34"></a>Once again I believe it is vital, especially in the period between N1 and N2, that Bank of England informality be replaced with modern rules. As regards the conduct of business, the Bank of England seeks to regulate conduct of business by means of its code of conduct set out in the so-called grey book; but the terms of the code are not rules. The code defines best practice, whereas rules demand a minimum satisfactory performance. Breaking a code does not automatically trigger disciplinary procedures. Breaking a rule does automatically trigger disciplinary procedures.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para35"></a>Conduct of business regulation is the fundamental protection which the supervisory system offers to individuals. It ensures that in what may be very complex areas, firms have the responsibility to provide <P>


<a name="column_CWH123"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH123</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appropriate information to ensure best execution and in all ways to deal with investment business in an appropriate manner.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para36"></a>In a modern regulatory system, it is surely imperative that what is appropriate should be embodied in clear rules, and of course that those rules are attuned to the characteristics of the counterparty, as set out in my amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para37"></a>It would surely be a nonsense if investment business conducted by listed firms--that is, those previously supervised by the Bank of England--was subject only to a best practice code, while identical investment business conducted by unlisted firms was subject to clearly defined conduct of business rules. Amendment No. 51 ensures that conduct of business regulation will be formal, clear and coherent rather than informal, unclear and incoherent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-20_para38"></a>These three amendments provide a framework of coherence between N1 and N2 which will ensure that the dangers, of which I spoke earlier and to which the Minister referred in introducing this section of the Bill, will be at least mitigated and substantially diminished. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My noble friend raised very serious matters and he raised them as appropriate in a serious way which reflects his expertise in the field and his wish to enhance the regulatory system. I am grateful to him for all of that. I thought at one stage that I would simply be able to answer by saying that he is trying to hurry us on and to implement more of the second Bill in the Bill than we had intended. Having listened intently to what he said, however, I rather think he is going further than that and is saying that there are new contradictions which will be introduced by the transfer which is proposed at this time. I shall, therefore, have to reflect that in my response.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para0"></a>Let me make it clear, first, that his amendments, which are in Section 43 of the 1986 Act, refer to wholesale money market institutions. He is quite right in saying that it has been the principle on which that Act operated that there should be a somewhat looser system when we are dealing with wholesale money market institutions whose clients are themselves in the financial services industry rather than members of the general public. He reflected that on a number of occasions in what he said. He is quite right in saying that the Bill simply transfers the existing regime--that is the somewhat looser regime for supervising money market institutions--from the Bank to the financial services industry, and that more general reform of the regulatory system will follow in the second Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para1"></a>Let me deal with the content of his amendments and then think aloud about how we are going to tackle the more complex points which he made in his speech. First, in relation to Amendment No. 50, under the general reform that will be the subject of our second Bill, money market institutions will be subject to a general fit and proper requirement as will all other authorised persons. It will be an explicit authorisation criterion applicable <P>


<a name="column_CWH124"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH124</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to money market institutions as well as to retail banks, securities houses, insurance companies and investment advisers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para2"></a>In the meantime, the money market institutions must meet certain conditions for admission to the list under Section 43. Those conditions are: that its financial position is sound; that its controllers, directors, managers and, where relevant, its partners are suitable and do not prejudice the sound management of the institution; that its ownership structure does not give rise to unacceptable conflicts or is otherwise a source of potential weakness; and that its systems, controls and record-keeping are adequate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para3"></a>Those conditions are clearly central to the general fit and proper concept as applied elsewhere in the financial services sector. The listed institutions are required to abide by the standards and principles set out in the London Code of Conduct. The conditions are set by the Bank and will in future be set by the FSA and approved by the Treasury. If there were any deficiencies in them--and my noble friend clearly indicated that he believes there are--they could be rectified without the need. for any amendment to the Bill. If my noble friend has any concerns about the listing criteria and he has raised those concerns in his speech, I shall be happy to discuss them with him before Report.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para4"></a>I should note that most of the Section 43 firms are banks or members of the Financial Services Authority in respect of other business they carry on and so will be subject to the fit and proper test as applied by the FSA or the SFA.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para5"></a>I will take the amendments in the order in which my noble friend dealt with them. Turning to Amendment No. 52, in keeping with our broad objective of ensuring that the FSA has the powers it needs, we are considering what powers are needed to ensure that individuals employed in the financial services industry meet high standards of competence and integrity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para6"></a>Until we have resolved the general approach, though--this is why I know that my noble friend is trying to hurry us up--we are reluctant to go down the route in the Bill for wholesale market institutions such as those listed under Section 43. These are firms which are granted the privilege of a lighter touch regime on the basis that they are dealing only with other expert players in the wholesale markets, not with retail customers. It would be odd to have a statutory power in that area alone.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para7"></a>The approach that we adopt will need to take into account the full range of authorised persons for which the FSA will be responsible. It may be that some statutory power along the lines suggested by my noble friend is the right approach, but that needs to be considered as part of the wider system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para8"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 51. Again, we are entirely in sympathy with my noble friend's intention. The FSA will have rule-making powers. In exercising those powers the FSA will in all cases be informed by its overall statutory objectives, including the protection of consumers and the duty to ensure the costs imposed by regulation are proportionate to its benefits. However, both the listing conditions and the London code of <P>


<a name="column_CWH125"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH125</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>conduct under which these money market institutions are required to operate have been drawn up with professionalism and integrity at their heart. The aim is to ensure that wholesale markets deliver the confidence that is needed for the benefit of investors and consumers more widely.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para9"></a>I am conscious that I have not answered the point that my noble friend made, which was to some extent central to his argument that the very fact of transfer brings the possibility of conflict and the possibility of the same people operating under different rules or under the same rules for different people. Rather than attempt to answer off the cuff two points which were not self-evident in the way the amendments were drafted, although they are clear in the way that he has spoken to them, much the best thing is for me to seek an opportunity to talk to him in detail before the next stage of the Bill and to undertake to take very seriously the matters that he has raised.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para10"></a>I do not think it would be possible for me to have anticipated the full rigour of the arguments that my noble friend has made. I apologise to him for that. However, I assure him that we shall seek every opportunity to ensure that the issues that he has raised are addressed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Eatwell: </B>   I am enormously grateful to my noble friend for his reply. I apologise if I placed him in a difficult position by the form of arguments that I put forward. I believe that we are facing a very serious problem of regulatory incoherence when we have the same sort of business being regulated by the same people but according to different rules.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para11"></a>I would say, however, that much of his answer hung on the argument that what we were dealing with was purely wholesale money market institutions. He may at this point have been misadvised or be labouring under a misconception. Under Part II of Schedule 5 to the Financial Services Act, it is clear that where the monetary limits on transactions are defined, which come under the terms of actions by investment business by listed firms, those monetary limits can be as low as &#163;100,000 and are typically &#163;500,000. Given the forms of gearing typically associated with transactions in money markets these days, those could easily be transactions made by individuals. There is no reason to suppose that they are just transactions made by large financial institutions. They could be individuals acting as a one-person firm. These are therefore not surely wholesale business transactions defined with respect to large banks or institutions dealing with each other but transactions which could involve individuals.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para12"></a>I hope I made the argument clear with respect to the definition of fit and proper. It is very important that, in particular, the notion of the registration of individuals as fit and proper should be introduced as soon as possible and should not wait until N2. It is an absolutely vital component of the supervisory apparatus in modern financial services and we need it as soon as possible to be applied throughout investment business in the British financial services sector.

<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para20"></a>Amendment No. 53 is a technical amendment to tidy up some of the consequential amendments and repeals contained in Schedules 5 and 9 to the Bill. As currently drafted, the Bill both substitutes a reference to the Bank and revokes that reference. This is clearly inconsistent, and the amendment I have tabled removes this inconsistency.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para21"></a>Amendments Nos. 54, 55 and 73 are technical amendments. Paragraph 41 of Schedule 5 makes consequential amendments to the Court and Legal Services Act 1990. Subparagraph (2) deletes the reference to the Bank of England in various sections of that Act and in Section 52(6) of the 1990 Act two references to the Bank of England are deleted. These three amendments ensure that the consequential changes to the Courts and Legal Services Act are accurate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para22"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 56 is a technical amendment required to make a consequential amendment to the Building Societies Act 1997. It arises because of the transfer of banking supervision to the FSA. The Building Societies Act in Section 32 makes provision <P>


<a name="column_CWH127"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>for a future amalgamation of the Building Societies Investor Protection Board with the Deposit Protection Board. Provision is made for consulting the Building Societies Commission and the Bank before making any order affecting this amalgamation and for the Governor of the Bank to appoint ordinary members of the new board. Following the transfer of supervision, the comparable supervisory body for banks will be the FSA, so it will no longer be appropriate for the Bank to be consulted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-21_para23"></a>The amendments make the necessary change to allow the authority to be consulted for the Bank, rather than the Bank, and for the chairman of the FSA to appoint ordinary members of the new board. I beg to move.

<A NAME="80304-22_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Home </B>   moved Amendment No. 57:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 10, line 37, at end insert ("or negligent"").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80304-22_para0"></a>The noble Earl said: Clause 25 refers to the immunities to be enjoyed by the authority. Those previously working on supervision within the Bank enjoyed Crown status, which was understandable particularly at the more senior levels in the Bank. Some people were above the Chinese wall, in that they were involved not just in supervision but also, in those days, in advice on monetary policy. That status will, as I understand it, be removed for those being transferred and indeed for new recruits to the authority. Those types of people will now have their immunities enshrined in statute. By and large, in the interests of transparency, I support this change.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-22_para1"></a>The members of the authority are now a combination of policemen, auditors and agony aunts. As far as I know, those three categories of professionals are not immune from action for negligence. The Government have repeatedly stressed that they are looking for maximum co-operation in all parties affected by this legislation. Institutions and individuals would be more willing to volunteer information if they knew that there was some redress if information leaked because a member of the authority negligently left a document in a train or other public place. Other aspects of disclosure of information will be discussed later. I am talking here about negligent disclosure of information. There is no reason why members of the authority should not be subject to the same disciplines as the rest of us in this instance. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am glad to hear that the noble Earl supports the change in general. It is a helpful context in which to consider this amendment. We take the view that it is essential, if the regulator is to be able to operate effectively, that he is not constantly constrained by the fear of speculative or constructive litigation. It is right for people to be able to seek damages if it can be shown that the regulator acted in good faith. But we want a regulator who is free to act as necessary. It is important that the FSA is not too timorous to be effective. Narrowing immunity, which <P>


<a name="column_CWH128"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would be the effect of the amendment, would result in the FSA being unduly constrained by the fear of speculative or obstructive litigation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-22_para2"></a>Alternatively, the FSA might be encouraged to collect more information than it would otherwise need, or to set tougher minimum standards, or to take longer over decisions than otherwise. That would drive up the costs for the businesses being regulated. The existing regulation provides immunities for the FSA and the Bank so long as they act in good faith.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-22_para3"></a>The clause simply extends the same immunity to the FSA's new functions in relation to money market institutions. The wording follows exactly that of Section 1(4) of the Banking Act, which will apply to the Financial Services Authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-22_para4"></a>There is no change imposed here. The noble Earl is in fact proposing more intrusive regulation for wholesale market institutions, which have hitherto benefited from a separate, lighter touch regime. With due respect to my noble friend Lord Eatwell, who is clearly concerned about this lighter touch regime, it is out of character for the Opposition to be seeking to make the regime more intrusive than proposed here. On that basis, I hope that the noble Earl will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-22_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Home: </B>   I am not trying to restrict any information; I am trying to stop negligence and encourage what is called in the City, a "clean desk" policy, which means that they are negligent in letting bits of paper fly around the place and ought to be accountable for gross acts of negligence such as leaving a bit of paper on a train. Not being a lawyer, I may have come up with the wrong wording to achieve the objective which I required. It was not my intention to put the fear of God into the regulators in thinking that they would sued. The objective was to stop ordinary negligence. We had better return to this on Report when I have taken more legal advice.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Before the noble Earl withdraws the amendment, I should like to say that, in the light of the debate we have had on my noble friend's amendment, I would like to reflect on his amendment as well.

<A NAME="80304-22_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Home: </B>   I am most grateful to the Minister for saying that he will reflect on it.

Given that these proposals are of an interim nature and will last only a couple of years, I believe that the financial sector will go along with them, whilst no doubt making strong representations on the future structure during the consultation process on Stage 2.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-22_para12"></a>I would here beg the Minister to ensure that this consultation process is done thoroughly but also speedily. We know that at any one time there are probably dozens of foreign banks and institutions wondering whether to locate here or whether to go elsewhere. Overhead costs are a vital element in deciding where to locate, and the supervisory costs within those overheads, being a significant proportion, could influence their thinking.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-22_para13"></a>Also, several institutions are currently regulated by more than one body. As far as possible, institutions need to know the totality of costs, and particularly those considering coming here rather than those already here would be more than interested to know the Government's thinking on this. Again, to the degree that they can let us know what those costs would be, institutions would be grateful.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-22_para14"></a>I make no apology for saying yet again that we are under the threat of competition from Frankfurt, Paris and other European centres, and in particular institutions which would now only be regulated by one or two bodies are concerned that the infrastructural costs of the authority might place undue strain on them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-22_para15"></a>Finally, I should be grateful if the noble Lord could also enlighten me on one further point. The consultation paper says the transition costs will be recovered over "a few years related to the annual fee". We all know that it is expensive to set up a new big group and the FSA will need departments such as human resources and internal audit, which individual groups to date have not needed. Can the Government yet tell us over what period the start-up and transition costs will be recovered? I beg to move.

<A NAME="80304-22_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   These amendments cover ground that was available for discussion when we were considering Clause 21. Because I was being economical in my speeches, I possibly did not make some of the points that I could have made then. I want to reassure the noble Earl by saying, first of all, that the FSA is currently consulting on banking supervision fees for next year. I take his point that the consultation should be as quick as possible in order to reassure banks <P>


<a name="column_CWH130"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and, particularly foreign banks. Also, the FSA has published a plan and a budget for 1998-99 which shows a reduction in budgeted costs for banking supervision of &#163;6 million, from &#163;73 million to &#163;67 million. That will influence the charges that are made by the FSA to the banks being supervised.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-22_para16"></a>Strictly speaking, the amendments are not entirely clear. The noble Earl says that he wants the proportionality to be the size of the institutions. There are various ways of measuring the size of institutions. One could also argue that proportionality should be to the benefit of regulation. The FSA is clear about the need to ensure that the costs that it imposes, through its rules as well as directly through its fees, are proportionate to the benefits of regulations. Proportionality of the regulatory burden is the principle which underlies the wholesale market regimes to which Clause 26 refers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-22_para17"></a>The FSA will be subject to statutory objectives, including one to be efficient and economic, and to impose only those costs on the industry as are proportionate to the benefits of regulation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-22_para18"></a>The second Bill, a draft of which will be published this summer, will provide that when the FSA consult on fees, it will have to publish details of its proposed budget as part of the same exercise. This will give the industry a much better opportunity to participate in the setting of the FSA's priorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-22_para19"></a>I well appreciate the concerns which underlie the noble Earl's amendment. I hope that what I have said to him about what will happen next year and what is proposed for the second Bill will alleviate at least some of his concerns.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80304-23_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Home: </B>   I thank the Minister for that and I am grateful to him for confirming that the consultation process will be as speedy as it reasonably can be. Again, we are talking about an interim phase. The noble Lord has confirmed that the Government are promoting the concept of proportionality. Obviously, one can make proportionality subject to a great many things, I accept that. We have to be very careful that a smaller institution, which might be regulated by only one or two people, does not carry the same burden as the enormous institution. We shall be watching how those costs turn out over the period between now and the next Bill.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: I beg to move Amendment No. 64, and I will speak to Amendment No. 65.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para12"></a>The amendments ensure that one of the bitter lessons learned during the Barings affair is not forgotten: namely, that supervisory authorities should themselves be subject to assessment and examination by an authority which is not only independent but is seen to be independent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para13"></a>Noble Lords will remember that the investigation into the conduct of the supervisory authorities at the Bank of England with respect to the Barings affair was conducted by the Board of Banking Supervision (the board referred to in Clause 28). They will remember also that the Board of Banking Supervision has the statutory duty under the Banking Act 1987 to advise the Governor of the Bank on the exercise of his supervisory functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para14"></a>Under the Banking Act, the board consists of three ex officio members, the Governor, the deputy governor and the executive director responsible for regulation, plus six independent members appointed jointly by the Governor of the Bank and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Crucially, the board is chaired by the Governor.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para15"></a>Noble Lords will recognise that essentially the same structure is contained in Clause 28, including the provision that the executive head of the institution responsible for supervision should chair the committee responsible for investigating whether that supervision is conducted in a satisfactory manner. It is this provision for chairing the board that amendments seek to change.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para16"></a>Noble Lords will certainly remember that at the time of the public of the report of the Board of Banking Supervision into the Barings affair the value of that report was called into question both in your Lordships' House and in another place and in the financial press, when it was revealed that the conclusions had been drafted at meetings of the board chaired by the Governor and Mr. Quinn, who was at the time the executive director responsible for supervision.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para17"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, noted on 18th July 1995 that the conclusions of the report did not seem to follow from the analysis which had been prepared by the independent members alone. He wondered whether the difference was attributable to the person who chaired the meetings at which the conclusions were drafted. My noble friends Lord Hollick and Lord Desai, speaking on 21st July 1995, when we managed to keep the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, from his holiday for some hours, both argued that it was unfortunate that the Governor <P>


<a name="column_CWH132"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be the chairman of the committee examining activities for which he was himself responsible. They called for a new independent inquiry. For the sake of completeness, I should point out that the principal Treasury spokesman for the Opposition also expressed these fears, although perhaps that citation is somewhat diminished by the fact that that person was myself.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para18"></a>Similarly at the proceedings of the Treasury and Civil Service Committee of another place, held on Wednesday 19th July 1995, members of the committee expressed disquiet over the Governor's role as chairman of the Board of Banking Supervision, and suggested that it was hardly surprising that the Bank had accepted with alacrity the conclusions in the drafting of the final version of which the Governor and Mr. Quinn had themselves participated.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para19"></a>Let me be absolutely clear. No one has suggested--and I am certainly not suggesting--any impropriety in the operation of the Board of Banking Supervision or on the part of the Governor and Mr. Quinn. What was suggested, and I believe was correctly suggested at the time, was that the report should not only be independent, but it should be seen to be independent by virtue of having an independent chairman to prepare it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para20"></a>I am sure that the Government are totally in agreement with this sentiment. Indeed, my noble friend speaking on Second Reading of this Bill argued that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The objective of the reform is again to enhance transparency and improve accountability".--[Official Report, 13/2/98; col.1385.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para21"></a>My amendments seek to achieve this with respect to the Board of Banking Supervision. In the new era of regulatory openness and institutional transparency, it is totally unacceptable for an individual with the authority of a chief executive to chair the body designed to monitor the institution for which he is responsible. Amendment No. 64 removes that embarrassment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para22"></a>Amendment No. 65 requires that the chairman of the Board of Banking Supervision be elected from among independent members of the board, so that the chairman would be an independent member and not the chief executive of the FSA--or, as in the past, the chief executive of the Bank of England.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para23"></a>I am quite sure that the drafting of Clause 28 was a slip on the Government's part. These simple amendments prevent the new FSA inheriting unfortunate and embarrassing practices from the Bank of England. They seek to ensure that just and effective monitoring of some of the supervisory activities of the FSA will not just be done effectively, but will be seen to be done effectively. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend for the way in which he has introduced these two amendments. I appreciate that they are intended to further reinforce the independence of the Board of Banking Supervision by appointing as a chair one of the non-executive members.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para24"></a>In general it has not been our aim in this Bill to change the banking supervision regime in the course of transferring it to the FSA. This, again, is a matter which we will have to discuss with my noble friend between now and Report. However, in transferring the Board of <P>


<a name="column_CWH133"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH133</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Banking Supervision across to the FSA, we have already sought to increase its independence by reducing the number of executive members from three to two. I should point out that the Board of Banking Supervision is primarily an advisory body for the FSA and not an investigative body. When it investigated the Bank's performance, the investigative members--including the chairman--withdrew.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para25"></a>In the longer term we do not propose to retain the board in its current form. This would not be in keeping with the wider regulatory responsibilities of the FSA. The current provisions are only temporary until the second Bill can introduce a thorough-going reform of the system. The FSA has been consulting on the form of practitioner input for the longer term.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para26"></a>So we are not opposed to the spirit of these amendments, which would appoint a non-executive chair until a longer-term solution is legislated for. However, we need to consider the issue further in the context of the longer-term plans for practitioner input and to take account of the views of the Board of Banking Supervision members. On that basis, I hope my noble friend will see fit to withdraw his amendments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Eatwell: </B>   I must say that I find that reply rather disappointing. First, the Minister referred to the reduction in the number of executive members from three to two. He may have noticed that, in the investigation of the Barings affair, there were only two executive members involved because Mr. Rupert Pennant-Rea, who was deputy governor, resigned prior to the beginning of the inquiry and no new member was appointed. So the numbers of executive members in the Barings investigation, and those contained in the Bill before us, are exactly the same.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para27"></a>My noble friend also seems to have overlooked the point I made about the drawing up of the conclusions of the Board of Banking Supervision in the Barings investigation. He is quite right that the investigation was conducted by the non-executive members, but the peculiarity, as was pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, at the time, was that the conclusions were drawn up at a committee chaired either by the Governor or by Mr. Quinn: that is, the executive members were actually involved in drawing up the conclusions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para28"></a>As the noble Lord was speaking, I also found myself worrying about the insistence that these procedures were purely temporary. This brings to mind the number of temporary portacabins outside schools which are still there 20 years after they were erected, or indeed some of the prefabricated housing erected at the end of the Second World War, which I happened to pass in Swindon when I was there the other day. I find this word "temporary" very disturbing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-23_para29"></a>In light of what my noble friend said, I hope he will look very seriously at what is a very simple change which would significantly enhance the reputation of the Board of Banking Supervision, albeit in the period between N1 and N2. Moreover, it would be a powerful signal of the commitment of the Government to a new regulatory era of openness and transparency.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 13, line 35, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) In making an order under subsection (1)(b) above, the Treasury shall ensure that no extra costs arising from such transfer shall be imposed on existing holders of stock on the National Savings Stock Register and that the overall level of charges is subject to controls similar to those in other parts of this Act.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80304-24_para5"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving Amendment No. 66, I shall also speak to Amendment No. 67. These are two very quick points but important ones for the small investor. They refer to the transfer to the Bank of the gilt business of the National Savings Stock Register and the future provision of brokerage services in connection with gilt registration.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-24_para6"></a>The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that no extra financial strain is placed on the small investors. Institutions or high-net worth individuals have a whole range of stockbrokers and financial advisers to help them negotiate commissions, but the small man with a little spare cash to invest does not have that type of protection. Yet he is the sort of person whom we want to encourage to invest.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-24_para7"></a>As far as that type of person is concerned, I do not believe that he ought to stand the cost of these transfers through increased charges. I may have missed it, but I do not believe we have yet been told what the cost of this transfer is, and I would ask the Minister to let us know if he has a figure at this stage. However, on the assumption that it does not run into many millions, I would hope that the Government would agree that the transfer could be sourced either out of the Bank's profits or at least from a source that did not impact on the small investor.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-24_para8"></a>Amendment No. 67 simply recognises the fact that the Bank is in a near monopolistic position in this instance and, again, the small investor should be protected. I am not asking that this service should be offered at a loss but rather charged out at a rate which is consistent with market practice elsewhere for a similar service. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am slightly puzzled by this proposal. The FSA is already, or will be, subject to the restrictions under Part V of the Banking Act in relation to all of the confidential information which it obtains in the discharge of its functions. So imposing <P>


<a name="column_CWH135"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH135</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>these requirements, which are only drawn up in relation to the information needed for compiling monetary statistics and assessing liability for CRDs--I beg your Lordships' pardon, I have renumbered my amendments and I went on to the wrong one. This is the amendment on the National Savings Stock Register.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-24_para9"></a>The main purpose of this measure is to reduce costs by merging the two similar services, although, in response to the request of the noble Earl, it is not possible yet to put a precise figure on the costs of the transfer. However, it is not appropriate to specify in legislation that the charge for providing a service cannot be increased since future increases in running costs may require an increase in charges to avoid making losses. However, we do expect existing holders of stock on the NSSR to benefit from the transfer. National Savings has been running the NSSR at a loss because the commission charged on the service does not cover the costs. Without a merger, there would have been pressure on National Savings to raise charges. However, once the transfer has been implemented, the economies of scale that the Bank can bring to bear mean that charges to customers using the official brokerage service can be contained.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-24_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Home: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for that answer. When we have the precise figure, we may wish to readdress this question. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

 . In this Schedule, "the Bank" includes the Financial Services Authority, where that Authority is exercising functions transferred to it under section 21 or Schedule 4.").

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80304-24_para17"></a>The noble Earl said: We have already discussed the removal of Crown status from members of the authority and the effect of that change. This amendment picks up the important point of disclosure of information by members of the authority. It is a point which my noble friend Lord Boardman and I raised during Second Reading and the Minister was kind enough to acknowledge it at that stage and said he would be addressing it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-24_para18"></a>As I have said before, it is important that the authority and the institutions develop the same mutual trust which currently exists between the Bank and the financial practitioners. Banks want to be open with the authority, but they will not be open unless they feel there are adequate safeguards protecting them from action by third parties because they have been required to disclose <P>


<a name="column_CWH136"></a>

<B>4 Mar 1998 : Column CWH136</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>privileged information. At least under this amendment they would have the same redress against the authority as they would have against the Bank.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-24_para19"></a>The MOU, to which we have referred in the past, in paragraphs 5 and 6 specifically addresses the collection of information point. Paragraph 6 says:

<A NAME = "80304-24_para20"></a>If either the Bank or the authority can collect the information and then use it, it seems strange that the Bank is subject to restriction on disclosure but the authority is not. Surely both institutions should be subject to the same discipline. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304-24_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   With renewed apology, I will now respond to the amendment which is before us. The FSA is subject to the restrictions under Part V of the Banking Act in relation to all the confidential information it obtains in discharge of its functions. This amendment refers only to the information needed for compiling monetary statistics and assessing liability for cash ratio deposits. What would happen is that we would have a second regulatory regime for those statistics. We would have regulatory information subject to two different sets of confidentiality requirements.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304-24_para21"></a>The question is, what does the FSA do when the requirements differ? What if information could be disclosed to another regulatory body or a public authority under Part V of the Banking Act but could not be disclosed under Schedule 7? Presumably the FSA would not be able to make a disclosure that Parliament and indeed the noble Earl thought was necessary for the purposes of sound regulation when the Banking Act was passed. The confusion is relatively simple and I hope that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

I am not in the least surprised that he brought forward this amendment. I would have been deeply disappointed if he had not, but knowing his track record on these matters he did not let me down. I just hope that his good example is followed by the rest of the Government.

Sheikh Ali S. A. Salman, citizens of Bahrain, who applied for asylum on their arrival in the United Kingdom on 17 January 1995, after being imprisoned without charge or trial since early December 1994, and then expelled from their country by the authorities: and why these cases have so far taken more than three times the average time to resolve.[HL755]<P></UL>

<P>
<A NAME="80304w01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   It is not possible to give such a date. However we do expect to be in a position to resolve these applications by the summer. Current delays in dealing with applications are the result of the large backlog of cases in the Asylum Directorate and it is inevitable that some cases will take significantly longer than the average.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304w01_wqn6"></A><B> Lord Acton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What are the latest figures for vacant dwellings in England.[HL920]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304w01_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  The total number of vacant dwellings in England is down by 23,000 on the April 1996 figure. This fall is encouraging.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304w01_para0"></a>At 1 April 1997, a total of 81,200 council homes in England were empty, 2.4 per cent. of local authorities' stock. The 1996 figure was 79,600 (2.3 per cent). All of the increase was in "management vacants" (dwellings available for letting immediately or after minor repairs), which account for 61 per cent. of all vacant local authority homes.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304w01_para1"></a>We are disappointed to see that the total number of local authority vacants has risen for the third year running, after falling in successive years between 1990 and 1994. It is clearly part of good housing management practice for local authorities to keep their empty dwellings to a minimum. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions Working Group on Best Value in Housing will be looking at performance indicators, and will consider whether it would be appropriate for local authorities to establish local targets for reducing the proportion of their housing stock which is out of effective use.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304w01_para2"></a>We are making nearly &#163;800 million available to local authorities in 1997-98 and 1998-99 through the Capital Receipts Initiative, and we hope that local authorities will make the very best use of this additional spending power to improve and renovate their existing stock and make it more attractive to prospective tenants.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304w01_para3"></a>It is also disappointing to note that vacancy rates in the Registered Social Landlord (RSL) sector have risen from 23,600 (2.5 per cent.) at April 1, 1996 to 26,800 (2.7 per cent.) at April 1, 1997. The Housing Corporation has published research and held seminars to inform and encourage RSLs to take action to reduce void levels. RSLs should also benefit from the development of Best Value in Housing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304w01_para4"></a>Many local authorities and RSLs already have good empty property strategies for which they can take credit. But there is still much to be done, and the Government will continue to encourage social housing providers to develop and implement effective empty property strategies to make the best use of existing housing stock.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304w01_para5"></a>The number of vacancies in the private sector fell from 667,000 in 1996 to 640,000 in 1997. This is the fourth successive year that the numbers have fallen. About 45 per cent. of private sector empty homes are "transactional" vacancies, which are properties lying vacant for a short period as part of the normal buying and selling process. Some 225,000 are problematic vacants which may require action to bring them back into use.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304w01_para6"></a>In the government sector, the number of empty homes held by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Ministry of Defence and the Home <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80304w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Simon of Highbury): </B>  My right honourable friend the President of the Board of Trade is today publishing a consultation paper, Modern Company Law for a Competitive Economy. The paper sets out her plans for a major review of company law and its relationship with corporate governance codes. The review will focus on the Companies Act 1985. Insolvency and Financial Services legislation will not in general fall within its scope.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304w02_para0"></a>The review is an important part of the Government's strategy to modernise the nation. While much of the relevant statute has stood the test of time, the review will ensure that company law statute can continue to underpin the growth, competitiveness and accountability of British companies into the 21st Century. It will, for example, consider whether, taking account of partnership law and the proposed Limited Liability Partnership, business has the right choice of legislative vehicles for growth. It will address the complexity of the current legislation, and ensure a structure that is clear to users; and it will seek a flexible framework of regulation which is cost effective for companies, and fair to all interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304w02_para1"></a>The review will be a considered, consultative and long-term process. A Steering Group, chaired by the Department of Trade and Industry, will manage the review process; and there will be a widely-based consultative committee to ensure active representation of all wider interests. Full public consultation will continue at the end of this year with the first report of a first expert working group, and will continue throughout the process.
<P>

<A NAME = "80304w02_para2"></a>The review will culminate in the publication of a White Paper on proposed company law reforms, towards the end of this Parliament.

<A NAME = "80304w02_para5"></a>Table 1 shows how many fundholding and non-fundholding practices received deprivation payments in each of the last four years, indicating how the profile has changed over time. General medical services (GMS) deprivation payments are made to general practitioners for each patient on their list classified as living in underprivileged areas (UPA). Arrangements for assessing entitlement to these payments are based on the Jarman score for UPA as the measure of deprivation. This index is constructed from census variables weighted according to GP's perceptions of their influence on GMS workload. The <P>
