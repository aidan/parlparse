On 8 January, Jonathan Shaw, the marine and fisheries Minister, met the deputy ambassador from Japan to express the United Kingdom&#146;s outrage and to urge Japan to end its slaughter of whales. On 21 December, the UK, along with 29 other countries, also took part in a d&#233;marche calling on the Japanese to cease all their lethal scientific research on whales and to assure the immediate return of the vessels.</p>

I hope he will pass on my thanks to his department for the work that it has done on this matter. What is the position of the two people from the &#147;Sea Shepherd&#148;, who boarded a Japanese whaling vessel yesterday in order, they say, to present a letter to the captain stating that it was unlawfully whaling? They were, according to press reports, detained and tied to the mast. Will my noble friend ensure that any protests on this subject are made at the highest level; namely, the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister?</p>

We have noted the reports that crew members of the &#147;Sea Shepherd&#148; are being detained on a whaling ship. Obviously, we want to see these detained members handed over to the proper authorities, and hope that this can be achieved safely and without further delay. Japan has confirmed that the two men have been detained, but denies that they have been harmed or assaulted.</p>

It was made quite clear at that conference that the Japanese research project was not scientific and therefore broke the convention on whaling. Are the Government going to take any legal action within international fora to enforce that motion and get a redefinition of scientific whaling?</p>

Japan&#146;s view that its whaling is scientific is quite preposterous. The latest check on the position in 2006 showed that of the almost 500 papers on whales posted on the ISI Web of Knowledge database, only 0.8 per cent came from Japan&#146;s whaling programme, so it is not scientific in the sense of publishing papers. We continue with our work through the International Whaling Commission, and all United Kingdom foreign posts are constantly on the lookout for people joining&#151;or not joining, as the case may be&#151;the commission, because that is really where these decisions must be taken.</p>

It is perhaps only coincidental, but many of them get economic support from Japan. Will my noble friend at least investigate discussing with like-minded countries the possibility of setting up a fund that has a countervailing effect on Japanese economic transactions in that area?</p>

<a name="08011674000016"></a><b><a name="80116-0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08011674000561"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, my noble friend raises an issue that I am told is highly sensitive. Allegations are consistently made regarding new members who join the International Whaling Commission and their apparent economic connections with Japan, but evidence has been a bit short on the table. Nevertheless, we have recently renewed our efforts through a document <I>Protecting Whales: A global responsibility</I>, the foreword to which was signed by both the Prime Minister and Sir David Attenborough. It was sent to more than 60 countries in the past few months. We are also actively working, through like-minded countries, to make sure that membership of the International Whaling Commission is such that the moratorium is maintained. My noble friend Lord Gilbert&#146;s concern is constantly raised, but evidence is in short supply.</p>

I understand that something like &#163;10 million a year is brought in there from that industry.</p>

The figures for the southern hemisphere show that in 1900 it was estimated that there were 240,000 blue whales; yet in 1996, the estimate was 1,700. At the same time, estimates have been made that the whale-watching industry is worth a billion dollars a year globally. There are thus economic advantages to not killing whales, which, as we know with good reason, cannot be killed safely, quickly or humanely. There is economic benefit derived from preserving whales and letting their stocks rise again.</p>

Is it the case that Japan is not observing the text of a treaty to which she is a party, or rather that she has chosen not to join that part of the treaty?</p>

As I said, it claims that the whaling is scientific, yet it publishes no papers&#151;or not to the extent that others do on it&#151;so it cannot put any facts behind the claim. The meat ends up on the market in Japan, so the allegation is that it is not scientific. No research or papers come out of it, although Japan claims that, scientifically, it needs to kill 1,000 whales to find out how they live. Well, while it is not publishing any papers based on its research, that killing is feeding back into restaurants in Japan.</p>

The Foreign Office has been involved, and we have contacted more than 60 countries within the past few months since, as I said, we republished that document with a foreword from the Prime Minister. Messages have also been sent to all our posts abroad. This has not been left just to the government department dealing with marine and fisheries; it is being dealt with at the highest level, across government and on an international basis. That is the only way we can deal with it.</p>

Given the failure that was identified in managing the MMC process, are the Government considering the need for and the purposes and functions of a co-ordinating body for NHS medical education in England, as has been proposed by Sir John Tooke, to lead on and take responsibility for training issues into the future?</p>

This year, there will be 9,000 opportunities for postgraduate training across England and a further 10,000 training posts, which are already filled through a run-through training system. We can never predict the number of applicants to a specific number of training posts, but that is separate from opportunities to obtain a job in the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="08011674000066"></a>On Sir John Tooke&#146;s recent recommendation, which is of great interest, we have to remember that it was not in the interim report. However, it is fresh thinking and certainly welcomed by the department. It is extremely important that we think about the functionality and the clear accountability of structures before we create a structure. We have had that experience in the creation of the MMC structure. The recommendation is very creative, but we should think quite hard about it.</p>

One of the serious problems now is that young doctors are applying for jobs where they do not necessarily know the consultant or the team for whom they are working. Will the Government look again at the system under which we both trained&#151;the old firm system&#151;whereby one can have a close relationship with a group of doctors and work much more as a team, something which is, sadly, increasingly lacking from the NHS and is compounded by the problem of Modernising Medical Careers at present?</p>

The purpose of Modernising Medical Careers was to get over the variability in the quality of training. In certain parts of the country, there was no agreed curriculum or standard of assessment. I strongly believe that the ethos of MMC is correct. However, when it comes to the selection and the process in which MMC should be implemented, my noble friend raises an important point. In 2008 we feel that the deaneries at a local level should be carrying out the selection. I also agree with him that the NHS and its local needs should determine the number of posts at a local level. That should also be considered in the light of the Tooke recommendations.</p>

The first noble Lord to raise this issue was, I think, the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, and I am pleased to see him in his place. Since we last debated this issue there has been a large and obvious increase in the number, the size and the sophistication of these adverts. There is also evidence of larger commercial organisations coming into the market. That is inevitable, given the clearly ineffective enforcement action by central government. In other words, it is not being effective at getting the local authorities to deal with the problem. It would be highly undesirable for farmers to get used to this income stream, because it will have to be turned off at some point&#151;better sooner rather than later.</p>

<a name="80116-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08011674000096"></a>These adverts are regulated by the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations (SI 2007/783). I hope the Minister can reassure the House that not only are the regulations comprehensive and detailed&#151;they are, but I could not understand them when I read them&#151;but also that they provide local authorities with all the powers that they need. I hope we do not need more regulations, with all their attendant pitfalls. For instance, we would not want to arrive at the next general election to find that we had accidentally banned all political roadside adverts, which are not a problem because they are erected for short periods, they only set the mood music, they do not require the recording of any details by drivers and of course they are not for commercial purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08011674000097"></a>Central government needs to ensure that the current legislation is used, and to informally tell the advertising industry to knock it off. If the Government do not succeed in reducing the number and the size of these

If the moving vehicle is a truck and the stationary vehicle is a school minibus, I dread to think what the coroner&#146;s report would say and I would certainly not want to be the Minister explaining to Parliament why nothing had been done to avoid such a clear and present danger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08011674000098"></a>Is the Minister satisfied that the regulations, which were laid only last year, are effective? If he is, why do we still have the problem?

These advertisements are growing in number, and on trunk roads they are positioned around roundabouts. They are a distraction and enforcement action certainly needs to be taken, whether by central government or local government. I am concerned that many local councils have cut back on their enforcement staff. In the district council where I live, the local authority itself has erected advertisements at roundabouts, which is a disgraceful flouting of the law and one that I regret very much.</p>

He kindly reminded the House that we have previously contested the issue within this Chamber. I had the pleasure of leading a debate specifically on the flourishing of motorway advertisements. I wish to repeat briefly some of those arguments. First, I believe that motorway adverts are unsightly; indeed, the CPRE has waged a recent campaign to that effect. Secondly, they almost undoubtedly break planning law. Thirdly, and this is the point that was highlighted by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, there is increasing evidence that, one day, we could be confronted by an accident wholly attributable to someone trying to write down a telephone number, or take other information, from one of these motorway adverts.</p>

<a name="80116-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08011674000101"></a>If you are a passenger in a car, just look at some of these adverts. They are grossly and poorly designed to give information to anyone passing them at speed. For a driver, they are a distraction too far. Since our debates on the issue in this House, Dr Mark Young and Janina Mahfoud from the Ergonomics Research Group of the School of Engineering and Design at Brunel University in March 2007 completed a study entitled <I>Driven to Distraction: The Effects of Roadside Advertising on Driver Attention</I>. The report found that roadside advertising had a detrimental effect on drivers&#146; performance and attention, making them more likely to crash. I encourage my noble friend to ask the civil servants to read that, with a view to stoking up the action that the Government have already taken on this issue&#151;and I think they are with us on this issue&#151;to ensure that we can eliminate this possibility before we suddenly find it returning to Parliament as a matter of urgency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08011674000102"></a>At the moment, the duty lies upon local councils to enforce the law. I suggest, as I have in the past, that most local councils have no interest whatever in monitoring infringement of the law, as it stands, on a motorway that passes through their county or district. My own suggestion, for what it is worth, is that the Highways Agency, whose agents pass up and down the motorways every day, might more properly be given the duty of observing and pursuing those who are breaking the law.</p>

<a name="80116-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08011674000103"></a>So I support the amendment, but hope that the Government will think again about what more can be done. I acknowledge what has been done so far, but it would be a terrible day if we had to take urgent action in this House because of this increased diversion for those trying to drive safely on the motorways.</p>

I am fascinated that the Conservative Party, which traditionally bemoans the fact that there is too much legislation, regularly proposes amendments that would bring more legislation before your Lordships&#146; House and the other place.</p>

<a name="80116-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08011674000105"></a>I am a bit concerned. My questions are for the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, about the exemptions he sees for political parties. He does not apparently feel that motorists, who, I agree, could well be distracted by some of these advertisements, as indicated by my noble friend, should be exempt, but, for some reason, under his proposals political parties will be. How many political advertisements has he seen in farmers&#146; fields for parties other than his own? I hate to inject a political note into your Lordships&#146; debate on the amendment, but when many farmers, particularly the bigger ones, seem to delight in putting Conservative posters in their field, why is that not distracting? He said, &#147;Well, you do not have to write down the telephone number&#148;. That is understandable for the advertisements to which I have referred.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08011674000106"></a>However, there may well be an instance where a picture of the Leader of the Opposition perhaps, who I suppose is a reasonably handsome fellow&#151;certainly the Conservative Party believes that to be the case&#151;may distract a female motorist. She may look and say, &#147;Isn&#146;t he nice looking?&#148;, just when the whole lane of the motorway in front of her stops dead. Is not that an ever-present danger, or does the noble Earl feel that perhaps the Leader of his party is not as handsome as some of the propaganda alleges?</p>

I used to be very distracted by Tory Party posters that appeared in farmers&#146; fields around my village.

When I first looked at it I thought that this was a bit out of scope. The Bill is about local transportation; the amendment is, in essence, about roadside advertising, and it seems a little out of place. But the debate is not  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1301"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1301</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>entirely out of place as these are important issues and relate to the sensible movement of people around communities&#151;and one should always take issues of road safety seriously.</p>

<a name="80116-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08011674000109"></a>Not all advertising is a danger to road traffic, but it is important that we ensure that drivers are able to concentrate properly on what they should be doing&#151;driving in a safe and legal fashion on our road, and particularly on our motorways.</p>

<a name="80116-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08011674000110"></a>The Government agree that very large roadside advertising can be excessively and dangerously distracting to drivers. On the other hand, small advertisements or those some distance away from the road obviously cannot be read at speed. The Department for Transport and the Highways Agency are already conducting research to determine where the balance lies in terms of road safety, and they are very aware of the research of Young and Mahfoud at Brunel University, to which my noble friend Lord Harrison referred, which is obviously very important.</p>

<a name="80116-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08011674000111"></a>We also know that unlawful advertisements can appear suddenly and without warning and then disappear just as quickly, but there are increasingly fewer of them. A publicity campaign in the summer of 2005 made it clear that placing advertisements on trailers in fields does not avoid planning law and that planning authorities can promptly enforce this law and deter further offences.</p>

<a name="80116-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08011674000112"></a>Furthermore, the Department for Communities and Local Government recently published for local planning authorities its new advice on advertising, which allows for refusal of planning permission on grounds of road safety, so it explicitly deals with the issue. It also contains specific advice on handling unlawful advertisements and includes new powers to charge advertisers for the cost of removal on top of any fines. A form of cost recovery is built in, so I do not necessarily accept the argument that it is not in the local authority&#146;s interest to enforce because it can recover the cost of enforcement, which is important.</p>

<a name="80116-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08011674000113"></a>I agree that the signs are unsightly and I can see the potential dangers to which they give rise. I congratulate noble Lords who have highlighted the issue. The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, said that this was a matter of central government enforcement. He then went on to tell us that he did not believe that local authorities would or did enforce it. That is not the case. We are there to make sure that local government does its job. Not only are the Government aware of the issue of mobile roadside advertisements but we have taken measures to combat the problem. We believe that it is a matter for local enforcement. I take the point that there needs to be an interface between the Highways Authority and enforcement. The Highways Authority is aware of that responsibility. I will undertake to go back to the department and remind it of the need to impress on the Highways Agency the value of joint working with local authorities on the matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08011674000114"></a>We do not believe that specifying in the Bill the need for local transport authority action would be practical or appropriate. After all, the local transport authority, say a county council, is in many cases not

Even for unitary authorities, which have responsibility both for transport and planning, there are many road safety and other transport issues that require action from local transport authorities. These will be addressed in future guidance on local transport plans, rather than in legislation&#151;the issue of mobile roadside advertisements will therefore be considered for inclusion in such guidance.</p>

<a name="80116-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08011674000115"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, is right to seek assurance that action is taken against dangerous mobile roadside advertisements. I assure him that the Government are aware of this issue and have been taking the appropriate measures. Valuable debates and points have been made in your Lordships&#146; House. I know that colleagues in the DCLG and the ODPM have dealt with the matters as well. We should ensure that the Local Government Association works with its district council authority members to ensure that their powers are being properly exercised and that enforcement action is taken where appropriate, because I see the potential for a menace to road safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08011674000122"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving the amendment I shall speak also to Amendment No. 2B. We have decided to come back with this amendment to emphasise our view that transport should be integrated if it is to be effective. These amendments seek to make it a requirement for a local authority to consult rail plans and strategies when producing their local transport plans. It is intriguing that at some points the Bill provides a near-exhaustive list of consultation requirements, yet sometimes it is argued that this matter would better be left for guidance. I cannot see why a requirement to consult organisations such as Network Rail should be opposed. Having this requirement in the Bill would be consistent with the tone of this clause. Due consideration needs to be given to rail capacity to ensure that authorities are well informed when devising their policies and plans and know that this is a clear expectation in the route to integrated transport.</p>

<a name="80116-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08011674000123"></a>I mentioned previously that route utilisation strategies are central to the forward planning activity of the rail industry. They set out the current capacity, passenger and freight demand, operational performance and cost predictions. If transport is to be effectively considered as a whole, there is surely an argument to have a sound link between rail policies and plans produced by local transport authorities. During Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, implied that the Government did not want to take the decision to add a long list of consultation requirements in the Bill for fear that they would become increasingly out of date. I cannot see how that argument holds for something like rail, even though the names may change, which seems fairly permanent. We need a firm relationship between road and rail. Accepting the amendment would also provide some encouragement that the Government took the same positive view of integrated transport. I beg to move.</p>

As the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, said, we discussed this in Committee and, like him, I was surprised that the amendment was rejected by the Government. &#147;Integrated transport&#148; may not be the wording that we use these days, but clearly any planning that involves road and rail should be done together and the amendment would fit in well. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, mentioned the railways route utilisation strategies, the forecasts that go with them and the Government&#146;s plan and high-level output statements for the railways. They are totally dependent on where passengers and, to some extent, freight go at either end of a journey. If the rail services are to be cut back or increased, local and regional transport plans should reflect that, and vice versa. This is before we start looking at the possible changes to transport demand when the price of oil rockets, but I shall not go into that now. I hope that my noble friend will consider this issue seriously, because this is such a simple group of amendments that would emphasise the importance of considering land-based transport in the round.</p>

There is a tremendous misbalance between the benefits accruing to railway schemes and those accruing to roads.

I certainly agree that consultation on local transport plans with interested and affected parties, and consideration of their plans and strategies, is vital in securing transport policies and projects that best service local people. We are grateful to Network Rail, the Campaign for Better Transport, and others, for their proposals for railways and local transport plans; we work closely with them at all times. I also know from our discussions on this in Committee that the noble Lord is keen to see better integration between road and rail, as are the Government. As he acknowledged then, the integration of local railways with other local transportation services already forms a key component of many plans. The Government seek to continue to encourage and deepen that understanding and integrated way of working. I believe that the term integration is appropriate&#151;I do not entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, when he seems to assume that integration is not something we favour; we clearly do.</p>

<a name="80116-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08011674000128"></a>It is right that organisations such as Network Rail should be consulted on local transport plans&#151;we think that is essential. Indeed, we think such groups are already likely to be covered in any event by the duty placed on local transport authorities to consult,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08011674000129"></a>I ought to reiterate the position that my noble friend Lady Crawley set out in Committee. The Government still consider that it is more appropriate for local authorities to decide which individual organisations to consult, taking account of local circumstances. Similarly, local transport authorities must take into account a wide range of plans and strategies when developing and implementing their local transport plans&#151;including those of Network Rail, but also other relevant local, regional and national strategies. It is for local transport authorities to decide which of these are most relevant. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, is often seen to berate the Government&#151;quite rightly, perhaps&#151;for not being sufficiently localist in their approach to things and not leaving sufficient scope for local determination. This is one of those occasions where it is right that the local transport plans should be locally determined. Further, the question of who works within that and who is consulted should be locally determined because the local authorities are closer to those circumstances and it is right that they should make that decision.</p>

It is preferable to use this approach to the inclusion of, say, Network Rail, rather than developing a long list in the Bill.

As he said, I believe in localism and in local people taking decisions. However, this is not a political point. These days, all political parties want to see integrated transport and the best use made of rail and road, and it is important to show that in the legislation to indicate that we really mean business in trying for integrated transport systems. Therefore, I am rather disappointed that the Minister did not accept the offer to add to our enthusiasm for integrated transport by putting Network Rail into the Bill. However, I see the point that he is making and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08011674000137"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we have retabled this amendment as we feel that the Minister&#146;s response to it in Committee was somewhat unsatisfactory. The amendment would allow and encourage local authorities to produce a bus partnership scheme as part of their local transport plan if they felt that it would be of benefit. The authorities would engage in dialogue and seek consensus on matters relating to bus transport.</p>

<a name="80116-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08011674000138"></a>On the previous occasion, the Minister implied that nothing would be gained from the amendment, as he felt that provision was already contained in the Bill for much of what we mentioned. My opinion remains that the partnership approach should be encouraged as much as possible to allow authorities fully to realise the benefits of the quality partnership scheme over quality contracts.</p>

<a name="80116-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08011674000139"></a>We have already had much discussion on the nature and appropriateness of admissible objections to setting fares, frequencies and timings. It is my view that much of this lengthy process could be avoided through effective discussion in the period prior to decision-making. In that way, a true partnership approach would be fostered.</p>

<a name="80116-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08011674000140"></a>One of the Minister&#146;s objections to the amendment was that local transport plans could be prepared at stages that did not coincide with the introduction of a quality partnership. Of course, we would not seek to make the production of a bus partnership scheme obligatory. The requirement to produce a local transport plan at intervals has already been corrected in the Bill, with flexibility introduced as a result, and we welcome that. Therefore, I argue that his objection is unfounded.</p>

<a name="80116-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08011674000141"></a>The Bill contains a range of tools that local authorities can choose according to their circumstances, and I feel that getting operators around a table to discuss bus needs could prove a useful exercise in most cases. Furthermore, I do not believe that accepting the amendment would mean that freight and road safety partnerships would necessarily have to be produced, as the Minister contended last time. There is a strong case for fostering a partnership approach from the outset between authorities and bus operators, and I feel that the amendment would encourage that. I beg to move.</p>

As he highlighted, it was also tabled in Grand Committee. The Bill already includes, at Clauses 12 to 17, provisions for quality bus partnership schemes. The Transport Act 2000 and the amendments made by the Bill include provision requiring consultation on these quality partnership schemes. Their coverage already includes routes, frequencies and fares. Therefore, some of what the amendment proposes has already been provided for elsewhere.</p>

<a name="80116-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08011674000143"></a>Local planning authorities already have an administrative duty to have regard to all such schemes where they are relevant to their functions. A specific duty for local planning authorities to have regard to bus partnership schemes would create a precedent for having a similar express duty related to many other  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1307"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1307</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>issues. Other transport schemes which might carry similar weight with local planning authorities include freight quality and road safety partnerships. There will also be similar examples in other sectors.</p>

<a name="80116-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08011674000144"></a>The quality bus partnership schemes created under the Transport Act 2000 and Clauses 12 to 17 of the Bill can be made when local transport plans are being prepared or at any other stage in their lifecycle. However, bus partnership schemes, as proposed in the amendment, would be restricted to being created merely during the preparation of a local transport plan. I cannot see the benefit of that.</p>

<a name="80116-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08011674000145"></a>I argue that the approach that we propose elsewhere in the Bill will enable much of what is in the amendment to be achieved. Secondly, the proposal could simply clutter up the process and create unnecessary confusion. I do not see a great benefit in it. The Bill will also provide far more flexibility about when it can be achieved. I hope the noble Lord will find some reassurance in those words. I do not see the need for this and I worry that it could offer itself as a weaker distraction to the overall thrust of the legislation. I am sure that is not what the noble Lord is seeking. For those reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

The amendment is tabled to try and make quality partnerships work better. Perhaps we have not always got the wording right but we prefer quality partnerships over quality contracts. The intention behind this amendment was to try and make them more effective. As the Minister and everyone else knows, I am involved every single day of my life in local government and we sit round the table trying to sort things out and get some agreement with outside partners more often now than ever before. This amendment was intended to try and make things work rather better with bus operators. I do not think the Minister has quite acknowledged that. It is time we had a bit of exercise so I would like to test the feeling of the House on this issue.</p>

In previous debates, the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, called on the Government to consider whether anything more could be done to disability-proof this legislation. The amendment seeks to achieve with some precision that objective by extending the general duty set out in the 2000 Act to all disabled persons within the meaning of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. It would apply the duty to the implementation as well as the development of local transport policies, thus bringing the two elements, of which the implementation side is the most important, together.</p>

The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 as amended in 2005 already places a duty on local authorities in the carrying out of functions, but we believe that there are benefits in extending the specific duty in relation to the development of local transport policies so as to ensure that local authorities take into account the needs of all disabled persons when developing and implementing those policies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08011674000162"></a>Under a statutory quality partnership arrangement, local transport authorities put in place improved infrastructure such as bus priority measures. Operators that wish to use that improved infrastructure must meet specified vehicle quality standards. The Bill addresses some weaknesses in the existing legislation, and allows a statutory quality partnership to specify frequencies, timings and maximum fares. However, the Bill also gives relevant operators a potential veto on these provisions where they have admissible objections. The definitions of &#147;relevant&#148; and &#147;admissible objections&#148; are set out in the December 2007 draft guidance and are very widely drawn. The operator veto on frequencies, timings and fares was not a feature of the draft Local Transport Bill; it has been put in following lobbying from operators. The draft guidance makes it clear that a wide range of operators will have a broad scope to veto key provisions of statutory quality partnership deals, which will reduce the ability of local transport authorities to negotiate soundly based deals with operators and will reduce the attractiveness of statutory quality partnerships as a policy tool.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08011674000163"></a>As I have said, the original draft Bill allowed statutory quality partnerships to specify frequencies and timings, and there were references in relation to fares, but without an operator veto. That was quite widely welcomed because if a local accountable transport authority is investing significantly in new facilities and in line with its wider transport strategy, then it should, having undertaken the consultation requirements set out in the legislation, be able to specify standards on issues such as frequencies and timings. With the right of veto over fares, timings and frequencies, the bargaining position of the operator vis- -vis the local transport authority is strengthened further from the present situation where it already has, and will continue to have, the significant power to deregister services at any time on giving the appropriate period of notice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08011674000164"></a>All parties now put emphasis on reviving the democratic process&#151;on delegating decision-making down the line, and enabling as many as possible of the decisions affecting local areas and local communities to be made by those affected and their elected representatives. That was the thinking behind giving, for example, the Mayor of London and the GLA the powers they have in relation to transport. No doubt it was also behind

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08011674000165"></a>My objection over what has happened is not to the bus operators exercising their right to lobby in their own interests, but to the Government having backed down&#151;in this instance on their basic principles over where decision-making power should preferably lie&#151;at the first sound of gunfire without being able or willing to give any detailed, credible reason for their major change of tack, which will reduce the prospects of statutory quality partnerships being made.</p>

<a name="80116-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08011674000166"></a>Presumably the original proposal in the draft Bill was not put in by the Government without considerable thought and without them carefully weighing up the pros and cons. Therefore, one would have thought that significant new evidence, information or arguments of which the Government had not previously been aware would have had to have been advanced for the Government to make such a fundamental change in their approach. If that was the case, the Government have not yet said in any detail what the new evidence, information or arguments have been which have overridden the compelling case in favour of the Government&#146;s original stance.</p>

<a name="80116-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08011674000167"></a>In Committee, the Minister described the circumstances in which a local transport authority might attempt to pursue a statutory quality partnership which set out unreasonable requirements in relation to maximum fares, frequencies and timings as &#147;highly unlikely&#148;. This must indeed be the case, because it would not be in the interests of a local transport authority to promote a statutory quality partnership which was manifestly unreasonable or unworkable. Operators would not sign up to such a partnership, thus rendering the whole exercise pointless from the local transport authority perspective. There must be a feeling that the Government&#146;s change from the draft Bill is to address an issue which in my noble friend&#146;s view, on behalf of the Government, is &#147;highly unlikely&#148;.</p>

<a name="80116-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08011674000168"></a>The draft guidance, to which I have already referred, provides that an admissible objection can be that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011674000260"></a>&#147;the likely demand for the services would not be sufficient to enable operators to provide services, to the standard specified, on a commercial basis&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011674000169"></a>During Committee, the Minister said:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08011674000170"></a>There seems a potential conflict between my noble friend&#146;s statement in Committee and the wording of the draft guidance.</p>

<a name="80116-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08011674000171"></a>Even were that potential guidance resolved, the local transport authorities&#151;the promoters of the statutory quality partnership&#151;would still not be party to the appeals process. Thus a non-elected body, the local traffic commissioner, would be able to veto key elements of a statutory quality partnership. He would be able to do this on the basis of a broadly based right of objection from commercial operators, without any reference to the locally accountable transport authority,  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1313"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1313</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>including any liability by the local transport authority to challenge financial information from operators provided to the appeals body in support of their case. With the threat of such a veto over which the LTA has no influence, the attraction of the statutory quality partnership option to local transport authorities is reduced.</p>

<a name="80116-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08011674000172"></a>In addition, by extending the right to object beyond those operators directly affected by the statutory quality partnership, there is the risk of an operator who does not operate the statutory quality partnership services being able to object and to veto a quality partnership that the LTA and incumbent operator have developed and accepted. If a local transport authority is to pursue, for example, a bus priority scheme, which can often be pretty controversial locally, a guarantee of regular clock-face frequency and caps on fares for those services which will use the bus priority lane are helpful incentives from the local transport authority perspective.</p>

<a name="80116-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08011674000173"></a>As we know, there has only been one statutory quality partnership scheme under the 2000 Act. That is one reason why we have this Bill today. What is needed is a radical overhaul of the arrangement, and not the measures proposed in this Bill. The Government have agreed that it is &#147;highly unlikely&#148; that a local transport authority would promote an unreasonable statutory quality partnership, and bus operators are under no obligation to operate within a statutory quality partnership in the first place if they consider it unreasonable. There is then no need for the admissible objection veto on the specification of maximum fares, frequencies and timings, which could add many months of unnecessary and costly delay.</p>

<a name="80116-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08011674000174"></a>This amendment would remove that veto, restore the position to the Government&#146;s own thinking in the draft Bill, and mean that the public sector&#151;including local transport authorities, which provide a significant part of bus-operator income through concessionary fares, tendered services and fuel rebate&#151;would be able to have a real influence over the level and frequency of services that its money is supporting. I beg to move.</p>

We have had much discussion on this point and it seems that the Bill would be improved were these words removed. The Government published, immediately prior to the first Committee session, draft guidance on what an admissible objection might constitute. The provision in the guidance that allows operators to make an objection based on operators being unable to provide services to the standards specified on a commercial basis has raised several questions already.</p>

I am astonished that the Conservative Front Bench support this amendment. After all, the original legislation was the 1986 Act, which was introduced by the Conservative Government. They had quite a number of years following 1986 when, if they had wanted what the amendment seeks, they could have had it. I realise that there is not a great deal of support behind what the noble Earl has just said, but the fact that the Conservative Party feels that the legislation needs changing in this way is significant and a little unexpected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08011674000178"></a>Before I discuss the amendment further, I declare my interest as a consultant to FirstGroup PLC and a former chair of the National Express Group&#146;s major bus subsidiary. Some of the fears of the PTEs, as expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, are unfounded. If we are to discuss partnerships, bus operators, who have a considerable investment in these matters, are surely entitled to have their voice heard. Partnership must be just that; it cannot be an ultimatum laid down by one side in the supposed partnership. To suggest that operators should not have the right to make admissible objections to a statutory quality partnership is unfair. It allows one side in a debate to make a final decision and to have, as the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, put it, &#147;the right of veto&#148; over the views of the other side in a supposed partnership.</p>

<a name="80116-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08011674000179"></a>The Minister said consistently throughout Committee that operators must be able to protect their legitimate interests. I suggest that, without an admissible objection power, such ability would be put at serious risk. Let us switch the argument around. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, could give us a guarantee that local transport authorities and PTEs will not seek to impose unreasonable terms on fares, frequencies and timings. These are the three matters about which they are most exercised and are subject of later amendments. I repeat that if one side of a supposed partnership wishes to insist that its view should prevail regardless of the other, we should be given proper reasons. The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, said that local authorities are democratically elected. I accept that point, but I hope that he in turn would accept that partnerships, statutory or otherwise, have worked well in various parts of the country where proper goodwill has been behind them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08011674000181"></a>I have one more brief extract from this article to illustrate how well the existing legislation can work. Referring to TWM and the Passenger Transport Authority, Mr Phil Tonks of Bus Users UK said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="08011674000254"></a>&#147;They are taking away the stereotype most people have of buses as dirty, smelly and never on time.

<a name="80116-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08011674000182"></a>My noble friend Lord Rosser advocates on behalf of the Passenger Transport Executive Group a world in which, to hear him, elected members at the local level are passionately concerned to bring better public transport to their area. I do not wish to repeat too many times in your Lordships&#146; House that that is not the case in many parts of the country&#151;I notice the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, nodding in agreement&#151;and certainly not in Birmingham. The Conservative-Liberal alliance there shows no signs of wishing to give buses the priority that those of us who speak regularly on these matters wish to see.</p>

<a name="80116-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08011674000183"></a>I hope that the Minister will resist the amendment. I hope that he will bear in mind that he himself has said, as have his colleagues in the department, that the operators must be able to protect their legitimate interests. They will not be able to do so if this amendment is accepted, and from that point of view I hope that it will be resisted.</p>

The big enemy of bus operation in the country is road congestion. Many local authorities are not, for various reasons, addressing road congestion and seek to put all the blame for bad services on the bus operators. There are some bad bus operators and they have poor standards. Where there is a real attempt to clear congestion, generally the bus operators respond with considerable extra investment and training.</p>

<a name="80116-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08011674000185"></a>My second point is rather procedural. I raised this at Second Reading. The Minister said then:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="08011674000255"></a>&#147;The intention is not to make it difficult to establish a quality partnership scheme; the intention is to ensure that local authorities cannot impose requirements on bus operators that are unrealistic or unreasonable in relation to frequencies, timings or ... fares&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/11/07; col. 799.]</p>

<p><a name="08011674000186"></a>I was also given the assurance, although it is not recorded here, that the Traffic Commissioner would not sit by himself. He would have two people with him,

I am sure that no bus operator will get by these people unless they have a good case. However, in any court of law both sides must have the opportunity to put their case. Therefore, I am sorry but I will not support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Rosser.</p>

I asked them whether they thought the amendments were a good idea and they all said yes. That is not to say that they liked the new buses described by my noble friend Lord Snape. There are an awful lot of other buses in the Birmingham area besides those on the three routes. It seems reasonable that the local authorities, who, as both noble Lords have said, are required to invest in bus lanes and shelters and so on, should have a role too. I think that the amendment is important and I support it. I would still like to hear from the Minister why policy has changed since the draft Bill was published.</p>

The Minister has assured us of this. This means that even when permissible objections are raised by transport operators, the local transport authority will have to have regard to the needs of disabled people before taking them on board. The Bill is disability-proofed so far as the impact of admissible objections is concerned.</p>

<a name="80116-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08011674000189"></a>However, there are a couple of other points that I would like to raise about the way the ability to raise admissible objections might work. I would be grateful to hear the Minister&#146;s comment on these. I raise these points with some diffidence because, unlike other noble Lords who have spoken, I am by no means an expert on the way local transport services work.</p>

<a name="80116-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08011674000190"></a>First, in the draft guidance, the department suggests that one of the things that might make an objection admissible would be if the likely demand for services would not be sufficient to enable operators to provide the services on a commercial basis. Other noble Lords have referred to that element in the guidance. Can the Minister clarify whether that condition would be met if just one operator could not provide the specified services profitably or whether the test would be that no relevant operator could provide the services profitably? Admissible objections should not be used to prop up uncompetitive businesses. A quality partnership scheme should not be thwarted just because one operator would not be able to operate the services profitably.</p>

<a name="80116-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08011674000191"></a>Secondly, there is nothing about quality partnership schemes which can force an operator to run unprofitable services. If they cannot run the services profitably, they just will not use the facilities afforded by the quality partnership scheme: that is the veto they already have. Presumably this is why the Minister said in  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1317"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1317</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Committee that it was highly unlikely that an authority would promote such a scheme. In fact, authorities will probably go to considerable lengths to ensure that operators wish to take part in their scheme, including informal discussions and so on. Admissible objections may risk giving operators the whip hand over authorities by forcing them to modify already carefully considered schemes&#151;perhaps to the detriment of passengers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08011674000193"></a>As often happens with these sorts of issues, a balance must be struck between the legitimate and understandable expectations of local transport authorities and the public on whose behalf they are acting and the legitimate interests of operators who are trying to run a business and make a fair profit. The balance needs to be struck in the spirit of partnership to produce schemes in which both authorities and operators can feel fully committed. If the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, detected a change of direction by the Government, it was in an attempt to secure that balance and try to preserve and underline the value of local partnership to deliver good quality local bus services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08011688000001"></a>It may interest noble Lords to learn that the Department for Transport has had representations, not just from the bus industry but from local authorities, passenger transport executives and others, about the whole issue of admissible objections. The bus industry is still concerned that the provisions will not give their members sufficient protection. If we are being criticised from both sides in equal measure, it is probably right to conclude that we have got the balance in this argument in the right place.</p>

<a name="80116-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08011688000002"></a>As I said in Committee, if we had no provision of this kind, operators would have little protection against a local authority imposing conditions on their operation that might be quite impossible for them to meet on a commercial basis, which could have the perverse effect that they would simply withdraw from the scheme altogether and leave the yawning gap in service provision that the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, is rightly concerned about. That is in no one&#146;s interest, and any sensible local authority would conduct a great deal of preliminary discussion and undertake negotiations with operators before initiating the public consultation process. However, operators are more inclined to participate if they at least have the comfort that, if really impossible terms are imposed on them, they can make an admissible objection to the particular provision they find hard to sustain and completely commercially untenable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08011688000003"></a>The crucial thing to bear in mind is that the precise terms of who is a relevant operator and what is an admissible objection will be defined in regulations&#151;in

I understand that this is frustrating, because your Lordships would probably like more certainty about how the provision would operate, but at the same time it should be reassuring that we have some flexibility. We shall need to consult fully on the regulations, and it will be easier to put things right if we get some of the detail wrong, rather than if we were to set out all these issues in primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08011688000004"></a>In an ideal world, it would be best if we had draft regulations ready so that people could see the quality of the drafting and make some comment on them. We have made good progress on the Bill, however, and we have not had time to perfect those draft regulations. I suspect that colleagues in another place will have that opportunity. However, we have given an indication of our intentions in the draft guidance, subject, no doubt, to more detailed consultation. I paraphrased those proposals in Committee, but perhaps I should also have read out the text in the draft guidance document immediately preceding them.

We will be working closely with interested parties, including through the Bus Partnership Forum, as we develop these regulations. Our aim in this is to prevent ill-conceived, vexatious or frivolous objections, while protecting the legitimate interests of operators involved in the provision of local services in the area affected. Box 1 below is an example of a possible way of meeting those objectives. We are willing to consider alternative ways of doing so&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80116-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08011688000005"></a>I remind your Lordships of the contents of &#147;Box 1&#148;, mentioned in the above quotation. For an objection to be admissible, first, it should be made in writing within a specified time by an operator of services directly affected by the proposals; secondly, it should be made on the grounds either that it would not be reasonably practicable for operators to meet the standards of service specified at the time that they would come into effect, or that the likely demand for the services would not be sufficient to enable operators to provide services on a commercial basis to the standard specified; and, thirdly, the traffic commissioner must certify that the evidence submitted by the relevant operator is sufficient to substantiate the objection.</p>

<a name="80116-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08011688000006"></a>I stress again that these are not tablets of stone, and that the guidance itself is still a draft, which will be further refined in light of the comments we receive. That shows that we are committed, first, to consultation; secondly, to getting these matters right; and, thirdly, to striking a balance at all times. The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, described our current position as an operator veto. I do not recognise that in the terms in which the noble Lord made the point, though I understand why he set it in that way. The draft Bill would have required operator agreement to requirements on fares. The admissible objections proposal provides a better balance between local transport authorities with a desire to include such requirements in the scheme, and the commercial interests of operators. That is probably the most constructive way of dealing with the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08011688000007"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, also made the point that a wide variety of operators can veto for a wide variety of reasons. We do not agree with that. The basis that we have proposed in the draft guidance is rather narrower than that. For that reason, I drew particular attention to the second of those boxed bullet points about the grounds on which admissible objections can be made.</p>

<a name="80116-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08011688000008"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, made a point about traffic commissioners and the fact that they would be accompanied by others when considering admissible objections. The noble Lord might have been confusing two issues: that of the approvals board and that of traffic commissioners plus two others. That, of course, works for quality contract schemes, not quality partnerships. Another issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, was that of traffic commissioners considering admissible objections. In drafting the regulations, we will need to consider whether the traffic commissioners should make decisions alone. We will consult on that before making regulations. No doubt noble Lords will express a view on that, as they have throughout the passage of this Bill.</p>

<a name="80116-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08011688000009"></a>I turn, finally, to a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, relating to draft guidance and the possible problem of insufficient demand being used as an admissible objection. The noble Lord asked if the test would also cover the issue of the single or any operator. The test we propose in the guidance is whether the bus industry as a whole can viably run the schemes. That is an important point, but we will need to consult on the detail. I made a note of the noble Lord&#146;s second point, but I would like to reflect on it further before making observations on it. I will have to write to the noble Lord. It raises an interesting issue.</p>

<a name="80116-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08011688000010"></a>For all those reasons, I cannot agree to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Rosser. We have tried to strike a balance here. We have published guidance, which seeks to underline that balance, and we recognise the importance of considering commercial interests. There is great value for local transport authorities in expressing their realistic, and quite legitimate, expectations in terms of defining quality services in the context of this particular aspect of public transport provision.</p>

One of the concerns that local authorities have, expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, is that at the end of the process by which they are trying to get a voluntary agreement on partnership, bus operators may come to the traffic commissioner with a load of objections that they think legitimate, and which may or may not be so. Perhaps we could confirm in the draft guidance that any objections need to be raised with the relevant local transport authority prior to them being raised with the traffic commissioner. The local authority may have tried to reach agreement, and may have thought that agreement had been reached, but the bus operator may then have come up with a load of objections.</p>

So there is no great difficulty with what the noble Lord is suggesting. It would make a lot of sense. Hopefully some of those issues can be resolved because at the end of it, we want to provide decent quality services. The local authority wants that. It is not in the operators&#146; interest to fail to provide decent quality services. In fact, my noble friend Lord Snape gave a very good example of where important investment comes in. Bus operators can see that there is a market to be tapped, and that it has a commercial benefit for them. Yes, of course we would want to see that take place.</p>

While agreeing wholeheartedly with what my noble friend Lord Smith has just said, that objections should not be last-minute ones, there is always the problem that the passenger transport authorities are not themselves responsible for the highway works on which many of these voluntary agreements depend.</p>

<a name="80116-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08011688000015"></a>Again on Birmingham, and without making political points about it, let us imagine a situation where, although both sides have ironed out the objections as outlined desirable by my noble friend, one of the highway authorities says, &#147;We are not prepared to implement that agreement and we have the final say&#148;&#151;exactly what takes place in Birmingham. That would be&#151;I hope my noble friend would agree&#151;where a last-minute objection would be very relevant. Can the Minister offer us any comfort about this disagreement, which one can envisage taking place in other parts of the country, given changes of political control over the years, and say whether something can be done to ensure that agreements between passenger transport authorities and bus operators are not negated by the action of highways authorities on a change of political control?</p>

From the centre as a Minister, it is hard to try to legislate for every situation. I sympathise with the point my noble friend makes. It is clearly in the interests of operators, I would have thought&#151;particularly where there is a commitment to ensure that timetables are kept to and that we have good frequency, punctuality levels and so on&#151;that there is close co-operation with the Highways Authority. If the Highways Authority takes the view that bus priority and bus lanes are going to improve the quality of punctuality, that has great value, and one would hope that establishing bus lanes and so on would survive the rigours of a change of political control. All we can do from the centre is to try to encourage that process and to hope that quality partnerships further underline its importance. That is something we can try to encourage in guidance and best practice. I not think we can go much further than that.</p>

In particular, what was the new information that came to light in the original Bill; and does my noble friend still agree he said that it was highly unlikely that any local authority would put forward a scheme that was manifestly unreasonable? If there was no involvement of the bus operators there would not be a scheme. The local authority would not sit back and envisage a situation where they had to explain to its electorate why there were no bus services.</p>

<a name="80116-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08011688000018"></a>A point has been made about congestion. I am sure that is an issue; I would not dispute that for a moment. Equally, there are cases where bus operators have been fined because their services have been running too early, which probably has not been due to congestion. That indicates that we should be doing everything we can to promote statutory quality partnerships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08011688000019"></a>Obviously there is a difference of view between us as to whether the Government&#146;s approach or that of my amendment is the best way around the matter. I understand the position. The Government have already changed their position between the draft Bill and the current Bill. Obviously, looked at realistically, there must be&#151;and it is not my noble friend, it is the Government&#151;a difficulty from their point of view of simply changing back again. I understand the difficulties that they are under and I hope that in the light of all that my noble friend has had to say about regulations, wording, consultations and discussions, the Government may use this opportunity to make the position more acceptable than it is today under the present Bill.

There does not seem to be any reason for this slight

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08011688000032"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, these amendments seek to simplify the procedure for the adoption of a quality contract scheme by removing the involvement of the approvals board to which reference has already been made, and the transport tribunal but instead allowing for a quality contract to be determined by local transport authorities. Quality contracts are in effect the franchising of a network of services, similar to the way in which the majority of public transport in Britain is provided, such as bus services in London and the national rail network.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08011688000033"></a>The Government have pledged on a number of occasions to make quality contracts a more realistic option as is the case at present under the Transport Act 2000. That requires a local transport authority to demonstrate to the Secretary of State that a quality contract scheme is the &#147;only practicable way&#148; to achieve its bus strategy. I suspect that my noble friend would be happy to agree that that wording helped to ensure that no quality contracts have been proposed since the Act was passed.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08011688000034"></a>The Bill proposes a different but difficult and convoluted process whereby a Local Transport Authority proposal for a quality contract scheme is determined by an approvals board, which would be chaired by a traffic commissioner. That decision can then be appealed to the transport tribunal. If neither the approvals board nor the transport tribunals decision went their way, whoever felt aggrieved would, I presume, be free to approve the decision to the Court of Appeal. The operators certainly would and in certain circumstances the local transport authority would as well. The net effect of that process would be to increase the already significant risks and uncertainties that the local transport authorities would face in a transition from the current unregulated situation to a regulated market. It would also prolong the timescale for introducing a quality contract and potentially give the approvals board and

It has been pointed out already in Committee that there is a contrast with the road-user charging proposals in the Bill, whereby a decision on such schemes is devolved to local authorities with no tiered process of external adjudication by unelected bodies.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08011688000035"></a>We know that the traffic commissioners and the transport tribunal have considerable expertise in areas such as vehicle safety and operational issues, but they do not have expertise, remit or accountability to determine whether a region&#146;s transport strategy should go ahead or not&#151;and I do not think that my noble friend is suggesting that. In Committee, my noble friend on behalf of the Government argued that the process set out in the Bill would not interfere with democratic accountability, because the approvals board would deal with how policy might be carried out rather than the policy itself; but a franchising system is the only guaranteed way to achieve the policy objective of a fully integrated public transport service. I believe that the Mayor of London has maintained on a number of occasions that he would not have been able to carry out the transport policies on which he considers he was elected without the powers to specify and regulate bus services.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08011688000036"></a>Also in Committee, the Government argued, rightly, that the legislation should be fully compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights and suggested that independent adjudication of a quality contract application would ensure that compliance. I have to say that counsel&#146;s advice to the Passenger Transport Executive Group is that the ability to judicially review a local transport authority-determined quality contract scheme makes a locally determined quality contract process equally and fully ECHR-compliant. On that there may be a difference between the view of the Government and passenger transport executives, but, no doubt, my noble friend will comment on that when he replies.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08011688000037"></a>My noble friend also argued that if the Transport Tribunal were to be removed from the process, there would be a likelihood of judicial review from operators and that although any Transport Tribunal decision could be appealed against at the Court of Appeal, it could be done only on points of law. The Government have argued on a number of occasions that the process set out in the Bill provides greater protection for local transport authorities from court action by operators than does local determination of quality contracts. However, the view of the local transport authority that the legal risks of a locally determined process are different, but no worse, than that of the process set out in the Bill and that the risks certainly do not outweigh the disadvantages of the delay, unaccountability and risk inherent in the determination of quality contract schemes by two layers of outside bodies. That is because the process set out in the Bill does not prevent operators going to the courts, because they will be able to go to the Court of Appeal to challenge the decision of the transport tribunal. Such a challenge could consider all matters other than questions of fact or of standing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08011688000038"></a>The grounds for judicial review of local transport authority quality contract scheme determination under the amendment would not differ to any appreciable degree from those that the Court of Appeal could consider in a challenge to the transport tribunal decision under the process set out in the Bill. Judicial review applies to many local authority decisions&#151;housing, planning and transport in particular. For example, the determination of a local transport plan is subject to judicial review, as is the implementation of a quality partnership scheme or road-user charging scheme. Surely, there is no reason why a quality contract scheme should be an exception to that general rule, because judicial review would provide ample scope for operators to challenge the making of a quality contract scheme on the basis, for example, that consultation was inadequate, that the scale of the contract scheme area was far larger than necessary to achieve the authority&#146;s aims, that the aim of the quality contract scheme was not permitted by legislation or, more generally, that on the evidence available no reasonable local transport authority could have taken the decision to approve the scheme.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08011688000039"></a>Without local determination, the concern that would be felt by many is that this new process could mean that the Bill repeats the mistake of the Transport Act 2000, with the franchising legislation being similarly underutilised against a backdrop of continuing decline in fare-paying bus usage. That would be a further wasted opportunity and let us remember that passengers would be the ultimate losers. I beg to move.</p>

To a certain extent that is true in certain parts of the country. Let us wind the clock back a bit further to before 1986. There has been a steady decline in bus use throughout the United Kingdom since the 1960s. The reason for that is obvious&#151;the all pervasive spread of the private car has meant that many people who formerly travelled by bus now prefer to drive themselves to and from work or any leisure activity.</p>

Or has bus use gone up in London, and is there a connection between the two?</p>

Of course, bus usage has gone up in London because there are a lot more buses in London than in most other parts of the country. In seeking to make this point, my noble friend will agree that the subsidies for buses in London are approximately&#151;I do not have the exact figures in front of me&#151;six times those in the rest of the country put together. It would be surprising and a bit difficult for Mr Ken Livingstone to fight the mayoral battle if, with all that money thrown at those extra buses, he had to report that the use of bus services had declined in this city.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08011688000045"></a>My noble friend makes a valid point, but he must take on board that, in the biggest ever survey of bus passengers carried out last year by the department, outside London, no less than 83 per cent of bus passengers were reasonably satisfied with the bus service provision. I remind him that this is in a deregulated world. In London, this Valhalla of bus services which is always prayed in aid by those who want to turn the clock back, only 78 per cent of bus passengers were satisfied with their bus services.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08011688000046"></a>Neither of those facts is particularly conclusive and I am sure that they will not convince my noble friend, but they indicate that in London there is a considerable way to go before bus passengers are as convinced of the wondrous nature of what they have in this city as is my noble friend&#151;and, no doubt, the Mayor of London. Perhaps we can agree to disagree and leave it at that. However, I hope that my noble friend will agree that, for various reasons, the number of bus-passenger carryings has declined right across the country, except in London. The other point is that London has the congestion charge, which very few other cities have or propose to have. If there were a deterrent to motorists, it would be possible to argue anywhere in the country that the result would be a greater number of bus-passenger carryings.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08011688000047"></a>I return specifically to the amendment. This is another case, perhaps with a bit more legitimacy so far as concerns quality contracts, of local authorities seeking to be judge and jury. They do not wish anyone else to be involved. To paraphrase what my noble friend Lord Rosser said, they are democratically elected, so they should be able to lay down the law on quality contracts. Not surprisingly, the bus industry takes a different view and does not like the idea of local authorities telling it what to do with its assets.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08011688000048"></a>I understand, although I do not think that it is in the Minister&#146;s brief, that the PTEs have already taken counsel&#146;s advice on whether simply allowing the operators to appeal to the courts, rather than allowing an initial process via the approvals board and the Transport Tribunal, would still protect bus operators&#146; rights under the European convention, and they have been advised that it would. I can well believe that that is exactly the view that the PTEG has sought. After all, it is not its money, so there is no problem in appealing to counsel about any aspect of the implementation of future laws. I do not think that that is a particularly satisfactory way to conduct bus business in future. In my view, if bus operators disagree with the provisions of a statutory quality contract, it is not sensible to say that the only alternative for them is to go to court. It might well enrich the lawyers&#151;I am aware that in your Lordships&#146; House the legal profession does not go unrepresented&#151;but I do not think that it is necessarily a sensible way to run bus services, and there must be a better alternative.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08011688000049"></a>The alternative that the Government have come up with&#151;that there should be a Transport Tribunal and that the traffic commissioners should be involved&#151;is a very sensible compromise. It cannot be acceptable for a PTA or a local transport authority under the Bill to be judge and jury over sensitive and controversial matters, such as quality contracts, involving the commercial interests of bus operators. Again, it may not seem usual for the commercial interests of bus operators to be put forward from these Benches but I think that it is perfectly legitimate for me to do so. These days, bus services are run on a commercial basis, although some of my colleagues may not agree with that. Indeed, given the earlier comments of the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, some in the Conservative Party&#151;although precious few of them are present during this debate&#151;may not agree with it, but that is a fact of life. I think that those commercial responsibilities should be recognised under this legislation. Surely the involvement of the traffic commissioners and the approvals board would make the whole issue more balanced than would be the case if either side in these disputes immediately ran off to engage in expensive court proceedings. That would be the effect of the amendment if Her Majesty&#146;s Government were unwise enough to accept it.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08011688000050"></a>The local transport authority example referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Rosser&#151;that other local authority decisions are capable of being challenged in the courts&#151;is right but not particularly relevant. After all, few other local authority decisions would impact as directly on the business as this piece of legislation. This amendment would undermine, if not destroy, the  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1327"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1327</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>profitability of many bus operators up and down the country, and they are understandably exercised about that. I repeat that it is not satisfactory for the PTEG and anyone who uses its brief to say, &#147;Just go to court&#148;. It is not sensible, it is too time-consuming and it is extremely expensive. I am not in favour of relaxing the very relevant controls on quality contracts that were included in the Transport Act 2000. This amendment would weaken those provisions.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08011688000051"></a>We have reached this stage after eight years because many passenger transport executives have declined to co-operate with private bus operators. It has not all been one-sided. I have some bitter experience myself. I am glad to say that the situation in the West Midlands has changed considerably thanks to a change at the top as far as the chief executive is concerned. As I indicated on an earlier group of amendments, there is proper co-operation in the West Midlands. I am afraid there rarely was in my time and not&#151;in case the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, thinks so&#151;because of the personality of the person chairing the bus company at that time. I went continuously to the passenger transport executive and said, &#147;Tell me what we are doing wrong&#148;. He used to make speeches at fringe meetings at all the political party conferences saying, &#147;They are making all this money and yet they do not co-operate with us&#148;, and I would go to him and say, &#147;Just sit round a table and tell us what you want us to do&#148;. He never could, of course, because he and many of his colleagues in the PTEG thought that if they protested loudly and long enough over a number of years and entertained various Members of your Lordships&#146; House as well as Members of the other place at expensive restaurants the length and breadth of the country, eventually their voice would be heard. I urge the Minister to resist their voice. This amendment would quickly destroy a remarkably successful bus industry, from the point of view of the number of passengers carried. The stabilisation of those figures and their improvement in many parts of the country where the co-operation that I have outlined takes place would be directly threatened if he were unwise enough to accept it. After seven years, the PTEG ought to start barking up another tree. It has spent enough public money barking up this one.</p>

I was confused about the approvals board and I accept that I was wrong. The quality partnership and the quality contract are two separate things. What underlines what the noble Lord, Lord Snape, has said is that we are talking about a partnership and I feel that many of the protagonists on the group to which he referred do not wholly agree it is a partnership. There are bad and difficult people on the bus side, but I assure you that there are very difficult people on the other side too. It is very difficult to get people to come to an agreement, yet that is what a partnership means.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08011688000053"></a>Lastly, let me turn to something the Minister said earlier that I have been thinking about. In this legislation, does the Integrated Transport Authority assume the highway powers so that it can give direction as to how the congestion to which the noble Lord, Lord Snape, has referred can be tackled? The issue of one or two

<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="08011688000054"></a><b><a name="80116-0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08011688000141"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, this issue was debated very fully in Grand Committee; it was evident then, as it is today, that it gives rise to some very strong feelings from both the local authorities and operators, but from totally different directions and perspectives. The passion is understandable but let me bring us back to what we are trying to achieve here. Again it is a question of securing a reasonable balance and what lawyers call a proportionate way of dealing with things.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08011688000055"></a>The support for an approvals board from operators is at least as strong as the opposition to it from local authorities. The arguments do not really seem to have moved on greatly since the idea was first floated. There seems to be no way in which we could satisfy both arguments, and there is no evident compromise available to us, so I cannot do much more than reiterate the points that I made in the previous debate.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08011688000056"></a>We decided on an approvals board to try to get that reasonable balance between the legitimate interests of local authorities on the one hand and the reasonable expectations of the bus operators on the other. The Transport Act 2000, which a number of noble Lords have mentioned, requires schemes to be approved by the Secretary of State or by Welsh Ministers in Wales. We had particular reasons in England for concluding that this was not the best way of doing things. I will not go into those reasons again, but we concluded that operators would be vulnerable if local authorities could make schemes without any independent assessment. That was not acceptable.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08011688000057"></a>A local transport authority that promotes a scheme can never be a disinterested party. It must actively support that scheme and rightly be convinced that it is in the interests of the local community. That is only fair and proper. However, how can operators be sure that their interests are to be properly protected by such a local authority? They could have a great deal to lose, and they have a right to be properly heard. They may not welcome the idea of a quality contracts scheme in any circumstances, but they would welcome it a great deal less if they felt that the local authority had made a poor case and gained public support without a proper analysis of the problems and some of the solutions. They could well persuade a court of law that the authority had damaged their interests with no tangible or evident public benefit.</p>

<a name="80116-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08011688000058"></a>I am aware that some local transport authorities say that they are prepared to risk judicial review and believe that they could fend off any challenge, but there are wider public issues at stake, including whether a court of law is the right forum in which to debate what are really issues of transportation planning and transport economics. The Approvals Board, with the transport tribunal providing the appeal mechanism, would be much more appropriate fora in which to resolve these matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08011688000059"></a>In Committee, I gave some indication of the role that the Approvals Board should play. It would not be part of its role to say whether a local transport policy with a quality contracts scheme that it aims to  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1329"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1329</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>implement is good or bad&#151;that is clearly a matter for local decision by the electorate&#151;but it is legitimate for the board to satisfy itself that the policy is at least internally consistent, that the effect of the scheme will be to support the policy, and that the assessment of the costs and benefits of the scheme are based on sound transport economics. All these matters can be best addressed by a panel of experts of the sort that we have in mind for approvals boards. It is not simply a matter of whether the authority has gone through all the procedures, consulted all the right people and taken note of their views. That is part of the story, but not the whole of it.</p>

<a name="80116-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08011688000060"></a>One might argue that an elected authority, because it is democratically accountable, has the right to take a risky decision that may turn out to be fundamentally bad, so long as it does so in good faith and in the procedurally proper way. That, however, will be small comfort to an operator whose directors may not have a vote in the local authority area if that operator loses its business as a result of a bad decision. It would be of even less comfort to passengers hoping for improved bus services. I recognise that strong passions have been aroused in this debate, but I am not in the end persuaded to move on the matter.</p>

<a name="80116-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08011688000061"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, asked about integrated transport authorities and their ability to take on highway powers. They could do that, but it will be for local authority areas to consider when they review governance arrangements and submit their proposals. It could work in that way; we see no particular problem with it. The noble Lord made the point on previous occasions that there would be some benefit in that. As I said earlier, getting things such as bus lanes and bus priority systems right would no doubt be a bonus, and being able to bring discussions with the highways authorities more directly into play would seem to be quite a sensible way ahead.</p>

<a name="80116-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08011688000062"></a>With that slight digression, while I cannot accept the amendment, I hope that my noble friend will be happy to withdraw it. We have sought throughout to strike a reasonable balance and find a way forward that, while it may not please everybody, at least finds a sensible route through this particular dilemma.</p>

He may be being unduly optimistic if he believes that the procedures outlined in this Bill will not end up as matters in the courts because it is clear that bus operators faced with decisions they do not like from the Approvals Board and the transport tribunal will pursue these issues as far as they can, including through the courts, to get a decision that they have more sympathy with.</p>

We have had a great deal of discussion and received a lot of information on the timeframe and process of implementing a quality contract. Our view remains that the partnership approach is ultimately preferable and, as I said before, gives more flexibility to all parties in the arrangements.</p>

<a name="80116-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08011688000081"></a>Of course, when pursuing a quality contract scheme, we have been reassured by the Minister that authorities would be expected to consult widely. One of the amendments we tabled in Committee concerned the need to consult neighbouring authorities; we have also discussed that today, and I am somewhat reassured by the Minister&#146;s response. Therefore the list of consultation requirements set out in Section 125 of the Transport Act 2000 remains unmodified. However, our view remains that consultation should be paramount when setting up something as contentious as a quality contract scheme. It should be the case at all stages of the elaborate process. I am concerned that the right of appeal is reserved only to those persons originally consulted at the consultation stage of the proposal. If a group was not thought appropriate to consult in the first instance, it would never get an opportunity to voice its objections. I suppose that there might be recourse to judicial review, but as several noble Lords have said, it would be most unsatisfactory.</p>

It is true that we used that as an example to illustrate that an authority could be neglected during consultation and thus lose its right to appeal, but the implications of restricting appeals could be greater than that. There is a lot in the Transport Act consultation requirements that hinges on what an authority &#147;thinks fit&#148;, and one can imagine that this could be manipulated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08011688000086"></a>The local authority will thus have to use its judgment on how widely or narrowly to consult beyond those that they are statutorily obliged to consult. They have to use that judgment reasonably, but not deliberately or inadvertently exclude anyone with a legitimate interest in being consulted. If they consult everyone, on the other hand&#151;and get a large postbag as a result&#151;they may find it difficult to give due weight to all responses, and if large numbers of the public appeal against decisions, that process could also become rather unmanageable and hold up schemes for a very long time.</p>

<a name="80116-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08011688000087"></a>It would certainly be strange if consultations were narrow but appeal rights were widened by these amendments to include absolutely everyone, whether or not they had a legitimate concern or interest in the scheme. If it is the noble Lord&#146;s intention to encourage wider consultation, I conclude that this is not the right way. I remain unconvinced that we need to amend the appeal provisions at all; they should work serviceably as set out in the Bill. For those reasons, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08011688000094"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, according to my papers I may speak to Amendments Nos. 32 and 37 together with this one. The purpose of Amendment No. 31 is to seek to put local transport authorities on a similar footing to Transport for London for the franchising of bus service networks. In London, when a bus franchise ends Transport for London simply tenders for the new contract; it does not have to undergo a process of demonstrating a case for bus franchising, neither it is subject to an outside body determining whether the policy of franchising bus networks should continue.</p>

<a name="80116-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08011688000095"></a>In Committee, the Government argued that a long or unlimited quality contract scheme would be against the public interest if that contract was not achieving its set aims, or was not proving a success. Presumably, the judgment on whether a local transport policy succeeds should be locally determined by locally accountable transport authorities. Indeed, it is difficult to see why a local transport authority would continue with such a scheme if it deemed it a failure. There seems to be a difference between the approach in London and that suggested by the Bill for the rest of the country. I therefore hope that my noble friend will reflect further on this.</p>

<a name="80116-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08011688000096"></a>Also within this group is Amendment No. 32. The Bill seeks to raise the maximum length of a quality contract from five to 10 years; Amendment No. 32 seeks to remove the absolute restriction on the length of such a contract and to allow it to be governed by general legal principles. Under EU law such a contract, while generally be limited to 10 years in duration, may, if the operator makes a significant investment in the service provided under the contract, be extended by up to 50 per cent. One of the principles underlying the amendment is that operators may be more willing to invest in assets such as garages, vehicles, staff development and matters of that kind under a longer-term contract than they would under a short-term contract.</p>

<a name="80116-0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08011688000097"></a>I appreciate that in Committee the Government argued that a bus contract, in any case, would be unlikely to qualify for a 50 per cent extension under EU law because the degree of investment in any bus contract would be limited given the nature of bus services. It was argued that that was unlike the situation in the railway industry where there might be considerable investment. However, I would have thought it would

The considerable investment that this implies may qualify under European law as a significant investment by the private sector but may only be commercially viable for the operator over a period longer than 10 years. The purpose of the amendment is to provide for that period of extension to be possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08011688000098"></a>Once again, for the reasons I have mentioned, I hope my noble friend will be prepared to reflect further on this issue. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="08011688000099"></a><b><a name="80116-0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08011688000147"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, I do not want simply to repeat what I said before but I have not heard anything new in the argumentation put forward by my noble friend Lord Rosser. There are essentially two issues here: first, the length of schemes; and, secondly, the length of individual contracts. I shall deal with them in reverse order.</p>

<a name="80116-0007.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08011688000100"></a>I take the point that in some restricted circumstances European Community law would allow contracts to be let for up to 15 years, although in most cases 10 years would still be the maximum. We could, therefore, set no limit in our own legislation and simply rely on the Community regulation to set the limit. However, we must not overlook the fact that the recently adopted regulation does not come into force until December 2009.</p>

<a name="80116-0007.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08011688000101"></a>The real question is whether it would be the right policy to do so. I have little doubt that my noble friend could cite precedents where contracts have been let for longer periods than 15 years for the provision of infrastructure&#151;light rail would be one example&#151;where considerable investment is needed to get the project off the ground. But one advantage of buses over light rail is that most of the infrastructure is there already in the form of public highway; any improvements that may be desirable are not particularly expensive, relatively speaking, or necessarily difficult to provide. This also means that a bus network can be provided on a more flexible basis and can more easily be varied in line with changing journey patterns, demographic changes, growths in new communities and so on. So there is a real danger that a 15-year contract could create a real disincentive to responding flexibly to change in demand and could undo many of the advantages inherent in buses over tracked systems of public transportation.</p>

<a name="80116-0007.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08011688000102"></a>A 15-year contract would also place a great deal of power into the hands of the contracted operator. The longer the period of the contract, the more difficult it would be to promote genuine competition for a successor, particularly if contracts are let over a wide area to a single operator. Even 10 years carries that risk and should be regarded as a maximum rather than the norm. It should require the operator to do something more than simply provide a basic level of service over that time.</p>

<a name="80116-0007.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08011688000103"></a>Nor am I certain whether the difference between 10 and 15 years would be sufficient to persuade an operator to invest in capital projects such as bus stations. Many PFI contracts have been for much longer periods than that, though 15 years would still be the limit for bus services under community legislation. In any case, I can see no reason why a contract to build and manage a bus station should not be left as a separate measure, unrelated to contracts to operate bus services. That contract would then not be subject to the time restrictions in this Bill or the community regulation.</p>

<a name="80116-0007.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08011688000104"></a>If we were to accept that there could be contracts for up to 15 years, we would have to extend the duration of the quality contracts schemes themselves, either to 15 years or, as in my noble friend&#146;s amendment, for as long as the transport authority wishes, which in practical terms might as well mean for ever. Again, I am not attracted to that for the same reason; it could create the rigidity and inertia that many of us believe were in the pre-1985 set up.</p>

<a name="80116-0007.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08011688000105"></a>The Transport Act 2000 has rightly required local transport authorities to make long-term plans for the public transport in their areas, and that was a necessary and long overdue reform. Yet it also obliged them to review these plans at five-year intervals. There may be a stage at which the only way of getting a decent bus service in an area is to go for the quality contract option. The Bill will make this option more realistic than it is at present, but that does not mean it is the right option for eternity. Since this option places a lot of power in the hands of the local transport authority, there will be understandable pressure to keep it in place long after it has served its purpose.</p>

<a name="80116-0007.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08011688000106"></a>We think it is in the public interest that these schemes should be subject to a formal review process at least once in 10 years, and measures in this Bill will enable a local transport authority to provide for a scheme to continue in force beyond 10 years without having to start again at the beginning where it has been successful. Without a process for review after 10 years, there is a danger that they will simply carry on, for better or worse, because there is insufficient motivation to suggest otherwise.</p>

<a name="80116-0007.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08011688000107"></a>I am not persuaded by these amendments and hope my noble friend can feel his way to withdraw them. My noble friend asked me to reflect more on the Transport for London position, where there is no 10-year limit. The situation is different in London; its services were never deregulated in the same way as services outside the capital. They have been shaped and configured in a different way, subject to different pressures and demands, as well as pressures for innovation.</p>

Amendment No. 43 will, I hope, address a number of the concerns expressed in that discussion.</p>

<a name="80116-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08011698000025"></a>In my response at the time to my noble friend, I explained how a transfer from a deregulated bus network to a regulated one under quality contracts would differ from the standard form of transfer of undertaking for which the TUPE regulations were designed. The process could be complex because in most cases we would not be starting with either a service directly provided by a public authority or a service provided under contract to a public authority. I fully accepted that the clause in the Bill did not deal with all possible circumstances and agreed carefully to consider the points made by noble Lords.</p>

<a name="80116-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08011698000026"></a>No doubt it will be recalled that the existing Clause 38 would provide TUPE protection only to employees who were taken on by a new employer who had won a quality contract. It would not provide for all those employed in providing the existing services to transfer to the new operator. The amended clause would create an obligation so that when an existing local service is discontinued because of a quality contract coming into force, all employees engaged in providing that service would be eligible for transfer to the new operator of that contract on TUPE terms. That change was advocated by nearly all who contributed to the Grand Committee debate.</p>

<a name="80116-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08011698000027"></a>Another criticism of the existing clause was that it left unclear many details of precisely which employees would qualify for TUPE terms, particularly where there was not a straightforward correspondence between the existing service and the new service. The amended clause contains provisions to address that issue as well, by means of a power to make regulations to prescribe the process to determine who comprises the existing workforce and those who would be assignable to a new contract. It is proposed that the incumbent

The successful tenderer would be obliged to employ those workers, provided that they were willing to make the transfer, before looking further afield for employees.</p>

<a name="80116-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08011698000028"></a>This model depends on a degree of co-operation from the existing operators. First, they will have to supply employment details, suitably anonymised. Provision is made for sanctions if they fail to do so. Secondly, the TUPE provisions will apply only if the relevant services are continued in operation until the transfer date. Noble Lords will be aware that this has difficulties, but it should be borne in mind that an existing operator who will lose its services and employees unless it bids for and wins a contract to keep them going has a strong incentive to play by the rules. An operator that is able to transfer staff on TUPE terms will avoid the redundancy procedures and payments that would otherwise be necessary. We believe that on balance it is worth the risk of some employees potentially losing out in order to create a strong incentive for continuity of service to be maintained. Ultimately, we cannot force operators, in a still deregulated market, to continue providing services that may not be commercially viable.</p>

<a name="80116-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08011698000029"></a>I am aware that this amendment does not address all the points made in Committee. It would be virtually impossible to please everyone and set up a system that would deal with every contingency. I believe this is a great step forward and evidence that we have been listening hard to representations on this subject, not only from Members of this House but from elsewhere such as within industry at large. There have been a lot of discussions. I beg to move.</p>

I share the view expressed by my noble friend that the amendment represents considerable progress. It is, as he said, a complex issue and it is important for all those concerned to get it right. I hope that the Government will continue, if necessary, to work constructively with those directly affected by the employment issues referred to in the amendment as the Bill progresses through Parliament. I am sure that people will want to raise further issues on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08011698000031"></a>I trust I am not being unrealistic in hoping that, as the Bill progresses through Parliament, the Government will still feel able to introduce amendments to ensure pension protection. Whether TUPE regulations would apply in the period between the award of a quality contract to its becoming operational&#151;that is at least six months; it could be longer&#151;in circumstances where an operator deregistered a service and the quality contract operator then took it over is one of the issues that may need to be explored further. I welcome the amendment and the genuine efforts of the Government to deal with what could be a very difficult problem.</p>

At least, it has not written to me. However, I understand that it is in favour of such a provision. On reflection, I think that it has consulted some of its members locally and decided that it is not quite as much in favour of them as it first appeared to be.</p>

<a name="80116-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08011698000033"></a>The only representation on this amendment that I have received from the trade union movement is from the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, which organises bus workers in various parts of the country, which is a legacy of certain railway companies operating their own buses prior to nationalisation. The letter was signed by the general secretary, Bob Crow&#151;he signed it &#147;Robert Crow&#148;, which I found impressive; he had obviously decided at least to take his name upmarket, if not some of his attitudes. He said that he was very much in favour of franchising and, a little like PTEG, said that we ought to make sure that it came into being, rather than it being semi-blocked by a difficult government Bill. He went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="08011698000127"></a>&#147;However&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011698000116"></a>there is always a &#147;however&#148;&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08011698000162"></a>&#147;in these circumstances, we are very concerned about future pension provision&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011698000117"></a>I forbore to write back: &#147;Well, the problem with franchising is that, all too often, franchises go to the lowest bidder and pensions are not immediately uppermost in their mind when making their bids&#148;. He might have thought of that before he wrote the letter, but I do not suppose that there will be much future in pointing out that to him.</p>

<a name="80116-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08011698000034"></a>However, we are talking not just about pensions&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, referred to that. PTEG has belatedly realised that it is not simply a matter, as it is with railway franchising, of ringing the paint producers and having a new livery on the trains; it is a matter also of certain employment aspects of franchising, which is what quality contracts mean, albeit under a different name. I, too, would welcome, therefore, further thoughts from the Minister as the Bill proceeds to another place&#151;I am sure that he will provide them&#151;about proper pension provision for those who are involuntarily transferred from one company to another should the Government, or the traffic commissioners and those who advise them, be unwise enough to accept the nonsense of quality contracts.</p>

<a name="80116-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08011698000035"></a>However, more matters than just pensions are involved here. I try not to repeat matters that were debated in Committee, unlike the Passenger Transport Executive Group, which appears happy to take advantage of your Lordships&#146; rules that there are no rules really, that we make them up as we go along, and that it is up to individual Members of your Lordships&#146; House to abide by those unwritten rules. Perhaps the Procedure Committee could look at whether it an abuse of those unwritten rules for any organisation to brief Members, to see that amendments are worded exactly as they were in Committee and to provide exactly the same brief. My opinion is that it is, but I have not been here long enough to try to rewrite the rules of your Lordships&#146; House. There are certain other matters aside from pensions that the Minister ought to consider.</p>

<a name="80116-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08011698000036"></a>For example, many employees of the major bus companies are part of their own sharesave schemes. I know that FirstGroup and National Express have among their shareholders a considerable number of employees. When I was at National Express, all its employees were shareholders. The bus section of National Express was originally an employee-owned company. They came with their own shares, which were converted into National Express shares. Under the existing tax regulations, those shares are subject to taper relief. I am aware that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has announced the abolition of taper relief and a flat rate of tax of 18 per cent. I am not sure that the announcement will survive the furore that followed it, but if it does not, what will happen to those employees? After all, under the rules of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, they get tax relief for shares only in the company for which they work. If under the daft provisions of quality contracts, and through wishes not of their own but those of the Passenger Transport Executive Group, they are transferred, will there be any income tax relief for them? If their transfer is against their will, it will certainly be as a result of this legislation. What representations does the Minister envisage making to the Chancellor of the Exchequer about future tax provision for those who have calculated their worth and benefits under the existing sharesave schemes and who find themselves not working for the company which originally issued those shares and, because of that, subject to a different income tax regime? These are all legitimate concerns. PTEG has largely glossed over them, because it is not interested in them; its only concern is to get its hands back on its buses. However, they are relevant concerns, and are perhaps among the reasons why the trade unions have been less than vociferous in supporting this aspect of the Bill. What provision does the Minister envisage making to protect those employees and their legitimate savings from the ravages of the taxman?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08011698000042"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 45 to 63. The Bill provides for a new competition test that would apply to voluntary partnership agreements between local transport authorities and bus operators and to certain other supporting agreements. The test would apply in place of the provisions of Chapter 1 of Part 1 of the Competition Act 1998. The new test is designed to encourage these agreements by providing greater clarity to bus operators and a more proportionate enforcement regime.</p>

<a name="80116-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08011698000043"></a>In debating this issue in Grand Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, tabled an amendment that would have broadened the scope of the test to cover any agreement involving bus operators, even without any local authority involvement. There are certainly circumstances where such agreements may be in the public interest and, in those circumstances, we would wish to encourage them. For example, two operators might wish to co-ordinate their timetables on a particular route to provide a regular service frequency throughout the day, which makes evident good sense. However, in seeking to create a more flexible framework for beneficial agreements of this kind, we need also to ensure we do not create a safe harbour for agreements that are not in the interests of passengers. Agreements that are inconsistent with the policies of a local transport authority would be one example, or agreements that seek to fix fares higher than they need to be.</p>

<a name="80116-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08011698000044"></a>The amendments are designed to get this balance right. They would allow any agreement between bus operators to fall within the scope of the new competition test so long as the agreement has been endorsed and certified by the local transport authority and did not involve price fixing. By being subject to the new competition testing, Part 2 of Schedule 10 to the Transport Act 2000, agreements meeting this condition would not be at risk of financial penalty from the OFT. I know that that has been a concern. I consider that the amendments address the concerns raised by noble Lords in earlier debates while ensuring we do not create a safe harbour for agreements that undermine and do not provide direct benefits to passengers. I beg to move.</p>

The Government will need to make it very plain to people that conversations between bus operators which are in the public interest are to be encouraged, not simply permitted. I understand that any local authority may give this certification so that it would not be open to a local authority which was being difficult to withhold its signature and override the wishes of other local authorities and the bus operator concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08011698000053"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment was tabled by my noble friend Lady Chapman who unfortunately has had to leave the House for a hospital appointment. I am moving the amendment at her request and with her permission. It gives me great pleasure to do so, because it seeks to bring into force Section 36 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Those of your Lordships who can count will appreciate that disabled people have not seen the benefit of this provision for the past 13 years. Section 37, which is comparable, gives a similar protection to disabled people who are guide dog users. It seems quite inequitable that Section 37 can be brought into force without the comparable protection for wheelchair users that Section 36 would provide.</p>

<a name="80116-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08011698000054"></a>I strongly support this amendment, which is why I have no difficulty in moving it on the behalf of my noble friend. She wanted me to thank noble Lords on all sides of the House for their warm expressions of support for her amendment. She also asked me particularly to thank the Minister for the time and courtesy he has extended to her in the discussions they have had about the implementation of Section 36 of the Disability Discrimination Act.</p>

<a name="80116-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08011698000055"></a>The Minister will recall that my noble friend asked a question on 18 December about when this provision was to be brought into force. The Minister indicated  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1343"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1343</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the Government planned to bring it into force at a reasonably early date. However, my noble friend has tabled the amendment to concentrate minds and ensure that at least we make a start.</p>

<a name="80116-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08011698000056"></a>I hope that the Minister will appreciate that the scope of this amendment is very limited&#151;it has to be to bring it within the scope of the Bill. It would, from August 2008, place the duties imposed by the, as yet unactivated, Section 36 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 on any taxi that is deemed or registered by the relevant local licensing authority to be a wheelchair-accessible taxi and where it is providing a local service as defined by Section 2 of the Transport Act 1985. We very much welcome the provisions in the Bill which permit the use of taxis to provide local transport services. However, this means that the scope of the amendment has to be limited to taxis that are providing a local transport service. It would not apply to a wheelchair-accessible taxi that could be hailed; for example, on a street corner.</p>

<a name="80116-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08011698000057"></a>My noble friend has been assured by the National Association of Licensing and Enforcement Officers&#151;NALEO&#151;which represents local government officers who enforce and oversee Britain&#146;s taxi licensing regime, that her amendment is practical and workable. It issued a statement on 14 January which said that the,</p>
<ul><a name="08011698000163"></a>&#147;amendment is, in our view, a proportionate and logical step in the improvement of local services. NALEO has no doubt that every licensing authority in England and Wales can identify all wheelchair accessible vehicles licensed by their authorities either instantly or at very short notice. Therefore the existing local authority licensing and enforcement framework would be capable of supporting this amendment at little or negligible cost&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80116-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08011698000058"></a>This statement additionally says that NALEO also believes that while the Government&#146;s proposed amendment on Report to impose a duty on local transport authorities to have regard to the transport needs of disabled persons is to be welcomed, my noble friend&#146;s amendment is necessary to reinforce that with requirements on taxi drivers not to discriminate against wheelchair users when they are driving a taxi that is providing a local service. This amendment seeks to achieve this through the unambiguous and enforceable duties on taxi drivers contained in Section 36 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</p>

<a name="80116-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08011698000059"></a>An estimated 1.2 million wheelchair users in England alone could benefit from the incremental advance this amendment seeks. They have already waited 13 years for Section 36 of the 1995 Act to be brought into force. It is time at least to make a start. In the summer of 2007 the Public Carriage Office of Transport for London was unable to pursue a court case against the driver of a wheelchair-accessible taxi who had refused to take my noble friend&#146;s fare because it discovered that Section 36 was not in force. This amendment, if accepted, would mean that such a prosecution would in future at least be able to be brought where a taxi was providing a local service. Up until now successive Transport Ministers have considered that rural and other areas are not ready to comply with the protections that the section would afford to wheelchair users using taxis. In urban areas far more taxis are wheelchair-accessible; for example, in London every taxi has to be wheelchair-accessible to obtain a licence. But, as I have said, my noble friend has been assured by the National Association  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1344"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1344</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Licensing and Enforcement Officers that her amendment would be practicable and workable in rural areas no less than in urban areas.</p>

<a name="80116-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08011698000060"></a>If the scope of the Bill were wider, my noble friend Lady Chapman would have amended it to bring the section into more general force, where local authorities have certified a taxi to be wheelchair accessible, so that unlike this amendment, it would apply to taxis being hailed on a street corner, not just those providing a local service. That will have to wait for another day.</p>

<a name="80116-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08011698000061"></a>Looking around Britain&#146;s high streets, it is hard to believe that&#151;as estimated by the NHS&#151;there are over 1 million wheelchair users in the country. More wheelchair users might get about and participate more in the economic life of this country if the Government were to accept this amendment and the door it will open for progressing wider implementation of Section 36.</p>

<a name="80116-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08011698000062"></a>With the numbers of potential beneficiaries from this amendment and the considerable numbers of wheelchair-accessible taxis now available in Britain, we believe that passing this amendment would be bound to have more than a symbolic significance. If the Government can give an assurance on this matter or offer to meet the purpose of the amendment in some way&#151;for example, on the commencement date&#151;then we would be prepared to consider withdrawing it. My noble friend Lady Chapman wanted me to remind your Lordships that 1 million of our fellow citizens are weary of being left out in the rain by successive governments as well as by many wheelchair-accessible taxis. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08011698000064"></a>Like many other Members of this House, I was absolutely shocked to know that this section of an Act affecting people with disabilities, passed nearly 13 years ago, has not been enacted. The noble Baroness, Lady Chapman, is very grateful to the Minister for the time he has given to her in discussions on this matter. We cannot forget that the Bill gives the opportunity to ensure that Section 36 of the Act is brought in.</p>

<a name="80116-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08011698000065"></a>I have heard stories of people trying to get taxis. The noble Baroness, Lady Chapman, told me how nine taxis one after the other just passed her. One had the audacity to wave to her as he went past. Nobody can condone that. That was not the situation that was ever intended when the Bill was brought in all those years ago. I am pleased to support the amendment. It is proportionate. It is supported by the local licensing authorities as a proportionate and logical measure. I suspect that the Minister is sympathetic to it and I hope that he can give a positive response&#151;or some indication of when the Government will introduce this provision in the Act. Most of us are now saying that enough is enough&#151;13 years is long enough for any part of the Act to be enacted. We would welcome it being done as soon as possible. This is a proportionate measure. The noble Baroness, Lady Chapman, has been extremely responsible in the way that she has put it forward. I support the amendment.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Chapman, has been tireless in her work on this matter and we all want to commend her for that. I hope that we will support her today. As the noble Lord, Lord Low, has said, this does not cause any problems to local authorities. It relates to those taxis that are able to take wheelchair passengers.

Unfortunately, there is a small proportion of people who see wheelchair users and pass by looking on the other side. One of the difficulties will be convincing people that they should stop and take on board wheelchair users who require a taxi. I am not sure how that can be done. A number of taxi drivers have told me that they cannot take me because they have a bad back. The number of bad backs among London taxi drivers seems to be increasing as the years go by. I support the amendment and trust that the Government will find some way to ensure that it is enforced&#151;though not in a rigorous police manner&#151;to get over the message that people in wheelchairs need to be helped and transported.</p>

I enjoyed a very robust discussion with her on this issue and she told me in no uncertain terms that she wanted to make sure that something got done. I was impressed by that and genuinely moved by her determination on this matter, as we all should be. Like everybody else in your Lordships&#146; House, I was fairly horrified by some of the stories which surrounded the noble Baroness, Lady Chapman, asking her question on 18 December. I had hoped that we had moved on from those days and that we were now in an era in which drivers were much more responsible regarding people with disabilities and their access to taxi services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08011698000070"></a>Members of your Lordships&#146; House who were here on that occasion will also recall that I made the point that, as the noble Lord has just said, most taxi drivers are happy and content to co-operate and want to be helpful and provide a service. However, sadly, a minority do not do taxi services any favours in their treatment of people with different measures of disability. We need a power like this. It is not hard to persuade me or others that we need to move in that direction. Like other noble Lords, I greatly regret that it has taken as long as it has to get to this point. I am not going to

<a name="80116-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08011698000071"></a>I have had some discussion with my right honourable friend Rosie Winterton on this matter. She assures me that we are very close to the point where proposals will be brought forward. She is obviously a person of great integrity on these matters and shares with me a passion to ensure that we get things right. I cannot offer a precise timetable for that&#151;to do so would be disingenuous. We intend to make an announcement very shortly. Before we make that announcement, I want to ensure that the noble Baroness, Lady Chapman, and&#151;if he is prepared to give up some of his valuable time&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Low, have a meeting with Rosie Winterton to have further discussion on this issue. There are some practical problems associated with this amendment so I hope it will be withdrawn today.</p>

<a name="80116-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08011698000072"></a>I will go through one of the issues concerned. Even if we were minded to consider the amendment today, there are one or two practical difficulties. The duties imposed by Section 36, for instance, are linked to Section 32, covering the taxi accessibility regulations that have not been commenced. Section 32 provides for the making of regulations in which technical requirements will be set out and under which it will be mandatory for any taxis governed by the regulations to comply with such requirements&#151;not unreasonable in themselves. We would need to ensure, however, that the Section 36 duties were quite freestanding. Furthermore, the power to make regulations under Section 32 applies only to taxis and not to private hire vehicles, so further amendments to Section 36 would be required so as to apply the duties to the drivers of private hire vehicles. The amendment does not quite work as it is, which is one of the areas of concern to Ministers. We do not want to put something in place that is not workable.</p>

<a name="80116-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08011698000073"></a>While I cannot promise to bring something back at a later stage of the legislation, I can say that we are close to an announcement, prior to which perhaps the noble Baroness, Lady Chapman, and the noble Lord, Lord Low, could agree to hold further discussions with my right honourable friend Rosie Winterton. We are all committed to delivering more accessible taxis and making it easier for disabled passengers to use public transport. That is a common and shared objective. The implementation of that is very important, and I know from my discussions with Rosie Winterton that there has to be a further period of consultation&#151;not a long period, but certainly to meet the usual three-month obligation. We have to ensure that we can achieve what is set out, and we want to carry out some further work.</p>

<a name="80116-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08011698000074"></a>We are reviewing the uncommenced sections, and an announcement is to be made shortly. We want to evaluate all the options. Certainly we need to have some discussions, not just with the National Association of Enforcement Officers&#151;which, I am glad to say, shares our enthusiasm, and I welcome that&#151;but also with the Local Government Association and others who have an interest in this matter. We want to reflect carefully on DPTAC, because it has important comments to make on these issues too.</p>

I asked whether it would be possible to give a date for an announcement, but the answer has come back that that would be unwise; we do not want to commit ourselves to something that we do not then deliver. However, the term &#147;very shortly&#148;, to my way of thinking, means exactly that. I do not want this thing to drag on any longer because that would not be in anyone&#146;s best interests.</p>

At the same time, I need to make it clear that the noble Baroness, Lady Chapman, was very anxious to get a resolution today and to test the opinion of the House. She thought, as do I, that &#147;very shortly&#148;&#151;and there are obviously varying opinions about how long that is&#151;must mean some time before August, which is the date specified in the amendment.

The two amendments pick up an amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Rosser in Committee. They concern the punctuality reports that traffic commissioners may prepare under the new Section 27A of the Transport Act 1985 that would be inserted by Clause 55 of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80116-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08011698000084"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend for drawing our attention to the point. In the clause as drafted, traffic commissioners are required to send copies of a punctuality report recommending remedial measures to the operator and, where recommendations about such measures are for implementation by a local traffic authority, to that authority. However, there is no statutory requirement to send copies to the integrated transport authority, which may also have a strong interest in the remedial measures; for example, because the implementation of those measures might affect the operation of buses in their area. In the metropolitan areas, the integrated transport authority, rather than the local traffic authority, is responsible for developing and implementing local transport policies, and that authority would have an interest in ensuring that such recommendations were implemented effectively.</p>

<a name="80116-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08011698000085"></a>The amendments will remedy the situation and create parity between the two tiers of authority in metropolitan areas. Outside the metropolitan areas, the issue does not arise because the same local authority is responsible for both transport and traffic.</p>

<a name="80116-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08011698000086"></a>The first amendment will affect subsection (6) of the inserted section. It would make it obligatory for the traffic commissioner to send a copy of a report to an integrated transport authority where any remedial measures proposed would affect the operation of services in their area.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08011698000087"></a>The second amendment will affect subsection (7) of the inserted section and will add integrated transport authorities to the list of further persons to whom the traffic commissioner may send a copy of the report but is not obliged to. This would cover cases falling outside the scope of the first amendment; for example, because the report did not propose any remedial measures, or none within the authority&#146;s own area, but could still be relevant to its transport planning role. There is a similar mention in subsection (7) of local traffic authorities, so once again the amendment would put both types of authority on the same footing. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08011698000096"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Bill proposes reinstating the PTE power to own vehicles and provide them to operators. The purpose of this amendment is to enhance that power to formally allow PTEs to provide vehicles to community transport operators. Unless I am very much mistaken, in Committee the Government did not specifically engage with what was intended as the main point of this amendment, which was to allow PTEs to provide vehicles not only for commercial operators, but for community transport schemes. Obviously, there are financial issues involved in such schemes and for those who run and organise them. This amendment would regulate the status of such support by the local transport authority. It would also be in line with one of the wider aims of the legislation, which is to support and promote the community transport sector.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08011698000097"></a>This group of amendments includes Amendment No. 70. If that amendment had been agreed in Committee, which it was not, it would give the PTE, as the operator of last resort, powers if a quality contract was terminated or services under that contract ceased. In Committee, the Government agreed to look at the operator of last resort powers again. The Minister has since indicated that the Government have decided not to move from the Bill as it stands on this particular issue. As far as the reasons that have been given are concerned, reference has been made to the position of an operator who, in effect, goes out of business, and to the powers of either an administrator or a receiver, among others, to address the situation that might arise. Within London, for example, these powers exist. Once again, there appears to be a discrepancy between what the Government view as appropriate in London, and what they view as appropriate outside.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08011698000098"></a>It is not only a question of companies that might become insolvent. There are, presumably, issues of franchise default or termination&#151;although they will be very few and far between, and nobody would suggest otherwise&#151;where the operator of last resort powers might, in some circumstances, be needed. I know that there is an argument about whether transport authorities are in a position to own their own fleet of vehicles, depots, and so on, but presumably they might be able to rent or lease vehicles. They might be in a situation where there has been a default or termination over a number of services in an area, rather than a situation where the local transport authority wishes to step in and provide vehicles for all services. There might be a need on certain routes. It might be part of a package of measures, involving other operators, put

The local transport authority itself might need to be the operator of last resort.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08011698000099"></a>I have read the Government&#146;s views on this in light of the representations we made in Committee, and have made some further points, which I hope my noble friend will be prepared to reflect further on. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_134"></a>
<a name="08011698000100"></a><b><a name="80116-0010.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08011698000189"></a>Lord Snape:</b> My Lords, listening to my noble friend I am struck by the fact that he has told us continuously, on behalf of the Passenger Transport Executive Group, that quality contracts were the way forward. Somehow, bus services the length and breadth of the country would be transformed, if only quality contracts could be implemented. The great failing of the 2000 Act was not to implement quality contracts. Now, of course, comes a safety net: this wonderful system that PTEG would inflict upon operators nationally has to be provided with a fail-safe mechanism. I understand why.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08011698000101"></a>If we are to have franchising of bus services, it is obviously conceivable that the lowest bidder will be awarded the franchise. Again, experience leads me to believe that, all too often, the lowest bidder is not the best long-term choice. I understand why the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, has to erect this safety net on behalf of PTEG, but surely there is a better way of doing it. If the quality contract goes ahead and the chosen operator fails, there is nothing&#151;under the legislation as I understand it&#151;to stop another operator being installed on a pro tem basis until the contract can be re-let. My noble friend will correct me if I am wrong. I wonder whether, when the noble Lord winds up the debate on this amendment, he will tell us, or give us an estimate of, how much money will be needed to acquire a bus fleet and rent premises. This is no cheap matter, but it was somewhat glibly skated over. Buses can be leased but, again, this is not necessarily cheap, unless one wishes to lease those glorified bread vans that disfigured our roads for some years after the 1986 Act, but which have thankfully now been swept away. I wonder if PTEG has thought about the financial implications of becoming the operator of last resort.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08011698000102"></a>I put one more point to the noble Lord, which he could, perhaps, reflect on in winding up, provided he has been adequately briefed. Could there be a temptation to choose the weakest operator, in the knowledge that there may be an opportunity to become the operator of last resort and, indeed, move into the bus business? This is a not inconsiderable temptation, as I know from some of my conversations with the Passenger Transport Executive. I do not mind it wanting to become the operator of last resort, although I do not think that it does that very well. Again, talking about the bus industry of the past, I cannot remember this wonderful system that local authorities ran so well. As a regular user of buses in my youth, if I wanted to get home after 11 pm, it had to be either by taxi or Shanks&#146;s pony, because the local authority was never keen to provide a late-night bus service.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08011698000103"></a>We have moved on from those days. If we are to have local authorities running bus services, albeit as the operator of last resort, it is incumbent on the  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1351"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1351</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Lord, Lord Rosser, to tell us whether provision needs to be made within the financial parameters of the constituent local authority&#146;s NEPT area, and, if so, how much money we are talking about and how many staff. How does one acquire the expertise to be a PSV operator? It does not come easily or cheaply, and rightly so. We are anxious, as a nation, to prevent what I might term fly-by-night operators entering the bus business.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08011698000104"></a>I do not suggest for a moment that local authorities would come under that category. However, before anyone on their behalf puts forward such an amendment, they should tell your Lordships how much money is involved and why the obvious alternative, that of installing another operator until the quality contract can be re-let, cannot be considered. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will resist this amendment as ably as he did in Committee.</p>

There are two separate issues: the leasing of vehicles to community transport groups and whether the PTE should have the power to operate the vehicles as a &#147;last resort&#148;. I shall deal with these in reverse order. I apologise for not dealing as properly as I should have with the first of the two issues, which is why I shall spend a little more time on it towards the end.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08011698000106"></a>We said that we would reflect on the issue of operating powers for PTEs, even in the narrow terms set out in Amendment No.70. Indeed, the more we think about it, the less convinced we tended to be. In Committee, noble Lords referred to the comparable case of rail franchises, and my noble friend Lord Berkeley mentioned that the Strategic Rail Authority had kept a team of qualified people at the ready in case it was necessary to step in to prevent a service being disrupted by the failure of a contractor. No doubt that piece of information was provided to support the need for such a measure, but in fact it also brought home to us just what an enormous commitment it would be for a PTE to profess to be the &#147;operator of last resort&#148; and to have the necessary legal powers.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08011698000107"></a>For the powers to be of any use it would have to be possible for the PTE to exercise them at a moment&#146;s notice, otherwise they might as well let an emergency contract. My noble friend Lord Snape has made quite a lot of that argument. I agree with him: it would be very difficult to acquire that level of expertise in that sort of timeframe. The practicalities of it are that they would need a public service vehicle operator&#146;s licence, the necessary financial standing and a professionally competent transport manager available at any time the emergency might arise. They would also need the vehicles and drivers. Arguably those of the failed company would be available, but they would not necessarily fall into the PTE&#146;s lap.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08011698000108"></a>What is more likely to happen, particularly if we are talking about a company of any size, is that receivers or administrators would be called in and would continue to run the company&#146;s affairs as best they could until a buyer was found. In particular, they  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1352"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1352</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would be likely to want to keep services going as these would bring in revenue to abate any unfortunate losses. Maintaining contractual obligations would take precedence over discretionary activities, so services outside quality contracts schemes may be more at risk.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08011698000109"></a>That might not happen in the case of small operators, particularly sole traders, but they would generally be managing small contracts, and I think that one could fairly argue that it should be easier to replace them on the open market. I am told that where, for example, a contractor defaults on a schools contract, there is little difficulty in finding another operator to step in, even at very short notice. Local transport authorities with a quality contracts scheme have powers to let emergency contracts under Section 131 of the Transport Act 2000 until a new permanent contractor is found.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08011698000110"></a>The PTEs, I understand, are more worried about what would happen if a big contractor should fail and, for any reason, the administrators were unable to keep the company trading, or chose not to do so. In that case it is hard to see how a PTE could step in more effectively than another operator, or several other operators, each taking a slice. The PTE would need a very large operator&#146;s licence, say for as many as 200 or 300 vehicles, and a means of getting hold of those vehicles and the people to drive them. One assumes that they would not have them on permanent standby. I find it surprising that this argument has been put forward as robustly as it has. I do not think it is a practical proposition; I am not sure that PTEs would welcome these powers in the long run; and I think it would be onerous to require them to set up a permanent shadow organisation which had little to do for most of the time.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08011698000111"></a>Finally, I doubt whether it would provide what we could reasonably envisage as good value for money.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08011698000112"></a>I have rather more sympathy for the other proposition contained in the group of amendments. This is a separate issue. Again I reiterate my apology to my noble friend that in Committee we were so exercised about the &#147;operator of last resort&#148; issue that we rather overlooked this one. I am sorry about that because it is clear that there may be some merit in this amendment which was not fully exposed in that debate.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08011698000113"></a>I fully understand that one practical way in which a PTE could help the community transport sector, particularly dial-a-ride services for older or disabled people, is by purchasing suitable vehicles and leasing them, perhaps for a nominal fee. This may be a more cost-effective way of supporting these services than other forms of grant aid&#151;and it appears that, unlike local authorities, they may be prevented from doing so because of the effect of the disapplication of the leasing power in Section 10 of the Transport Act 1968.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08011698000114"></a>I am not certain whether the amendment would entirely achieve what my noble friend is arguing for. It would seem to extend only to services aimed at elderly or disabled people. That is because it would be caught by the words &#147;public passenger transport services&#148; which appear at the end of the paragraph in Clause 58. Services provided under Section 19  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1353"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1353</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>permits&#151;the permits used by community transport bodies&#151;are not included in that term unless they are,</p>
<ul><a name="08011698000164"></a>&#147;provided wholly or mainly to meet the needs of members of the public who are elderly or disabled&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011698000118"></a>I am not sure whether my noble friend intended the leasing power to be restricted in that way. I suspect that he did not. I also suspect that the PTEs may want the power to extend more widely, even if their main concern is to support services for older or disabled people.</p>

<a name="80116-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08011698000115"></a>My commitment today is simply this: we can see merit in the amendments. We are happy to take away this issue and see whether we can move in the direction indicated in my noble friend&#146;s amendment and better perfect it to fit the purpose which I think he probably intended for it. I hope on those terms that the noble Lord will be able to withdraw this amendment and to not pursue the others in the group. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="080116101000004"></a>On the issue of the operator of last resort I do not think that my noble friend responded to the point that there are those powers within London. Any local transport authority would have to decide about the costs involved in deciding whether to exercise those powers of operator of last resort. Obviously, the costs involved would depend on the extent to which it was going to decide to act as an operator of last resort in the exceptional circumstances in which that normally arises. In the light of the Minister's response, that option is not going to be available to the transport authority to consider even if it wished to do so. I note my noble friend's response with regret on Amendment No. 70, but I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 67.</p>

Under the Transport Act 1985 it is the only specific grant-making power available to PTEs and other local transport authorities. Under the relevant section of that Act, local transport authorities can make capital grants to provide, maintain or improve facilities wholly or mainly for facilitating travel by members of the public who are disabled. They can also make revenue grants to community transport operators to support the provision of bus services for both the disabled and the elderly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="080116101000009"></a>The amendment, which I hope will find better favour with my noble friend, would extend the permissible categories for capital grants to include older people, people in full- or part-time education and the unemployed, and for revenue grants it would allow the same category extension for grants by local transport authorities to community transport operators. In effect, the amendment, if it were adopted, would allow local transport authorities to support a much wider range of initiatives and projects with a social-inclusion focus. That in turn would contribute to wider government goals for tackling social exclusion. It might, for example, allow grants to be made for vehicle acquisition for yellow school bus schemes or for community transport providers. It would also allow for both capital and revenue support to be provided for community transport schemes serving socially excluded communities, rather than just for community transport schemes serving the elderly and the disabled.

<a name="80116-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="080116101000014"></a>I also suggest that the amendment, even in its narrower form, risks confusion and overlap with the existing powers available to both local transport authorities and education authorities. It is not clear, for example, that services used by unemployed persons are really a discrete category or that special vehicles, equipment or, for that matter, facilities are required to enable them to use such services. Do unemployed people&#151;or, for that matter, those in full-time education&#151;not just want to make use of good-quality local transport services like the rest of us? I am also concerned that the extension of the power to make capital grants in the amendment raises issues that need some further examination, not least, as was said in one of the earlier debates, in relation to the position under EU state aid rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="080116101000015"></a>We have to be careful. Those reservations draw me to the conclusion that this is not a particularly attractive or helpful amendment. I appreciate the thinking behind it, but it could have some unintended and unfortunate consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="080116101000020"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 73 to 76. In Committee, amendments were tabled with the objective of obliging certain persons, such as bus operators, local authorities and traffic commissioners, to have regard to representations made by the Public Transport Users Committee. The aim was to strengthen the powers of the committee to ensure that certain parties would take proper notice of it. While we considered that the amendments as drafted were overly restrictive&#151;not least because they would not have applied if the Secretary of State opted to give additional functions to the Rail Passengers&#146; Council&#151;we agreed to consider the concept and examine whether it would be appropriate to legislate.</p>

<a name="80116-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="080116101000021"></a>We have done that and agree that there would be merit in strengthening the remit of the passenger representative body by placing, in certain circumstances, an obligation on certain persons or bodies to respond to the representations or recommendations of the committee. The powers we already propose to take through this Bill would enable the Secretary of State to confer powers on the passenger representative body to make recommendations or representations to certain people or bodies, such as bus operators, local authorities, and traffic commissioners. The government amendment would enable the Secretary of State, subject to approval by resolution in both Houses of Parliament, to make an order to confer functions on those people or bodies to place them under an obligation to respond in a particular way.</p>

<a name="80116-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="080116101000022"></a>What we have in mind is that if the passenger representative body makes representations to a bus operator about the way in which services are operated in a particular area, that operator would be under an obligation to consider those representations, and perhaps to send a written response to the user committee. The amendment as drafted would enable this to be done if we were to either set up a public transport users committee or add additional functions to Passenger Focus, the rail watchdog.</p>

<a name="80116-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="080116101000023"></a>One further change that I would like to mention specifically is our proposal in respect of the functions to be conferred on the Public Transport Users&#146; Committee under new Section 125B of the Transport Act 1985. These are to make recommendations to the Secretary of State either on any matters relating to public passenger transport services as the committee considers appropriate, or in response to a particular request by the Secretary of State. We believe that it would be appropriate to widen the power to enable the committee to make representations, as well as recommendations, to the Secretary of State on appropriate matters. We have tabled an amendment to include that point.</p>

In Committee, the noble Lords, Lord Low and Lord Berkeley, tabled amendments which would have placed an obligation on passenger transport operators to display information about public transport users committees. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Low, focused on the need for the presentation and location of such notices to take the needs of disabled people into account. At the time that we debated these amendments I explained that, although we agreed with the principle and intention behind them we wanted to consider them further, and I promised to come back at this stage with a suggestion on how to achieve his objective.</p>

<a name="80116-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="080116101000033"></a>We agree that it might be appropriate to require such information to be visible, so that, for example, passengers know who they can contact if they have a complaint about the service that they have received, or where to take that complaint further if they feel it has not been properly addressed. As noble Lords are aware, we are consulting on a new bus passenger champion. In drafting this clause, we have been mindful that the legislation should not be tied to any of the options, as it would be redundant if that option were taken out. Furthermore, this objective has merits in itself aside from the statutory passenger representative body that may be set up, so we want to ensure that the powers can be used even if it is decided that no such body is needed. Therefore, this amendment has been drawn up with sufficient flexibility to accommodate a range of different outcomes to the consultation. It would provide for the detail of the information requirements to be prescribed in secondary legislation, and that will give the right flexibility.</p>

<a name="80116-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="080116101000034"></a>This provision would also extend to Wales, although it would be for Welsh Ministers to make the regulations to apply there. We have defined the power to make regulations in such a way as to provide that, for

The power would also enable the regulations to empower a traffic commissioner to impose a financial penalty on any operator who without reasonable excuse failed to comply with the requirement. Such an operator would have a right of appeal to the Transport Tribunal against a decision to impose a penalty.</p>

<a name="80116-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="080116101000035"></a>The second new clause in this group of amendments is supplementary and would clarify the powers of the Transport Tribunal in relation to appeals under the main clause. It would also clarify those powers in the case of appeals against sanctions imposed by the traffic commissioners under Section 155 of the Transport Act 2000, as proposed to be amended by Clause 56 of this Bill.</p>

I shall press him on bus users&#146; representation. He will be aware that the present system involving Bus Users UK is favourably regarded by people in the industry. I understand that the Government are looking at whether that organisation or another should adequately represent bus users. The trouble with Bus Users UK is that it is funded by the bus industry, and some critics say that its voice is muted because of that. I am in no way authorised to say this, but I will say it anyway, given my connections with the bus industry: that industry would be quite relieved if someone else funded it, but no one else does, so it remains the responsibility of the bus industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="080116101000048"></a>The Bill places an overarching duty on what have previously been known as passenger transport authorities to develop policies for transport in their area and to produce a local transport plan. In other words, they will be responsible for transport strategy covering not only public transport, but all transport within their locality. They will have additional statutory powers as set out in Part 5. In recognition of this new, wider, set of responsibilities, we believe it would be sensible to rename PTAs as Integrated Transport Authorities&#151;ITAs. At the same time, we would rename the area that an ITA covers&#151;previously known as a passenger transport area&#151;as an &#147;integrated transport area&#148;.</p>

<a name="80116-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="080116101000049"></a>I am sure that it will come as no surprise to the House that there are many references to PTAs and passenger transport areas in current legislation, going back, as far as we can understand it, to the Transport Act 1968. Clause 67 provides that such references should now be read as if they refer to Integrated Transport Authorities and areas as regards England and Wales.</p>

<a name="80116-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="080116101000050"></a>I am told that it is good legislative practice to make the necessary changes, where possible, by way of textual amendment, in order to aid accessibility of the legislation in future. We believe that this is particularly important now that legislation is so often accessed through electronic means.</p>

<a name="80116-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="080116101000051"></a>Schedule 4 currently lists existing references to PTAs and passenger transport areas where these occur in various statutes coming forward from 1968 and relating to transport matters. We have now had an opportunity to identify more such references, and these amendments expand Schedule 4 to provide a comprehensive list of textual amendments to PTAs and passenger transport areas in all public Acts of Parliament.</p>

<a name="80116-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="080116101000052"></a>There is one proviso to this. While the new references to ITAs and ITA areas would apply to England and Wales, it is still necessary to retain existing references to PTAs in relevant legislation. This is simply because one PTA was set up in Scotland&#151;in Strathclyde&#151;which is not affected by this Bill. As a devolved matter, any legislative changes in Scotland to the Strathclyde PTA would be a matter for the Scottish Parliament. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="080116101000063"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we take up again what was a fruitful source of debate and indeed a happy hunting ground for my predecessor in this job, the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. We continue to debate a saga of unfortunate actions that have led to unfortunate consequences.</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="080116101000064"></a>In a sense, the Government are fortunate that the consequences of this series of regulations are now fairly well disguised behind a growing economic slow-down which is being followed by falling prices in the UK housing sector. All of that is exacerbated by the consequences of the sub-prime banking collapse in the United States which has caused a shortage of credit in the UK banking system and aggravated the general loss of confidence in the market. The collapse of Northern Rock, which is as yet unresolved, does nothing to help the situation.</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="080116101000065"></a>All these factors hinder the possibility of seeing a clear and precise picture of the impact caused by the introduction of home information packs. However, there are things that we know. We know that the Government have never dared to publish the results of the research, which cost &#163;4 million, into the effects of the pilot schemes. This is most unfortunate. It inevitably leads suspicious minds like mine to the conclusion that there is perhaps something the Government wish to hide&#151;or, at the very least, not to reveal. We know that in its fifth report of this session, the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee undertook a very helpful and full review across what I will term the housing market industry. Its conclusions, which I will paraphrase, are as follows. The objectives of the home information packs regulations are to provide consumers with better information at the right time to reduce costs and carbon emissions from homes. It goes on to say that these amending regulations provide for a further reduction in the information required in home information packs. Views among stakeholders continued to be divided&#151;both about the benefits of this change and about home information pack policy generally.</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="080116101000066"></a>I acknowledge that the Association of Home Information Pack Providers continues to be enthusiastic because of the transitional arrangement that the

It goes on to note that there are problems in obtaining even some of the reduced information required. I believe that I have interpreted its note correctly. The fact that there is less information than was originally intended means that the general purpose of the packs is not as strong as it might otherwise have been. However, its enthusiasm is not matched by others elsewhere. While noting a reduction of costs of searches by some local authorities, the Council for Mortgage Lenders also noted that delivering energy performance certificates through home information packs will take more than 13 years to cover the housing stock. Yet energy performance certificates are the main reason for pressing on with home information packs. It goes on to say that the Government should reflect on whether energy performance certificates could be more quickly, and more universally, delivered in a different way.</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="080116101000067"></a>As someone who is participating in the Committee stage on the Climate Change Bill, which is currently in this House, the matter of speeding up the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from the domestic sector cannot be deferred for 13 years; the problem is more urgent than that. Those qualified to provide energy performance certificates will need to provide their services to any householder. We have a much greater urgency than is implied by having them tied to home information packs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="080116101000068"></a>A memorandum from Mr Michael Garson to the Statutory Instruments Committee lists 10 objectives which, he says, the home information packs fail to meet. I do not intend to list them all as it would take too long.</p>

Inquiries that they receive about possible new business are down by 5 per cent in the south of England and nearer to 30 per cent in the north. That is a very heavy reduction, and prices are going down at the same time.</p>

In other words, the law of unforeseen consequences applies: the client will pay more for the home information pack than it costs to produce.</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="080116101000073"></a>It seems to be said everywhere that the searches required for home information packs are inadequate for the purposes of clients&#146; lawyers before any purchase can be completed. The members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors are clear that, in reality, the home information pack is not a major consideration in the minds of home-buyers.</p>

<a name="080116110000002"></a><b><a name="80116-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="080116110000120"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> My Lords, I feel as though I am intruding on old friends in this debate. When there was a debate on the No. 2 Regulations last year, my noble friend Lady Scott of Needham Market started by saying, &#147;Here we are again&#148;. I am taking over from her today and, as I look around, I see a number of Members of the House whose words on that occasion I have recently read. On that occasion, on a Motion moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, from the Conservative Front Bench, the Government, with Liberal Democrat support, got what might be called a &#147;non-fatal mauling&#148;. To say that the Government ignored that would be unfair; I am sure that they paid a great deal of attention to what was said, not least because many of the points made in the debate were very valid. Nevertheless, they ploughed on.</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="080116110000003"></a>I have never been terribly enthused by home information packs. They were a good idea, but the Act was flawed and the implementation has certainly been flawed&#151;at least, it has been very difficult. It has been fragmented and there has been an impression of stuttering and stumbling along. Having said that, we should pay credit to the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, who, as a Minister, has put a lot of personal commitment and energy into making HIPs work. Without her efforts, they probably would not have been put into force. Some people may consider that to be a good thing but I think that she should be given the credit for them. However, they are still struggling to get over the finishing line, as we see with the amendment regulations before us.</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="080116110000004"></a>In many ways, it is too soon to make a judgment on home information packs. In the debate on 18 July, the Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_240"></a><a name="080116110000106"></a>&#147;They will help to end frustration and reduce costs&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 18/7/07; col. 273.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080116110000100"></a>At the moment, the kindest thing that one can say is that that case is as yet unproven, but it may be that that will be the long-term effect. However, Parliament as a whole will have to come back to this issue at some point in the future to see whether HIPs are doing what has been claimed for them. If they are not, their cost will mean that they should be done away with. Nevertheless, at the moment the jury is not out because the evidence and information is not there, but the jury will be needed in future.</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="080116110000005"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said that the Government had never dared to publish the report from the pilot trials. I do not know whether that is the case or whether it has just taken a long time for the information to emerge through the system. Again, I shall be kind to the Government and suggest that that may be the case, but one has to ask when this information  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1371"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1371</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will be published, as clearly it must be. On the previous occasion, they promised to publish it in the late autumn. Whenever autumn may be nowadays with global warming, it certainly does not extend into January of the next year. We need a clear commitment on when the information will be published, because it is vital. It is extraordinary that a system has been introduced across all types of housing before publication of the report on the pilot schemes, which were presumably intended to give us the benefit of that information before the decision to proceed was made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="080116110000006"></a>The report by Europe Economics has been published but it was only narrow in its reference to the housing market and it suggests that there has been no impact as yet. Again, we shall see in a year or two whether that continues to be the case. I know only that the introduction of the two-bedrooms-and-less rule on 14 December resulted in all the advertisements for houses disappearing from the local press in my part of the world for around three or four weeks before Christmas. We got remarkably thin newspapers, which just shows how much the newspapers rely on people advertising houses. It may be that, apart from that, nothing has happened. However, we want to know what use HIPs are, what impact they are having and whether they are value for money. Those are questions to which we shall have to return.</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="080116110000007"></a>The energy performance certificates have had a wider degree of support around the House and certainly from the Liberal Democrats but, again, some serious research must be done on them once they have been around for a while to see whether they are making a difference. Are they resulting in more energy-efficient houses because people are investing in things to produce that? Such evidence might emerge in a couple of years&#146; time, but the Government must take responsibility for ensuring that the research takes place, and that is the basis of my second question.</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="080116110000008"></a>Here, we are discussing quite narrow amendment regulations to regularise what has been happening since 14 December and to extend what is known as the &#147;temporary first-day marketing provision&#148;&#151;a few people in the world will understand what that means&#151;to 1 June. What will happen if there is a need to extend that beyond 1 June? Will we have more amending legislation or will 1 June be an absolute back-stop? That is my third question.</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="080116110000009"></a>I turn to the temporary provision on leasehold information. Until 1 June, the leasehold documents, apart from the lease, will now be authorised, not required, documents because of the difficulty that people have had in getting this information quickly from landlords and leaseholders. Are the Government satisfied that by 1 June people will start to produce this information or that they will have had enough practice in the new system for it to work, or, again, will the date be extended beyond 1 June?</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="080116110000010"></a>The debate about HIPs goes far wider than these regulations, but the noble Lord rightly asked questions about how they were introduced and where we are going now. However, in the context of where we are now, our view is that the regulations are sensible. They  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1372"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1372</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are not fundamental and they are not unprincipled, and, even if we voted against them today, we would not want to see the system close down overnight&#151;it is too far advanced for that. If HIPs are to become a permanent feature, that is one thing but, if they are not to become permanent, a decision on them will have to be taken in a year or two or perhaps four or five in the light of experience. Therefore, we would not support the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, if he pushed this Prayer to a Division this evening, although we sympathise with a great deal of what he said.</p>

My noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith mentioned some of the problems with the energy performance certificate and although it is welcomed by a lot of people, I would remind the House that it is not a panacea. It is not going to solve the energy problems of housing. It might identify some but it does not provide a solution.</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="080116110000012"></a>HIPs is a very different issue, and that issue, among others, has led to this Government being the most disliked and distrusted when it comes to property matters, most particularly for the lack of consultation. Even the Communities and Local Government Select Committee in another place, which has just published its annual report for 2007, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_241"></a><a name="080116110000107"></a>&#147;CLG&#146;s failure to engage effectively early enough with stakeholders is both one of the principle reasons why HIPs were delayed and a further example of the Department&#146;s inability to build the relationships it needs if it is to succeed in taking partners with it across the whole range of policy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080116110000101"></a>It was absolutely crucial that the Government took the property industry with it. It clearly failed and that was a major mistake.</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="080116110000013"></a>What have been the effects of HIPs so far? With regard to speeding up the process, we have no evidence at all. In fact, we are building up quite a caseload of work imposed by the purchasers&#146; solicitors, asking for far more details in the searches and not accepting the vendors&#146; searches. Few buyers read HIPs or even ask for them. In our firm we have not had a single prospective purchaser even asking for a home information pack. I thought I had better widen the range, so I rang a number of estate agents around the country. I have not found one that has said a prospective purchaser has asked for a home information pack. One prospective purchaser asked for an EPC but none for a home information pack.</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="080116110000014"></a>There has been a reduction in the number of properties coming to the market. Whether this can be blamed entirely on HIPs is debatable and I am not going to make judgment at the moment, but it is sad at a time when we clearly need more housing. There is a reduction in land coming on the market for new build and there is also a reduction in new stock coming on the market. That is going to restrict mobility and changing jobs, and it is going to add to the general economic decline and depression that is beginning to affect us. In the research we have been doing&#151;and I have talked to other agents about this&#151;we have also found that no action is being taken on the EPC. People will look at the EPC but they have got their own ideas for the house. Very little action is being taken as a consequence of having that certificate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="080116110000015"></a>What are the consequences of these regulations? We come back to something that I have been stressing all the way through our discussions on home information packs and that is first-day marketing. I ask the Minister, please, to think again. In many cases, it is taking well over two weeks to get a home information pack. There are still delays and there are going to continue to be delays. Please do not distort the market any more by withdrawing the ability to market on the first day that one gets the instructions. It is a very important part of how the property market works and is used by so many agents, particularly in the south-east where the market tends to be bigger and stronger than elsewhere. To take that away would be really detrimental, and I mean that. It would be utterly detrimental. I ask the noble Baroness to think again and let us continue to market at day one. I know of no evidence of agents deliberately flouting HIPs, so could she just leave that provision? I again raise the point of my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith about the results for the pre-implementation trials of HIPs. It is quite wrong that the Government have not published these. It was a pity that the Liberal Democrat Party was taken in by the Government&#146;s promises on pre-implementation trials but the results should have been published by now.</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="080116110000016"></a>Let me quickly move on to the leasehold market. The plans for this are vague and the regulatory impact assessment is based on assumptions about consumer behaviour rather than evidence. One particular concern is that the impact assessment fails to take into consideration the carbon cost of preparing an EPC. Will a new EPC be required with every lease? If so, how does that comply with the rules from Brussels that tell us that an EPC is valid for 10 years? If you have to have an EPC only every 10 years, the letting market is being treated differently to the sales market. That leads to all sorts of further complications. What the Government still have not addressed with regard to letting is the problem of getting information out of managing agents. As far as the regulations are concerned, all one now needs to produce is the lease, but as from 1 June one is going to have to produce all the details and we are going to be back in the hands of managing agents who have no incentive at all to provide that information to vendors. That is going to mean a further delay in bringing property to the market. I hope the Minister will think on that again.</p>

They resent the fact that the consumer is getting a better deal via HIPs. This is a small part of the major drive by the Government both to improve the buying and selling of houses and to stimulate the housing market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="080116110000018"></a>I do not take kindly to people who are given evidence from the department and stand up here and ignore it in their debate. Last December, I wrote to the department  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1374"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1374</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and asked for an update on the HIPs saga. I was told by the department that an announcement which addressed the points was going to be made, and I got a copy of it. That information&#151;which is public information and I cannot believe that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, who is very good at his homework, is not in possession of it&#151;answers a number of queries. When we have previously debated this subject, one of the main arguments has been the inaccessibility or unavailability of qualified people to carry out the surveys. I was told in December that 5,794 people are now accredited to provide energy performance certificates. When the figure was 2,000 it was derided, but at that time the figure of 2,000 was adequate. As the programme has been rolled out with more and more properties from four-bedroom down to one-bedroom properties, more and more people are required. But the evidence is that they have not only been found and trained but also accredited as worthy of carrying out these inspections. I cannot understand the point that is being made.</p>

<a name="80116-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="080116110000019"></a>Another point made was about cost. We were told that HIPs would cost the consumer &#163;600. The figures I have from the department show that the cost has been between &#163;300 and &#163;350 over a period of six months. That was the figure that we were given nine months ago, and Members opposite should reflect on the cavalier way in which they are treating the information that is available to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="080116110000020"></a>I am told that HIPs are taking on average seven to 10 days to prepare. Either I can take the shaking of his head by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, whose professionalism I respect, or I can take the evidence from the department, which must be based on the information that it has. I am told that for the majority of property, drainage and water searches are being delivered within five days. If that is the position, it knocks skew-whiff the evidence that this is somehow a drag on these matters. Energy performance certificates are being prepared on average within two to four days. Let us be reasonable. The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, said that this will not be a panacea. It was never expected to be a panacea; it is a genuine attempt to deal with something that has been more than a niggle, not only for first-time buyers but for others. What was a cosy relationship&#151;one might call it a closed shop&#151;has now been impinged on by this new arrangement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="080116110000021"></a>As far as I am concerned, the consumer&#151;the person who is buying and selling&#151;is king, not the professionals involved. The consumer is very important and needs to be taken into account. I therefore say to the Government that I look to the evidence from the Europe Economics report, to which the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, referred. The report finds no evidence of any impact on transactions or prices, although there is a predicted short-term impact on new listings. You either accept the professional integrity of people who supply the department with evidence of how this is working or you do not. I happen to accept it. I congratulate the Minister, who, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has said, has invested a certain amount of personal endeavour in this matter from the very beginning, and her colleagues on sticking to their guns. The problem that they have sought to solve will not be solved overnight, or even for years,

I felt that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, were the mouthpiece of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. They did not like it, so the thing should be cancelled. HIPs are being blamed for the downturn in the housing market, based on anecdotal evidence. We were told that the Government need to agree this with the property industry. This is my interpretation. The property industry needs to engage with the Government. My understanding is that the Government tried very hard to engage with the property industry. Negotiations went on for some time, and in the end the property industry said, &#147;We don&#146;t like it&#148;.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="080116110000023"></a>My noble friend talked about the consumer. This is where we should start. I am told that having a HIP has stopped quite a few vendors, or so-called vendors, putting their house on the market and simply testing how much they will get for it. If they actually have to spend money on a HIP, they might think twice before doing that, which is not very good for people who want to buy it. The other thing is that if there are three or four people competing to buy a house or a flat, you could end up with three or four surveys of the same house or flat, which is great for the surveying industry but a complete waste of money. The HIP is a way out of this.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="080116110000024"></a>Ditto with the energy performance certificates, Yes, people might not want them, surveyors might not want to know about them, and they might not be perfect, but they will provide information to people who can then take action or not. I suggest that, as the price of gas, electricity and everything goes up, more and more purchasers, when taking the decision whether to buy, will welcome them as providing information so that they can decide whether they will buy a place, whether it needs more insulation and how much it will cost.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="080116110000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, seemed to like the idea of the energy performance certificates, but did not want them to be part of the home improvement pack. I do not know how one could become obligatory without the other.</p>

I believe that I have made the general salient points on earlier occasions. If the regulations are to be judged on the basis of whether the Government have produced a panacea for the massive problem that existed&#151;the gap between the agreement, or the meeting of the minds between two parties on a real property sale, and the exchange of a concluded contract&#151;the answer must clearly be no. They have not done so. Nor will they, and nor will any other government anywhere in the world, within the system of English law. They have tried hard. Their efforts go back some 10 years, and in so far as the home information pack and the energy performance certificate are concerned, they have tried honourably and properly to bring about some amelioration of the problem between purchaser and vendor. They have also brought about some amelioration of the environmental problems that this generation must face.</p>

<a name="080116110000029"></a><b><a name="80116-0014.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080116110000127"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> My Lords, the last time we debated HIPs, I began by saying how grateful I was for the opportunity to tell the House what progress we have been making. That was greeted by hollow laughter around the Chamber, but I can honestly say this evening that I am grateful for the opportunity that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, has created. We have a good story to tell and I want to bring the House up to date and to welcome members of a new cast. It is nice to see the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on the Front Bench&#151;I am grateful for his kind words&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith. I am also grateful for the support of my own Back-Benchers and for the welcome of other noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="080116110000030"></a>We have, over the past 18 months to two years, had an extended debate on home information packs. It has sometimes not been easy for the Government, but we have listened closely to what has been said. Noble Lords will know the unfolding narrative. We debated HIPs on a number of occasions last year, and noble Lords rightly asked us to keep their introduction and operation under close review. We have done just that. We particularly took into account the number of energy inspectors and how HIPs have been operating in the market. I will address some of those issues a little later.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="080116110000031"></a>I shall give a little chronology and say where we are. HIPs started to be rolled out on 1 August 2007, when we rolled them out to properties with four or more bedrooms. That was closely followed by the roll-out to properties with three bedrooms. On 14 December, we rolled them out to the remaining sizes of property, thus completing the process.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="080116110000032"></a>Over the past months, as HIPs have been introduced, we have been conscious at each stage of the need to take account of the responses of stakeholders. On the last occasion we debated HIPs, my noble friend asked  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1377"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1377</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>specifically that the dialogue with stakeholders should be kept open, especially while the scheme is being implemented. We have done just that, and indeed the very sensible transitional measures we are now bringing forward are informed by and reflect what stakeholders have said about how to improve the experience for the consumer and the industry operating in the marketplace.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="080116110000033"></a>The measures do two things. They further extend the temporary first day marketing period until 1 June 2008 and remove the requirement to obtain leasehold documents except the lease itself until the same date. During this period, we have commissioned further work to assess how leasehold documents can be most effectively provided. I shall come back to that point in the light of what has been said by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness. We believe that these measures will help consumers as HIPs continue to bed in.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="080116110000034"></a>The first measure means that for the next five months, until June, anyone looking to sell their home can do so immediately, provided that they have commissioned a home information pack and they expect it to arrive within 28 days. Why did we extend the transitional arrangement? We did so because of a later than expected commencement of the final stages of HIPs and in light of the need to produce guidance for local authorities dealing with access to and charging for search information. I can tell the House that the access and search guidance will be published this Friday, which will be helpful to everyone involved.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="080116110000035"></a>Of course there have been unexpected changes in the market, and I shall say more about that later, but we also received strong representations from stakeholders who have emphasised that an extension would greatly assist our joint objective of a smooth implementation. We have listened to what they had to say. We believe that this extra time benefits buyers, sellers, estate agents and solicitors as HIPs bed in and become part of the familiar landscape of buying and selling.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="080116110000036"></a>The second decision has been to remove the requirement to provide leasehold information other than the lease until June was also driven by what the industry told us would help, if HIPs are to be delivered smoothly and effectively. We had previously made changes to allow 28 days for the provision of leasehold documents, and that was based on earlier evidence from the area trials. But let me say that it has never been the case that we have been waiting for a final, cliffhanging result from those area trials. We have tried to use the information coming in to us over the past months to inform what we can as we change the processes, and thus the leasehold documents were given the extended period of 28 days.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="080116110000037"></a>However, uncertainty remains in the ability of the system to cope with the requirement for additional leasehold information upfront&#151;the sort of leasehold information set out in Schedule 5 to the original regulations. It became apparent that more information on the leasehold system was necessary if we were going to make it a more useful process. Early feedback from the industry showed us that while the lease could be produced at low cost without too much difficulty,  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1378"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1378</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>providing additional documents containing information about, for example, major works on the property was more likely to cause delays and hold up production of the packs. However, we have turned this into an opportunity. Having discovered that&#151;and to be frank, we were working on the basis of anecdotal evidence because there were virtually no systematic accounts in the field about this&#151;we have taken the opportunity to establish not just how we can overcome the problem, but what else we can do to provide leasehold information in other ways. To that end, we have commissioned Ted Beardsall, deputy chief executive of the Land Registry, who is a member of our Home Buying and Selling Stakeholder Panel&#151;which I am sure noble Lords will be delighted to know exists&#151;to advise us on what else can be done to improve the provision of leasehold information alongside further consideration of the search process. So this amendment allows time for that work to be undertaken and to inform the way that leasehold information is included in the pack. That is, I think, a very prudent step.</p>
<a name="time_21"></a>
<a name="80116-0014.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="080116110000117"></a>8.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="080116110000038"></a>Over the past six months we have been looking at a sensible, pragmatic and responsive process. What has happened is that between 1 August 2007 and 10 January 2008, we have seen 260,740 EPCs and 188,899 HIPs launched. I think that that is a very creditable result. The difference between the two figures is simply that in the beginning, because we were conscious that we had energy inspectors without work, local authorities got them to do EPCs for some council social housing.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="080116110000039"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, who I know is very committed to the energy and carbon reduction agenda, asked why we cannot go faster. From 1 October 2008, EPCs will be required, in addition to all residential property sales, for private and social rented properties upon a change of tenancy; and commencing 6 April this year, for the sale, lease and construction of commercial property. DEAs who already have their core skills will have the option of acquiring the extra skills needed to carry out non-domestic EPC work if they wish to do so. We are looking at an expansion of the volume of work into these other areas.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="080116110000040"></a>I am afraid that I cannot answer the question raised by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, about leasehold in relation to EPCs, but I am happy to make a commitment to write to him. We will discuss it in the department.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="080116110000041"></a>We know that the pragmatic approach has worked, not least because of our own monitoring, which is done in many different ways from regional monitoring to spot checks with estate agents at the local level. Information is coming to us from all directions. The sort of thing we have noted as it comes to the office is as follows; I quote from estate agent Tim Barton at Dreweatt Neate:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_242"></a><a name="080116110000108"></a>&#147;I can quote two cases already where the registered title element has revealed what could have caused major difficulties later on. In one the registered boundaries were significantly different from those told to us by the vendor and in the other the property was covered by restrictions the vendor was not aware of. HIPs are already proving their usefulness and two sales that might have hit the buffers later on have been put on the right track from the start&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1379"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1379</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="080116110000102"></a>That is exactly the sort of thing that we discussed in the abstract when trying to anticipate problems which can and do frustrate sales, generating much wastage in the system. Conveyancer Lisa Shenton of Irwin Mitchell said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_243"></a><a name="080116110000109"></a>&#147;The packs are designed to help people looking to purchase a property, and this latest announcement by the government brings more certainty for the market&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080116110000103"></a>That underlines how we are being asked for clarity and certainty all the time.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="080116110000042"></a>Obviously I have to address the comments of the Merits Committee. The noble Lord pointed out that there are still divergent views on HIPs, and the Merits Committee has rightly pointed to them. But I have to say that there is now far more understanding of and confidence in HIPs and the process around them that there was the last time we debated this issue. It is a measure of the fact that they are becoming a familiar part of the landscape and are bedding in.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="080116110000043"></a>Let me take this opportunity to address the issue raised by the area trials, because again it is something that the Merits Committee referred to. It is not true that the area trials have not been used to inform the development of HIPs, and I have to take issue with the noble Lord because it is not a question of not having dared to come forward with the evidence. We have always said that we will use the evidence wherever possible. But it was a measure of the protracted nature of the system that the average time needed for a home sale is over six months, and sometimes much longer. It was not until the end of last year that we had gathered a sufficient set of transactions to study in order to make proper judgments about it. Those are now with the independent researchers who are compiling the evidence. Believe me, we will bring it forward as soon as possible.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="080116110000044"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, is quite right: one of the issues we face is that we have discovered that many buyers are not seeing HIPs, and that this may come out at the area trials as well. There is no justification for it and I do not think it should be up to the buyer to have to prod and push and search for their HIP; it is for the estate agent to do so. He should be saying, &#147;Here is the HIP. This is what we may be able to make use of because it contains important and valuable information&#148;. I say that particularly because the regulations provide buyers with a legal right to rely on the information provided in the pack. We are therefore discussing with the National Association of Estate Agents what more can be done to increase awareness of the energy certificate. We have also responded to that discovery by committing to a systematic communications strategy, which is aimed at all of the people who should be making sure that HIPs are at the front of their mind, because of the valuable information that they bring forward. We want to start that campaign quickly; its essential message will be, &#147;If you&#146;re buying a home, make sure that you see the information pack&#148;.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="080116110000045"></a>I cannot resist saying that my noble friend has already done a magnificent job in looking at the evidence that has been brought forward that deals with some of the unproven and dire predictions. Many of those, which we heard not least in this House before  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1380"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1380</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>HIPs were introduced, have simply evaporated. I hope that this smooth rollout, given the volume of HIPs and EPCs, will help to put many minds at rest.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="080116110000046"></a>Before we rolled out, many said that there would be delays in putting packs together and that the process would come to a standstill. However, we have found exactly what my noble friend quoted in her figures. On average, HIPs are taking seven to 10 days to prepare; the majority of property, drainage and water searches are being delivered promptly within five days, while EPCs are being prepared on average within two to four days. The cost of a pack is not around &#163;1,000, as was hazarded previously; the average cost is &#163;300 to &#163;350.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="080116110000047"></a>I should spend a little more time on the impact on the market, given what was found in the research that we commissioned. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, has rightly focused on our now being in a different situation with the housing market than we were six months ago, let alone a year ago. Early on, in spring 2007, we commissioned authoritative and independent modelling from Europe Economics to show the likely impact of HIPs on the market. That research concluded that there was no evidence that there would be any impact on transactions or prices, although there was&#151;as my noble friend said&#151;a predicted short-term impact on new listings, as sellers changed the timings of their listings. The report concluded that this predicted impact on listings would be short-lived and that the impact would be marginal compared to the wider factors. We therefore rolled out to around 18 per cent of the market on 1 August, as I said, going up to 60 per cent of the market on 10 September.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="080116110000048"></a>By that time, however, as noble Lords know full well, market conditions had changed for a variety of reasons: the credit crunch, Northern Rock and so on. We decided that we then had to seek expert advice about the likely impact of roll-out, and therefore asked Europe Economics to look again at its research in the light of changing conditions&#151;in the knowledge that we had already started the process, and that there was evidence from real-time market conditions. We asked them to collaborate on that with Dr Peter Williams, of the National Housing and Planning Advice Unit&#151;a former deputy- general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, and a man with extremely practical and wide experience of the market&#151;to consider whether changing housing market conditions meant we should delay the roll-out. Its advice was that HIPs had had no impact on prices or transactions, and that changed market conditions would make no difference to that. It also said that there were strong arguments for rolling out as planned, and that further delay could cause greater uncertainty, which would be extremely unwelcome. This was clearly consistent with the advice that we were getting from others. Indeed, all of the sensible commentators who know the housing market well were clear that interest rates, house prices, stock market uncertainty and concerns about sub-prime lending are the significant factors determining behaviour in the housing market. The impact of HIPs is very minor compared with those. All of that was in our minds when we decided to roll out on 14 December.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="080116110000049"></a>I am coming to consider the benefits but, before I do so, I will answer the important question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves: &#147;What happens now?&#148; We have these transitional arrangements in place; the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, also raised a question there. We are guided by the realities, and we have tried to be extremely responsive. We certainly have better relationships with stakeholders than at the beginning. We are keeping them alongside us and all of the evidence points to a smooth rollout.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="080116110000050"></a>We must continue to monitor the market and to look closely at how the processes are working; we will make decisions on the back of the evidence. When I talk of clarity and certainty that is what we will aim for. We cannot, therefore, be categorical in predicting the future, but I do not expect any more transitional arrangements and we will be guided by what we find. </p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="080116110000051"></a>I turn, finally, to the benefits. HIPs have already cast a spotlight on areas of the home-buying and selling process that were in need of change. We have also seen knock-on benefits, including over 80 local authorities reducing their search costs by an average of &#163;30. From the feedback that we are getting, we have certainly seen consumers beginning to benefit from getting early information. I quoted just one example, but that is exactly why we want to make sure that buyers see the HIPs.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="080116110000052"></a>With the EPC being produced quickly, it means that consumers have access to important energy efficiency information, and the Energy Saving Trust has calculated that up to &#163;300 per year on energy bills can be saved. The next step is to ensure that consumers are aware of the assistance available to them for increasing the energy efficiency of their home. This is, of course, not a panacea, but it will take us toward a much more realistic understanding of what fuel costs and its impact.</p>

<a name="80116-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="080116110000053"></a>I will conclude by reflecting a little on the comments made by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, about speed. Estate agent Sam Chivers, of Barons Property Services, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_244"></a><a name="080116110000110"></a>&#147;The HIP has provided me with a great sales tool and without a shadow of doubt enabled purchasers to move much quicker to the point of exchange; now all they require is a mortgage offer and answers to any enquiries that their solicitor should raise, then they are ready! Gone are the days of eight, twelve or sixteen week transactions, welcome to the new era of four week exchange, it&#146;s real and it&#146;s here&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080116110000104"></a>We want that to be the experience of every estate agent, and everybody who buys and sells a home in future. I am grateful for the patience of your Lordships, since I have taken a long time to go through the details. I hope that noble Lords will feel fully informed about what we know; that is where we are with this policy now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="080116110000056"></a>I was fascinated that the noble Baroness, when she responded to my complaint about the lack of published information on the studies done on the preliminary trials, said that the Government were still studying that information. That says to me that they put the whole edifice in place before they had arrived at a conclusion about whether the trials had been as effective as they expected them to be. That may be a misinterpretation of the Minister&#146;s words&#151;if it is, I apologise&#151;but they are more or less the words that she used. So we have a difficulty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="080116110000057"></a>I was fascinated by the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. To use a little alliteration and a slight misinterpretation of his words, he said that the Act is flawed and the pack is flawed&#151;but, despite that, he finished up agreeing that the whole lot should go ahead. That seems a trifle inconsistent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="080116110000060"></a>I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Graham, that I did not mention any questions about the ability to provide qualified people, nor did I mention the question of costs. The provision of a home information pack is described to me by some people in the business as an earnings centre for the profession. Whether that is good or bad is neither here nor there, but it is certainly an unintended consequence, which is what I said it was.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="080116110000061"></a>I tried to produce a reasonably balanced picture of what is going on. However, it is very difficult to find a great deal of good, published information, but it is very easy to find adverse comment. This has been a useful debate. I am not quite sure what is happening in June because the noble Baroness said it would depend on the way in which the situation developed. If I understood her correctly, she left open the question of further regulation to delay the full implementation of HIPs. That means that we will almost certainly be back here on some other occasion, if not debating the issue in this form then in some other form. It has been a useful hour.

How reviews are to be carried out is not the issue. The number of local authorities it takes to trigger a review is specified in the Bill&#151;it says &#147;any one or more&#148;. The amendment would provide a safeguard against vexatious reviews.</p>

<a name="80116-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="080116110000068"></a>By their very nature, existing ITAs are collaborative bodies. These amendments would also ensure that the ITA was party to its own review.

We take the view that it makes sense for the Bill to allow maximum flexibility on who should carry out reviews. For instance, authorities in an area might choose to nominate a single authority to carry out a review on their behalf. Where an authority was abusing this flexibility by triggering reviews in the way that the noble Lord has considered, it would obviously be open for the Secretary of State to take serious note of that, both in deciding whether to issue a direction for a joint review under Clause 72 and in deciding whether any proposals for change which emerge from a review by a single authority should be implemented.</p>

<a name="80116-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="080116110000070"></a>Given the importance that integrated transport authorities would have as interested parties when a review of transport governance is carried out, it is only right that where reviews take place they ought to involve an element of self-reflection. The Secretary of State&#146;s guidance would be a useful tool in providing shapes, formats and ideas on how authorities should conduct reviews.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="080116110000071"></a>I do not think the amendment takes us any further.

This amendment would ensure local determination of whether an ITA should have non-elected members, the appointees and their status on the ITA. The amendment would clarify that any members nominated by bodies other than local councils must be appointed by the ITA. In effect, this would give the ITA a veto over the members nominated to it by non-constituent councils. This is required so that an ITA should be able to develop its own governance arrangements and to rule out any possibility of the imposition of non-elected members by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="080116110000082"></a>When this matter was discussed in Committee, noble Lords from all parties raised concerns on grounds of local determination. My noble friend the Minister sought to reassure them that the Government had no intention of imposing a particular membership on ITAs, and that the ITAs would be able to propose that there should be no non-elected ITA members if they so wished. That point did not necessarily engage directly with the explicit point of this amendment, which is that only the ITA should be able to appoint any non-elected member, thus guaranteeing local determination of ITA membership. That is what the amendment seeks to achieve, and I beg to move.</p>

Setting out in primary legislation the majority of the detail of how such authorities are established and how they work does not provide sufficient flexibility for different arrangements to be set up in different areas, or for these to develop as circumstances change. It is vital to incorporate the flexibility for the membership arrangements for an ITA to be determined in secondary legislation. Such legislation would, of course, be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure in your Lordships&#146; House and in another place.</p>

<a name="80116-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="080116110000086"></a>The arrangements for membership of an individual ITA&#151;which will be set out in an order&#151;would emanate from the governance scheme put forward by that area&#146;s local authorities under Clause 71 or Clause 72. That would be subject to widespread consultation. In essence, what can be achieved here is local determination, with a governance structure that comes up from the locality. Of course it is important for an ITA to be democratically accountable to the people in the area it represents. To ensure this, Clause 73(3) requires that a majority of an ITA&#146;s members would need to be elected councillors of those local authorities which fall within the ITA&#146;s area. What is more, if they considered that this was more appropriate, the authorities carrying out a review could choose to propose that the ITA&#146;s membership should remain comprised of local councillors only. There is that extra element built into it.</p>

<a name="80116-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="080116110000087"></a>It would be open to them to propose that representatives from other sectors should be members of the ITA. For instance, this could include representatives of business or the Highways Agency&#151;we have learnt today from the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, of the important value of relations between the Highways Agency and local authorities. We have heard from others today of the value of having Network Rail consulted, and it would be open to the ITA to have that sort of membership. Importantly, transport users, too, could be included. Each of those consultees could bring relevant, wider experience and expertise. The capacity for that exists. It is important to ensure that appointments follow proper procedures&#151;I do not think that anybody would demur from that. Therefore, where the secondary legislation relating to a particular ITA area provided that the ITA&#146;s membership should include one or more non-elected persons, it would also need to include provisions establishing how those representatives would be appointed.</p>

<a name="80116-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="080116110000088"></a>In the light of that, I hope that noble Lords will not press the amendment. We in good faith want to see the governance schemes directed from within the locality and responsive to local needs for the valuable interaction with a range of other bodies that can take place at that level, if that is what is required locally. The amendment would bring a measure of inflexibility to arrangements that perhaps need to be flexible to ensure wider representation, respecting, as we all do, the value of the majority democratic element.</p>

<a name="80116-0015.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="080116110000097"></a>The Bill already provides the flexibility for the boundaries of an existing or new ITA to be expanded to incorporate the territory of a non-metropolitan district without the need to include the whole of its parent county. However, while Clause 75 currently allows for the delegation of the functions of a county, unitary or metropolitan district council to an ITA or its successor body, it does not allow for the functions of a non-metropolitan district council to be delegated in this way.</p>

The Bill contains provision to allow authorities to vary their road pricing, depending on how charges are recorded, administered or paid. I can see that certain methods will be less costly, but our amendment seeks to ensure that any variation is justifiable and reasonable. I voice our argument again: we want to make certain that charges cannot coerce road payers into using one particular payment method solely to avoid paying what might be a penalty for using other methods.</p>

<a name="80116-0015.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="080116122000006"></a>The Minister seemed to well understand our intention to protect those road users unable to possess a bank account and allow their charge to be taken by direct debit. Obviously, if you have a bank account you can pay by direct debit. If you do not have one, you have to find other ways of paying a charge, particularly a general charge for everyone. This illustrates how certain groups might be unfairly disadvantaged by variable charging, and we want to pursue and have the Minister acknowledge these problems again.</p>

<a name="80116-0015.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="080116122000007"></a>However, of equal importance is the consideration that has to be given to those road users unwilling, even if they are able, to set up a direct debit or whatever is their preferred method of payment. The extra charges that they might have to pay by not having a direct debit might be considered a penalty rather than a disincentive.</p>

<a name="80116-0015.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="080116122000008"></a>An analogous situation can be found in the mobile phone operator market, where the industry has been criticised for practices such as charging up to &#163;5 extra for non-direct debit payments. It is inconceivable that this can be justified in any kind of road-charging schemes. Furthermore, some customers might not wholly trust the direct debit system. Recent reports have highlighted how incorrect amounts can be taken via the system and not refunded properly in accordance with the direct debit guarantee. Some people have even had funds taken from accounts following cancellation of direct debits.</p>

<a name="80116-0015.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="080116122000009"></a>We have heard throughout the discussions on this Bill that the Minister is keen on including matters in guidance. I contend that variable charging is such an important problem that it should be considered in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="080116122000010"></a><b><a name="80116-0015.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="080116122000197"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his explanation, but I do not think I can agree with the conclusion that he draws from his own amendment. Let us just go through this carefully. Clause 100 amends Section 171(5) of the Transport Act 2000 by adding a further example of how an authority can vary its road-user charges. The clause makes clear that local authorities can offer different charges for different methods or means of recording, administering, collecting or paying the charge. This is not an exhaustive list. Local authorities are of course free to impose different charges for different cases.</p>

<a name="80116-0015.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="080116122000011"></a>The amendment seeks to clarify the clause by adding that any variations should be &#147;reasonable&#148;. On the face of it that does not seem a bad notion, but it is important that local authorities have the opportunity to provide incentives to encourage the use of efficient payment methods. I am still trying to imagine what I would do if I were the county treasurer in Essex County Council. I would probably be encouraging the leader of my local authority to do exactly that. If I did not have the courage to encourage the leader of my local authority to do exactly that, I would probably not be fulfilling my job as the council as a whole envisaged it. It is clearly very important that local authorities use the most efficient and effective means of collecting charges for particular services. Local authority officers have a duty to do that. We are simply trying to enable them to better fulfil their responsibility. It is all about conforming properly with your local fiduciary duty. The Bill as it is assists that process.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="080116122000012"></a>We have also set out clearly in our guidance to those authorities bidding for money from the transport innovation fund that we expect schemes to accept debit card and cash payment as a minimum. We are clear that providing users the option of cash payments to accompany declarations is necessary for social inclusion and privacy reasons. We have been clear throughout the various sittings on the Bill that we believe local authorities are best placed to make a judgment about decisions on how best to administer their local scheme. I am sure the noble Lord will agree with that. We therefore have no reason to think that local authorities will not act reasonably in this decision, as in all decisions about their road pricing schemes.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a><a name="080116122000013"></a>Local authorities already offer different payment methods for their services. They are also obliged to ensure that in developing their proposals they recognise the impact they could have on all groups. If their decision were unreasonable or irrational with regard to any particular group or category of local residents, then&#151;as the noble Lord well knows&#151;they would already be at risk of challenge in the courts without the need for additional clarification in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a><a name="080116122000014"></a>We are trying to help to encourage best practice. The noble Lord will be aware that some methods of collecting charges and fees are more efficient than others. We wish to encourage local authorities in that regard. We give them the local flexibility to determine the best possible payment methods and offer a range of opportunities and options to their customers.</p>

I am the leader of a large local authority and we have lots of methods of payment. Though there are plenty of options, such as direct debits and credit cards, unfortunately a lot of people do not use&#151;or do not wish to use&#151;those facilities. We have literally thousands of very small debts because people do not have those facilities. I do not envisage road charging going into rural areas, but if it did some rural communities might not want to use the methods of payment that we would like.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="080116122000016"></a>In the amendment I was trying to clarify what the Government think. As the Minister says, it is up to the local authority to decide. His comments indicate that they would not expect local authorities always to find the most convenient way of paying. They would have to find the payment method that suited the community that they represented. If it is left to local authorities, I agree with the Minister that they will try and find a way suitable for the community they represent. Perhaps I have clarified more in my answer than I did in my question. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="080116122000019"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, we return to the issue of the London low-emission zone. I moved this amendment in Committee. My objective is to exempt certain very low-population and low-usage vehicles from the LEZ. Vehicles concerned are in the taxation class of recovery vehicle, special vehicle and private heavy goods vehicle. In Committee I explained some of the technical problems and risks associated with recovery vehicles coming into the LEZ. I also drew the Committee&#146;s attention to special vehicles. Both these classes of vehicle tend to be mounted with specialist engineering equipment which is often more valuable than the basic vehicle chassis. That will be a problem area, but I do not intend to weary your Lordships with it tonight.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="080116122000020"></a>My real concern lies with private heavy goods vehicles, which fall into two categories: relatively modern vehicles used privately&#151;horse-boxes are a good example&#151;and preserved classic commercial vehicles. Both categories of vehicle cover low mileage. I declare an interest here as I own one heavy vehicle that will be in the scope of the LEZ. It is technically a very interesting vehicle&#151;indeed, it appeared in <I>Heritage Commercials</I> magazine only last month&#151;but it will not be appearing in London again. Because it is post-1973 it attracts a charge of &#163;200 per day to enter the LEZ and a non-compliance penalty of &#163;1,000. However, the vehicle excise duty is  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1390"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1390</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>only &#163;165 and the insurance cost is similar. The reason for that is that such vehicles cover very low mileages. I remind the House that I am the patron of the Road Rescue Recovery Association.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="080116122000021"></a>I think it is vital to preserve our heritage, and I believe the Minister does too. However, it will not be practical to have a preserved lorry in London if it was built after 1973 since, as I have explained, the LEZ charges are so high. In reality this is a ban, and retrospective. We rarely enact retrospective legislation, and when we do it is because of the overriding public interest.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="080116122000022"></a>In Committee the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, claimed that emissions per kilometre were the same for a preserved vehicle as for a modern one. I pointed out that a preserved vehicle&#146;s emissions may actually be a bit higher but preserved vehicles cover very low mileage, evidenced by the low insurance premiums. Thus, although preserved vehicles may not be very green, I believe they will have no measurable effect on London&#146;s air quality.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a><a name="080116122000023"></a>Incidentally, I take it that by the end of February this year&#151;bearing in mind that the LEZ starts around 5 February&#151;air quality in London will immediately and measurably improve. If not, surely there is something wrong with the policy of the LEZ. Is the Minister confident that the LEZ will have an immediate and beneficial effect in sympathy with each stage of the scheme&#146;s implementation?</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a><a name="080116122000024"></a>Another problem is this: if a preserved-vehicle enthusiast finds that he cannot use his reasonably modern and green lorry in London&#151;say a vehicle built in 1980&#151;surely he will sell that vehicle and buy a pre-1973 lorry that is not in the scope of the LEZ but was built when the manufacturers were happy if their vehicles would only not smoke too much. What a perverse result. In my case, if I cannot use my 1981 vehicle in London I will use my 1955 vehicle, built at a time when manufacturers did not really know what pollution was.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a><a name="080116122000025"></a>What are my objectives today? The Minister will no doubt be supporting the LEZ as its underlying objectives are desirable. I would like him to agree with me that central government, in the form of the Secretary of State, has the power to exempt certain classes of vehicles from the LEZ&#151;but she chooses not to use it. The Minister cannot just transfer all the political responsibility to the mayor. Of course, he may be able to delight me with his response today but, if not, I hope he can answer my question about whether the Secretary of State has the power to exempt certain classes of vehicle from the LEZ. I beg to move.</p>

My colleague, the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, dealt with this issue earlier. I will run through some of the arguments deployed then, and try to answer the noble Lord&#146;s question.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a><a name="080116122000027"></a>As was explained, the London low-emission zone is the responsibility of the Mayor. As such, it is being taken forward by Transport for London on his behalf. The aim of the scheme, which the noble Earl agrees is  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1391"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1391</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>laudable, is to improve air quality for those living in, working in and visiting London. It will help London and the UK to move closer to achieving national and EU air quality targets by deterring the most individually polluting vehicles from driving into the low-emission zone. The Government support that overall objective.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a><a name="080116122000028"></a>The exemptions requested by this amendment would potentially erode the benefits that the low-emission zone seeks to achieve. The noble Lord himself admitted that some of these vehicles emit more than others because of their age. It is for that reason that the proposal has these restrictions on it, and that is why there is a limited range of exemptions. When the zone goes live on 4 February this year, heavier diesel-engine lorries will be required to comply with a Euro III emissions standard for particulate matter if they are to drive within the LEZ without charge. Buses and coaches are required to comply with the standard from July 2008. The Government believe that the detailed design of local road-charging schemes is best decided at local level, and London authorities already have the power to exempt from charging schemes those vehicles that they deem appropriate.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a><a name="080116122000029"></a>TfL carried out two periods of public consultation on the LEZ. The first public and stakeholder consultation was on the principle, and was carried out from 30 January to 24 April 2006. Almost 9,000 representations were received. The second period of public and stakeholder consultation was carried out between 13 November 2006 and 2 February 2007 on the more detailed proposals for the London LEZ, as set out in the scheme order. In total, roughly 8,000 representations were received.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a><a name="080116122000030"></a>The issue about the vehicles that the noble Lord referred to was raised during that consultation, perhaps even by the noble Lord himself. TfL published a response to the consultation, and detailed answers to these points can be found in theme E and theme K of chapter 6 of that document on TfL&#146;s website. Transport for London tell us that, broadly speaking, exemptions were not considered appropriate because there are no technical reasons why these vehicles cannot be modified to comply with the scheme, and because these vehicles have similar emission characteristics to the HGVs and LGVs from which they are derived. As with all charging schemes, we believe that TfL will keep the scheme under review, as it is obliged to, really, and make any appropriate amendments to scheme design if and when they are required.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a><a name="080116122000031"></a>The noble Earl taxes me with a precise question and I will give him an answer. He asks whether the Secretary of State can exempt a group of vehicles from the London low-emission zone. The answer, simply, is yes. Schedule 23(11) of the Greater London Authority Act 1999, which is about road-user charging, says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_254"></a><a name="080116122000157"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision for or in connection with&#151;</p>

<p><a name="080116122000138"></a>Schedule 24(1)(3) states that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_259"></a><a name="080116122000162"></a>&#147;a class of motor vehicles is a reference to a class defined or described by reference to any characteristics of the motor vehicles or to any other circumstances whatsoever&#148;.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="080116122000032"></a>In Section 420 of the same Act the power to make regulations includes a power to make different provision for different cases. That probably provides the noble Earl with an answer. I hope it provides him with an assurance that the Secretary of State has all the relevant powers needed in the Greater London Authority Act to exempt a group of vehicles from any road-pricing charge in London.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="080116122000033"></a>Of course it is then open to make a decision about whether to carry through that exemption. Obviously it needs to be carefully borne in mind what any exemption might do to undermine the effect of the LEZ. As the noble Earl said, we all share that common concern to improve air quality, and the LEZ is a very important way of achieving it. The noble Earl makes his particular case for his particular type of vehicle. To a degree it is a bit of special pleading, but it is understandable and it represents a wider interest. I am grateful for his raising the issue in the way that he has.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="080116122000042"></a>I have been around a long while in local government. Governments of all parties like to find ways of restricting their expenditure to local government. I can see that this is a marvellous opportunity for Governments to say in the future that local government should raise &#163;100 million from road charging and so we will deduct &#163;100 million from the transport grants we give them this year. We see that sort of thing happening with efficiency savings and every other thing that the Government have a policy on. They generally deduct funding from the whole revenue support grant, capital grants or whatever is given to local government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_428"></a><a name="080116122000043"></a>The amendment is designed to try to get a promise from the Government that they are not going to do that with road-pricing schemes. They are putting the political problem to local government. There is not, as was said earlier today, a national enthusiasm for road-pricing schemes. I was reading some research yesterday that the public really want to see that road-pricing schemes would improve transport infrastructure and transport generally and not be another tax on using roads and so on, given they feel that they pay enough tax already through their petrol tax, car duty and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_429"></a><a name="080116122000044"></a>We see this as a repeat of what happens with efficiency savings and other things, with any Government, perhaps in the future, saying, &#147;You could have raised &#163;50 million, or &#163;100 million on road schemes and we will penalise you for it&#148;. I would like the noble Lord to give a commitment from the Government that that will not be the case. If road charging and road schemes are put in by local authorities the revenue could be used by that local authority for improvement of transport systems. That could be for bus schemes or all sorts of things. It would improve the public&#146;s perception of road pricing rather than just being another sort of tax. I beg to move.</p>

That is an important aspect both of an authority&#146;s business case and of the calculation of the scheme&#146;s value for money. As noble Lords will be aware, allocations of block capital funding and revenue support grant for local authorities are currently distributed on the basis of broad formulae intended to reflect need and in the case of revenue support grant the ability to raise council tax revenues. Such formulae do not generally take into account the other various sources of revenue available to local authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_434"></a><a name="080116122000052"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we now switch to the Welsh scene. My Amendments Nos. 119B and 119C refer to a major central argument between ourselves and the Government. I have some more points to make that I hope that the noble Baroness will either give in on or at least take away and do a little more research on. Let me remind your Lordships that the Assembly in Wales was devolved and set up with no tax-raising powers. That was the wish of the electorate of Wales and the wish of the Government as we understand it. We believe that the road charge for Wales in the way that it is laid out in the Bill is in fact a tax. If it is a tax it should not be in your Lordships&#146; House because no tax-raising powers are yet devolved to the Welsh Assembly.</p>

<a name="80116-0016.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a><a name="080116122000053"></a>There is an ongoing law case between the American Embassy and the Government about C-charges in London: whether they are a tax, which the Americans claim, and therefore they should not be paying it; or whether they are some form of levy. It seems to us, having carried out a certain amount of research, that if it is not to be a tax, but a local charge or a levy, the particular charge must be tightly circumscribed so that the reasons for it and the way in which the money raised will be spent are quite specific. The Bill originally was set out, I understand, to help to pay for some alterations and improvements to the M4 into Wales. Indeed, the Secretary of State in another place said that the aim is to,</p>
<ul><a name="080116122000184"></a>&#147;provide very limited powers over trunk roads, and not all roads in Wales, so that the Assembly Government can bring in congestion charges or provide for road tolling, which might be the only way of financing the M4 relief road&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080116122000139"></a>That is not totally specific, but I would not expect the Secretary of State to be that clear. There is a little bit of wriggle in there. However, the Bill clearly states on page 84 that there is provision for:</p>
<ul><a name="080116122000185"></a>&#147;the application of the proceeds of charges imposed under such schemes&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="080116122000140"></a>referred to earlier in the clause&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="080116122000186"></a>&#147;towards purposes relating to transport&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080116122000141"></a>There is nothing specific in that&#151;it is about as general as it can be. That is our point and I have to ask the noble Baroness to go away, if she cannot concede the point today, and either come back with some new wording as a government amendment, which I would be delighted to see, that clearly circumscribes the purpose in the Bill to raise a levy to help fund

I am disappointed in the noble Lord because I tried to offer him a piece of gentle advice in Grand Committee&#151;that he should reflect on this matter and consult with his Conservative colleagues in the National Assembly. Therefore, I have to spell out in more precise terms what I was trying to allude to in a gentler manner during our earlier discussions.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80116-0017.htm"/>


<a name="80116-0017.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a><a name="080116122000055"></a>There is exhibited this evening a massive contradiction on the Conservative Front Bench. On the previous amendment, we heard his noble friend argue that charging by local authorities in, I presume, England should be for transport purposes and that this was the attraction of such charges. He mentioned a series of broad transport spending decisions that could make charging acceptable. As an example, he quoted the very successful congestion charge scheme in London. Yet, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, is denying to Welsh Ministers what his noble friend is willing to grant to English local authorities. Surely, the Conservative Party needs to develop some consistency on these matters.</p>

<a name="80116-0017.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a><a name="080116122000056"></a>The noble Lord is seeking to limit spending on transport to trunk roads and, in Amendment No. 119D, to stop the onward march of devolution. I would ask him to reflect: is this now Conservative policy? I have followed the development of his arguments from his speech on Second Reading on 20 November, where I detected a difference of emphasis between the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, who took a balanced view of devolution, its progress and the implementation of the 2006 Act, and this crusade against framework powers. As a practitioner and student of devolution for some 35 years, it fascinates me to know where this is coming from. Is it now Conservative Party policy in Westminster, Cardiff and anywhere else that no powers are to be granted to the National Assembly for Wales by the framework powers route? If that is the case, it is absolutely contrary to what was set out in June 2005 in the original White Paper of the then Labour Government, <I>Better Governance for Wales</I>, which said that the Government intend to draft,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_263"></a><a name="080116122000166"></a>&#147;parliamentary bills in a way that gives the Assembly wider and more permissive powers to determine the detail of how the provision should be implemented in Wales&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080116122000143"></a>That was stated in the White Paper and it has been the settled, understood view of Welsh Conservatives, and of any other Conservatives who take an interest in devolution&#151;that it is appropriate for both these routes to be pursued.</p>

<a name="80116-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a><a name="080116122000057"></a>In Grand Committee the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, deployed three arguments to demonstrate why this should not be the case. First, he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_264"></a><a name="080116122000167"></a>&#147;Broadly speaking, we disapprove of this process for three reasons: first, a provision on Wales in a broader Bill may not be adequately scrutinised&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1396"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1396</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="080116122000144"></a>Well, what have we been doing? His speech on Second Reading, the discussion in Grand Committee and our debate this evening are fine examples of scrutiny by Parliament and of framework powers. I am sure that the House of Commons can match that when this Bill appears in the other place. He goes on to say that these framework powers involve,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_265"></a><a name="080116122000168"></a>&#147;the transfer of powers that the Assembly has not requested&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080116122000145"></a>I will not tell the noble Lord that he is misleading the House as that would be out of order, but it is the next best thing to it. These powers have been requested by Welsh Ministers&#151;in fact, by my honourable friend in another place, Ieuan Wyn Jones, the distinguished Deputy First Minister and Minister for Economy and Transport. It has been requested by him, because he is the Deputy First Minister of a Cabinet that has the support of two-thirds of the Assembly. By any democratic calculation that I make, that has been requested by Welsh Ministers with the support of the Assembly.</p>

<a name="80116-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a><a name="080116122000058"></a>In his third argument the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, states that,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_266"></a><a name="080116122000169"></a>&#147;we suspect a trend in which departments transfer competence rather than draft legislation applicable to Wales&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/12/07; col. GC 249.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080116122000146"></a>That is the worst one of the lot. We are giving the National Assembly for Wales the opportunity, in the measure-making powers that will derive from this primary UK legislation, to make a measure. That measure is the equivalent of an Act of Parliament; it is the legislative process that the constitution of Wales 2006 has before it. That process has not been made up by Welsh nationalists, or even by devolutionists in the Labour Party&#151;it is the constitution of the United Kingdom, as devolved to Wales. It is the constitution agreed by this House.</p>

<a name="80116-0017.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a><a name="080116122000059"></a>In these amendments, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, is being a little disingenuous with the constitutional settlement that we have before us. Further, he is also undermining the capacity of Welsh Ministers to carry out their statutory duty. Under Section 79 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 there is an obligation on Welsh Ministers to develop a &#147;sustainable development scheme&#148;. Clearly, because transport spending is a major part of sustainable development, how can Ministers develop a proper sustainable development scheme if they do not have the powers relating to transport?</p>

<a name="80116-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a><a name="080116122000060"></a>By moving an amendment which seeks to leave out Clause 110 completely, the noble Lord is undermining the whole notion of framework powers. Is this now Conservative Front-Bench policy in the House of Lords? Is he going to be getting up whenever there are framework powers in this present Session&#151;there are two more and no doubt there will be many more&#151;and depose each one? Or is he picking just one because it suits his party political propaganda somewhere else? I have to warn him that he is in danger of embarrassing his own colleagues in Wales. When he visits the Assembly, where he will be very welcome, I hope that he will discuss frankly with his Conservatives colleagues what his function and role are in this place and that he might seek to reflect on the fine public career of that great closet devolutionist, the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy.</p>

I start by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, for his contribution and for helping me a great deal. I have a very long speaking note on the Government&#146;s commitment to the Government of Wales Act, the promotion of framework powers, legislative competency orders and the whole philosophy and debate around that. With his eloquent disposition of the success and importance of the devolution settlement, the noble Lord has saved me a very important job.</p>

<a name="80116-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a><a name="080116122000062"></a>I shall confine my remarks specifically to the amendments before us. I hope very much that I shall be able to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, that we are not talking about a framework power that contradicts the Government of Wales Act and that this is not in any way about injecting a tax-raising power through the back door or through illegal or ultra vires means. By doing that, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="80116-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a><a name="080116122000063"></a>I have been given a very clear note from the Box which answers the question whether this provision is about imposing a tax. It states clearly that the application of proceeds does not affect whether something is a tax or a charge. That depends on the link between the payment and the service received by the payer. Whether or not a charge or a tax is hypothecated&#151;that is, whether it is limited to a particular purpose by the receiving authority&#151;is not the issue; it is a question of whether a service is received by the payer. I hope that that addresses the question of whether we are talking about a tax here.</p>

<a name="80116-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a><a name="080116122000064"></a>Specifically with regard to Amendment No. 119B, paragraph (b) of the provision inserted by Clause 110 allows the Welsh Assembly to make provision in Assembly measures in relation to how the revenue from a trunk road charging scheme in Wales is spent, so long as it is,</p>
<ul><a name="080116122000187"></a>&#147;towards purposes relating to transport&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080116122000147"></a>The advice that I have is that that is pretty clear. We talked about this matter in Committee and I shall come to it in a moment but, as we have said, these powers do not constitute a tax and this provision does not confer tax-raising powers on the Welsh Assembly. The Government of Wales Act does not allow the transfer of tax-raising powers to the Welsh Assembly. We are clear that these powers refer to a road user charge. There is no field in Schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act that would allow for legislative competence for tax-raising powers. Such powers are outside the devolution settlement. I believe that it is wrong for us to continue debating this question because the proposed framework is very clear&#151;we are not talking about changing the settlement.</p>

<a name="80116-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a><a name="080116122000065"></a>We think it is right that if the Welsh Assembly has the competence to make a trunk road charging scheme, it should have the competence to decide how the money is spent in relation to transport purposes. As I said in Committee, Welsh Ministers have yet to decide what role, if any, road charging will play in addressing current and future transport challenges. Therefore, with regard to the noble Lord&#146;s concerns about the  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1398"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1398</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>potential scheme being set up to deal with a particular problem in a particular location, I can reassure him that Welsh Ministers have yet to decide what role they wish this to play. However, they wish to have the powers available to allow them to adopt a coherent approach towards any road pricing proposals that local authorities in Wales may bring forward or towards any future UK scheme.</p>

<a name="80116-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a><a name="080116122000066"></a>The Welsh Ministers have also made it clear that if they were to introduce road pricing, it would be targeted on those parts of the trunk road network with the worst congestion problems. It would be important for Welsh Ministers to be able to construct a package of measures around the charging scheme which could include improvements to complementary transport provision, including trains and buses, as well as improvements to the road infrastructure, which I know the noble Lord was concerned about. It is important that the Welsh Assembly is able to spend the revenue from such a scheme in developing any complementary transport measures that are needed for it to work effectively. I hope that gives the noble Lord some reassurance on his concerns about the tightness of that clause.</p>

<a name="80116-0017.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a><a name="080116122000067"></a>On Amendment No. 119C, Clause 110, as currently drafted, would allow for the revenue from a trunk road charging scheme in Wales to be put towards the purposes relating to transport. This restriction strikes the right balance, allowing for the revenue to be spent on any necessary complementary transport measures to a pricing scheme, while not being so broad&#151;which I know the noble Lord was concerned about&#151;as to allow for frivolous uses, for example the question of Welsh Ministers&#146; cars. We talked about that in detail in Committee. Restricting spending to trunk roads, as Amendment No. 119C would do, would not allow for any improvements on local roads feeding into the trunk roads within a pricing scheme or, more broadly, for investment in alternative modes of transport or other important improvements. As I said in relation to the previous amendment, road pricing should be seen as a package of measures tackling congestion problems alongside investment in transport improvements, both roads and otherwise. This amendment would severely limit the effectiveness of such a strategy as it would not facilitate those complementary improvements.</p>

<a name="80116-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a><a name="080116122000068"></a>I will speak briefly to Clause 110 as a whole. As explained in Committee, the clause inserts new matter into Schedule 5 of the 2006 Act to allow the Assembly to make its own legislation. The noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, explained why it is so important that we allow this measure-making to go ahead. Trunk roads comprise the network of strategic roads managed by Welsh Ministers which account for around 5 per cent of roads in Wales by length. It would be for the Assembly to consider whether it would be appropriate to exercise those powers and if so, how. I hope noble Lords have had a chance to read the Explanatory Memorandum that was published alongside the Bill. Copies are in the Library. A great deal of thought has been put in to how to make these new legislative processes accessible to Peers so they can fully understand the thinking behind the framework powers and legislative competence orders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_449"></a><a name="080116122000069"></a>The arguments I raised previously in relation to specific taxation and revenue issues are also important to remember when discussing the provision as a whole. The provision states that the Welsh Assembly Government must require any revenue raised by a trunk road charging scheme to be spent, as we have heard, on transport. The revenue would be used for the provision of transport infrastructure services in Wales to help develop the transport network in line with the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s transport policies and programmes, which are at a very advanced level of development. We look forward to a very important publication of the transport strategy soon.</p>

<a name="80116-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a><a name="080116122000070"></a>Trunk road charges are already within the legislative competence of the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly. We are not creating a new precedent; we are simply following the path set out by the devolution settlement in the Government of Wales Act. I hope that I have been able to give the noble Lord some reassurances. He mentioned that he had undertaken some research which I not aware of, and I would be happy to discuss any new information that he has or to meet him further to discuss the practicalities of how the clause is intended to work. If there is any further information that I can offer, I am happy to do so, but the Government are committed to making the Government of Wales Act, the framework powers and the LCOs a success. We believe that the devolution settlement is a great success in Wales, and I hope that, with those remarks, the noble Lord will consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

It is very important that we recognise that the Government of Wales Act does not give the Welsh Assembly tax-raising powers. It is an agreed part of the devolution settlement, and it would be a great shame for us to be seen to be unpicking that now. What the Assembly is asking for is quite reasonable, and if there is any misunderstanding that I can clear up or further work that I can do to help to clarify the situation, I would be pleased to do it. I have tried hard to give a definition of what we see as a tax and make it clear that we are not talking about tax-raising powers under this legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_455"></a><a name="080116122000080"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 119F and 119G. They refer to a different subject about which we have concerns, and that is the extent to which the Bill presently facilitates the sharing of personal data with inadequate protection of that information. The clause is quite cumbersome to read as it rolls through onto page 85. Clause 111 is basically intended to facilitate data sharing. Clearly, if the scheme is to operate well, it will be necessary for the DVLA to provide data on the registered keeper of a vehicle or vehicles. But the clause goes further by allowing local authorities and statutory bodies to provide information on drivers to Welsh Ministers. Perhaps the Minister could indicate what sort of information the Government have in mind. The clause provides for Ministers to charge the Welsh Assembly a fee for supplying data, but does not provide the same for local authorities or statutory bodies in order to cover their costs. Can the noble Baroness explain why the Government are giving themselves the power to recoup their costs, but not local authorities. This scheme should not become a burden on local authorities, and our amendment seeks to ensure that local authorities which provide information are able to charge a fee for doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_456"></a><a name="080116122000081"></a>Amendment No. 119E would replace the current wording of Clause 111(3) by deleting paragraphs (a) and (b) and replacing them with,</p>
<ul><a name="080116122000188"></a>&#147;may not be disclosed by the person to whom it is disclosed under subsection (2) otherwise than for or in connection with the scheme&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080116122000149"></a>This would ensure that data transferred to Welsh Ministers in relation to the scheme could not be transferred other than to those with whom the Ministers had entered into arrangements.</p>

<a name="80116-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a><a name="080116122000082"></a>In our view, the provisions to share information go too far. The legislation envisages that the Assembly might employ a contractor to run a road pricing scheme. We would certainly endorse that, and it is therefore necessary that the Assembly should be able to make data it receives available to its contractors. However, Clause 111 would allow these contractors to pass the data on to yet others. Recent events have shown the importance of retaining control over personal data. Our amendment would limit the transfer of data to those who had contracted directly with the Assembly. I suggest that without this containment when dealing with contractors and so on, the Assembly or those in charge might find themselves in quite a mess.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_458"></a><a name="080116122000083"></a>Amendment No. 119G adds a new subsection to the clause:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="080116122000150"></a>This ensures that the Bill does not allow transfers of data in contravention of the data protection principles. One would hope that the Assembly would insist on high standards of protection for personal data disclosed under this scheme. However, it is important that this Bill does not allow for greater transfer than is strictly necessary or which risks wrongful disclosure. It should not be possible for the Bill to be the statutory authority for any wrongful transfer, loss or disclosure of data. The amendment would ensure that any data transfers would be subject to the protection of the 1988 Act.</p>

As the noble Lord indicated, Clause 111(2) allows information that the Welsh Ministers receive in connection with their charging scheme to be passed on,</p>
<ul><a name="080116122000189"></a>&#147;to any person with whom the Welsh Ministers have entered into charging scheme arrangements&#148;.</ul>

<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1402"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1402</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not necessarily directly employed by the scheme owner; they should have access to the information necessary to run the scheme effectively. I also reiterate the important safeguard that this information can only be disclosed to people for or in connection with the road charging scheme. All disclosure of information would have to be in accordance with existing legislation; as the noble Lord highlighted, that includes the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

<a name="80116-0017.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a><a name="080116122000087"></a>On Amendment No. 119F, Clause 111(4) allows the Secretary of State to charge a reasonable fee for supplying information to the Welsh Ministers. The noble Lord raised an important question there; the provision has been included because of the particular role of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. The information that it holds on driver and vehicle registration is needed to properly cost and model road pricing schemes before they are implemented and to ensure that the enforcement process can work effectively. If such a scheme were to come into existence, it would actually be an ongoing service that the DVLA would need to provide. As such, I am sure that noble Lords can understand that the DVLA would need to be in a position to make a charge for that.</p>

<a name="80116-0017.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a><a name="080116122000088"></a>If the DVLA supplies that information to the Welsh Ministers, it is reasonable to expect those Ministers to contribute to the administrative costs of providing such information. The DVLA will incur costs both in connection with the initial set-up and the subsequent operation of the scheme, which the Welsh Ministers could take into account when developing the business case for any trunk road pricing scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_463"></a><a name="080116122000089"></a>The noble Lord asked about local authorities. It is certainly the policy intention behind the drafting of this Bill that, where local authorities and the Welsh Assembly work in partnership, such information-sharing as was going on would be mutual. There would be mutual costs either way, so the intention to create a power in the Bill is not a duty. The Secretary of State does not have to provide this information, but the Bill makes it possible so that the DVLA would not be put in an impossible position by a potential scheme in providing a service whose costs it could not cover.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a><a name="080116122000090"></a>The Government have a clear strategy on road charging, and respecting privacy is a central consideration of that; I turn, therefore, to Amendment No. 119G. The Government have published guidance to local authorities bidding for transport innovation fund money that sets out our approach to data protection. Within that guidance, we state that local authorities must ensure that information is gathered and managed respecting the Data Protection Act&#151;that is absolutely vital. The Welsh Assembly Government must also comply with the Data Protection Act, and we see no reason why a scheme of theirs would be outside the confines of that Act. Therefore, the Data Protection Act&#146;s principles as set out in Schedule 1 will apply to the processing of personal data in accordance with Clause 111.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_468"></a><a name="080116122000096"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is the same as the one I moved in Committee. As I said to the Minister after his reply giving his reasons for not accepting it, there is a point to the amendment. There is a class of disabled people for whom using the car is not optional. In particular, blue badge holders cannot be expected not to use their cars for journeys of less than a mile, nor is it likely that they will readily be able to use public transport as an alternative. Blind and partially-sighted people are not drivers themselves, have considerably restricted mobility and may be similarly dependent on the car. They do not necessarily qualify for a blue badge either. For those for whom driving is not an option, congestion charges, if they have to pay them, are a tax on disabled people, not a charge on congestion. The case for a national exemption for disabled people is a strong one.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a><a name="080116122000097"></a>When I moved the amendment in Committee, the Minister laid out a number of objections that he had to it. First, he said that exemptions and discounts from local road pricing schemes are, in the first instance, a matter for the local authorities considering introducing such schemes. The Government believe that it is right for the local authority to propose its own charge level. Secondly, he said that as part of any stakeholder engagement on a proposed road pricing scheme, a local authority should address the exemptions and discounts that a scheme offers. Interested parties will have an opportunity to make their views known through the consultation process. It will be especially important for local authorities, as part of the development of a scheme, to assess the impact of the scheme on different groups, including, in particular, those with disabilities. Thirdly, in developing local road pricing schemes, local authorities will also have to observe their duties under the Disability Discrimination Acts. That should ensure that disabled people are not unfairly treated through the introduction of a scheme.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a><a name="080116122000098"></a>Finally, the Transport Act 2000 already allows for national exemptions. The Act provides the appropriate national authority with the ability to make regulations on exemptions and discounts, and on limiting the charges that local authorities are able to introduce. However, the Government have yet to make decisions on whether&#151;and, if so, how&#151;they might exercise those powers. They believe that it might be more appropriate to issue guidance to local authorities.  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1404"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1404</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Section 193 allows the appropriate national authority to issue guidance to charging authorities and the authorities must have regard to it when exercising their functions. This may be a more suitable way of approaching the principles that local authorities are expected to follow.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a><a name="080116122000099"></a>The Minister also made clear that the Government are looking at the best way of achieving these aims. This could include issuing guidance on the manner in which exemptions and discounts from a scheme should be implemented. They aim to have completed that work well in advance of the introduction of any local road pricing schemes so that the public and the scheme operator can be clear on what is envisaged. They therefore think it unnecessary to specify in the Bill that the appropriate national authority must make regulations.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a><a name="080116122000100"></a>Before the Minister runs away with the idea that I am making his speech in reply for him, there are certain points that I wish to make in rejoinder. First, it cannot be quite right that the Government are proposing to bring out guidance in advance of any congestion-charging schemes being introduced, because some have already been introduced and more are in the pipeline.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a><a name="080116122000101"></a>I note that it will no longer be a requirement for the Secretary of State to approve schemes, including details of any exemptions. While I welcome the fact that guidance on exemptions and discounts will be produced, I am concerned that, with the removal of the requirement of the Secretary of State&#146;s approval, local authorities may produce exemption schemes for disabled people that do not meet the needs of all those who, because of their impairment, are unlikely to use public transport and are reliant on a private car for their mobility, either as driver or passenger. As the Secretary of State&#146;s permissive power under the Transport Act 2000 and the Greater London Authority Act 2007 to prescribe exemptions has not been exercised, the amendment provides that the appropriate national authorities be put under a duty to make regulations concerning exemptions. With the removal of the requirement for Secretary of State approval for road-charging schemes, it will be even harder to enforce good practice if there are no regulations specifying minimum exemptions for disabled people. As a permissive power under the Transport Act 2000 has not been used, it would be appropriate for the appropriate national authorities to be put under a duty to make regulations concerning exemptions.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_474"></a><a name="080116122000102"></a>I can understand the Government&#146;s reasons for not wanting to fetter in the Bill the discretion of local authorities, and for saying that they do not want to accept this amendment because they are still developing the framework of congestion-charging schemes. Yet, this amendment is in effect only asking that the principle that there be minimum exemptions for disabled people is in the Bill. By requiring in the Bill that the appropriate national authorities should make regulations, we are simply stipulating the principle that provision will be made for this; we are not saying anything in detail as to how or when. By obliging the appropriate national authorities to set a minimum, local authorities will still have the discretion to go above the minimum, while the needs of disabled people are protected. The  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1405"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1405</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government can also wait to develop the regulations until it is clear how they would fit in with the rest of the package of regulations and guidance affecting congestion charging.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a><a name="080116122000103"></a>I wait with interest to hear what the Minister has to say in response. If he is not minded to accept the amendment in full, I finally ask that the Government might be willing to investigate the potential impact of charging schemes on various classes of disabled people and to publish the results. Then possibly, in the light of that, we could form a better assessment of whether congestion charges were bearing harshly on disabled people. I beg to move.</p>

The Minister might say that I should be supporting, as I always do, local discretion on this.

In the end, I cannot agree to accept the amendment but I am going to come to his offer of having a look at the potential impact of exemptions in different localities. First, I will make some points that bear thinking about. The noble Lord in good measure anticipated some of my lines of reply, and I congratulate him for that. He obviously studied carefully what was said when we debated the issue in Committee.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a><a name="080116122000106"></a>As the noble Lord said, the Transport Act 2000 contains powers for the appropriate national authority to make regulations specifying national exemptions and discounts from local schemes and the maximum charge payable. At this time, we do not think it appropriate to change the legislation to compel the appropriate national authority to make the regulations. The key words in that sentence are &#147;at this time&#148;.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a><a name="080116122000107"></a>In respect of limiting the charges that local authorities are able to introduce, it is right for the local authority to propose its own charge levels as part of the detailed design of local schemes, which should be left to the local level. It is on the detailed design of local schemes that we need to focus, because congestion charging will vary in the way in which it is operated in each locality that develops a scheme. The local authority will be able best to determine the impact of that scheme on particular transport user groups; for example, car users. An authority would therefore be best placed to set the charge level that is most appropriate for tackling the problems in its local area after a careful economic modelling exercise. We do not want to set an arbitrary price for all schemes across the country when there is a need for difference depending on location, scheme design and scheme objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_479"></a><a name="080116122000109"></a>In our online transport analysis guidance, we have given guidance to local authorities that scheme design will need to identify at-risk groups and consider how any negative impacts on those groups could be minimised or mitigated. There may be ways of doing that other than by offering exemptions or discounts. We expect local authorities to consult relevant interested parties on a full range of issues, including any proposals for exemptions and discounts, which will ensure that the needs of any specific group are adequately taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_480"></a><a name="080116122000110"></a>We have today underlined this issue in relation to disabled people by amending Clause 10 so that local transport authorities will have a duty to have regard to the needs of all disabled persons when developing their transport policies and local transport plans. The amendment which the noble Lord, Lord Low, has encouraged us to adopt, which would disability-proof the legislation, will assist in ensuring that disabled people are not unfairly discriminated against at a local level. Local authorities making road charging schemes will have to facilitate local transport policies developed in accordance with that duty. Local authorities have a general duty to observe under the disability discrimination legislation. The amendment should be a further reminder to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_481"></a><a name="080116122000111"></a>The best approach is for local determination, so that it can reflect different designs of schemes. There is a big difference between, for example, the London scheme, which applies all day, and the proposed Manchester scheme, which would apply only at peak times. As such, it is inappropriate to be overprescriptive in coming up with a solution to the issue that the noble Lord raised.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a><a name="080116122000113"></a>I also appreciate that there are concerns about individuals having to engage with a number of specific schemes. It is worth reminding ourselves that at this stage there are only a small number of areas with serious proposals for road pricing. To date, the department has received only two bids for transport innovation fund money with proposals for the development of road pricing. We only have two congestion charge schemes&#151;one in London and one in Durham. If we were to go along the route suggested by the noble Lord, we would be trying to cover all bases and design a set of regulations nationally for a maximum of four schemes, one of which is rather large in scale and one, in Durham, very small.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a><a name="080116122000114"></a>Exemptions and discounts for certain users are a matter for local authorities in the first instance. We acknowledge that under the Transport Act 2000, the Secretary of State may make regulations for national exemptions and discounts. As proposals for local schemes are developed, we will of course be happy to listen to views on exemptions and discounts for users. We will want to ensure that we strike the correct balance between local discretion and national consistency, which is the point at issue for the noble Lord, Lord Low. We think that it is unnecessary, therefore, to specify in the Bill that the appropriate national authority must make regulations. We do not think that we need to go that far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_484"></a><a name="080116122000115"></a>The noble Lord offered to help us investigate the potential impact of schemes on people with disabilities who have, for good and sensible reasons, incurred congestion charges. That is a very helpful suggestion, which I will take away with me. In consulting, we ought to carry out some research, and if we can do that jointly with groups representing different disabilities, that would be very helpful. I am very grateful to the noble Lord for that.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a><a name="080116122000116"></a>For the very good reasons of local design, the need for local flexibility, the fact that we do not have a vast array of schemes yet within our view, and because we can deal with this issue more than adequately in guidance, it would be inappropriate to incorporate the amendment in the Bill as it stands. However, I certainly recognise the importance of ensuring that local authorities work in concert and with knowledge of each other&#146;s schemes. That will be reflected in the way in which guidance is drafted and in the form of consultation that is undertaken.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a><a name="080116122000117"></a>I hope that, having heard the reassurances that I have given, the noble Lord, Lord Low, will feel able to withdraw his amendment. I hope that he will be content with my commitment to ensure that we continue to have further discussion with him on the way in which this issue works and the way in which people with disabilities will want to ensure that they are fairly treated regarding exemptions.</p>

He has the most seductive way of saying no and not accepting one&#146;s amendment. He said that the Government did not want to accept the amendment &#147;at this time&#148; and I took considerable comfort from that emphasis. He referred, quite rightly, to the duty in the legislation on local transport authorities to have regard to the needs of all disabled persons, as well as to elderly people and those with mobility difficulties. I took the point that asking the Government to lay down regulations for charging schemes for the whole country in the abstract when there are only two schemes in prospect was probably asking a lot. The noble Lord also drew attention to the power in the Transport Act 2000 to make regulations. He indicated that the Government would be open to representations at some future time, when it might be appropriate to make regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_487"></a><a name="080116122000119"></a>In particular I was heartened by the Minister&#146;s positive reception to my suggestion that there should be some investigation of the impact on disabled people of charging schemes as they came along, and of course I have every confidence that disabled people and their organisations would be happy to co-operate in conducting such investigations. For all those reasons and on that basis I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a><a name="080116122000122"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the purpose of this new amendment is to remove a legislative obstacle to delivering one of the Department for Transport&#146;s key proposals to reduce the administrative burden of the operator licensing system on goods vehicle operators. I also draw noble Lords&#146; attention to a related issue where the Government are considering the case for a further amendment in response to concerns raised by the haulage industry.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_490"></a><a name="080116122000123"></a>Section 5(2) of the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995 currently requires the registration numbers of every vehicle used by a goods vehicle operator to be specified on their operator&#146;s licence. This is primarily to aid roadside vehicle enforcement by VOSA and the police. Under current legislation, when the operator wishes to add a new vehicle to their licence they must pay a fee to the traffic commissioner&#151;currently &#163;9 or &#163;12 per vehicle per quarter depending on how they have opted to pay.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_491"></a><a name="080116122000124"></a>However, following a commitment made in the White Paper <I>The Future of Transport</I>, published in July 2004, the Department for Transport announced in November 2006 a package of reforms to streamline the operator licensing system for buses and goods vehicles. One of the proposals is to reduce the number of fees that goods and bus operators must pay to the traffic commissioner to maintain and update their operator&#146;s licence. For goods vehicle operators, this will involve merging the fee charged for specifying a vehicle on an operator&#146;s licence with that charged for the vehicle&#146;s annual MOT test.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_492"></a><a name="080116122000125"></a>However, Section 5(6) and (7) of the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995 currently requires goods operators to pay a fee when they wish to specify a new vehicle on their licence. Therefore, in order to abolish the fee, we need to make changes to the 1995 Act to remove the requirement that a particular fee must be paid at a particular time. Amendment No. 121 therefore amends Section 5(6) and (7) of the 1995 Act to make the levying of a fee, to notify the traffic commissioner of a vehicle, optional rather than compulsory.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_493"></a><a name="080116122000126"></a>The amendment also has a second subsection. Under Section 5(6) of the 1995 Act, a goods vehicle operator has a one-month grace period before a new vehicle must be specified on the operator&#146;s licence. This is called the margin concession. However, another of the reforms announced in November 2006 was to explore the possibility of abolishing this concession. Although the detail of this proposal is still being determined by the Department for Transport, Section 263 of the Transport Act 2000 already contains an uncommenced power to abolish the margin concession. However,  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1409"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column 1409</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Section 263 also assumes that that operators will still be required to pay a fee when adding new vehicles to their licence, even if the margin concession were abolished. Therefore, the proposed amendment to the 2000 Act will also make the payment of a fee optional rather than compulsory, should Section 263 be commenced at a future date.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_494"></a><a name="080116122000127"></a>I said that I would also mention a potential future amendment, which relates to the proposal to abolish this margin concession. I am aware that concerns have been raised by the haulage industry that outright abolition of the margin concession could impose a disproportionate administrative burden, particularly where goods vehicles are hired out to operators on very short-term contracts. The Government are therefore considering whether there is anything more we can do to Section 263 to ensure appropriate flexibility. This is an issue we may wish to return to at Third Reading.</p>

<a name="80116-0018.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a><a name="080116122000128"></a>The Department for Transport estimates that the package of fee amalgamation will cut the number of individual fee transactions that goods and bus operators pay by over 190,000 per year, saving business an estimated &#163;1.5 million per year in the costs of processing the payments. However, the details of the simplification proposals are not directly relevant to the debate on Amendment No. 121, which in itself makes no substantial changes to fees. It simply introduces flexibility, should the existing fee for goods vehicle notification be abolished in the future by regulations. That is entirely consistent with the existing legislative flexibility to charge or not charge all other operator licence fees for goods and passenger vehicles. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000010"></a>The noble Earl said: My intention in proposing to remove this subsection is to allow a general debate on the implications of the requirement on local authorities to place children locally, save in exceptional circumstances. I hope that it will be helpful if I raise two matters. First, as I indicated at Second Reading, I am concerned that the imprudent application of this clause might result in the loss of vital good-quality specialist provision. Secondly, I am anxious that good-quality foster placements near to a child&#146;s home but in a neighbouring local authority should not be lost.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000011"></a>In the past, efforts to encourage local authorities to place more children in borough appear to have resulted in disruption to placements. The policy is right in principle, but it is the practice that matters. Guidance on this clause needs to be carefully drawn and its implementation must be carefully monitored. I understand that in Wales, where requirements to this effect are in place, there has been disruption to proximate out-of-authority placements. I am awaiting detailed information on that and will it forward to the Minister as soon as I receive it. I was grateful for the Minister&#146;s reply at Second Reading, but further reassurance would be welcome.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000012"></a>Three years ago, a letter was sent from the DfES, as it was then, to local authorities requiring them to place children within a 20-mile radius of their home, unless it was against the interests of a child to do so. I paraphrase the letter, but it was explicit that local authorities should avoid disrupting out-of-authority placements. None the less, some local authorities appear to have interpreted it as meaning that they should pull the plug on out-of-authority placements.</p>

Half the voluntary and independent providers reported reduced occupancy and two-thirds said that they were receiving insufficient referrals. It is therefore essential that we see the guidance in draft as soon as possible. Can the Minister say whether we might see it before Report?</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000014"></a>This occurrence adds all the more weight to the request by my noble friend Lord Laming that local authorities should be obliged to produce a commissioning strategy for their looked-after children. Local authorities need to be proactive rather than crudely reactive. I welcome what the Minister said on an earlier day in Committee about the improvements being planned for commissioning and those that have already been undertaken. I look forward to meeting some of his advisers during the passage of the Bill to discuss this further.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000015"></a>Specialist provision can be more costly in the short term. Children are often prematurely withdrawn from such services. A child appears to be better, and the local authority therefore removes him. In fact, the removal of the symptoms may be only the first stage of addressing the fundamental needs of a traumatised child. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children service for young abusers in north London, albeit a non-residential service, has often had such experiences.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000016"></a>The Mulberry Bush School in Oxfordshire provides residential care for the most troubled children. I have visited the school, which has very good Ofsted reports. A documentary to be broadcast later this year shows children arriving who kick, punch and spit at staff. They often need to be restrained by more than two staff members. The programme shows how, over time, the children&#146;s behaviour changes. There is a particularly touching scene of a child&#146;s bedtime, when his carer holds him tenderly. The Mulberry Bush is so well respected that I doubt whether this clause would impact on its clients commissioning its services. However, the institution illustrates the value of highly specialist residential provision.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000017"></a>If local authorities avoid using out-of-authority specialist residential provision in future, there is the danger that some children will experience increased levels of multiple placement breakdown, something about which we are all most concerned. Will the Minister seek to monitor this by introducing a mechanism to check how many children have more than five, 10 and 12 placements each year? I welcome the Government&#146;s PSA target on ensuring that children have no more than three placements a year, but as I understand it there is no lever on local authorities. It does not really matter much to the child how many more times over the limit they are placed, whether it is four, five, six or seven times. If the limit of three is exceeded, there does not appear to be any mechanism to prevent the child from being shifted around. It would be helpful to know how this is monitored. I welcome the reduction in the number of children who experience more than three placements a year and I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s reply. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08011695000020"></a>We very much welcome the aspect of this Bill that attempts to keep children in care close to home. It is encouraging to see the Government recognising the importance of keeping a child in their local area as a way of increasing stability and continuity of care. It can only be a double blow to the child to be put into care and then to be removed from the only stable things in their life. The familiarity of surroundings, friendships and ties to the local community can soften the blow of being taken into care and make it easier for a child to handle the difficult transition with more confidence.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000021"></a>However, we have some concerns. First, as it stands, the threshold for determining when a child must be kept in a local area is weak. The Bill states that care should be within the local area unless the authority is &#147;satisfied&#148; that there is no local accommodation. We feel that, if the Government are serious about keeping children close to home, they need to make a more robust statement of this purpose in the Bill. Our Amendment No. 29 would tighten the language and remove the possibility of local authorities wriggling out of their duties; it would ensure that children are kept in the area unless that is inconsistent with their welfare.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000022"></a>We are also concerned that, as drafted, this clause could be interpreted to keep a child locally when their best interests would be better served away from home. We are particularly anxious about children and young people with severe and complex disabilities, who require extremely specialist care that many local authorities simply cannot provide. Of course it would be wonderful if every local authority could provide every specialist need, but that is sadly not the case. I think that the Committee will agree that we need the clause to cover exceptional circumstances. A child should not be denied access to the care that they need because of geography. I am sure that the Minister will point out that that is not the point of this clause at all, but we want to ensure that need, not cost, is driving provision.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000023"></a>I have so far spoken only about the welfare of a child and, in particular, the need for an exception for disabled children. In Amendment No. 31, we have included safety as well. There are a host of reasons&#151;gang pressure, abuse, traumatic family environments and trafficking&#151;where keeping a child in the local area would be dangerous. We want to ensure that there is provision for children to be placed out of local areas when there are situations that would make it genuinely unsafe for a child to stay there.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000024"></a>Before I finish, I should like to touch on the plight of trafficked children. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, spoke about them earlier this week, but I want to talk about them in a slightly different context. I want to talk about children who are trafficked  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC512"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC512</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>into our country and those who are trafficked within our borders. Their cases are tragic and we should give them all the support that we can. However, that is not an easy task. The nature of their situation often leads to them being not just traumatised but, where they have been trafficked for sex, highly sexualised and confused between genuine affection and abuse. This makes them difficult to place with most foster carers, so they are put in hostels or in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, where they just disappear. According to an article in the <I>Guardian</I> in September, more than 180 children recently trafficked into the UK have vanished without a trace from social service care. I wonder whether the Minister can tell the Committee what the Government are doing to ensure that those cruelly exploited children are placed in the most appropriate setting.</p>

<p><a name="08011695000025"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08011695000162"></a>Baroness Butler-Sloss:</b> I believe that the figure given by the noble Baroness came from the Government. I am not sure that it is 180&#151;it may have been 160&#151;but the Government have certainly said that something in the region of that number of trafficked children have gone missing in the past year to 18 months. It is an extremely serious matter. I must declare an interest. I belong to the All-Party Group on the Trafficking of Women and Children, so I very much endorse what the noble Baroness has just said.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000026"></a>Perhaps I can make a separate point about accommodation outside the area. Another group of children who are particularly difficult to place are those who have been sexually abused over a long period. Sometimes they are very young children. I have a vivid recollection of a little girl of five, whose case I dealt with. She went to see a child psychiatrist who was not an enthusiast about child sexual abuse&#151;he was not at all sure that it really happened very much. The girl ran in and sat on his lap, although she had never met him before. She then lay down, opened her legs and said, &#147;Would you like to see what daddy did to me?&#148;. He was converted in an instant. The point is that she could not go to any ordinary foster family because she would be a danger to the father and to the boys in the family. One has to bear in mind that, in exceptional circumstances, highly sexualised children must have very careful treatment, which may well have to take place outside the area.</p>

On Amendment No. 33, we would simply like a recognition that there may be cases involving specific safety concerns, as have just been outlined, which make a placement within a local authority not in the child&#146;s best interests. That is why we propose the addition of safety as a criterion in Clause 8.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000029"></a>Amendments Nos. 34 and 46 define what we mean by welfare. Kevin Brennan MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Young People and Families, speaking on 9 October 2007, made it clear that the Bill would not prevent access to specialist services for children with complex and acute needs. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011695000149"></a>&#147;the needs of each individual child must come first. We will ensure that out of authority restriction is not absolute, as we recognise that some young people will have needs that require them to be placed at a distance&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000030"></a>Although we recognise that and welcome the Bill&#146;s focus on ensuring that local authorities provide appropriate placements that are consistent with the child&#146;s welfare, we would like more clarity on what we mean by &#147;welfare&#148;. In some cases, out-of-authority placements may be the most appropriate. As drafted, the Bill states that the Secretary of State will define the requirements with which local authorities must comply before placing a child out of their area. We believe that further clarification is required in the Bill, which is why we have provided our own definition of welfare. Noble Lords will note that it includes physical and mental health as well as appropriate educational outcomes; support for the child&#146;s social, emotional and behavioural needs; safeguarding requirements; and the stability of the care placement. </p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000031"></a>We would place a similar definition of welfare in Clause 9, because we are concerned that a lack of flexibility and understanding of the circumstances of children with complex needs could result in a decision to place a child in an inappropriate placement, simply because it is near to the school, which is the subject covered by Clause 9. That might be the school where they are currently registered. It is of course easier to leave them there&#151;whether or not they are actually attending, which might also be an issue&#151;regardless of whether the school is able to provide the specialist support that the child needs. That is why we propose the same definition of &#147;welfare&#148; in Amendment No. 46 as in Amendment No. 34.</p>

What attracted me to them, having myself been part of a Government in the distant past, is that I have always worried a little that, whatever the good intentions, how the policy is to be fulfilled and what its specifics are need to be looked at in some detail. Sometimes there is a certain amount of frustration among those delivering in the field. They do not doubt the good intentions and positive attitude of the Government, but they do not believe that what needs to be done in terms of action and specific circumstances has always been clearly thought through. I am therefore always tempted to support amendments that try to be specific in their implications. I hope that my noble friend will feel able to look seriously at what is being argued.</p>

If ever there were two such words, they are &#147;reasonably practicable&#148;. When you remove &#147;reasonably practicable&#148;, the phrase reads:</p>

<ul><a name="08011695000151"></a>&#147;reasonably practicable and consistent with the welfare of the child&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08011695000129"></a>particularly given all the needs that we have heard about and the difficulty of placing individual children for more than understandable reasons. I very much support all the amendments because of what we have heard, and continue to hear, about the details of some of these appalling cases. We are all horrified by the number of missing children, whatever it is. It is quite beyond belief.</p>

I suggest that it will be important to keep them separate in our minds. The first, from the child&#146;s point of view, is continuity of friends and relatives when he or she is being placed, either in the same local authority area or close to it. The second is the stability of the placement itself.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000035"></a>In London and other large conurbations, a much better and more satisfactory placement may well be available just over the edge of the boundary of the particular local authority. I am sure that the Minister has that in mind and I hope that he will continue to keep it there.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000036"></a>At Second Reading I said that stable placements of children were worth their weight in gold, which is why I welcome paragraphs (d) and (e) in Amendments Nos. 34 and 46. They emphasise the long-term stability of the potential care placement and the consequent mental and physical health of the child. I am sure that we all agree that long, stable placements provide the environment in which the child&#146;s mental and physical health can be cared for, preserved, maintained and improved. On those grounds, I support what my noble friend Lord Listowel said about a possible mechanism for looking at placements that have failed to last and have broken down for one reason or another. Perhaps the mechanism could look into the causes of the breakdown as well as simply the administration of it.</p>

I thought that she would be far more concerned about the growing chasm between herself and me. I greatly regret that she is so far away and I wish that she was closer. However, her words carry equal force wherever she delivers them from within the Grand Committee.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000039"></a>Greater stability and continuity are our objectives, which are clearly shared by all noble Lords who have spoken in the Committee today. In respect of the noble Earl&#146;s Amendment No. 28, we are committed to reducing the number of inappropriate out-of-authority placements and to encouraging provision of a range and choice of suitable-quality accommodation within each local authority area that is capable of meeting the needs of the children that it looks after.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000040"></a>The noble Earl asked about data on placement stability and whether we could publish data on those who are moved five, 10 or 15 times a year. We currently have national indicators on three or more placement moves and long-term placement stability and we publish those statistics. However, national data collection captures information on every placement move, and the extremely high levels of placement disruption to which he referred are counted. I shall write to him with the information that we have in a form that may be useful to him.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000041"></a>The latest figures show that 34 per cent of children are placed outside their local authority area. This rate has increased in recent years. Because of this high level&#151;we believe it to be unacceptably high&#151;we think it right to strengthen the duties on local authorities to help to reduce the current reliance on distant placements, both outside the local authority or at some distance within it. Children have told us that they can feel isolated in distant placements and miss contact with their friends and local communities. Local authorities find it harder to be attentive corporate parents to children who are in distant placements and they have less leverage over the relevant services in that area.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000042"></a>In general, children placed out of area do less well than those placed closer to home. We know that children placed out of their local authority area are more likely to achieve poor outcomes and to be in very expensive placements, which are spot-purchased and do not always justify their costs. For all those reasons, we have the provisions set out in Clause 8.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000043"></a>However, there will always be children for whom a placement outside their local authority area is the right placement; that is, children with needs that can be met only in very specialist placements or those who may need to be moved away from their home area for their own protection or for the reasons set out by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. Some of these children are the most vulnerable looked-after

That is why we have included in Clause 8 the new test, which we believe to be robust; I say that in respect of the remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, about new subsection (7A). An authority would have to act reasonably in the judgment that it makes, which is a high threshold in terms of the way in which it exercises its judgment under that subsection.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000044"></a>To ensure that local authorities exercise this discretion appropriately, we shall use the power in new subsection (7B) to set out a process in regulations to scrutinise the decision to place out of area, to ensure that the authority has properly considered all the local options and whether out-of-area placement would meet the child&#146;s assessed needs, and to ensure that arrangements have been made to deliver the services that the child needs. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, asked whether we would allow Members of the Committee to see a draft of the guidance on the placing of children before Report. I am afraid that I cannot help him in that regard. As we have already said publicly, our commitment in respect of the revised Children Act 1989 guidance is to produce it by 2009, so it will not be available shortly and certainly not by Report.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000045"></a>On Amendment No. 31, we share the concern that the location of a placement near to the child&#146;s home should not be the sole consideration when deciding on a suitable placement. The statutory framework already reflects that. Section 22 of the Children Act 1989 places local authorities under an overarching duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of looked-after children. By virtue of this, whenever a decision is taken that concerns an individual looked-after child, the local authority has a general duty to safeguard and promote the child&#146;s welfare. New subsection (7C) restates the existing presumption in Section 23(7) of the Children Act 1989 that usually it will be in a child&#146;s interests to place them near to home. This duty to place near home takes effect under Clause 8 subject to the duty to place in the authority&#146;s area, reflecting the fact that the authority responsible for looking after the child will be better able to co-ordinate other services within its area that the child might need from other local agencies, including education and healthcare providers.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000046"></a>However, this presumption will be rebuttable. The overriding duty of the authority will be to ensure that the placement is consistent with its general duty to safeguard and promote the child&#146;s welfare. Furthermore, the effect of the limitations on the duty set out in new subsection (7E) of reasonable practicability and being consistent with the child&#146;s welfare is to ensure that the local authority is under no duty to perform the impossible and is able to take into account a range of factors in addition to placement location. These might include whether the local authority can place together siblings who might have different homes, whether the proposed placement would enable the child to remain at the same school and, of course, whether the support that could be offered by the specific foster carer or children&#146;s home is consistent with the child&#146;s welfare.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000047"></a>On Amendment No. 32, we accept that specific legal duties must not have the effect of creating

There may be situations where it is simply not possible for a local authority to place the child near his or her home or with siblings. All the remarks that I have just made in respect of the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, apply.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000048"></a>On Amendment No. 33, it is obviously essential that every looked-after child be kept safe and protected wherever they are accommodated by the authority that is responsible for their care. Clause 8 does nothing to detract from that. It might not, for example, be consistent with the child&#146;s welfare to place a child near his or her home if he or she was at risk of abuse from a family member. Local authorities are under a general statutory duty, set out in Section 11 of the Children Act 2004, to make arrangements for ensuring that their functions are discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. The statutory guidance, <I>Working Together to Safeguard Children</I>, published in 2006, sets out the actions that local authorities need to take to ensure that children&#146;s welfare is safeguarded.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000049"></a>On Amendments Nos. 34 and 46, any decision that touches on the welfare of a child will necessarily involve consideration of a wide range of factors, some that are particular to the child and his family situation and some that are of universal relevance. I agree that those highlighted by noble Lords are vital to the interests of children and young people. However, we do not believe that it is either desirable or necessary to specify a definition of a child&#146;s welfare in primary legislation. The term &#147;welfare&#148; is not currently defined in legislation. However, it is well understood by the courts, local authorities, social workers and other practitioners involved with looked-after children. In common usage, &#147;welfare&#148; means the well-being, happiness, health and prosperity of a person. In the context of the Children Act 1989, it requires consideration of both the child&#146;s short-term and long-term needs.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000050"></a>Our view is that, by specifying a definition in primary legislation, we may end up with a narrower definition of welfare than we currently have. That would limit the choices that a local authority can make in a way that may be detrimental to a child&#146;s overall welfare. Furthermore, Section 10 of the Children Act 2004 places local authorities and their partners under a duty to co-operate to improve the well-being of children, as defined by the five <I>Every Child Matters</I> outcomes. Those outcomes cover the aspects of welfare that the noble Baroness highlighted as important and apply as much to looked-after children as to other children.</p>

<p><a name="08011695000051"></a>To repeat, we will set out in the revised Children Act 1989 guidance the key factors that we expect a local authority to take into account when making care placement decisions and performing its various duties under Section 23. We also intend to leave local authorities the scope to take into account additional

I look forward to hearing further details of those young people whose placements break down more frequently than three times. I emphasise again that the danger with the current system is that it is cheaper to keep children in foster placements. The most vulnerable and traumatised children may find themselves being moved from one foster placement to another and then another. Unless one keeps a strong eye on those children who are moved to five, six, seven or eight placements, one could severely harm those most vulnerable children as they go through the care system until eventually they end up in the right, perhaps more expensive, specialist placement. We do not want to put them through that. I look forward to receiving the information, but we need to look at what pressures might be put on local authorities to ensure that, when these numbers start building up, prompt action is taken to place the child in the right placement, which, as I say, may be a more expensive specialist placement.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011695000137"></a> Clause 9, page 7, line 2, leave out &#147;schools&#148; and insert &#147;educational institutions&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000066"></a>The noble Lord said: I am conscious that the amendment brings together various threads in my noble friend&#146;s varied and extensive responsibilities, so I particularly hope that he will be able to respond positively. I place on record the fact that I have had very helpful discussions with some of those working with the children and young people to whom the amendments apply. I have found their commitment, based on their insight and experience, utterly convincing. I am also speaking to Amendments Nos. 38 to 42 and Amendment No. 45. I shall be interested to hear what the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, says about Amendments Nos. 43 and 44, because they seem to be very much in harmony with what I am proposing.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000067"></a>Under Clause 9, local authorities are required to make arrangements for a child whom they are looking after to be accommodated near to the school at which the child is a registered pupil. As far as it goes, this is to be welcomed; it may go some way towards addressing the instability that looked-after children experience in their education. Annual education statistics have clearly demonstrated the wide gap in performance between looked-after children and the wider child population across all key stages. For example, in 2006, 58 per cent of looked-after children of the appropriate age achieved level 2 at key stage 1, compared with 85 per cent of the general population of that age group. At key stage 2, 47 per cent achieved level 4, compared with 81 per cent of the general population. At key stage 3, 30 per cent achieved level 5, compared with 74 per cent of the wider population. At key stage 4, the inequalities persist, with 12 per cent of looked-after children achieving five or more A* to C grades at GCSE, compared with 59 per cent of the general population.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000068"></a>It is widely acknowledged that instability in a looked-after child&#146;s placement is one of the key barriers to their receiving uninterrupted education provision and therefore to their achieving their potential. While the provisions under Clause 9 are welcome, a number of questions remain. First, it is unclear what categories of educational establishments are included under the clause, apart from the provision that pupil referral units be altogether excluded. The purpose of the amendment is to gain clarification from the Government on which educational establishments will be included. For example, will the provisions cover maintained nursery schools, academies and special schools?</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC520"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC520</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000069"></a>Secondly, in the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper, the Government recognised that many young people are leaving care at 16 when they may well be ill prepared to live independently and where such a transition can have a negative impact on the child&#146;s education and training. The White Paper also proposes pilots to better involve young people aged 16 to 18 in decisions around their leaving care and to allow young people to remain with their foster carers until the age of 21. With this emphasis on allowing looked-after young people to stay in care beyond the age of 16, should further education colleges at which such young people may be receiving educational provision really not be included under Clause 9?</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000070"></a>Finally, as I have just explained, new subsection (9B)(a), to be inserted by Clause 9, states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08011695000152"></a>&#147;&#145;school&#146; does not include a pupil referral unit&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08011695000130"></a>This raises considerable concerns. I hope that my noble friend can clarify precisely why PRUs are not included. They provide education to children of compulsory school age who, because of exclusion, illness or other factors, are unable to attend a mainstream school. Like other children, a looked-after child who has had difficulties in mainstream education may well be receiving education in a PRU. Placement in accommodation far away from this establishment could have a negative impact on a child&#146;s educational achievement and experience. Indeed, it could almost be argued that those children are, by definition, more in need of nearby provision than are others.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000071"></a>To sum up, will my noble friend take the opportunity of Grand Committee to clarify exactly which educational institutions will be included under the Clause 9 provisions? Will he indicate whether further education colleges will also be included under Clause 9 to reflect the Government&#146;s intentions to allow looked-after children to stay in care beyond the age of 16? Will he explain why pupil referral units have been excluded from the Clause 9 provisions? I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000073"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Judd, spelt out, Clause 9 of the Bill, to which all these amendments relate, will amend Section 23 of the Children Act 1989 to ensure that local authorities are required to make arrangements for the child to be accommodated near their school. As the noble Lord, Lord Judd, explained, it is important to clarify what is meant by &#147;school&#148; in this context, particularly in a world in which we have a proliferation of different types of school. We have particular sympathy with the spelling-out of what types of school they should be, although we do not go along completely with the points made by the noble Lord about pupil referral units. Normally, a pupil is at a referral unit only for a short period. If they are to go back to their mainstream school, it is important that, rather than being moved, they stay where they are in order to be  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC521"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC521</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>accommodated back into their mainstream school. We also think that nursery schools need not necessarily be maintained ones; this could apply to any form of nursery school. With those provisos, we support the amendments.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000074"></a>We are particularly concerned about access for looked-after children to these new diploma courses, which are often run in collaboration between schools and colleges. It is essential to ensure that children in care are not restricted in the opportunities that are available to them. They often have lower attainment, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, explained, than the average of their peer group at key milestones in their school careers. They are especially likely to be among those pupils who find little stimulus in the present secondary school curriculum, particularly the GCSE courses in which low attainment&#151;for example, a pass below grade D&#151;is often perceived as a failure. They are therefore particularly likely to benefit from the new diploma courses to be run alongside the existing GCSE and A-level qualification framework. It is vital that young people receive support and guidance to assist them in making important decisions for entry to qualification routes that meet their aptitudes and aspirations and provide a means of progression to future stages of learning.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000075"></a>Equally, it is important that the courses pursued are not overly specialised, so that young people do not become locked into narrow occupational tracks without developing transferable skills for entry into different learning pathways. It may be that, having achieved the first stage of diploma studies, which will give them a level 1 or level 2 NVQ qualification, they would best proceed to further education courses offering a BTEC or a City and Guilds qualification, or something of that sort. In that respect, access to a further education college is just as important as access to school. I very much endorse what the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said, about further education colleges.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000076"></a>Amendment No. 43 gives us a definition of the word &#147;near&#148;. In page 7, line 3, a new subsection (7G) is inserted into Section 23 of the 1989 Act. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011695000138"></a>&#147;The arrangements must enable a child to live near that school or (as the case may be) one of those schools&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011695000131"></a>We seek through the amendment to probe the Government as to what &#147;near&#148; might mean. When we sought guidance, we came up with the fact the 1996 Act contains a definition of walking distance. Section 444(5) of the 1996 Act states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011695000139"></a>&#147;In subsection (4) &#145;walking distance&#146;&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011695000140"></a>(a) in relation to a child who is under the age of eight, means 3.218688 kilometres (two miles), and</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="08011695000132"></a>We have suggested that that might be the definition of what is near. The Minister may well come back to say that it is extremely difficult to do that. On the other hand, I bring to his attention the fact that new subsection (7G) provides two get-outs for the local authority. One is the weasel words &#147;reasonably practicable&#148;, which means that, where it is reasonably practicable for them to be within walking distance,

That is the essence of what we want. However, we feel that the term here is very vague and we want clarification.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000079"></a>My noble friend Lord Judd is right to say that what he was asking about in respect of Clause 9 is not defined in the Bill, but I can give him almost all the reassurance that he seeks and I hope that I can give him an adequate explanation of one of his concerns; I will look further at a second one. In respect of schools, in Clause 9, we take the word &#147;school&#148; to have its normal accepted use, as meaning an educational institution at which a child is a registered pupil. The expression includes all maintained schools, including special schools and maintained nursery schools, non-maintained special schools and independent schools, which includes all academies, city technology colleges and city colleges for technology and the arts. That meets almost all the concerns of my noble friend.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000080"></a>On PRUs, my explanation is precisely the one given by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. We gave careful consideration to whether pupil referral units should be included. We took the decision that the new provision should not apply to PRUs on the ground that such placements are, by their nature, intended to be temporary. They are specifically organised to provide education for children who would not otherwise receive suitable education because, for example, they have been excluded. We would expect a local authority to take all necessary steps to ensure that children are reintegrated in a mainstream school as soon as possible, which is almost always consistent with their welfare, and we believe that a statutory impediment to such reintegration may work against their welfare. That is why we have not put PRUs in the category of schools.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000081"></a>In respect of further education, some children in key stage 4 attend courses at institutions in the FE sector. However, almost all 14 to 16 year-olds in the general population who attend courses at FE colleges will be registered at a school and we have no reason to suppose that the same is not true of looked-after children. The only case that would not be caught by this new restriction on school moves is that of a looked-after child who is moved from one institution to another within the FE sector and who is not a registered pupil at a school. The size of that group is likely to be very small and we believe that we can address those cases through statutory guidance to local authorities, rather than by introducing the additional complexity in the provision that would result from the practical difficulty of identifying with sufficient legal certainty the trigger for the duty in the absence of a common registration system in the FE

The guidance would also cover 16 to 18 year-olds, explaining clearly that we expect &#147;school&#148; in this context to encompass relevant further education institutions. However, I take my noble friend&#146;s point about the importance of FE and of looked-after children with FE placements being properly catered for. I shall reflect further on his comments before Report.</p>

However, the meaning of &#147;near&#148; will properly vary with the particular circumstances of the child, including his age and any special educational needs or disability that might affect his ability to travel. We do not think it appropriate rigidly to define &#147;near&#148; in the Bill. The importance of preserving stability at school needs to be balanced against that of giving local authorities sufficient flexibility in the choice of the location of the care placement to ensure that it is a good one that can meet the child&#146;s care needs. A local authority may find that the placement that best meets a child&#146;s wider needs and enables the child to remain at his existing school is not within walking distance of the school. The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment would prevent the local authority from making such a placement, even where it would otherwise be within reasonable travelling distance, and we do not believe that that would be in the best interests of the child. The word &#147;near&#148; is not defined in the Bill, but that is deliberate; we expect local authorities to interpret it reasonably, taking account of all the factors in the case.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000095"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 48, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 55. A common theme of amendments to the Bill, particularly those that we shall come to later, is that young people leaving the care system are still insufficiently supported to enable them to make the transition to independent adult life. The Bill brings many improvements. Clause 10 provides that a local authority must undertake a statutory review of the child&#146;s case if it is considering moving him from local authority foster care to accommodation of a type that involves making other arrangements, such as living independently in rented accommodation or a supported hostel or having residential employment. This probing amendment proposes that the local authority must also undertake a statutory review if the placement breaks down before the child reaches the age of 21 and that it must make alternative arrangements for the accommodation of that child if that is necessary in his best interests.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000096"></a>Despite some improvements, far too many young people still leave care at too young an age and almost all will be living independently by the time they are 19, compared to 23 or 24 or even later for most young people who live with their families. The current care system does not allow for an interim status. Children are either in care or looked after or they are living independently and supported under the provisions of the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000. That contrasts with the experience of most young people, who do not leave home in a single act; the normal transition is graduated and is characterised by frequent returns to the family home and continuing support from parents and carers. Many young people will go away to college for a period and come back during the holidays&#151;bringing their washing with them, which is only one of the continuing supports that those young people get.</p>

The key findings were that half the young people felt that they had no real choice in the accommodation offered to them on leaving care; 29 per cent did not feel safe in their accommodation; and about one-third felt that it did not meet their needs. I acknowledge that it is not feasible for local authorities to replicate exactly the experience of gradually leaving home that most families have. However, I believe that they could do more to ensure that children who leave care for independent living, particularly those who leave at a young age&#151;before 18&#151;do not drop into a spiral of moves of accommodation because of a single mistake or the failure of a particular placement. A requirement for the independent reviewing officer to undertake a review if an independent living placement breaks down would help in examining why the placement failed and in ensuring that any new accommodation was suitable and that the young person received the sort of support that he needed in order to minimise the risk of further breakdown. We do not want these young people to land up homeless, which happens far too often.</p>

<p><a name="08011695000098"></a>Amendment No. 55 would insert a new clause entitled &#147;Preparation for ceasing to be looked after&#148;. It is a probing amendment, which would extend the age of an eligible child under the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000. The local authority is currently under a duty to advise, assist and befriend an eligible child with a view to promoting his welfare when it has ceased to look after him, but an eligible child is aged only 16 or 17 and has been looked after by the authority for a prescribed period of time. This amendment would ensure that a local authority provided this sort of support to the child right up to the age of 25. I must say that I find that my children still require that sort of support, and they are getting on for 40.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000099"></a>We were briefed on this amendment by Barnardo&#146;s, which feels that not only should young people be able to remain in care until they are 21, but that the age of eligibility for services under the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 should be extended to 25. Young people should have the right to a personal adviser, a pathway plan and the same degree of care and protection as they would have if they were still in care or if they were at home with their own family. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08011695000101"></a>We welcome Amendment No. 48. If a local authority makes arrangements for a child&#146;s accommodation and this, for whatever reason, ceases to have effect, it is only right that it should be reviewed. It is often young people in this transitional phase who step through the cracks of care provision. We think that extending the review mechanism to apply to young people of up to the age of 21 would help to prevent this from happening.</p>

The Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 already imposes duties on local authorities to allocate a personal adviser, to maintain a pathway plan and, in particular, to keep in touch with all former relevant children until they are at least 21 years of age, and in some cases longer, while they remain in an approved programme of educational training. Clause 19 includes provision to enable young people entitled to care-leaving services who request the support to continue to be supported by a personal adviser beyond their 21st birthday where they have not yet achieved basic educational qualifications, where they remain in education or training, as now, or where they decide to resume education or training.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000103"></a>Amendment No. 48 covers accommodation. My department, along with Communities and Local Government, is funding research as part of the wider national youth homelessness strategy to inform good practice guidance on housing and children&#146;s services co-operating to prevent homelessness. The findings from this research will be available in April and will inform new guidance on interagency co-operation to support young people and families with children who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. We are continuing to work with voluntary organisations that support care leavers to build on the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper commitments to promote and spread best practice in providing supported accommodation services for care leavers.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000104"></a>The implementation of a young person&#146;s pathway plan should avoid homelessness. However, where such arrangements break down, the homelessness legislation provides an essential safety net, where necessary. Under that legislation, adults aged 18 to 21 who were formerly in care have priority need. We therefore believe that the amendment is unnecessary, given care leavers&#146; existing entitlements and the range of services available to them from children&#146;s services teams as care leavers and from other agencies that provide services to vulnerable adults in general.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000105"></a>Amendment No. 55 attempts to redefine the Children Act&#146;s definition of &#147;eligible children&#148;; namely, those children aged 16 and 17 who remain looked after and who are entitled to, in addition to other services, leaving-care support and, in particular, assistance with planning their transition to adulthood. It would not be logical to widen the definition of eligible children to include young adults up to the age of 25 as proposed by the noble Baroness. That is because the legal definition of &#147;eligible child&#148; can refer only to someone under 18&#151;that is, a child&#151;who remains looked after by the local authority. Young persons aged 18 to 25 could never be legally defined as children because they have reached legal adulthood and as adults can no longer be looked-after children. For that reason, it would not be possible to accept the amendment as drafted. However, it is right that care leavers should continue to receive assistance from, and to be supported by, the local authority that looked after them. The focus should be to enable and to support the young person as an adult rather than to do this on their behalf.</p>

<p><a name="08011695000106"></a>The legal framework for supporting care leavers under Sections 23A to 24D of the Children Act 1989, as amended by the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000, provides for proportionate interference in young people&#146;s lives to ensure that they are not cast adrift by the local authority formerly responsible for their care and that they receive the services that they need to the extent that their welfare requires it. Their individual needs will vary from case to case, but we believe that these young adults should be treated as adults and should not be subject to decisions taken on their behalf by a local authority in the way that this amendment, perhaps unintentionally, would bring about. I hope that, having heard these reassurances, the noble Baroness will think that our policy is correct.</p>

Notwithstanding all the entitlements to housing that the noble Lord listed, I wonder why so many young people who have been in care land up homeless. Given what the Minister said, it seems amazing that any young person leaving care could land up homeless, but the fact is that they do. However, I shall look carefully at what the noble Lord said and decide whether to bring this back later.</p>

<p><a name="08011695000108"></a>On Amendment No. 55, of course I accept the Minister&#146;s statement, which is quite true: somebody aged 25 cannot be described legally as a child. But the problem with support arrangements for those older than 18 is that they have no formal structure. Moreover, there are so many pressures on local authorities and they have so many things to do for young people under 18 in care that they probably have little time to devote to a 25 year-old who needs a bit of support. That is the problem. However, I again thank the Minister for his comments and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Amendment No. 50 is about

<a name="80116-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000113"></a>All children have a right to communicate their views, but what if the child cannot speak clearly or even at all? The local authority has a duty to seek their views but it cannot fulfil that duty properly unless some help is provided. It is important that children should have access to essential communication aids; it should be a basic right for young disabled children who are looked after. Without these aids, it is not possible for the local authority to carry out its duty to seek children&#146;s views. As with advocacy, IROs and visitors will not be effective unless disabled children have a right to the aids and equipment that they need to communicate their wishes and feelings.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000114"></a>In December 2006, the Children&#146;s Society found that more than 40 per cent of those surveyed said that they could not provide advocacy for children who did not communicate verbally, and more than a third said that they could not provide advocacy for autistic children. This provision is not expensive, apart from the high-tech equipment required for those individuals at the very top end of the range of needing help, which could cost up to &#163;5,800. However, there is a wide range of difficulties. For example, sign-supported speech does not involve any equipment costs at all, although it has training implications and so on. There are also costs involved with insurance and ongoing support.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000115"></a>Scope has estimated that around 15,000 people have the highest communication support needs in the UK. Not all those are looked-after children, but quite a lot of looked-after children have these problems&#151;Scope&#146;s estimate is that the figure is about 7.5 per cent. Meeting those needs currently accounts for 4.4 per cent of the budget. I am not sure where those figures come from, but there are young people who are not able clearly to communicate their views simply because of the lack of a small or maybe a larger kind of support with their communication. Provision of these communication aids is important for their basic rights and to enable the local authority to carry out its duty. I beg to move.</p>

However, provision is patchy and often when the aids break down there are no funds to mend them, so those children stop communicating. It would be like taking away our speech. The <I>Children Now </I><I>M</I><I>anifesto</I> published last year included the right for disabled children to have communication support. It said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08011695000148"></a>&#147;Without the ability to communicate we cannot explain what we want or share our thoughts. Children with speech and other communication impairments who lack the right support or equipment are effectively gagged&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08011695000133"></a>It went on to say that the Government do not measure how many children are in this situation. Can the Minister give an assurance that the Government will collate figures on this so that we can fully understand the scale of the problem and look for ways to redress it?</p>

In the considerable move that the Government have made to make available a range of digital hearing aids&#151;although that has not gone quite as far as many of us would like&#151;there is a particular priority for children. We are talking not just about aids but about very specialist trained teachers, for which there must be resources if these young people are to be kept included in our society.</p>

It is necessarily implicit in that duty that, where the child has a communication impairment, the local authority should ensure that those tasked with performing this duty have the necessary skills or the right support to do so and that the child is provided with the means to articulate his or her wishes and feelings. This would include the provision of communication aids in appropriate cases.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000121"></a>The Bill builds in further safeguards in this respect. In Clause 11, for example, we are requiring all local authorities to appoint a named independent reviewing officer for each child. This IRO will enhance the personal accountability and individual responsibilities of each IRO and will build in a presumption that every child has a right to a consistent relationship with one professional who keeps his or her care plan under review. Clause 11 also imposes on the IRO an express duty to ensure that the young person&#146;s views are given due consideration at each review of their case.</p>

<p><a name="08011695000122"></a>We made it clear in the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper that we would, as part of the greater support offered to looked-after children, introduce a requirement for IROs to spend time with each child prior to any review so that the IRO personally establishes the child&#146;s wishes and feelings about the issues to be covered at the care planning meeting. We will ensure through statutory guidance that children with communication difficulties or complex needs are supported either by an IRO with the skills necessary to facilitate care planning and to elicit the views of children with communication difficulties or complex needs, or through an IRO who has access to specialist input from someone who has these skills to ensure that the child&#146;s views are elicited and put forward effectively.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08011695000123"></a>Where a communication aid is specified in the educational provision section&#151;part 3&#151;of a statement of special educational needs, the local authority is obliged in law to provide it or to ensure its provision. This of course includes all looked-after children with statements. However, we recognise that this provision is not always well managed, which is why, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, just mentioned, we have commissioned a review of services for children with speech, language and communication needs, led by John Bercow MP, to advise the Government on how best provision can be mirrored in all areas, so that every young person up to the age of 19 gets the support that they need as early as possible. I will ensure that John Bercow sees the report of today&#146;s debate, so that he can take full account of it. His report will come in the summer, with an initial report in March. I know that he will be very receptive to comments that Members of the Committee wish to make to him directly.</p>

Therefore, more attention needs to be given to the provision of these communication aids, not just at the moments when the children are having to speak to an IRO or someone of that nature, but all the time. As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said, when the equipment provided breaks down and there is not enough resource to mend or replace it, that takes away the child&#146;s voice. I do not think that anyone in this Committee would like to have their voice taken away; we are all far too fond of our voices. I am sure that it would be terrible to be put in that position. Clearly, there are not enough resources. There are children who are not able to communicate with advocates because they do not have the appropriate communication aids, as is clear from the responses of the advocates. There is a problem, the extent of which it is quite difficult to gauge, although there are individuals for whom it is a personal tragedy.

That is in relation to the provision of services for children, including accommodation, and decisions made by the local authority with respect to looked-after children.</p>

<p><a name="080116107000003"></a>The amendment would ensure closer compliance with Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which grants all children the right to express their views and have them given due weight in all matters concerning them. It is clear that current practice does not adequately ensure that children&#146;s views are listened to or recorded. An online survey of children conducted by the Department for Children, Schools and Families in autumn 2006 found that almost one-quarter of respondents&#151;23 per cent&#151;who had a social worker said that they felt that they &#147;never&#148; had their views taken into account. Inspectors of foster care services have also noted that children do not always feel confident that their views are listened to.</p>

It would also ensure that there is evidence that every young child is asked their view, even if they do not participate in care reviews.

That would not only enable new staff to develop a better understanding of a child&#146;s views but also help to avoid the missed signs that have been the hallmark of inquiries into children&#146;s deaths from Maria Colwell to Victoria Climbi&#233;. I also have concerns that in the training of teachers&#151;I hope to bring this up in an amendment on Report&#151;more attention may need to be given to how you look for signs that could cause problems in future.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080116107000006"></a>It is surprising that a similar amendment was rejected during the passage of the Children Act 2004, on the somewhat strange grounds that entries made into electronic recording systems would not count as writing and that visually impaired social workers might not be able to record a child&#146;s wishes in writing. Those seem rather extraordinary reasons for rejecting the amendment. They would be even less reason to reject it in today&#146;s world. It is certainly unclear whether a visually impaired social worker would not have other methods of communicating. Quite a number of them are rather good&#151;rather better than I am, I have to say&#151;on the internet, and so on. Anyhow, it seems extraordinary that we are still left with this situation. May we please have some guarantee that &#147;writing&#148; is writing, whether it is recorded in an e-mail or whatever? The view that I have heard is that that should count as writing and as a proper method of recording the wishes and feelings of the child. I beg to move.</p>

We listened to them because, between them, they have enormous expertise in helping children and, especially in the case of the British Youth Council, of knowing exactly what young people want.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080116107000008"></a>In the amendment, we are trying to enshrine best practice in legislation. To me, it would seem to be best practice to note the child&#146;s wishes and feelings when having significant conferences with them. It is quite clear that case notes of that sort might have helped to avoid the missed signs and the drift that happened in the cases of Maria Colwell and Victoria Climbi&#233;, which the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, mentioned. It really is best practice to note these things. You cannot misinterpret or misremember something if it is written down clearly at the time. That is the important thing; it has to be done at the time.</p>

<p><a name="080116107000009"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080116107000046"></a>Lord Elystan-Morgan:</b> There is undoubtedly an unanswerable case for the precept that is represented by the amendments and I do not think that anyone  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC533"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC533</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>could gainsay anything that has been said by both noble Baronesses and articulated by the half a dozen or so distinguished children&#146;s charities. The case against such an amendment is, broadly speaking, that it is probably not appropriate time and again to overclutter a statute with detail of this nature. I think that that might well be the Minister&#146;s attitude to the amendment.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080116107000010"></a>My next point is relevant not only to this amendment but to the vast majority of amendments that are proposed to the Bill. In my speech on Second Reading, I referred to what lawyers and no doubt other persons call the green baize door syndrome. That is the door that comes down on a child&#146;s life when a care order is made. He is handed over to the care of the local authority, the door comes down and, with very few exceptions, the court has no authority to supervise beyond that point what happens to that child. In 1995, if I remember rightly, the matter was challenged in the courts; it went through the Court of Appeal and came to the House of Lords. The Court of Appeal had suggested that a court could perhaps preserve a concurrent authority to oversee what was happening to that child by introducing a system of what it described as starred milestones. &#147;Not so&#148;, said this House. &#147;When statute allows a body that is recognised by statute to take over full responsibility, you have to trust that authority. You cannot day by day look over its shoulder to see whether it is doing its duty&#148;.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080116107000011"></a>Sitting in the jurisdiction of family matters, I often felt that a court would dearly like to have that authority, but not because it wanted to interfere or snoop day in, day out at what is happening in local authorities, which in the main I have no doubt are conscientious and are worthy of trust. There are situations that no human agency could possibly foresee that may well develop in relation to a child where a court would feel that it was only right and proper that it should be able to have that authority.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080116107000012"></a>If one looks at the situation in law prior to the Children Act 1989, often in those cases you had wardship. It was the very conflict between wardship and care that made the Act in the first instance an absolute necessity, as a result of the case of Liverpool Corporation and A. In wardship, you had the High Court judge in the situation of parens patriae, who was able at each stage to overview what was happening to the child and to intervene constructively if necessary. That is not now possible.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080116107000013"></a>The logic of the decision of this House may well be such that it is not possible for there to be anything of the nature of starred milestones and that, even if you had legislation, it might not be utterly appropriate. As a family judge, I felt that when a care order was made and one dispensed with the services of the guardian ad litem, a bridge between the child and the authority was inevitably destroyed. There was often such a relationship between a guardian ad litem, a child, the family and the local authority that one felt that only good could come from prolonging that relationship in some way. That, again, is not possible, save in exceptional circumstances where one deals with a contact matter or something of that nature.</p>

<p><a name="080116107000014"></a>I apologise for making a very obvious point, but it is something that we should bear in mind as a background to considering how much we should spell out in statute. If concurrent authority was vested in a court to be able to supervise from day to day what happens to a child, if needs be, this measure would not be necessary. However, that power is not there, which is a powerful consideration in relation to this and, indeed, other amendments.</p>

<p><a name="080116107000015"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="080116107000047"></a>Baroness Howe of Idlicote:</b> I could not help but think back to before the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 when exactly that situation occurred with regard to juvenile courts. Social services, education authorities, the police and the other officers of the court all worked together in the best interests of the children. I am not suggesting that it is possible to go back to that scenario. Nevertheless, it is desirable to try to work out some way in which the best aspects of that activity can be taken into account.</p>

I am sure that all Members of the Committee agree that the intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, was not only powerful but also moving. I hope that I may be allowed to digress. I am inclined to separate people into those who in any task set their minds to preventing themselves from learning any more because they think that they know it all and those who have clearly learnt from their lifetime. Not for the first time, we have had the privilege of hearing what the noble Lord has discovered and learnt in his lifetime. I try to be at least an apprentice in that school.</p>

<p><a name="080116107000017"></a>For nine years I was national president of YMCA England. We did a lot of work with young people, many of whom were in care, detention centres or prison. I repeatedly saw&#151;I saw it for myself; it was not just something that I was told, although I was also told it repeatedly&#151;youngsters struggle to develop a sense of identity, a sense of being in control of their own lives and a sense of having responsibility for their own lives. There is tremendous kindness and commitment among many of those who carry professional responsibilities on our behalf. We must never drift into a situation where we implicitly seem to be lining up against them. It is totally unfair to do that, because they are often deeply committed and give their whole professional life to such work. We dabble in it a little, but they give their whole professional life to it.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080116107000018"></a>Of course, in any large body of people there are different levels of performance. For those who are doing the job in the spirit in which we would like to see it done, this amendment is in no way threatening, because they are already implementing its provisions. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, agrees with me that they may find it a little irritating to have to write out something yet again; they are often doing the job so well that this business of writing things out becomes a bit irksome. However, it seems to me that they have absolutely nothing to fear or to feel threatened by and no criticism whatever is implied.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080116107000019"></a>For those who strive a little more to achieve that qualitative level of performance, an amendment of this kind could help, but it will certainly be important

Sometimes children, like all of us, are capable of saying that they were not listened to when in fact they mean that what they wanted was not complied with totally. Nevertheless, it is important to have in place a system that demonstrates to the child the strengthened performance and which helps those carrying out the responsibility on our behalf. I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, on having introduced the amendment and I hope that my noble friend can respond positively.</p>

Although people are working hard to provide the best possible care for children, there is no substitute for the opinions of a child or a young person on their experience of care. The child should be at the forefront of policy making and a child&#146;s voice should be listened to and carefully recorded. I had hoped that that would happen in best practice. In an organisation with which I used to be involved, we used to say that if something is not written down it has not happened. I shall listen to what the Minister has to say before making a final decision on whether I think that this should be brought back on Report and whether it should be in the Bill. I thought that the noble Baroness made some powerful arguments.</p>

This programme is supported by dedicated grant funding to every local authority. The framework and the related government circulars about the implementation of the ICS were issued under Section 7 of the Local Authority and Social Services Act 1970, which means that local authorities are legally obliged to act under it. The ICS captures all the processes of assessment, planning, intervention and review that are essential in working effectively with vulnerable children and families to enable them to achieve positive outcomes.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080116107000022"></a>In respect of this amendment, the ICS sets out the essential information requirements and how these must be managed. This includes specifying that parents and their children must be engaged and involved in the assessment and planning processes and that their views must be recorded. I can assure the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, that &#147;recorded&#148; does mean &#147;in writing&#148;.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080116107000040"></a>&#147;What are the views of the child/young person about the plan? Please record any areas of disagreement&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="080116107000024"></a>There is a space for that to be recorded in writing. Section 21 asks:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080116107000041"></a>&#147;To what extent have the wishes and views of the child/young person been obtained and acted upon? If it has not been possible to act upon the child/young person&#146;s views, please state why&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080116107000031"></a>Then there is a section that needs to be completed. I believe that that meets most of the concerns of the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080116107000025"></a>To improve the practice further, as I mentioned in respect of the previous group of amendments, Clause 11 strengthens the functions of independent reviewing officers who are responsible for scrutinising each looked-after child&#146;s care plan. Following this Bill, as part of the revised functions of the IRO, the Children Act 1989 will be amended so that IROs ensure that any ascertained wishes and feelings of the child are given due consideration by the local authority. One aspect of this strengthened IRO role will involve detailed scrutiny of how the authority has performed its care planning duties. Any authority would be unable to discharge these competently unless it had a robust approach that ensured that its officers recorded children&#146;s views. I completely accept the force of the points made by the noble Baroness, but we believe that the system is in place and that the existing legal structures, as supplemented by provisions in the Bill, are adequate for the purpose.</p>

It is puzzling that there appears to be quite a large gap between the perceptions of children in care on whether their views are listened to and what actually happens. I do not have the figures with me as I have just handed in my papers, but there is quite a big gap between what children perceive and what, by definition, should happen automatically, of which children should be fully aware. Perhaps the Minister could tell me whether modern methods of communication are used and whether &#147;writing&#148; is still writing. It is important that matters are written down and are in people&#146;s own handwriting. Presumably they are sending one another e-mails all the time, as we are all being encouraged to use those forms of communication.</p>

I am very glad that at least the structure is there; I am less happy about the fact that that will be complied with in a way that means that, when the green baize door has been shut, the children are very much a part of what happens within the local authority&#146;s views, resources and so on.

</ul>
<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000003"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment stands in my name and the names of my noble friend Lady Walmsley and the noble Lords, Lord Rix and Lord Judd. It would create a specific duty on local authorities to provide short breaks as a care prevention measure. The duty would apply only where a parent or carer was, or would be, unable to continue caring for a disabled child.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000004"></a>Parents tell us that regular, reliable and appropriate short breaks help to keep disabled children and their families out of the care system. Families who get such breaks describe them as essential in helping them to sustain their caring role. This is what one family has written:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0801171000221"></a>&#147;I am fortunate to finally receive respite. What a wonderful relief. One night a week we can be a normal family. Go to the cinema, pub or for a meal or just be. No strict routine, no bathtime, no struggle to medicate, no getting up four or five times in the night. Bliss&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0801171000203"></a>Breaks can be provided in a variety of ways: within the family home, through accessing community facilities or by the child staying overnight with another family or in a residential setting. The report from the parliamentary hearings on services for disabled children stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="0801171000244"></a>&#147;the lack of short breaks was the biggest single cause of unhappiness with service provision&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0801171000204"></a>That was in the submissions from parents to the hearings.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000005"></a>On Monday last week, the noble Lord, Lord Rix, received a letter from the Minister, which he very kindly copied to us all, telling us that the programme set out in <I>Aim</I><I>ing</I><I> High for Disabled Children </I>is to begin with 21 pathfinders. As I understand it, those pathfinders are to be pilots for a three-year transformation in short breaks for disabled children. This has come as a result of an additional &#163;370 million to develop a step change in the provision for short-break services for the years 2008 to 2011. The Every Disabled Child Matters pressure group&#151;it is for that group that we are arguing this amendment&#151;welcomes this vital investment, but it is clear that families also need and deserve a legal minimum  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC538"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC538</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>entitlement to breaks to prevent unacceptable local variations in service provision. New funding is very welcome but, without a legal right, there are real concerns that those families most in need will continue to miss out on the short breaks from caring that they so desperately need in order to sustain their caring role. That will continue the unacceptable situation in which those families who shout the loudest get the most support.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000006"></a>As the majority of the new funding is weighted to the 21 pathfinder areas, without a change in the law families will be at the mercy of a postcode lottery, with access to breaks being largely dependent on where they happen to live rather than on their level of need. Without a change in the law, there is a risk that this three-year funding package will be seen as a one-off project. Creating a right to short breaks would ensure that the &#163;370 million was invested as the start of a long-term strategy finally to give those families with severely disabled children the support that they need to keep caring for their children and to keep those children out of the care system. Without that right, at the end of the three years&#146; funding, we may end up with short-break provision that we can no longer afford to staff.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000007"></a>The Children and Young Persons Bill provides a critical opportunity to remedy the gap in the legal framework for families with disabled children and to keep more disabled children with their families out of the care system. Following an assessment under the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000, the amendment would impose a specific duty on local authorities to provide short breaks for families who provide a substantial level of care already on a very regular basis.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000008"></a>While on the subject, I ask the Minister to clarify in guidance the distinction between short breaks as a regular, planned family support mechanism, where full parental responsibility is retained, and those short breaks that are effectively a family placement mechanism in crisis or in emergency situations where looked-after children status is needed. It is important that the entitlement to short breaks on a regular respite basis does not increase the number of those classed as looked-after children. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000009"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="0801171000260"></a>Lord Rix:</b> I warmly welcome the joint announcement made by the Minister and the Minister for Care Services on Monday to launch the start of an intended transformation of short-break services to disabled children and their families. I also thank the Minister for writing to me on Monday.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000010"></a>The financial commitment that the Government have made so that local authorities and health agencies can substantially improve short-break services for disabled children and their families over the coming years is truly significant. The additional funding provided by the Department of Health demonstrates a commitment to a joint approach that has long been needed. However, this is only the first step on a long journey. The year 2011 will be with us in the blink of an eye and there is no guarantee that this funding will continue after that date at the same level or, indeed, at all. What is certain, however, is that families with disabled children in 2012 and 2013 will have just as great a need of short-break services as families do today.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000011"></a>At Second Reading, I referred to the legal opinion prepared on behalf of the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign that suggested that the right to short breaks already exists in law. I hope that the Minister will now be in a position to clarify the legal position. If what the opinion states is not the case, I hope that he will have reconsidered his opposition to a new legislative requirement on local authorities to provide a minimum level of service to families in the greatest need, a duty that this amendment seeks to establish.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000012"></a>The need for short-break services does not go away once the child moves into adulthood and out of the childcare system. Parents and carers of adults with learning disabilities continue to struggle without regular support. This needs to be given priority and financial commitment. I realise that this is outside the remit of the Bill, but it is an important issue for the Government to take on board.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000013"></a>Providing short-break services is an issue close to my heart. I first introduced the Disabled Persons and Carers (Short-term Breaks) Bill in your Lordships&#146; House 12 years ago. The issue has not, and will not, go away. After all this time, we are ready for change. We must fill this gap and ensure that legislation includes an entitlement to short-break provision for those children, adults and families who need it.</p>

Members of the Committee have spoken to it most eloquently, so I will not rehearse the points already made except to say that access to short breaks can make all the difference between families coping with their disabled children and those children being taken into care.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000015"></a>A couple of years ago, I visited the Red House charity in Bury. The stories of the families whom I met were extraordinarily moving. A common plea from all of them was to be able to have some respite from the exhaustion of looking after their much loved children. However, they also wanted to be able to choose where their children went for short breaks, so that the children were looked after by people whom they knew and trusted. The families wanted to be able to care for their own children; they simply wanted some support to help them.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000016"></a>We are of course aware that there are cost implications. As a party, we are looking at how we could implement a single assessment process in order to improve the wide variety of social services that disabled children require. Currently, over a quarter of spending on families with disabled children is wasted on the assessment process and so never reaches the pockets of those who need it most. If the system were simplified, more money would be available for services such as short breaks. In short, people should not have to fight to get the support that they deserve. </p>

We have a real job in responding to that and in ensuring that they have a chance to live a little more fully. Of course, many of them find immense fulfilment in their commitment to the child&#151;or disabled adult, in many circumstances&#151;but we must be quite certain that we do not just take what they are doing for granted. The second point, which we are repeatedly making in our deliberations, is that this makes economic sense. If the whole thing breaks down because the person cannot cope any longer, what will the costs be? In economic terms, prevention is much better than coping afterwards.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000018"></a>I took the liberty a moment ago of referring to my time as national president of the YMCA. I remember once being asked to visit with my wife a residential holiday provided by the YMCA and a number of other agencies involved with young people. I was shocked to discover how much responsibility was falling on sometimes very young people who effectively became the principal carer. Under those circumstances, everything that I have said is doubled in its significance. What are we doing to the young person concerned? We are depriving them of their childhood, their full adolescent life and the rest. If we are going to take this important amendment seriously, we have to look at it in the fullest sense and recognise that, although there is a challenge with all carers, it is disgraceful how far as a society we have failed to face up to the predicament of young carers.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000019"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0801171000263"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> As Minister with responsibility for disabled children, I have no cause dearer to my heart than improving the support for families with disabled children, including short breaks. This is not just a pious aspiration; in fact, few causes commandeer more new government funding than short breaks. The figures that the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, referred to speak for themselves. More than &#163;300 million of new government funding is being provided over the next three years in respect of short breaks. Indeed, at the moment hardly a new document is published by my department that does not introduce new funding in this area. The Children&#146;s Plan<I>,</I> which was published last month, included &#163;90 million of new capital funding in this area. We are investing substantially in improving&#151;indeed, transforming&#151;the quality of provision for all the reasons that noble Lords so eloquently set out about the life chances and the quality of life of children and families in the categories that we are discussing.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000020"></a>The issue is whether the law should be changed in the way envisaged by this amendment. My response comes in two parts. The first part is on whether there is an existing enforceable right to short breaks in English law. That was the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, at Second Reading, when he conveyed to me the legal opinion provided to the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign. It makes two arguments in support of its view that an enforceable right to short-break care already exists in English law. I undertook to him that I would respond in Committee, so I hope that the Committee will bear with me if I am unusually lengthy in my remarks.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC541"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC541</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000021"></a>The first argument set out by the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign is that a disabled child who has been assessed by the local authority as in need of residential short-break care under Section 20(1) of the Children Act 1989 has an enforceable right to such care, although it is recognised that this is likely to apply only to families in crisis or potential crisis. The opinion contrasts the test in Section 20(1)(c), where the local authority has a duty to provide accommodation for any child in need in its area if the carer is prevented from providing the child with suitable accommodation and care, with the test in Section 20(4). In Section 20(4), the local authority has the power to provide the child with accommodation if it would safeguard and promote the child&#146;s welfare, even though the child&#146;s parent is able to provide the child with accommodation. The opinion argues that the enforceable duty under Section 20(1)(c) is triggered,</p>
<ul><a name="0801171000245"></a>&#147;if a parent is able to provide a child with accommodation, but is not able to provide accommodation that is suitable to the child&#146;s needs, or is unable to provide suitable care&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0801171000205"></a>In those circumstance, in its view,</p>
<ul><a name="0801171000246"></a>&#147;she is &#145;prevented .... from providing him with suitable accommodation and care&#146; and the duty will arise under s20(1)(c )&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0801171000206"></a>However, our considered view is that Section 20(1)(c) is not broad enough to encompass the provision of short-break services. Rather, we take the view that Section 20(4) should be the basis for a local authority to provide short-break care, but there is no entitlement to it.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000022"></a>The opinion argues that a child may have an enforceable right to short-break care at home under Section 17 of the Children Act 1989 read in conjunction with Sections 2 and 28A of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. The services that may be provided under these provisions include, under Section 2(1)(a),</p>
<ul><a name="0801171000247"></a>&#147;practical assistance for that person in his home&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0801171000207"></a>It is our view that Section 17 read with Sections 2 and 28A of the 1970 Act would not provide an enforceable right for the provision of short-break care. The concept of practical assistance in the home is quite different from the concept of short-break care.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000023"></a>The opinion accepts that a local authority must necessarily consider its available resources when assessing the needs of a particular disabled child and its family following the Barry case. It is also accepts that, even where a specifically enforceable right to short-break care exists, a local authority is probably permitted to have in place eligibility criteria to determine the level of need at which it will provide services. We accept and agree with this argument.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000024"></a>We therefore do not believe that there is an existing enforceable legal right to short breaks, nor do we consider that the best way to improve short-break provision is through the imposition of a new duty. The existing statutory framework affords local authorities the necessary flexibility to respond appropriately to the assessed needs of children who meet the criteria for services set out in Section 17 of the Children Act, including disabled children.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC542"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC542</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000025"></a>However, as I said at the outset, we are not content with current short-break provision&#151;far from it. We wish to see a transformation in that provision, which is why we are making more than &#163;300 million of new funding available over the next few years. I stress to the Committee that that funding is ring-fenced. It is very difficult to get that kind of funding ring-fenced in local authority budgets, but we have taken that step to ensure that this funding leads to a transformation in the quality of short-break provision and does not simply substitute for other local authority expenditure. Last May, in our <I>Ai</I><I>ming High for Disabled Children:</I><I> Better Support for Families</I> document, we set out our objectives for the additional &#163;370 million of additional funding. In the press notice referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, which we put out on Monday, we set out how we intend to take forward the rollout both of the pilots over the next two years and of the nationwide short-break provision thereafter.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000026"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said that there was a danger that this funding would promote a postcode lottery and would favour some areas more than others. I think that she misunderstands the nature of the rollout. The 21 pathfinder areas that will receive the bulk of the funding in the first two years are the pathfinders to the rollout of the full short-break provision in year 3. The rollout of that full provision will benefit all local authorities. The escalation of the funding reflects this. In the next financial year, there will be &#163;15 million of revenue funding to support predominantly, but not exclusively, the pilots. As we extend the piloting, this will increase to &#163;80 million in 2009-10. That increases to &#163;185 million in the third year, 2010-11, as we go national. It is absolutely our intention that there should be consistency in the national provision of transformed short-break services. The rollout that we set out in the press notice on Monday taking forward <I>Aiming High for Disabled Children</I> seeks to secure that.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000027"></a>Why are we piloting? We are piloting for precisely the reasons given by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. We need to ensure that we get the quality of short-break service that delivers on the expectations of parents, which means getting assessment processes right. As the noble Baroness said, often they are not fit for purpose at the moment. This also means ensuring that the quality of the short breaks themselves reflects best practice and that local authorities have in place, or commission, the effective infrastructure needed to deliver short-break provision. Of course, it will take time for them to get that in place and they need to look at best practice models as they do so.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000028"></a>Only this morning I chaired the ministerial implementation group taking forward the short-break policy. On that group we have leaders of primary care trusts, local authorities and many of the charities that do outstandingly valuable work in this area. I chair the group jointly with my honourable friend Ivan Lewis, a Minister in the Department of Health, which brings together the two departments in a close partnership relationship. We are absolutely committed to seeing that this huge investment of public funds leads to a transformation in short-break services and to a consistency of provision between local authority areas. I hope

The reality on the ground is that we are investing more than &#163;300 million to bring about a transformation in services over the comparatively short period of three years.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000029"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0801171000264"></a>Lord Rix:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his lengthy response regarding the legal position. Listening to it, I fear that I probably have to accept his department&#146;s assessment. That is unfortunate, but there we are. However, I am still anxious about when the funding stops. I am delighted that it is earmarked and that it will be used in pathfinder areas to find out how well the programme works and to ensure that it works well when it is spread throughout the country. However, it is still possible that in 2011 the whole thing may come to a shuddering halt. Even though best practice has been established, if there is no money to continue that best practice, what then is the position?</p>

<p><a name="0801171000030"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0801171000265"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> I thank the Minister for his lengthy reply. I also thank other noble Lords who participated in this debate. I echo the noble Lord, Lord Rix. We need to look hard at the Minister&#146;s reply to consider whether we want to pass up this opportunity to make such provision a legal duty. We have an opportunity in the Bill to impose a legal duty on local authorities because, given the Minister&#146;s response to the questions that the noble Lord, Lord Rix, raised at Second Reading, it is fairly clear that currently there is no legal duty. We have an opportunity now and we shall need to consider whether we want to bring this matter back in order to establish a legal duty.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000031"></a>I take some reassurance from what the Minister said about the current programme. If there is no legal duty, it is appropriate that the money should be ring-fenced, because that means that the money will get through to providing short breaks. I also take on board what he said about the rollout of the programme and about the necessity of the pilots in establishing best practice. Looking at the figures that he has produced, I see what he means about the extra money later on. We will need to read carefully what the Minister said and consider whether we want to pass up this opportunity to impose a legal duty on local authorities. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000036"></a>The noble Baroness said: The Bill makes welcome provision for independent reviewing officers to review the cases of looked-after children in a particular local authority. This is a step in the right direction. Independent review of individual cases is an important way of ensuring that children and young people are receiving the care provision they need. Our only concern is that in order for this to be as effective as the Minister intends, we need assurances that reviewing officers will be truly independent. Our amendment defines &#147;independent&#148; as having minimal connection to the local authority, including not having recently worked for that authority or having any connection with the child whose case is being reviewed. As it stands, the Bill does not have sufficient provision to ensure independence. While seeking to provide a robust appointment procedure for IROs, we feel that Amendment No. 59 is too rigid in specifying who must be consulted, including trades unions and local authority associations. If we want IROs to work, local authorities will need some flexibility. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000037"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0801171000267"></a>Lord Judd:</b> I hope my noble friend will look at this amendment carefully because if what the noble Baroness has been arguing is well applied and well developed, it will be an additional service to the local authority, as it will have at its disposal an objective view of what is being done and how it is being done which it can take into account in the development of its services. I do not want to get into a contentious area, but in the age of leagues and passing and failing in which we live, it is unfortunate that one inevitable consequence is that people see external reviewing and the rest as a bit threatening. If that is done in the right way, it can be extremely supportive and helpful in ensuring that the local authority is not only doing what it thinks it is doing, but is doing it as effectively as it can.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000038"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0801171000268"></a>Baroness Howe of Idlicote:</b> I support the amendments, especially Amendment No. 58, in my name, and those of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Sharp. In our amendment, we have tried to give a concise definition of independence. It goes further than the definition in Amendment No. 55A. It is crucial that there is a really independent voice on these matters. There cannot be any criticism that a particular path has not been followed because of problems that a local authority may be having.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000039"></a>Certainly, people from whom I have had briefing have some concerns about CAFCASS and the creation of a national IRO service, or to move the IRO function to CAFCASS. The CRAE, which is an amazing organisation of children&#146;s bodies, is concerned about this and believes that there should be no more delay in guaranteeing for every looked-after child a highly

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000040"></a>We keep coming back to human rights. It is crucial that this aspect is fully taken into account and given a full airing in everything that is happening between local authorities and children. I shall leave it at that; I know that the Members of the Committee whose names are also on the amendment will have other things to say.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000041"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="0801171000269"></a>Baroness Sharp of Guildford:</b> I speak to Amendments Nos. 58 and 59, and give notice that I shall not be moving Amendment No. 60.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000042"></a>We endorse the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. It is vitally important that the independent reviewing officer is just that&#151;independent&#151;and therefore not a member of a local authority or associated with it in any way, or a member of or associated with the organisation that provides residential care for the child. Amendment No. 55A covers much the same ground and we have sympathy with it, but our names are attached to Amendment No. 58 and I therefore place my emphasis on that.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000043"></a>On Amendment No. 59 and whether Clause 12 should stand part of the Bill, we have doubts about Clause 12 as a whole. It enables the Secretary of State to establish a new body to discharge the independent reviewing officer&#146;s functions. This undermines the commitment in Clause 11 to establish the existing statutory framework for independent reviewing officers in order to achieve improvements in the outcomes for looked-after children.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000044"></a>The case is not made for setting up a new body. It has been suggested to us that the experience of dealing with a number of such moves, including transfers of staff to CAFCASS, the National Care Standards Commission and Ofsted has demonstrated that they cause considerable destabilisation of existing local authority staff and their services. The new bodies often take quite a few years to settle down. Moving creates increased bureaucracy, with yet another agency with its own management structure, accountability and ways of working&#151;and, of course, it requires yet more resources to run. Such decisions should therefore not be taken lightly. Clause 12 should not stand part of the Bill, and the Government should focus on building and strengthening the role of independent reviewing officers within local authorities.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000045"></a>However, should Clause 12 stand, Amendment No. 59 proposes two conditions. First, it proposes in new subsection (10) that before setting up such a body the Secretary of State should consult widely among local authorities and the independent reviewing officers themselves, as well as other professional bodies involved with looked-after children and independent reviewing officers. Secondly, new subsection (11) says that the Secretary of State should commission a wide-ranging review of how the whole independent reviewing officer set-up is working under Clause 11. As indicated, it takes time for any such changes to bed down. Any such review could take place only once this had happened. It is also important that rigorous

First, with regard to calculating how many independent reviewing officers are needed, is it possible to calculate how much time IROs give to individual looked-after children and from that how many we need nationally? We want to be assured that there are enough to go around. Secondly, what will the relationships be between the IROs and the social work practices? Will they be monitoring them under some sort of contract monitor, as it were, or will they be monitoring the performance of the local authority and therefore be one step removed from the social work practices?</p>

It seems to be fundamentally important that they should be fully independent and that they should have no conflicts of interest. Having said that, perhaps I could ask the Minister one or two questions about how they have worked in practice up to now, and whether the Minister thinks that enough suitable people can be found to undertake this very important role. I understand that IROs have existed since the 1989 Act. In that long period, have they been able to make helpful recommendations about the breakdown of placements, which my noble friend Lord Listowel and I have talked about already this afternoon? Secondly, have they ever been asked to look into disappearances from care, which was also raised earlier today by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton?</p>

At the moment, there are about 1,200 IROs. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, asked how many would be needed after the legislation is implemented. We are proposing to set out case loads for IROs and therefore how many IROs are needed in statutory guidance following the implementation of the legislation.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000049"></a>The Government will monitor progress closely. If, as we hope, the evidence shows that the desired change in the effectiveness of IROs can be achieved through the new framework introduced by Clause 11, then that is all well and good, for precisely the reasons given by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. However, it is right to have the option of exercising the enabling power in Clause 12 to establish a new national IRO service, which is entirely independent of local authorities, should that be necessary because of the important role that IROs play in ensuring effective outcomes for looked-after children.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000050"></a>On consultation under Clause 12, I assure the noble Baroness that if the Secretary of State were to consider exercising the powers in Clause 12, the department would consult all the relevant stakeholders, including local government, IROs and their representative organisations, looked-after children and their parents and carers, CAFCASS, Ofsted, the Children&#146;s Commissioner for England, the Children&#146;s Rights Director and the Courts Service regarding any such proposals that might come forward.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000051"></a>However, before even getting to that stage, a proper review of the impact of Clause 11 to establish in what respects, if any, it had failed to have the necessary impact in transforming local IRO services would be necessary. Such a review would necessarily include the views of stakeholders and professionals on the effectiveness of the reforms introduced by Clause 11 and the statutory guidance, and would reflect the experience of children and young people as well as their parents and carers.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000052"></a>Furthermore, there is the provision that Clause 12 can be brought into operation only within seven years of the Bill being passed, otherwise it will cease to have effect. Seven years gives us the appropriate amount of time in which to assess the impact of Clause 11, decide whether we need to introduce further changes to the way in which the IRO functions and, if necessary, the right lead time for CAFCASS to establish a national service. Taking all those factors into account, we believe that Clauses 11 and 12 get the right balance between seeking to improve the existing IRO service, without going towards a national service that could have the bureaucratic implications that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, set out, while having the backstop power to establish such a national service if the IROs do not prove sufficiently independent and effective to perform the important tasks with which they are charged.</p>

But if the IRO was independent only of the management of the case, but was employed by that authority, he or she may be very loath to say that the practice of the authority is wrong.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000056"></a>I was involved in the trust at a teaching hospital, and I know that when we did complaints reviews, the fact that one of us belonged to the hospital always meant that there was a question mark in the minds of the people who sought redress; namely, that we were not giving them the proper due consideration that we should. Even though we were as objective as we possibly could be, in their minds we would always come down on the side of the hospital, and I can understand why.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000057"></a>This issue is causing great concern to a lot of organisations.

<p><a name="0801171000060"></a>The noble Baroness said: The purpose of the amendment is to introduce an express duty on independent reviewing officers to monitor the human rights compliance of the local authority in relation to an individual child&#146;s case. I know that the Government have acknowledged that IROs are not doing that. They are not sufficiently monitoring or protecting the human rights of children and young people in care, which was the intention when the IRO regulations were first introduced in 2004. Of course, we very much welcome the further strengthening of the IRO role in the Bill through Clause 11. However, that major omission persists in the absence of any express duty on the IRO to monitor the compliance of the local authority with its human rights obligations.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000061"></a>The provision in the Adoption and Children Act 2002 for IROs to refer cases to CAFCASS is described in the Explanatory Notes to the Bill as,</p>

<p><a name="0801171000208"></a>and the expectation is that IROs will identify potential human rights challenges. There has been much debate about the factors affecting the likelihood of referrals being made by IROs to CAFCASS, but the fact remains that no human rights proceedings have yet been brought by CAFCASS following a referral from an IRO.</p>

It is notable that the DCSF has not issued any specific guidance on the Human Rights Act and other human rights instruments to IROs. The CAFCASS confidential advice line for IROs and managers received only 13 enquiries from IROs in a

As I said earlier, none of those has led to a case. That could be due to a lack of awareness by IROs of this important service. One way of making them aware of it is to put an express duty in the Bill and ensure that that is backed up by training in how to carry out that duty. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000063"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0801171000277"></a>Lord Elystan-Morgan:</b> I support everything that has been said so lucidly and with such conviction by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. Earlier, when I mentioned the green baize door, I may have given the impression that there was simply no window in that door at all. As far as the court is concerned, there is no window, but, of course, a window was created as a consequence of the remarks made by the House of Lords in its judgment in Re S. As noble Lords will know, that led directly to the reforms that were added to the Adoption and Children Act 2002, which led to the regulations of 2004. Everything that the noble Baroness said was underlined very clearly by the House of Lords.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000064"></a>I do not want to give the impression that the House of Lords was insensitive to the needs of children in this regard; it applied what was a classical rule. I suppose it was inevitable that it came to the conclusion that it reached. In so doing, it expressed concern and was disturbed by the fact that children with no adult to act on their behalf may not have any effective means to initiate a challenge. A challenge would have been lawful, but there was no court to initiate that challenge. The child was entitled to initiate the challenge. The IRO is the trustee of the child and it seems to me that inevitably the IRO, if one were to follow the spirit of this pronouncement, must regard himself or herself as being in a position to review the totality of the situation of that child.</p>

I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, that it is a question of having sufficient training to monitor human rights law compliance. Can the Minister explain what steps the Government are taking to ensure that compliance occurs?</p>

<a name="80116-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000067"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, said, the role of the independent reviewing officer was introduced by the Adoption and Children Act 2002, partly in response to concerns expressed by the House of Lords in the cases of Re S and Re W about whether some looked-after children, with no adult to act on their behalf, had the means to initiate a challenge in the courts in respect of failures in local authority duties to the child. The IRO was always  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC550"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC550</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>intended to have a role in supporting and enabling children to access independent expert legal advice in situations where there was a risk that their rights were being breached. For this reason, his statutory functions include referring the child&#146;s case to a CAFCASS officer, if he considers it appropriate to do so. Clause 11 preserves this aspect of the IRO&#146;s functions unaltered, while strengthening his capacity to discharge this effectively by giving him responsibility for overseeing the child&#146;s case as a whole, instead of simply focusing on the review and highlighting his important role in making sure that the child&#146;s voice is heard.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000068"></a>There is already a clearly established mechanism in place for the IRO to refer a case to the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS), if he considers it appropriate to do so. This power is not confined to cases where a child&#146;s human rights might have been breached, although that is clearly one of the more important aspects of the referral function. However, we believe that the IRO&#146;s functions in relation to the protection of the child&#146;s rights are rightly ones of referral: the IRO is a trained social worker who will not necessarily have any particular legal expertise or experience. In our view, it is not the role of the IRO to monitor the human rights compliance of the local authority in relation to the child&#146;s case, as the IRO does not have the skills and expertise necessary to carry out that particular function, although IROs should have the training necessary to alert them to cases that may raise such issues and the confidence to refer such cases to CAFCASS.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000069"></a>I should like to quote the words of the Family Justice Council in its response to the <I>Care Matters</I> consultation:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0801171000226"></a>&#147;The Council queries whether any IRO has the specialist qualifications and experience within the complex fields of European and domestic Human Rights law affecting children which would enable them to identify Article 6 or Article 8 breaches with confidence. It is for the court, not the IRO, to adjudicate upon potential breaches&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0801171000210"></a>However, I stress to the Committee that in our guidance under this clause we intend to take the opportunity to make it clear that referral by an IRO of a case to CAFCASS should no longer be seen as a last resort, but considered as a real option to ensure proper scrutiny of local authority decisions in cases where individual IROs believe that it is appropriate to escalate well-founded professional concerns. We expect that this lower threshold for making referrals will result in a culture where IROs feel more confident and comfortable in referring cases to others and seeking expert legal advice on behalf of the child.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000070"></a>In addition, giving IROs a specific duty to monitor children&#146;s cases for breaches of human rights ignores the importance of the IRO taking appropriate action in other cases of possible breach of statutory duty that might have equal or more practical importance for a child, even though they might not involve human rights issues. For those reasons, we do not feel able to support the amendments, but we attach great importance to the role of the IRO in identifying human rights breaches.</p>

It would be utterly inappropriate to make it a rule that an IRO should be legally qualified and in a position to determine whether there was a prima facie case under the Human Rights Act. That must be right. It would limit the field enormously and point in an improper and wrong direction&#151;an irrelevant direction&#151;as far as the qualities sought in an IRO are concerned. On the other hand, to say that it is for the courts to determine ignores the point with regard to the green baize door. The courts are not able to look through the green baize door; the IRO is able and is charged to do so. It may well be that the answer lies in what the Minister has already suggested, that if the IRO believes that there is a breach of human rights law, it is not for him or her to adjudicate on the matter, but to consult CAFCASS. If an undertaking can be given that the IRO would consult CAFCASS and say, &#147;I have deep suspicions about this case and would be grateful if you would formally consider it&#148;, we would have the best of all worlds. Is that what is intended?</p>

As the noble Lord said, they are not to adjudicate; they are to refer. The problem, to which our amendment was a response, was that it does not appear that that is being done and we are not convinced that the IROs have sufficient training even to do the referral job that they are supposed to do. However, I am much encouraged by what the Minister said about lowering the threshold for intervention by the IROs if they suspect that the child&#146;s human rights might be being contravened, although they are not able to adjudicate on the matter.

Our policy intention in originally drafting Clause 13 was to ensure that local authorities remained in touch with children who were previously looked after by them, but who lost their looked-after status as a result of being sentenced to custody. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not consider that this intention had been properly reflected in the clause as drafted.

Our assumption is that at that young age they will move from their foster family or care home into supported accommodation, with very little support. At present, local authorities have considerable discretion over their visiting policy for care leavers. In east London, for example, the policy is for young people automatically to move on from their social worker to somebody called a &#147;personal adviser&#148; at the point when they move from their foster parents or care home.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000093"></a>I shall refer to just one typical example to illustrate how incredibly destructive that policy is. A young person in care&#151;like all his peers, no doubt&#151;had a terrible start to life and, doubtless, a number of unhelpful changes in placement. At the age of 15 he happened to find a placement where at last he could put down some roots and develop. Of course, until some firm foundations are in place, a young person simply cannot develop normally. But at the age of 18 he had to move from that accommodation, away from the best family he had ever known. At the same point, his social worker no longer continued working with him. He asked the social worker, &#147;When will I see you again?&#148;. The answer was &#147;Never&#148;. Can that possibly be right? Of course not. A short time later, this young person was involved in drugs and crime&#151;at what cost to society?</p>

<a name="80116-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000094"></a>A related issue which renders all the more important ongoing social work input between 18 and 21 is that the majority of young people will probably move from a foster family, who have had training over the years, to a voluntary sector organisation. I know that such organisations do a wonderful job, but I am told that many of the staff who look after these particular young people will be rather less well trained than those the young people have been with previously. I am told that many of these staff will find it very difficult to cope with the depth of disturbance of the young lad I have referred to and that of thousands of others like him.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000095"></a>The National Leaving Care Advisory Service rightly argues that, in order to secure their successful transition to adult life, local authorities should guarantee care leavers that they will have regular visits by somebody they know up to the age of 21. I am sure that the Minister is aware of the work of the organisation YoungMinds on young people leaving care. BAAF also expresses its concern:</p>
<ul><a name="0801171000250"></a>&#147;a major component of the Care Matters agenda for 18 to 21 year olds is missing from the bill&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80116-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000096"></a>The amendment would ideally support another to extend foster care beyond the age of 18. Whether or not the Government are willing to reconsider that issue, however, it is of the utmost importance that young people do not have a change of home, the loss&#151;for many&#151;of a family environment and, at the same time, the loss of the professional social worker upon which many have come to depend.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000097"></a>Amendment No. 66 refers to Clause 14; I think that this is a slightly odd and somewhat confusing grouping. That amendment ensures that a person&#146;s appointment as an independent visitor to a relevant young person need not cease until the young person reaches the age  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC554"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC554</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of 25. I emphasise that the independent visitor is, of course, quite distinct from the local authority representative who would visit the child.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80116-gc0007.htm"/>


<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000098"></a>In his helpful response to the Second Reading debate, the Minister referred to the aims of the independent visitor proposals. He made it clear that there is no requirement on the local authority to continue to provide an independent visitor to relevant and formerly relevant children, and suggested that there is no reason why a local authority could not choose to continue the arrangement. I must say that there is a little matter of relevance here: in view of the enormous pressure upon local authority resources, we can be quite sure that if there is no requirement to provide independent visitors, the great majority of local authorities simply will not do it.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000099"></a>The rationale for Amendment No. 66 has several strands. First, on average, young people leave their family home at the age of 24, as my noble friend Lord Listowel pointed out in a previous debate. Even then we can assume that they rely heavily on the support of their families in the years ahead. All of us who are parents know well that when life gets really tough, the young person&#151;and the not-so-young person&#151;returns to the nest. They phone up, they come and visit and they may even live at home for a while. But, of course, a looked-after child who is unable to return to their family of origin when they leave care will not have any of that support.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000100"></a>Secondly, we have already referred to the high proportion of children in prison who have been looked after. According to the Youth Justice Board, nearly 70 per cent of young children released from custody are re-convicted. The lack of consistent support for relevant young people in the years when they are most prone to criminality must surely play a significant role in those figures.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000101"></a>Thirdly, we know that looked-after children and young people are likely to have mental health problems. Likewise, care leavers&#146; outcomes in employment, education, housing and health indicate significant failings in their preparation and readiness for adult life. I understand that the initiative involving 60 organisations, called What Makes the Difference, has found that 38 per cent of young people with care experience believe that they were simply left to get on with it without any input when the time came to live independently. I find it hard to imagine the desolation of these young people when they are out there on their own, and there is suddenly, perhaps literally, nobody in the world to turn to.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000102"></a>I applaud the proposal of the National Leaving Care Advisory Service for a new transitional status for care leavers which envisages an accommodation and support strategy for them up to the age of 25. It seems to me that that is exactly what is needed. Amendment No. 66 relates directly to the second of the three elements in that transitional status. The independent visitor could provide an important element in the support strategy. I beg to move.</p>

What she has said stands in its own right.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000104"></a>The reasons I have leant my name to this amendment can be summed up under a couple of headings. The first is to remember that, in everything we are doing, we are trying to compensate for the absence of family. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, referred in a cheerful aside to her own family experience and to her children being nearly 40. I am sure that that is not a unique experience. In saying that, we must try and translate ourselves into the young person&#146;s position. Continuity is terribly important. It does not help to have theoretical arrangements in place which do not amount to a row of beans. The two amendments taken together are indispensable.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000105"></a>As I was arguing a moment ago on the previous amendment, we always have to face the social consequences, the cost, of not having done the right thing in time. All of us with experience of our own families know that people in that age group are at a terribly important stage in life. It is a tremendously important stage when people are getting launched into the real world. The amendments are important, and I look forward to what my noble friend has to say.</p>

I shall not say any more about that. But, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and getting the debate moved on in the allotted time, we have also grouped Amendment No. 82 with those amendments, so I shall say a few words about it.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000107"></a>Looked-after children may have additional learning and behavioural needs. Indeed, special educational needs are more frequent in this group than in the normal population of children. It is important therefore that the provisions under Clause 19 refer to the SEN code and the transition post-16 plan, which is generally prepared for young people with a statement in year 9 of their schooling.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000108"></a>Paragraph 9.14 of the SEN code of practice says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0801171000231"></a>&#147;The Transition Plan should draw together information from a range of individuals within and beyond school in order to plan coherently for the young person's transition to adult life&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0801171000211"></a>When first drawn up in year 9, a transition plan is,</p>
<ul><a name="0801171000251"></a>&#147;not simply about post-school arrangements. It should also plan for on-going school provision, under the statement of special educational needs as overseen by the LEA&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0801171000212"></a>This amendment would ensure that the planning process is carried out in conjunction with other agencies through transition planning, rather than by single agencies in isolation. Again, <I>Every Child Matters</I> has supported this amendment. In addition, assurances are being sought that young disabled people who have looked-after status will have access  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC556"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC556</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to personal advisers, because it was felt that paragraph 6.45 in the White Paper was somewhat confused on that point. Perhaps the Minister would respond to that in writing.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000109"></a>Transition to adulthood for disabled young people was described in the parliamentary hearings on services for disabled children as being like a black hole. I know that the Government have recognised that concern by allocating &#163;35 million within the <I>Aiming High for Disabled Children</I> framework to fund a new transition support programme. However, the concern about outcomes for disabled young people in transition is magnified for those young people who are attending residential provision, many of whom are not in regular meaningful contact with their home authority because they may be some distance away.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000110"></a>This amendment requires local authority staff responsible for SEN transition planning and pathway planning for care leavers to collaborate effectively to ensure the best possible outcomes for young disabled people leaving care. Collaborative planning and multi-agency working is very much the fashion these days for very good reason and should be applied in this case.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000111"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0801171000291"></a>Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> The transitional stage of care is often one of the most difficult stages. Indeed, this stage of life can be a time of confusion, uncertainty and frustration for young people who enjoy considerable advantages, let alone for young people in care. During this time, when a child faces the vast insecurities of an uncertain future, we are uneasy that that support is stripped away. We do not want help to disappear just when it might be needed most.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000112"></a>How many young people between the ages of 18 and 25 will be eligible for visits under this proposal? The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, talked about desolation, and I could not agree with her more. I very much take on board what she has said about being professionally trained, being known to a child and knowing what to do. However, under this section on independent visitors, there is a place for a long-term mentor. I know that Chris Waterman&#146;s pamphlet deals with this. A mentor can go well beyond the age of 25 and be part of a young person&#146;s life as he grows into adulthood with all the wonderful things that might happen to him. The training that is given to mentors is very important, and the Government are doing quite a lot in this area.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000113"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0801171000292"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> I am sorry that I do not immediately have to hand the statistics that the noble Baroness is seeking; I will see whether I can secure them for her. On Amendment No. 62, we are seeking to extend the entitlement to a personal adviser to care leavers up to the age of 25 where they continue or resume education and training. We are also supporting 11 local authorities that are participating in the Right2B Cared4 pilots, which are designed to give young people a greater say over when and how they leave care. Both policies are about improving the support that care leavers receive to more closely replicate that which reasonable parents might offer one of their children.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000114"></a>The Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 already imposes duties on local authorities to allocate a personal adviser, maintain a pathway plan and, in particular, to keep in touch with all former relevant children until they are at least 21 years of age, and in some cases until they are at least 25, regardless of where they may be living. However, it would not be appropriate to introduce a specific, more formal and less flexible visiting requirement in the Bill for this group of young people as proposed in the amendment. We should respect the right of this group of young adults to determine the nature of the ongoing contact with their authority after leaving care. We do not believe that it would be appropriate to impose on local authorities a duty that is potentially intrusive and that may not be possible to perform where an individual had explicitly rejected that contact.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000115"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0801171000293"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> The problem that has been pointed out to me is not that the young person would not want a visit. The problem is that local authorities cease to give priority to finding people to perform those functions once the child has left care. The important point is that the child has a right to have such a visit. We will go on to another amendment where we talk about the continuity of the same professional. Does the Minister accept that a lot of young people do not receive regular visits simply because of the pressure on resources and so on? The priority simply is not there. In my humble opinion, there is a need to strengthen the provision to make sure that young people leaving care have access to the visits that they need.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000116"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0801171000294"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> I am informed that the effect of the amendment would be to impose a duty on local authorities to visit young people aged 18 to 21 who are care leavers.</p>

I propose that we have a discussion about this to see whether there is wording that would ensure that young people had access to visits if they wanted them. I take the Minister&#146;s point.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000118"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0801171000296"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> Now that I understand what the noble Baroness is saying, perhaps I could reflect on it further and come back to her.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000119"></a>On Amendment No. 66, which seeks to extend the period of appointment for independent visitors until the young person reaches the age of 25, while we appreciate that the intention is to help looked-after children to make the transition to young adulthood by building on our proposals in the Bill, the effect of the amendment is much wider than that: it would require the local authority to continue the appointment of an independent visitor for any child leaving care in whatever circumstances&#151;children who are reunited with their parents, children who are adopted from care, children who cease to be looked after before they reach their teenage years and &#147;care leavers&#148; in the sense that that expression is commonly  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC558"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC558</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>understood. That potentially intrusive and costly service would have to be provided, regardless of whether there was any continuing need for it, well into adulthood. We are therefore not sympathetic to the amendment.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000120"></a>On Amendment No. 82, we appreciate the concern that disabled young people should not miss out on the enhanced entitlement to continuing personal adviser support for care leavers up to the age of 25 who wish to continue in or resume a programme of education or training. In response, I stress that the entitlement to a personal adviser is open to every former relevant child who requests help from his leaving care services to persist with or to resume education and training, including former relevant children with disabilities.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000121"></a>In respect of transition planning, Clause 19(5) specifies that the local authority&#146;s assessment of the need for continuing leaving care support may take place in conjunction with a range of other assessments concerned with care leavers&#146; entitlement to wider services, including services provided to disabled young people by local authority adult social care services. We believe that this will in practice achieve largely the same effect as the amendment as tabled. However, in making the necessary revisions to regulations and guidance under the Bill, we recognise that it will be important that we take the needs of disabled young care leavers into account so that between the ages of 21 to 25 they have access to the same benefits under this clause as all other care leavers.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000122"></a>In addition, my department, with the Department of Health, will be taking forward the Transition Support Programme to embed joint team working across agencies and with adult services to provide a holistic approach and choice and control for all disabled young people. Underpinned by &#163;19 million of additional resources, the change programme will initially focus on the 13 to 19 phase so that we instil a cultural shift in the way all services work together for successful transition planning for adulthood. So I believe that we are doing a good deal to meet the objectives set out in this amendment.</p>

These amendments would ensure that local authority visits to looked-after young people and others are made by their lead professional, who must be a person known to the child or young person. It is important to be clear that we are talking about local authority visits in relation to Amendment No. 63.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC559"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC559</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000127"></a>In speaking to these amendments, I, along with the NLCAS very much welcome the Government&#146;s plan to formalise the arrangements for visiting children and young people in care. The amendments would ensure that the laudable aims of Clause 13 are fully achieved, providing the benefit intended to young people. If the clause remains as it stands, the discontinuity and confusion for the young people can be expected to continue. Again, I am grateful to the National Leaving Care Advisory Service for its help in drafting these amendments.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000128"></a>We can draw attention to the research findings of the NLCAS which highlight the importance of relationships in making the difference to outcomes for young people in care. Good relationships will provide the attachment that these young people so desperately need if they are to succeed. But scattered across all the briefings from organisations working in this field are the sad cries of young people about the large number of professionals with whom they have to deal and the high turnover of all these people with the result that, half the time, the young person does not really know who is who. If the legislation does one thing, it should build in continuity whenever possible.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000129"></a>However, I want to draw attention to the wording in Amendment No. 64. It makes clear that the person chosen as the visitor, representing the local authority, is the child&#146;s lead professional, &#147;except in exceptional circumstances&#148;. Clearly, it may not always be possible for the child&#146;s lead professional to be chosen as the visitor. I accept that any wording in a Bill must allow for exceptions. Paragraph (c) in Amendment No. 64 refers to the importance of the person being known to the child. The same provision is made for exceptional circumstances.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000130"></a>I hope this wording may discourage the Minister from recommending that the principles here would be perfectly satisfactorily dealt with, or better dealt with, in regulations. The principle of continuity is so important to the interests of looked-after children that I hope we will all agree that these amendments, which are designed to achieve that objective, should be in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000131"></a>The only other issue to which I want to refer is the impact of the amendments on children in the criminal justice system. We know that 46 per cent of children in prison have been looked after at some time. The Youth Justice Board recognises the visits measures as those with the most direct connection to the youth justice system. The point here is that Clause 13 is designed to ensure that appropriate visits are undertaken for children in care who enter custody. That is welcome, but young people who go into custody are at particular risk of losing contact with their lead local authority professional, or people in the system who they know. The amendment therefore has particular importance for the many looked-after children who go into custody. It responds to the concerns of the Youth Justice Board that, under the new legislation, local authorities do not absolve themselves of responsibilities regarding children in care when they are brought into contact with youth offending teams. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000134"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0007.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="0801171000301"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> Regular visits by a social worker to looked-after children have rightly been identified as one of the key mechanisms to ensure that a child's needs are met and that the care plan remains appropriate. The amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, is intended to define  more precisely which staff in local authorities should carry out the new visiting duties under the clause. We agree with her that it is important that children are visited by people who they know and who have  been involved in planning their care. We will make clear in guidance that that should generally be the case.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000135"></a>However, we do not believe that it would be helpful to be prescriptive in the Bill as to which staff in a local authority can carry out that very important representative role. For example, it may be appropriate for visits to be made by other members of children's social work teams under the supervision of a qualified social worker. At certain points in a child's life, the most appropriate person may be a personal adviser or another member of staff employed by the local authority, especially where a child or young person is moving into a different stage of their life and requires  the support of someone with different skills and experience.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000136"></a>At times, it may also be necessary for an experienced member of staff to visit the child, even where they are not previously known to the child&#151;perhaps because the child has indicated that an urgent visit is necessary and the familiar representative is unavailable, perhaps due to leave or sickness. The circumstances in which that may happen cannot properly be described as truly exceptional but, in our view, it is more important that the child is visited regularly by a person with the appropriate skills to carry out the functions of the job, and that the authority is responsive to the child's request for support, than that visits are delayed until a visitor who is known to the child or previously involved in the child's case is found. Being unduly prescriptive in the Bill could work against the best interests of the child, so we do not feel minded to accept the

<p><a name="0801171000148"></a>The noble Lord said: It is unfortunate that our time is almost up just as we are about to deal with this group. The last time we met time was short when we were about to deal with an important grouping on healthcare, which I suspect was similarly proscribed.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000149"></a>Much of what lies behind my amendment has come out in many other amendments, particularly those recently raised by my noble friend Lady Meacher, which is not surprising. Members of the Committee may remember that in the report entitled <I>Managing Offenders, Reducing Crime</I>, by the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, a point was made that prisons and probation were silos and he wanted to try to bring the silos together. I did not dispute the fact that they were silos, but an unfortunate fact about custody&#151;particularly prison custody&#151;is that for too long it has been conducted in isolation from things such as healthcare. For example, it was not until 2004 that the NHS became responsible for healthcare in prisons and it is only recently that the departments running education have been responsible for education in prisons. Therefore, they have been isolated from what has been going on in the mainstream which has affected all those who go into custody.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000150"></a>When I was the chief inspector, I discovered to my horror that there was a Victorian idea that prison amounted to what they called a living death. Therefore, when you went into prison you lost all rights to citizenship, which included, for example, the right to vote. It seems to me that this Bill brings an opportunity to put right some things which, when inspecting prisons, I had seen were wrong. From my very first visit to a young offender institution I was appalled to see the treatment meted out to children. However, having very fortunately been introduced to the then director of the Association of Directors of  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC563"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC563</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Social Services&#151;the very good director of social services for Portsmouth&#151;I asked him to send one of his inspectors with me when we went to a juvenile establishment. She looked at the treatment and the conditions there and said that if that had been a local secure home it would have been closed because of the treatment of, and the conditions for, the young children.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000151"></a>That night, after the inspector had told me that, I met a former corporal of mine who was responsible for the reception of young people. Normally the shifts stopped at 8 pm, but he told me that he always stayed until at least 9 pm because people would arrive late. Sure enough, just before 9 pm, a van arrived from an exchange point at a young offender establishment, Glen Parva in Leicestershire. Among those who got out was a 16 year-old boy from Hull who had gone to court that morning. He did not know that he was to be put inside, but he was then put in a van and sent to Glen Parva and finally ended up in this place, Onley, near Rugby, just after 9 pm. No one knew where he was; he was in tears; he was confused and luckily this man began to talk to him and he let fly something which I had not appreciated before. Although, on occasions, it was possible to get in touch with the parents of such people, there was one group about whom they felt helpless and that was those who came from care because no one was responsible for them. Allegedly, when they went into care they ceased to have any right of access to the various things that care can provide.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000152"></a>I have raised this before, but all of us are very conscious of the intense humanity of the Minister, which he has demonstrated throughout the Committee and in other debates in the House. It is marvellous and we are thrilled about it. But I have to say to him again that I was enormously disappointed by the sentence in his letter of 3 December saying that the Government did not accept that young people in custody required to be looked after, or for the state to assume a formal parenting role for them. I submit that that is totally and utterly wrong, quite apart from being against the spirit of everything that has been raised in every amendment throughout this Committee. I was also slightly concerned by the Minister&#146;s comment on Amendment No. 62 that young people lost status as a result of going into custody. That must be extinguished from every statute book in this country in 2008, and it ought to have been done before.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000153"></a>Looking at the amendments again as a result of what has been said, I was wrong to have put in that this applies only to a young person aged 18 or over, because I believe from what we have said that that ought to be extended. The purpose is to make certain that, when someone goes into custody, the person who has been responsible for them as their care officer before they go in should remain with them during the time that they are in there. That is given particular relevance by the Detention and Training Order conditions, which provide that very soon after a young offender goes in there is a case conference to which parents are invited. The Youth Justice Board will tell you that in about 60 per cent of cases a parent  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC564"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC564</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>attends that case conference and therefore they are kept in touch with what is going to happen to the young offender. Then another important conference takes place before release. That conference should be attended by the person who has been overseeing what has been going on and who is going to oversee the important transition into society. That includes things like making certain that there is accommodation, that there is something to do and that drug treatment or healthcare is continued, in addition to what the youth offending team leader has to do as a professional responsibility. That is the human, care bit; that is what care is all about.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000154"></a>We have heard the figures relating to the number of people in custody who have experience of care. Some of them have had huge numbers of interventions over a period and there has never been any consistency to them. Custody is a very stressful time, and continuity of care is more important during the period of custody than at any other time that we have been talking about. That must go over.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000155"></a>This is not helped by the fact that, at present, thanks to overcrowding, young offenders are sent miles away from home. Here is an opportunity. The Minister for Children says that she wants to be responsible for the administration of justice for juveniles. Here is a case for supporting the fact that children should not be sent too far away from home so that they are not separated from their care worker, who must be helped to maintain conference with them. That is why I tabled the amendments. What I have found most interesting during this Committee is that so many other amendments have in a way led up to this one and have emphasised that this has been missing from the way in which we conduct things for far too long. I hope that we will be able to put that right in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

In supporting the amendment, I immensely look forward to what my noble friend Baroness Massey will have to say. When the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has spoken on these issues, it is a brave person who tries to say anything else, because he has so much experience and so much genuine commitment&#151;I do not hesitate to make the point again that all that is underlined in its significance by the fact that he has a distinguished military career behind him. That is not altogether an expected starting point for someone who has done those things.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000157"></a>The more disrupted the life is, the more important continuity is and the more important stable points of reference become. Therefore, the amendment is crucial. We constantly speak about our objective being rehabilitation. Is it rehabilitation or not? How on earth will we maximise the prospects of rehabilitation if, at a very sad period of their lives, we subject people to further disruption? Obviously, there will be some disruption by their internment, but we ought to turn that as far as we can into an opportunity to strengthen the processes of continuity and support, not undermine them.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC565"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC565</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000158"></a>I could speak at great length on my amendment, or I could speak briefly. Obviously, I must do the second. First, I am immensely grateful for the extraordinarily good legal advice that I had on how the amendment should be drafted. I say thank you in a big way. The purpose of the amendment is something about which I feel at least as passionately as does the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, on a whole range of issues of human policy. I have come to the conclusion that, until we make it abundantly clear that under no circumstances do people in those age groups who are going to be interned go anywhere but to a special institution designed for that age group, there will inevitably be processes of rationalisation that say, &#147;In this case, we make an exception and we will lump them together where a place is available&#148;, for whatever reasons.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000159"></a>That has gone on too long. Of course, I oversimplify and am in danger of distorting, but my starting point is that no one in that age group should be in prison. That is not a place in which rehabilitation of the young can be achieved. I have heard those whom I greatly respect on human rights and social policy say that to say never is not reasonable because there will always be exceptions. I am afraid that I have come to the contrary conclusion. I have come to the conclusion that if you have provision for exceptions, exceptions will too often become the rule of the day. Until we have that principle firmly established and laid down in black and white, we will never make sufficient provision for that to happen. Therefore, my second amendment is about that. I cannot say how strongly I believe it to be necessary.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000160"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0801171000307"></a>Baroness Massey of Darwen:</b> Time is against us, but I rise to support Amendment No. 67 and to speak to my Amendment No. 79. I have the greatest respect for the two previous speakers, and they have said a great deal with which I agree. I welcome the new approach of the Government to youth justice. There is much to be gained from it, such as the amalgamation of various departments into the Youth Justice and Children Unit. On Amendment No. 67, I merely wanted to quote from the position paper of the Standing Committee for Youth Justice, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0801171000243"></a>&#147;The treatment of children in trouble with the law should be underpinned by a commitment to children's human rights, as enshrined in the UNCRC ... Children who offend should be treated as children first. Youth justice legislation should be consistent with and complementary to all other legislation dealing with children&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0801171000213"></a>We are short of time, but we will return time and time again to the issue of children in custody, because it is very serious.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000161"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 79 is to ensure that children and young people who have been detained in custody for more than 13 weeks and were not previously looked after by a local authority have access to the same level of support as children and young people leaving local authority care or accommodation. It ensures that support is provided for a vulnerable group of children. It amends the leaving care provisions in the Children Act 1989, which were inserted by the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000.</p>




<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC566"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC566</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000162"></a>Children who are detained in custody have very similar needs and vulnerabilities to looked-after children. Many of them will have experienced periods of being looked after before entering the secure estate. They need considerable support when returning to the community, as evidenced by the very high rates of reoffending, which have been quoted time and again. Seventy per cent reoffend within 12 months. It is a disgrace that we can put up with these figures. Children and young people in contact with the youth justice system have high levels of need across health and social care&#151;we have discussed this over and over again. One-third of young offenders have a mental health need, and around half have problems with peer and family relationships. One-third have significant problems with education or work. Two-thirds of young offenders come from backgrounds where the family structure has broken down, and one-third have been looked after by the local authority at some point. Three-quarters of them have a history of temporary or permanent school exclusion, and poor attendance levels are also common. One-quarter of children and young people in contact with the youth justice system have learning disabilities, and there are high levels of speech, language and communication difficulties among them. They are indeed a very needy group.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000163"></a>Including these children in the definition of &#147;relevant child&#148; would place local authorities under a duty to appoint a personal adviser for them, to carry out a needs assessment on them and to develop a pathway plan based on their identified needs. The local authority would also be under a duty to provide accommodation and maintenance if they were needed and should provide assistance to achieve the goals set out in the pathway plan. Youth offending team workers&#146; powers are limited. The RAP project by the Youth Justice Board is still being evaluated; there are positive results, but it is in a number of pilot sites only and for people with mental health or substance misuse problems. It is quite limited. There is lots of evidence of poor planning pre-release and a lack of support once back in the community. YOP workers focus on offending issues, not always on wider welfare needs. They simply cannot do both. Once the licence is finished or the sentence completed, youth offending teams tend to close a case, regardless of whether the child and his family have ongoing needs.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000164"></a>We are talking about some of the most vulnerable children in society. They are likely to be children in need in accordance with Section 17 of the Children Act 1989, and they will need support to achieve well-being in the five outcomes in the Children Act 2004. Because of their age and the fact that they have been detained, it is extremely unlikely that social workers in children and families social care departments will take on their cases. It is therefore better to focus on the kind of support provided to care leavers. It is not necessarily a costly exercise. Overall, we are talking about a small number of children, and ultimately costs will surely be saved because it will assist in reducing reoffending and the need for further custodial sentences. It will help young people make a contribution to society. All children

These amendments build that support into policy and systems. I stress that in the long term it will save money.</p>

Then we throw our hands up in horror and wonder why so many young people reoffend. I was happy to put my name to Amendment No. 67 because I remember vividly comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, in a debate in 2006 when he quoted from a publication entitled, <I>Tell Them Not To Forget About Us</I>. Too often, these children are forgotten, falling as they do between two systems. In the report, children expressed a real fear of being forgotten in the midst of the confusion. This amendment would ensure that they should not feel that fear again and would provide the continuity that may, as the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, said, go some considerable way to stop them reoffending.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000166"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0008.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0801171000309"></a>Lord Williamson of Horton:</b> I am sure the Minister will recall that I am a benevolent Member of the Committee and that I have been remarkably restrained in my interventions. On these amendments we are faced with a policy decision, which is quite simple; namely, should there be assistance in the interests of the child and the continuity of the supervision of his or her interests for looked-after children in custody? The case for that is strong and we should support these amendments.</p>

This is the second time that we have been pushed on probably the two most important amendments. I shall make three points. First, it is vital that we support this group of children. We need to accept that the cost of rehabilitation has to be faced because we have failed up to this time. Secondly, the emphasis on prevention must be maintained above all. If we have failed, prevention of further reoffending, as the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, has said, is crucial. I support the amendment.</p>

I can remember at least 10 times in the past 10 years that we have talked about these issues and have said how important it is to deal with this group of children. It is not cost effective not to get this right.</p>

Children and young people will be assured that they are not on their own and that someone who cares for them will come in.</p>

All custody in one respect is an institutional irony. In this sense, a person&#146;s conduct is so intolerable within the bounds of society that that person has to go outside the walls of society in the hope eventually that he or she will be able to come back and will be a more wholesome and acceptable member of that society. That is true of all prisoners of all ages. Of course, there are people who are so savage and dangerous that there is no place for them, save in custody.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000172"></a>There is also a dichotomy. I remember the maiden speech of the late Lord Lane, if only for the fact that I think that it was on the same day as I made my maiden speech in this House about 26 years ago. He was Lord Chief Justice of England and a lawyer of immense distinction. He said that in his view no person had ever been reformed by the fact of a prison sentence.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000173"></a>I remember thinking at the time: how does that square with Rule 1 of the Prison Rules 1964, which states that the first and dominant purpose of prison must be the reformation of the prisoner? That should still be our goal in appropriate cases and it most certainly must be our goal for children&#151;whether we speak of it as rehabilitation or reformation, it comes to very much the same thing. To suggest that in some way children have lost status and thereby are to be pariahs in the system would be entirely wrong.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000174"></a>I have immense regard for the Minister, who is a person of massive humanity, great ability and considerable commitment. It would be unworthy of him if he were to reject the amendment on that basis. There may be other bases. I appreciate that with many of the amendments, one could say that, marginally, it might be better for it to be in the statute than not. This is no such case. These are not truncated adults. It may be argued that an adult has made a social contract with society that he does not want to have the rights of the citizen. You cannot say that of a child. We are imprisoning more children than any other country in western Europe. I said in the House some weeks ago that we are imprisoning more children than Germany, France, the Netherlands and Norway put together.</p>

<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC569"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC569</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="0801171000176"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0008.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="0801171000316"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham&#151;as do other Members of the Committee&#151;brings huge experience and expertise on the issue of young people in custody. We appreciate that the intention behind the amendments is to seek to guarantee that local authorities provide the right kind of support to young people in custody whom they have looked after or who remain in their care. I stress that children who are looked after because they are the subject of care orders do not lose looked-after status when they enter custody. I emphasise that that is the context in which the remarks that I made in my letter to the noble Lord should be interpreted.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000177"></a>Local authorities share parental responsibility for that group of children and, like any reasonable parent, they should arrange to visit those children in custody and plan for their support in the community once the custodial part of their sentence comes to an end. We are making the visiting requirement explicit through Clause 13. Furthermore, as part of our wider Care Matters programme, when we revise the regulations and guidance to the Children Act 1989, we will be emphasising the responsibilities of local authorities towards the children in their care who are in custody; setting out basic standards for their support. For example, we will be requiring local authorities to convene a statutory review of the child&#146;s care plan chaired by an independent reviewing officer prior to any child in care being discharged from custody. The purpose of that crucial meeting will be to make sure that there are proper, realistic arrangements in place to support the child when they leave custody&#151;arrangements that include making sure that there is a placement available to them that can meet their needs. I believe that that goes some way to meeting the concerns set out by the noble Lord in his amendments.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80116-gc0009.htm"/>


<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000178"></a>Beyond that first group of children, other children acquire looked-after status by virtue of being remanded to or serving their sentences in accommodation provided by the local authority, under Section 21 of the Children Act 1989. That group of children will also benefit from the new duty on local authorities to arrange visits to all looked-after children under the provisions of Clause 13, which will apply to all looked-after children regardless of where they are living.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000179"></a>In addition, we have made clear our intention to use the delegated powers in Clause 13 to impose a requirement for local authorities to arrange visits to those looked-after children who lose that status when they enter custody&#151;namely, those voluntarily accommodated under Section 20 of the Children Act 1989. This further change will ensure that these children continue to receive the support they need and that the local authority is aware of their likely needs when they are discharged.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000180"></a>We are determined that local authority staff visit and remain in touch with any child who has been in their care who enters custody, whether in a secure children&#146;s home, secure training centre, young offender institution or prison. The purpose of these visits will be to assess the young person&#146;s needs and establish the kind of continuing support that will be necessary to resettle the young person back into the  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC570"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC570</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>community. For some young people this will involve ensuring that on release from custody they are provided with appropriate accommodation and continue to be &#147;looked after&#148; by the local authority. I hope, therefore, that the noble Lord will recognise that our new section has been designed to meet many of the objectives that he set out in Amendment  No. 67.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000181"></a>In addition to visits these children will also be entitled to receive advice, support and assistance when they seek it. Once the Bill is enacted, officials from my department, the Ministry of Justice and the Prison Service will seek to develop policies to encourage greatly improved contact between looked-after and previously looked-after children in custody and their responsible local authorities.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000182"></a>I turn to aspects of Amendment No. 67 that differ from Clause 13. Where a young person aged over 18 is eligible for care leaving services, the local authority already owes a number of statutory duties towards them. All care leavers aged 18 to 21 must be provided with a pathway plan agreed by the young person and a personal adviser. A visit to the young person is necessarily implied by the personal adviser&#146;s role in developing the pathway plan with the young person in custody, to have a face to face conversation about planning their resettlement. It will, of course, be essential that the personal adviser liaises with other agencies, including the probation services and housing services, about these resettlement issues.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000183"></a>I can tell the noble Lord that revision of regulations and guidance that apply to local authority services for care leavers will include additional emphasis on the particular responsibilities of local authorities for arranging the right kind of support on a multi-agency basis for care leavers who have experienced custody.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000184"></a>Finally, proposed new Subsection 1(c) of Amendment No. 67 imposes a duty on local authorities to visit children formerly looked after who have been released from custody. We do not believe that it is necessary to extend the duty to visit in this way, since as I have explained, where children are the subject of care orders or where they are aged 16 to 18 and entitled to care leaving services as relevant children, the local authority will be responsible for their accommodation and maintenance and will be actively planning for their future into legal adulthood and beyond.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000185"></a>Where children who were voluntarily accommodated have lost their looked-after status because they have entered custody, one of the purposes of visiting them in custody will be to establish the kind of support that they will need on release. Depending on their needs, this could involve them becoming looked after again, which might be appropriate in certain circumstances, in which case the local authority will necessarily be involved to offer them accommodation and support on release; or it could involve supporting them in the community and again we would expect the local authority to work with their family, the youth offending team and other agencies in this case.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000186"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 68 in the name of my noble friend Lord Judd. I fully appreciate his concern that young people who are sent to custody should be  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC571"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC571</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>placed in accommodation that is appropriate to their needs. The new clause proposes that anyone under the age of 20 who receives a custodial sentence should be placed in local authority secure accommodation; that is, in a secure children&#146;s home. We do not believe that this specific proposal is either practical or desirable. The new clause would apply to a wide age range, considerably wider than that of young people who may be tried in the youth court and one effect would be to require that 19 year-old adults are placed in a children&#146;s home, perhaps alongside 12 year-olds. No one would deny that a twelve year-old, even one who has committed a very serious crime, is a young and vulnerable child. In law, a 19 year-old is an adult. We do not believe that it would be realistic or practical to place children in the same setting as potentially dangerous adults, yet this would be one implication of my noble friend&#146;s Amendment No. 68.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000187"></a>It is true that the new clause proposed by my noble friend enables the Secretary of State to make regulations, a power which could possibly be used to require local authorities to provide different establishments for different age groups. That would not be immediately practical, and the funding necessary to decommission much of the current secure estate in favour of completely new types of secure establishment that might resemble secure children&#146;s homes would be considerable.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000188"></a>The volume of local authority secure accommodation has declined over recent years. There are currently somewhat fewer than 400 places in secure children&#146;s homes in England and Wales. The majority of these are used by the Youth Justice Board to accommodate vulnerable young people who have been sentenced to custody. It would not be possible to accommodate all under-18s who are sentenced to custody in local authority secure accommodation, let alone the 18 and 19 year-olds which the new clause would also cover.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000189"></a>Since it assumed responsibility for commissioning and purchasing custodial places for under-18s in April 2000, the Youth Justice Board has created a diverse secure estate in which different types of establishment provide for different age groups and needs. We recognise that the balance of provision can be improved, with more accommodation specifically adapted to the needs of more vulnerable older boys in particular, and the Youth Justice Board is seeking to achieve this. But to move towards a single type of establishment to respond to the demands imposed by all children and young adults in custody under the age of 20 would be a retrograde and unnecessarily rigid provision.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000190"></a>The new clause would also make a number of amendments to existing legislation, with the aim of ensuring that young people are not sent to adult prisons. As my noble friend is aware&#151;he took part in the debates&#151;this was subject to extensive debate both in Committee and on Report on the Offender Management Bill, where my right honourable and learned friend the Attorney-General explained that all young people over 17 who are remanded to custody are technically in prison from a legal point of view, even though they are remanded to a young offender institution appropriate to their age group. To  


<notus-date day="16" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC572"></a><b>16 Jan 2008 : Column GC572</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>remove the power to place in prison, as in my noble friend&#146;s amendment, would, I am informed, undermine the remand system and make it unworkable.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000191"></a>However, we very much share the concern expressed by my noble friend and other Members of the Committee that children and young people in custody need to be given the best possible chance of reform and rehabilitation. We agree that children who remain looked after, or who were looked after immediately before entering custody, should be provided with improved support on their release. Clause 13 seeks to deliver this objective.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000192"></a>I apologise for the length of my response, but hope that I have covered most of the points raised in the debate.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000193"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0009.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0801171000317"></a>Lord Judd:</b> Once again my noble friend has, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, illustrated his commitment, concern and compassion.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000194"></a>However, I am not convinced. We seem to be locked in a madhouse. We are about to expand the number of prisons available with huge sums of money. We know that prisons are not achieving the objective of rehabilitation that they should. A time when we are committing so much of the taxpayer&#146;s money to building new prisons is surely the time to steer away from the finding ourselves trapped by the provision that we have inherited. It is time to say that some of this money should go into purpose-built secure units where people can receive the kind of attention and support that they deserve. My noble friend has alluded to it but, if I have been disturbed by nothing else, I have been disturbed by the number of self-harming and suicide cases with which we have been confronted in this age group.</p>

<a name="80116-gc0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0801171000195"></a>Those are the extremes. We know that the situation is generally not helping the rehabilitation process. If we are to find new resources, it is time that we found them for methods that can tackle the task at hand.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000196"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0009.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="0801171000318"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> There have been no suicides in local authority secure units, whereas there have been in other parts of the secure estate for children. It is well recognised that keeping those children reasonably near their homes is crucial for the success of rehabilitation. That is only possible if one has smaller units, such as local authority secure units. A teacher in a secure training centre described the provision of children leaving secure training centres as like falling off the edge of a cliff. There is much to be said for what the noble Lord, Lord Judd, suggests.</p>

<p><a name="0801171000197"></a><b><a name="80116-gc0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0801171000319"></a>Lord Elystan-Morgan:</b> I tender a sincere and heartfelt apology to the Minister. When I heard the quotation from the correspondence with the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and the reference to status, I thought that there must be&#151;I could not believe my ears&#151;a reference to some loss of human status or of social status. That clearly was not intended and I hope that the Minister will accept the apology in the spirit in which it is tendered.</p>

The Government have considered the SSRB report and will today table Motions that will be debated in the House of Commons on 24 January.

MPs and Ministers are paid by the public purse. The Government are committed to ensuring that public sector pay awards remain consistent with the continued achievement of the inflation target of 2 per cent.

It would be a significant constitutional reform for MPs to be explicitly removed from the process of voting on and determining their own pay and pensions. In some other countries, elected representatives' pay and pensions are determined entirely independently of the legislature. We hope to draw on this international experience so as to find a suitable mechanism that will work within our parliamentary system.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08011679000025"></a>The Government believe the SSRB recommendation on pay for 2007-08 should be staged, with 0.84 per cent increase backdated to 1 April 2007 and a further 1.06 per cent backdated to 1 November 2007. This would give a 1.9 per cent increase across the year 2007-08 and a final salary of &#163;61,820.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="08011679000026"></a>With respect to pay for future years, the Government consider that MPs' pay in the future (including 2008-09) should be determined by a mechanism that is independent of MPs' votes and therefore does not propose taking forward the SSRB recommendations pending Sir John Baker's review of both the appropriate comparator and mechanism for determining MPs' pay.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08011679000027"></a>SSRB has also recommended increasing the London Supplement from &#163;2,812 to &#163;3,500, backdated to 1 April 2007. The Government do not accept this proposal.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08011679000029"></a>Ministers' pay is set under the Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975. SSRB recommends that the salaries for the Prime Minister, Ministers and other office holders in the Commons should increase more than the salary of MPs. The Government do not accept the proposal and believe that ministerial salaries should increase at the same rate as MPs.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08011679000031"></a>SSRB makes recommendations to change severance pay for Ministers who leave office. The recommendations are that Ministers or other office holders who are reappointed to a salaried government or parliamentary post within three months of leaving office should keep a pro rata severance payment and the balance repaid. SSRB recommends abolishing the age bar of 65 that currently applies to severance payments.</p>

The Government accept this principle and propose that the supplements be increased in line with the increases in MPs' salaries.</p>

<a name="80116-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08011679000035"></a>In respect of pensions, the SSRB has proposed the introduction of an optional one-60th accrual rate. The Government accept this proposal in principle and are prepared to introduce it when the change can be made as part of a cost neutral package.</p>

<a name="80116-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="08011679000036"></a>SSRB makes a number of recommendations aimed at limiting the cost to the taxpayer of parliamentary pensions. These include the 50:50 sharing between members and the Exchequer of future increases or decreases in pension cost pressures, and restricting the underlying Exchequer contribution to the scheme (other than in respect of the deficit identified at the last valuation) to a maximum of 20 per cent of payroll. The SSRB also recommends that there should be a review of parliamentary pension provision if the costs are rising significantly such that the 20 per cent cap on the Exchequer contribution is likely to be breached. These recommendations are consistent with the approach being taken in public service pension schemes generally and the Government accept them. The Government propose that the detail of the arrangements should be worked up in consultation with the trustees of the parliamentary pension scheme so that it can be taken into account by the Government Actuary in his 2008 valuation of the scheme.</p>

<a name="80116-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="08011679000037"></a>The SSRB recommendations on MPs' pensions apply also to Ministers' pensions and the government position on these is as set out above.</p>

<a name="80116-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="08011679000038"></a>SSRB recommends that future holders of the offices of Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor and Commons Speaker are covered by the parliamentary pension and severance arrangements that apply to Secretaries of State rather than the pension arrangements that apply now. The Government accept this recommendation with respect to Prime Ministers and Lord Chancellors. The Government do not propose to implement this recommendation with respect to future Commons Speakers, as it considers the position of Speaker to be substantially different from that of a Prime Minister or Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08011679000041"></a>The SSRB makes several recommendations on changes to parliamentary allowances including those on:</p>
staffing expenditure;expenditure on offices;communication expenditure;expenditure on travel;compensation for leaving office; and a range of other matters
<a name="80116-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="08011679000042"></a>Given the detailed nature of the proposals, the Government propose that they should be referred to the Members Estimate Committee to examine in light of observations by the Advisory Panel on Members' Allowances.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="08011679000044"></a>The SSRB proposes that increases in pay for Lords Ministers are aligned with that of increases in Commons Ministers' pay in accordance with current practice. The Government accept this recommendation. It is proposed that Lords Ministers' pay will be increased by 1.95 per cent for 2007-08 in line with the proposed increase in MPs&#146; pay, and that from 1 April 2008, increases in Lords Ministers' pay will be made via the same mechanism as for MPs and other Ministers.</p>

<a name="80116-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="08011679000045"></a>Recommendations on MPs pensions will also apply to Lords Ministers' pensions&#151;the Government's position is as for Ministers within the Commons. The age bar that currently applies for severance pay will also be abolished for Lords Ministers as for Ministers within the Commons.</p>

<a name="80116-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="08011679000046"></a>Additionally, the Government agree on the proposal to continue the existing salary arrangements for the Leader of the Opposition, Opposition Chief Whip, Chairman of Committees and Deputy Chairman of Committees. Related to this, the Government accept the SSRB recommendation which seeks to peg the salary of the Lord Speaker on a &#147;mark time&#148; basis pending the next review of parliamentary pay or reform of the House of Lords.</p>

<a name="80116-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08011679000047"></a>Until recently the Lord Chancellor was head of the judiciary as well as Speaker of the House of Lords, and is entitled in legislation to a salary &#163;2,500 higher than the Lord Chief Justice. Given that the post no longer now has those functions, the SSRB recommends that where the post of Lord Chancellor is held by someone who also holds another ministerial post, that person should receive only the salary for the ministerial post. The Government accept this recommendation.</p>

<a name="80116-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="08011679000048"></a>The SSRB made three recommendations on Lords&#146; allowances: on the extension of the spouses', civil partners' and children's travel entitlement to include a named partner; for reviews of the definition of parliamentary business for the purpose of the subsistence allowance; and for a review of IT support for Members. These recommendations should be considered in the first instance by the House Committee.</p>

No additional funding has therefore been made available to local authorities in connection with enforcement of part L of the building regulations.</p>

<a name="80116w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="080116116000054"></a>Post-completion checks on the whole of part L are not required in law although the Government did introduce mandatory pressure testing of new homes in 2006. This is an important part of local authorities' role and they are expected to ensure that such a test is undertaken before a completion certificate is issued. Building control is, however, a devolved service and no central targets are currently set for local authority building control departments on this or any other element of compliance.</p>

<a name="80116w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="080116116000055"></a>Part L was last revised in April 2006 and was accompanied by a major dissemination and training exercise with the aim of improving compliance. As new houses are only now being built and completed to the revised standards, a post-implementation review of levels of compliance before now would have been premature. An independent assessment of compliance with part L (2006) is, however, due to begin shortly, and will form part of our preparations for the further revision of part L planned for 2010.</p>

Natural England's concerns for trees and woods are, however, very similar to those of the Tree Council and much of what it does throughout the year is consistent with the aims of Tree Week. This includes its work on protecting and managing special sites and their wildlife, understanding the needs of trees, woods and associated species, and promoting the use and enjoyment of woods and other special places.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_104"></a><a name="080116116000260"></a>The Uzbek authorities tightly control religious practice. A degree of tolerance is permitted to traditional churches which are seen as non-proselytising Christian groups; for example, Russian Orthodox Christians and Catholics. However, proselytising groups such as Jehovah's Witnesses are not able to register and even those which are registered, such as Baptists, can experience regular harassment and are vulnerable to criminal charges for unregistered religious activity or civil charges for possession of books or religious materials which the authorities regard as &#147;missionary&#148;.</p>
