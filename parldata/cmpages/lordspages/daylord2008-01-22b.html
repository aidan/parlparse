These arrangements have removed the risk that short-term political factors can influence monetary policy, and ensure that interest rates are set in a forward-looking manner to meet the Government&#146;s symmetrical inflation target. There is absolutely no intention to change these arrangements, which have resulted in one of the lowest inflation rates in the G7 and interest rates of around half the average of the previous decade.</p>

Is that independence and the Bank&#146;s high reputation in that regard not going to be further undermined in the public&#146;s eye as that shambles continues? Furthermore, what will be the effect on the Bank and its status of the new powers anticipated for the Financial Services Authority?</p>

That is when the discussions will have concluded. On the broader question, the partners in the tripartite arrangement are in close contact all the time. It will be recognised that it is necessary for them to meet fairly regularly at a certain level, and they have done so over the past decade, which has contributed to the exceptional record of the British economy over that decade. The noble Lord will appreciate that the difficulties over Northern Rock necessitated additional meetings. However, he will appreciate, too, from my Answer, that we have no intention at all of changing the role of the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets the interest rates that relate to the question of controlling inflation in this country.</p>

Would my noble friend agree that not only does the Monetary Policy Committee have a remit to deal with inflation, but subject to that, in those famous three little words, the committee is supposed to be considering other matters&#151;namely, helping the British economy? Would he ensure that the Treasury emphasises that to the Monetary Policy Committee, not that I suggest that it would panic in the same way as the Federal Reserve in America is doing&#151;but at least to take account of the possible panic affecting us here?</p>

Of course, he will take delight in the fact that the British economy at present not only has the second lowest rate of inflation in the G7 but has a very high employment rate indeed. I know that he stresses the successes of the Monetary Policy Committee in its concern that the economy should grow and employment levels should be high.</p>

It is clear, is it not, that the arrangement for removing banking supervision from the Bank of England and giving it to the FSA has not been successful, to say the least? That is not because the then Chancellor was wrong to remove it from the Bank of England; there was a case for doing so. That case was to give it to an institution which had the sole purpose and remit of banking supervision. That is what needs to be done, as I wrote in my book&#151;</p>

Other voices have also commented on the developments over the past few months. All of us will appreciate that Northern Rock presented a unique and significant problem to the financial position in Britain at the time, and lessons are being learnt from that experience.</p>

This is not the first time that the FSA has been slow. Will he reassure the House that, when a new chair of the FSA is appointed later in the year, banking experience and an ability to take tough decisions quickly are part of that person's curriculum vitae?</p>

On the idea that the FSA should have acted earlier, these arrangements have been in place for more than a decade. Northern Rock produced a more significant shock to the system than anything that has been experienced over the past decade and lessons need to be learnt from that experience. The Government have given an undertaking that the FSA is looking closely at its operational requirements and we will come forward with proposals in the very near future.</p>

To accelerate the process at this time would do nothing for the stability of the economy or confidence in the Bank of England. We should follow a normal course for that appointment. It is such a crucial appointment. The timetable is well established. Everyone knows what that timetable is. The Government are not producing a road block: they are just following common sense.</p>

We are modernising the curriculum, which is an issue in respect of teaching geography. The new key stage 3 curriculum, which comes into force this September, will offer teachers greater freedom to teach topical, contemporary and relevant issues, such as climate change and globalisation, in order to engage and enthuse pupils. Part of the &#163;2 million action plan to which I referred goes towards sustained professional development for geography teachers, raising the quality of their skills in this area.</p>

Can the Minister comment on Ofsted&#146;s finding that concerns about health and safety are reducing the amount and effectiveness of field-work?

We do not have any evidence&#151;nor has Ofsted provided any&#151;that the number of children going on school trips is declining; indeed, from the anecdotal evidence that we have from schools, we think the opposite is the case. Research into residential education by the Scout Association and the Duke of Edinburgh&#146;s Award in 2005 found that 86 per cent of primary schools and 99 per cent of secondary schools offer pupils at least one residential education opportunity, of which outdoor education was the most popular type, so the opportunities do appear to be there.</p>

This is a major concern of the Royal Geographical Society&#151;I declare a rather ancient interest as a former president&#151;and it is of course a major focus of the Government&#146;s action plan for geography.

I should stress that there are 870 training places for geography this year, so a large number of new entrants to the profession are coming forward. Although the noble Lord is right to say that the numbers of those taking geography have been declining, it remains the fifth most popular optional GCSE subject, after English literature, history, French and art and design.

This is a wide-ranging Bill: it traverses youth justice, sentencing, anti-social behaviour, the risk management of violent and sex offenders, the law on self-defence and the possession of extreme pornographic images, to name but a few of its provisions. However wide ranging, at its core, this is a Bill about protecting the public, promoting the rehabilitation of reoffenders and further strengthening confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>

<a name="80122-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="08012268000079"></a>Much has been achieved in these areas in the last 10 years. Crime is down by one-third. Police numbers have increased by 14,000 and there has been significant investment in the prison and probation services. We have also set out, in response to the report by my noble friend Lady Corston, an action plan to improve provision and services for women, in order to tackle their offending at an earlier stage, particularly in the community and before they end up in custody.</p>

<a name="80122-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="08012268000080"></a>I am under no illusion, however, about how much more needs to be done. Crime needs to come down further, as do reconviction rates. Few in this House will take solace from the number of children and young people currently in custody. No one can pretend that these issues can be tackled by the passage of legislation alone, but criminal justice legislation has a contributory role to play in helping to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour, and in enhancing the protection of the public.</p>

<a name="80122-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="08012268000081"></a>Many of the provisions in this Bill build on successful innovations to be found in earlier legislation passed by the Government. The generic community sentence for adult offenders, crack-house closure powers and sexual offences prevention orders have all proved their worth in recent years. Why not apply those successes to other contexts, such as the punishment and rehabilitation of young offenders, tackling significant and persistent anti-social behaviour centred on particular premises and the protection of the public from violent offenders?</p>

<a name="80122-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="08012268000082"></a>Part 1 provides for the youth rehabilitation order. This new generic community order will simplify the sentencing structure for young offenders and enable the courts to tailor sentences to individual risks and needs. Over time the youth rehabilitation order should help to reduce offending and the number of young offenders sent to custody.</p>

<a name="80122-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="08012268000083"></a>Part 2 makes a number of reforms to sentencing. They build on the framework set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and reflect the experience of operating that Act over nearly three years now. The Government will always ensure sufficient prison places to accommodate those serious and dangerous offenders on whom the courts see fit to pass a custodial sentence. Over the past 10 years we have increased prison capacity by more than 20,000 places and, following the review by my noble friend Lord Carter of Coles, we will see capacity rise by a further 15,000 places to 96,000 places by 2012.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_128"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80122-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08012268000084"></a>My noble friend&#146;s remit was not just to look at the supply of prison places, but at the other side of the equation&#151;demand. We need to ensure that prison and probation resources are properly focused on serious, dangerous and violent offenders, with public safety coming first. The Bill contains a number of provisions to this end, many as a direct result of recommendations in my noble friend&#146;s report.</p>

<a name="80122-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08012268000085"></a>Public protection sentences are reformed to increase judicial discretion and refocus them on the most dangerous offenders. Credit will be given to offenders who spent time on bail subject to an electronically monitored curfew, in a similar way to the credit currently given in respect of time spent on remand. The two are clearly not analogous, which is reflected in the fact that the credit given will be at only the rate of half a day for each full day subject to curfew and then only when the terms of the curfew are adhered to.</p>

<a name="80122-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08012268000086"></a>Release and recall arrangements are also reformed, first, by bringing the arrangements for the recall of offenders sentenced under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 into line with the arrangements for those sentenced under the 2003 Act. Release arrangements for non-dangerous offenders sentenced under the 1991 Act to a sentence of four years and over will also be aligned with the release provisions in the 2003 Act. In addition, the Bill provides for a fixed 28-day recall period for non-dangerous offenders who breach the terms of their licence, restricting the use of suspended sentence orders to indictable and either-way offences, and restricting the availability of community sentences to imprisonable offences only. Lastly in this part, the Bill amends the Bail Act to restrict the grounds on which a person charged with an imprisonable summary offence may be refused bail. Taken together these measures will help ensure that the prisons system is put on a sound and sustainable long-term footing.</p>

<a name="80122-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08012268000087"></a>Part 3 deals with appeals and changes to the test applied by the Court of Appeal when considering an appeal against conviction. They contain significant differences to the provisions originally in the Bill when it was considered in the other place. Part 3 has been substantially revised. The Court of Appeal will retain the ability to quash any conviction, even in cases where the guilt of the appellant is not in doubt, when it is of the view that it would seriously undermine the proper administration of justice to allow the conviction to stand. This will enable the court to uphold the rule of law by taking account of serious misconduct by the police or the prosecuting authorities.</p>

<a name="80122-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08012268000088"></a>Parts 4 and 5 place the offices of the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman for England and Wales and of the Prisoner Ombudsman for Northern Ireland on a statutory footing. In placing what have previously been purely administrative arrangements on a firm statutory basis, it is the Government&#146;s view that the Bill would substantially enhance the standing and independence of the new commissioners. However, it is evident from public statements made by the current ombudsmen and by the Parliamentary Ombudsman that there is significant concern about the provisions. All three ombudsmen have argued for a different model that provides for direct accountability to Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08012268000089"></a>I want to make it clear that we wish to proceed with Parts 4 and 5 on the basis of a consensus if at all possible. In the absence of such a consensus at present, I advise the House that I intend to table amendments in Committee to withdraw these two parts. In doing so, I want to assure the House that the Government remain committed to placing these two important offices on a firm statutory basis. We will now enter into a period of further consultation with interested parties. We will need to be satisfied that any alternative statutory model will provide value for money and enhanced service. We hope that there will be an early opportunity for Parliament to return to this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08012268000090"></a>I refer in this section to the provisions in Clause 105 which extend the remit of Crown Prosecution Service designated caseworkers. The Government consider the deployment of designated caseworkers an efficient and effective means of dealing with straightforward advocacy in the magistrates&#146; courts, enabling Crown prosecutors to focus more effectively on the provision of advice and to devote more time to the preparation and handling of serious, complex and sensitive casework. The Government firmly believe that allowing designated caseworkers who are properly supervised, suitably trained and externally regulated to appear in a wider range of criminal hearings can only benefit the criminal justice system by delivering greater efficiencies through the more focused deployment of Crown prosecutors. This can be achieved without any drop in the level of service, not only to the courts and court users but, more importantly, to victims of crime and the public at large.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08012268000091"></a>In tackling the possession of extreme pornographic images, the Bill seeks to bring our controls on such violent and explicit material into the internet age. We can no longer control the circulation of this pernicious and potentially harmful material through legislation dealing with the traditional forms of publication and distribution. We have to look to an offence of possession. We want to ensure that the new offence hits the right target. In the other place, concerns were expressed that the offence went too wide. We understand that concern. I aim to bring forward amendments in Committee that will clarify the drafting of the offence and, I hope, put beyond doubt that the type of imagery found in popular mainstream films will not be covered by the offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08012268000092"></a>The prostitution-related provisions in this Bill make important changes to the Street Offences Act 1959, to remove the term &#147;common prostitute&#148; and introduce an alternative penalty to a fine for the offence of loitering or soliciting. This new order can be tailored to the specific needs of those involved in street-based prostitution, offering a more appropriate intervention which will address the causes of their offending behaviour. We expect the order to be supervised by someone already based in a dedicated support project who is already working with the individuals involved in prostitution and who will be able to continue working with the offender beyond the terms of the order. Those based in dedicated projects have the greatest expertise in dealing with the issues faced by those involved in prostitution and are best placed to deliver this role. These new orders will enable us at least to start to address the underlying

They will not of course provide an instant solution, but they must be a better alternative to a fine which offers those involved in prostitution no way out and the major problem of the revolving-door syndrome.</p>

<a name="80122-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08012268000093"></a>I have no doubt that the new offences of inciting homophobic hatred will attract much debate in this House, and rightly so. In constructing the offences we have been very conscious of the need to balance the protection of the gay and lesbian community from material inciting hatred with the right to freedom of expression. We believe that we have struck the right balance in the Bill. The new offence will apply only to threatening words and behaviour intended to stir up hatred on grounds of sexual orientation. Given that high threshold, and all the other safeguards, including the consent of the Attorney-General to any prosecution, we do not consider that a saving is needed to protect expressions of criticism or antipathy towards homosexual practices. If such expressions are not threatening and not intended to incite hatred, they will not be covered by the offence. If they are, then they should not be excluded. This was debated in the other place, and the other place rejected such a saving by a considerable margin.</p>

<a name="80122-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08012268000094"></a>Clause 128 provides a valuable clarification of the law on the use of force in self-defence. It will help to reinforce public confidence that the criminal justice system is on their side when they act in self-defence, whether in protection of themselves or their property, or when acting as responsible citizens in seeking to prevent the commission of an offence.</p>

<a name="80122-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08012268000095"></a>Part 9 provides for violent offender orders. Those orders will provide a means of continuously protecting the public from some of the most dangerous violent offenders who still present a high risk at the end of their sentence, when there are no other means for public protection authorities to manage their risk. Violent offender orders will therefore be an essential risk-management tool by enabling the closure of that gap in supervision arrangements. Violent offender orders will be available only in cases where there has been a previous conviction for a serious violent offence and where an individual is considered to pose a risk of serious violent harm.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08012268000096"></a>Part 13 includes reserve powers to restore the statutory prohibition on inducing prison officers to take industrial action. I should like to make it very clear to the House that we have taken that step reluctantly, following the decision of the Prison Officers&#146; Association, the union representing prison officers, to withdraw from the current voluntary joint industrial relations partnership agreement. Our hope is that it will be possible to agree with the Prison Officers&#146; Association, before Royal Assent, a new dispute resolution and trade union recognition agreement which puts industrial relations within the Prison Service on a sounder long-term footing and which ensures that the working of our prisons is not disrupted by industrial action. Such action can never be justified in the prison context, not least because of the real and immediate adverse impact to the health and welfare of the prison population. Were a new voluntary agreement which includes

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08012268000097"></a>Finally, I want to alert your Lordships to one new provision&#151;a not uninteresting provision at that. The House will be aware that on Report in another place a new clause was tabled, and subsequently withdrawn, which provided for the abolition of the common-law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel. In the other place, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Maria Eagle, advised that the Government would be conducting a short, sharp consultation with the churches, particularly the Church of England, on that matter. Subject to the outcome of that consultation, it is our aim to bring forward amendments to the Bill to abolish those essentially obsolete offences. I cannot give a guarantee, but I hope that it will be possible to table any such amendments in time for Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08012268000100"></a>I described this Bill as wide ranging in my introductory remarks. It is wide-ranging and important, dealing with many significant issues which have a direct and immediate impact on our communities and the workings of the criminal justice system. The Bill will strengthen and safeguard those communities. I am sure that the House will wish to scrutinise the Bill carefully and the Government welcome that. With those concluding remarks, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

On this occasion, I offer my commiserations. We all know that it is not his fault and that he has to do as he is told. However, he must know that it is something of a farce.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08012268000105"></a>In this time of rising violent crime&#151;and there is absolutely no point trying to deny that it is such a time&#151;when the Government themselves are proposing that metal detectors be installed in schools to keep out knives and prisons are overcrowded, they bring forward a Bill like this, which has no coherence or theme and which has grown like Topsy since it was first introduced in another place. It has grown from one to two volumes, from 240 to 358 pages, from 129 to 202 clauses and, I think, from 23 to 38 schedules.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08012268000106"></a>The Minister comes before us today&#151;the poor Minister&#151;to say that they are proposing to remove two parts of that Bill, one of which was introduced only at Report in another place. Two parts&#151;of 48 clauses&#151;and, I presume, something in the order of nine of the 38 schedules will have to be struck out. This looks like chaos in legislation.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08012268000107"></a>As the noble Lord made clear, the Bill is wide-ranging in covering the criminal justice and law spectrum. We have the youth rehabilitation orders, sentencing and appeals. We were going to have the new Commissioner for Offender Management and Prisons for both the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. However, we understand&#151;because there is allegedly no consensus&#151;that that is going to be taken out. I do not know if it is a lack of a consensus on our part which has meant that it needs to be taken out or whether it is some other lack of consensus. No doubt the noble Lord will tell us in due course.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08012268000108"></a>We are to deal with bail, legal aid and, in the criminal law parts of the Bill, with pornography, sexual offences, hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation, prostitution, self-defence and more. We have parts dealing with international co-operation, violent offender orders, anti-social behaviour, policing and clauses dealing with the question of whether prison officers can go on strike, as well as immigration issues.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08012268000109"></a>We must be grateful that the Minister did not go through the Bill clause by clause or we might have been here for a very long time indeed, but he has given us some idea of what is in the Bill, and I imagine that we will spend a considerable time on it when we reach the Committee stage. I mention all this to make it clear that, as I have said, there is a lack of theme to the Bill. There is no consistent message, but a whole series of measures&#151;good, bad and indifferent, although I might have said good, bad and ugly. It is a sort of spaghetti western of a Bill. But we shall give all these parts close scrutiny in due course because some were barely discussed in another place; I shall get to those later on. The Minister himself would accept that we have a duty to look forward to what I suspect will be for him quite a testing Committee stage. In the presence of his colleague the noble Lord, Lord West, I hope that he will have some assistance from the Home Office and, looking at the sponsors in another place, possibly from Ministers in other departments such as the Department for  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_133"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Children, Schools and Families, which also seems to be involved, and no doubt the appropriate officials from all those departments.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08012268000110"></a>Like the Minister, I do not have time to go through the Bill clause by clause, but I do want to say just something about certain aspects of it. I am sure that other noble Lords will highlight other areas. However, I should make it clear that while on this occasion my noble friend Lady Hanham is not speaking at Second Reading, she will be joining us in Committee to deal with some of the Home Office aspects, particularly those related to immigration.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08012268000111"></a>I shall start by saying a little about youth rehabilitation orders, covered in Part 1. On this occasion I should like to offer the Minister a small degree of comfort by saying that I think we can give this measure some support, while expressing a considerable degree of concern about the potential inflexibility of the orders. We will need to know more about them and we shall certainly want to pursue some amendments to see how they fit together, particularly whether orders related to treatment for substance or alcohol abuse could be made compulsory. We need to make a detailed examination of this first part.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08012268000112"></a>In Part 2 we move on to dealing with sentencing. As the noble Lord made clear, this part will make some profound changes, such as doing away with the power of magistrates&#146; courts to suspend sentences for summary-only offences. I presume that will mean that slightly more people will go to prison, although prisons are already bursting at the seams. At the same time, the Secretary of State is to be allowed to re-release non-dangerous offenders who breach the terms of their licence, which I presume is designed to release pressure on prison numbers. We also have the rather peculiar idea that credit will be given for periods on remand on bail just as if the individual had been locked up. I am not sure of the logic behind that unless it is again to keep down the pressure on prisons. That, too, is a measure we shall wish to pursue in Committee. It is one which I think the noble Lord will find is not necessarily as popular with the public as he thinks.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="08012268000113"></a>Part 3 covers appeals. As I understand it, the Government are making a profound change following the case of the Crown v Mullin, which would allow the Court of Appeal to rule that a conviction will not be unsafe if it is satisfied that the appellant is guilty of the offence. I gather that, in another place, the Government agreed to look at this again. As I understand it&#151;the noble Lord and I have both received the same brief&#151;the Bar Council, the Criminal Bar Association, the Criminal Appeal Lawyers Association, the judiciary, Justice, Liberty, the Law Society and the Criminal Cases Review Commission have all expressed their concerns. The Minister might accept that some movement or flexibility would by wise on the part of the Government. They might be well advised to consider the advice coming from such bodies.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="08012268000114"></a>The noble Lord says that Parts 4 and 5 need not concern us. I look forward to the noble Lord&#146;s amendment removing what now appears to be about a quarter of the Bill, along with&#151;if he will give this confirmation&#151;some nine schedules that seem to be dependent on Parts 4 and 5. When will we see those parts again, and in what legislation?</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_134"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80122-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="08012268000115"></a>Part 6 brings us to the remaining criminal justice provisions. Two in particular will need a considerable degree of scrutiny. First, Clause 104 deals with trial or sentencing in the absence of the accused in magistrates&#146; courts and seems to create a presumption that the court will so proceed in such cases. As they already have a discretion in law to do so, does the clause really add that much? Perhaps the noble Lord will be able to enlighten us in due course. That cannot be said of Clause 105, which I suspect will effectively remove the role of lawyers in some summary cases. Again, we want to hear more from the noble Lord on that point.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08012268000116"></a>Part 6 is also indicative of how the Government&#151;particularly the Home Office or what is now the Ministry of Justice&#151;legislate. On page 83, in paragraph 519, the Explanatory Notes state, for Clause 103&#151;it was originally Clause 84 when the Bill first started in the Commons&#151;that,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="08012268000297"></a>&#147;Clause 84 introduces Schedule 22, which amends Schedule 3 to the 2003 Act&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012268000277"></a>The two subsequent paragraphs set out just what Schedule 3 of the 2003 Act was to do, what the amendments it made achieved, and what will happen in due course. Then we are told in paragraph 522 that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012268000304"></a>&#147;most of the provisions of Schedule 3 to the 2003 Act are not yet in force&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012268000278"></a>So here we are repealing something that never actually came into force. It seems a strange way to legislate. As I said before in an earlier speech on a Criminal Justice Bill, perhaps in time the Ministry of Justice will make improvements in the way they manage things, removed from the dead hand of the Home Office. I do not know if that will be the case; I somehow doubt it. No doubt the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord West, can look to these things and see what they can achieve in due course.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08012268000117"></a>In Part 7, we move on from criminal justice to the criminal law itself. We find a whole array of diverse and disparate matters, as the noble Lord assured us. We deal with extreme pornography, prostitution, homophobic hatred, self-defence, nuclear material and facilities, and new penalties for unlawfully obtaining personal data. The Government might also consider some new penalties for incompetently losing personal data&#151;something that the Government seem to know a great deal about at the moment. The noble Lord, Lord West, smiles ruefully. Perhaps we can leave that for an amendment at a later stage.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08012268000118"></a>My first point on this part of the Bill is that there will be problems of definition&#151;the Minister touched on this in his opening speech&#151;and a need for certainty or, at least, a degree more clarity. Secondly&#151;this is particularly true of the measure on hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation&#151;there will need to be compromise by all concerned to achieve a balance between preserving freedom of expression, as the Minister put it, while seeking the appropriate protection that the clause seems to offer. We on these Benches will enter into debates on that and other clauses and seek that compromise. Thirdly, we need to examine these clauses carefully&#151;I am thinking, in particular, of the clause on self-defence&#151;and consider whether what the Bill proposes does anything at all; or is it, dare I put it this way, grandstanding, so that the Government  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_135"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can claim they are doing something when all the Bill does is clarify the existing law without adding anything. We certainly sought to add something to the law of self-defence.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08012268000119"></a>We still have some seven parts of the Bill to go but, before I finish, perhaps I may touch on Part 9, which deals with violent offender orders, and simply mention the others, which will get their time in due course. The Minister has, quite rightly, made his declaration on the front of the Bill that its provisions are compatible with Convention rights, as did his right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor in another place. I ask the Minister to have another look. Is he absolutely sure and happy that these provisions are compliant? I particularly refer him to Article 6 on the right to a fair trial and Article 7 on retrospective punishments. It would be wise of the Minister to take advice and have another look at that in the light of his statement on the front of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08012268000120"></a>I also note what the Minister had to say about blasphemy and blasphemous libel, and his other comments about the Church of England. We look forward to that debate and, in the light of recent letters they have written on the subject, to some former distinguished most reverend Primates taking part in it. It is a matter that we can deal with in good time and in its proper place.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08012268000121"></a>I remind the House and, in particular, the Minister, of the large aspects of the Bill that were not debated in another place. There was virtually no debate on prostitution, although I understand that since the passage of the Bill through the other place, three Ministers, including the Solicitor-General, all went at once to inspect the situation in Sweden and to report on the conditions there. Why it took three Ministers I do not know; it may be that they thought there would be safety in numbers. I leave that to them. There was no debate in the other place on the powers of the magistrates courts; no debate on pornography and sex offenders; no debate on personal data, which I imagine we all want to discuss again&#151;I look forward to the contributions of the noble Lord, Lord West, on that subject; no debate on miscarriages of justice; and no debate on powers to restrict the Court of Appeal, violent offender orders, causing nuisance on NHS premises or tobacco sales&#151;I could go on. The noble Lord will get the drift of what I am saying.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08012268000122"></a>We look forward to a busy Committee stage and to ensuring that all these matters are debated, and debated fully.</p>

Thank you very much&#151;it is a paradise for lawyers, as the noble Lord, Lord Henley, hinted a moment ago.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08012268000124"></a>Above all, though, the Bill is a missed opportunity to encourage, in a principled way, the prevention of crime in this country by creating and resourcing the means to put young offenders on the right path and by approaching social problems not through the criminal courts but with imaginative and constructive solutions.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08012268000125"></a>With regard to youth justice, there is no attempt to put forward a radical policy that will shift the emphasis towards prevention and earlier interventions. We can pick out the scattered provisions from the Bill dealing with youth justice: youth rehabilitation orders in Part 1, the sentencing of young offenders in Clause 9, youth offender contracts in Clauses 36 and 37, conditional cautions in Section 98 and Schedule 18 and a review of ASBOs in Clause 174. It is all over the place. There are three things lacking: a comprehensive approach that would deal in one comprehensible Bill with all the provisions relating to youth justice; a government structure that would place one Minister firmly in charge of policy and implementation; and a commitment to resources to carry out the tasks that are seen to be necessary.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08012268000126"></a>The youth rehabilitation orders are to be made by a magistrates&#146; court, whose prime purpose in the Bill is said to be punishment. Yet magistrates are turned into a social agency who must pick and mix from a selection of requirements tailored towards the individual young offender. They are to initiate service provision, such as accommodation by local authorities, medical treatment, drug treatment and education. They are to consider intensive supervision and fostering. Is that the role of a sentencer in a criminal court? If it is, how can that possibly be done without extensive reports, assessments into the background and personality of the person in question from social workers, probation officers and, frequently, medical practitioners? What input will there be from parents and from the offender himself, as happens with the more enlightened Scottish system of children&#146;s panels? If our courts are to become a social agency of this nature, surely it is incumbent to state that the prime purpose in sentencing young offenders is not punishment but the consideration of the best interests of the child, as is set out in the children&#146;s convention, whether that includes an element of punishment or not. As the Joint Committee on Human Rights says in its report today, detention or imprisonment should be seen only as a last resort. We shall be putting forward amendments for debate on all these matters. My noble friends Lady Linklater and Lady Falkner will expand on that.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08012268000127"></a>The grave danger that exists with all these restrictions and requirements is that they set up children and young people to fail. The sanction in each case is a fine and, in the ultimate, imprisonment. Around 6,500 children and young people are in prison, a 200 per cent increase since 1991. Reoffending rates following custody are 82 per cent, rising to 96 per cent for those who have more than seven convictions. The cost is &#163;245 million  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_137"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a year, which is 70 per cent of the Youth Justice Board&#146;s budget. According to the Audit Commission&#146;s 2004 report, six months in a young offender institution costs &#163;25,400 as compared with &#163;8,500 for the most intensive community sentence. Meanwhile, on 7 January, the Minister for Prisons, David Hanson, confessed in a reply to a Question in another place from my colleague, Mr Tom Brake, that convictions for robbery in London where the defendants are under 18 have increased threefold in the past seven years, from 592 to 1,533. It is a fivefold increase in respect of girls.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08012268000128"></a>The Government claim that their policies have in some areas resulted in a fall in crime. In some respects, that may be so, but they cannot take the credit for it. Crime has fallen across Europe. The European Crime and Safety Survey, published last year, and sponsored by the European Commission, compared levels of crime across all EU countries. It found that levels of common crime have fallen in the EU during the past 10 years, but the UK is regarded as a crime hotspot. For example, out of 20 countries, we rank fourth for the level of thefts of personal property reported to the police, which is twice the rate it is in Poland. When it comes to a comparison of 16 capital cities, London leads the field in the provision of security devices, but it has the highest levels of theft, burglary, robbery, sexual incidents and assaults in Europe&#151;it is higher even than in New York. It was no surprise to learn last October that gun crime had increased by 10 per cent in a year. London has the lowest percentage in the EU, bar Amsterdam, of citizens who have not been victimised in the past five years.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08012268000129"></a>That accords with our own perceptions: how many of your Lordships would feel safe, not just in London, but in your nearest town, in walking the streets after nine o'clock in the evening? Even the Home Secretary finds it necessary to take her minder to the local kebab shop in Peckham.</p>

<a name="80122-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08012268000132"></a>Although we are still heading the European league tables for crime, we imprison vastly more offenders than our European neighbours. Prison is not the answer. According to the International Centre for Prison Studies based at King&#146;s College London, in 1998 we imprisoned 98 out of every 100,000 citizens; today, that figure has gone up 50 per cent to 143 out of every 100,000 citizens. Let us look at the comparisons. In that same period, France has moved from 85 to 84 in every 100,000 citizens, Germany from 93 to 81, Italy from 67 to 85, Ireland from 72 to 71 and Denmark from 67 to 64. Imprisoning 143 out of every 100,000 citizens in this country is the result of that macho swaggering that we saw by rival Home Secretaries of both Governments. Prison does not work, but what is the Government&#146;s answer? It is build more, build bigger.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08012268000133"></a>On sentencing, we shall be concerned under Part 2 to examine the failure of the indeterminate sentence for public protection and to attack the unconstitutional attempts to have released prisoners recalled for a fixed term of 28 days at the say-so of the Secretary of State, without any judicial or independent oversight.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08012268000134"></a>With violent offender orders, we are back on familiar territory. This is the use of the criminal justice system not for the investigation and punishment of past offences, but as a tool to manage future risk. Over centuries, in order to protect the innocent defendant, the common law developed the concept of due process in criminal cases, as encapsulated in Articles 6(2) and (3) and 7(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, no similar safeguards exist or have been suggested for the misuse of civil procedures to impose conditions or requirements on an individual, breach of which amounts to a criminal offence. It is not a technical procedural question of interest only to lawyers; it involves a court&#151;frequently on hearsay, tittle-tattle evidence, which would not be received in a criminal court&#151;making an order that sets out a personal code for the individual forbidding such conduct as prostitution or entry into an area of a town or a particular public house, which is not criminal in itself. It follows that a person who breaches his own personal criminal code imposed on him may be sent to prison for non-criminal conduct, which would not have that effect on anyone else. The principle of all those orders, from ASBOs onwards, is bad&#151;and the practice is even worse.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08012268000135"></a>Another issue of principle arises with the proposal that unqualified CPS staff will be able to conduct serious trials in a magistrates&#146; court, which is totally contrary to the public interest. I cannot put it better than the Bar Council, which said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012268000305"></a>&#147;in cases involving contested facts, issues of law, and serious allegations, which demand a high level of professional responsibility and developed advocacy skills legally qualified lawyers have an essential role to play. Qualified lawyers, who are under a professional duty to be independent, not only contribute to maintaining the independence of prosecutions in our criminal justice system but they also inspire confidence in the public and the victims of crime.&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08012268000279"></a>It is a cost-saving exercise that the Government are engaged in.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08012268000136"></a>There are two necessary requirements: first, to put a ceiling on the type of case that may be conducted by an unqualified person&#151;certainly not including cases punishable by imprisonment&#151;and, secondly, to ensure that any CPS staff appearing in court at least qualify with ILEX, the Institute of Legal Executives, and are taught to understand and apply the ethics of advocacy thoroughly. Your Lordships will appreciate that the negotiation of pleas, the disclosure of documents and other evidence, and the rules of evidence themselves are particularly important. It is wrong that the only person in court who might have received any training at all should be the court clerk&#151;and even he does not have to be a professional. It would hopelessly inappropriate for him to advise the prosecutor on how to conduct his case properly and then go in with the magistrates to advise them on the law.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08012268000137"></a>I turn to populist measures, which I mentioned at the beginning and which are simply misconceived. The Government seem to think, along with the tabloid press, that under the law as it presently stands defendants who are guilty regularly escape punishment because the Court of Appeal will quash their convictions on a technicality. Since 1907, the Court of Criminal Appeal has been required to dismiss an appeal if the jury would inevitably have convicted. However, the court does not consider whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant. How could it? It has no opportunity to see the witnesses, hear what they have to say or see them examined or cross-examined. The task of the Court of Appeal was to determine whether the defect was so fundamental as to make the jury&#146;s verdict unsafe; if it does so conclude, generally it will order a new trial. This new proposal that the Court of Appeal will not dismiss an appeal if it is convinced beyond reasonable doubt of guilt turns it into judges of the facts without hearing the evidence. That is utterly alien to the rule of law.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08012268000138"></a>I turn to another topic: the introduction of a watered-down Megan's law in Part 13. It ignores existing practice, which involves the notification of head teachers of the presence of someone who is a danger. The presumption that information about an offender should be disclosed not simply to a targeted individual but generally, as the Bill proposes, will dangerously encourage vigilante groups of the sort which attacked a paediatrician because they thought that she had something to do with child abuse.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08012268000139"></a>As for self-defence, I suppose that it is the Government's intention, following the Martin case, to strengthen the defence of self-defence to allow a householder to shoot someone in the back as he runs away. At common law, a defendant today who acts under a mistaken belief has to show that his belief is objectively reasonable. The new provision put forward by the Government says that he is protected by this defence even if his mistaken belief was entirely unreasonable. I do not agree with the Joint Committee on Human Rights that the clause clarifies but does not amend the existing law: it strengthens self-defence in a way that I hope your Lordships will agree is quite inappropriate.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08012268000140"></a>I shall have much to say on the proposed cap on compensation for miscarriages of justice. The Government do not seem to realise that if a person is wrongly imprisoned he is a victim of the state, not of a third party, and it is for the state to put him in the same position he would have been in had he never been wronged.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08012268000141"></a>As for extreme pornography, Clause 113 is utterly vague, and Clause 115 proposes an unacceptable reverse burden of proof. We welcome what the Minister said a moment ago, when he appeared to recognise that. I shall leave it to my noble friends Lord Wallace of Tankerness and Lady Miller to comment further on the provisions of Parts 7 and 8. Similarly, in Committee, my noble friend Lady Harris will deal with policing matters in Part 11 and my noble friend Lord Avebury with special immigration status in Part 12.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08012268000142"></a>I make no excuse for speaking at length on the Bill. The primacy of the House of Commons in this Parliament  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_140"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has become a joke. As the noble Lord, Lord Henley, pointed out, the Government started off in the other place with a Bill of 129 clauses and 22 schedules and ended up with 202 clauses and 37 schedules. Large swathes of legislation were simply tossed into this ragbag of a Bill in Committee and on Report and were never debated because there was not sufficient time. Everyone looks to your Lordships in this House to scrutinise and sort it all out. Well, I assure the Government that we have the time. We will scrutinise these measures clause by clause and schedule by schedule, and we hope that there will not be scrawled on the government brief the magic word &#147;resist&#148;.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08012268000143"></a>Perhaps the first sign of spring is the abandonment of Parts 4 and 5, which gets rid of 47 clauses voted through the other House on a Whipped vote. The proposal then was to replace the ombudsman with HM Commissioner for Offender Management and Prisons, someone who was neither a commissioner responsible to Parliament nor involved in offender management. What a title&#151;Gilbert and Sullivan would have loved it.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08012268000144"></a>We will raise issues that colleagues in the other place sought to argue but which were ruled out for lack of time. Such issues are data protection and the scandal to which the noble Lord, Lord Henley, referred of personal files in the control of the Government dropping off the back of a lorry, and human trafficking. Why are we legislating on prostitution but still delaying ratifying the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking?</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08012268000145"></a>We will look to the Government to fulfil the pledge that was given to Dr Evan Harris, my colleague in another place, on the abolition of the law of blasphemy, and we shall bring forward other serious amendments hoping to persuade your Lordships to include them in this Bill. If, in due course, they are rejected on a Whipped vote by the government party in the Commons&#151;a party supported at the last election by 35.1 per cent of those voting&#151;then the joke will be upon the people of this country, and they will not find it very amusing.</p>

However, it is a sad state of affairs when all the opposition parties in the other place, not to mention a number of the Government&#146;s own supporters, are so unhappy&#151;I use a mild word&#151;with the way it has been handled, particularly with the addition of so many new clauses at Commons Report stage, as we have heard, and the grotesquely short time given them to consider this huge Bill. Even the Minister of State, David Hanson himself, commented that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012268000306"></a>&#147;if I were an Opposition Member I might well oppose the motion myself. I know that it will be very difficult for us to discuss some of the amendments before the House in the time that we have allocated&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="08012268000280"></a>Unsurprisingly, the point was underlined by many speakers in the other place that this House now has a vast amount of work to do if we are, in the words of Edward Garnier,</p>
<ul><a name="08012268000307"></a>&#147;to deconstruct the Bill and turn it into something resembling a proper Act of Parliament&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 9/1/08; cols. 308, 428.]</ul>
<p><a name="08012268000281"></a>I have no doubt that we shall do our best to achieve this. Our track record for doing so with many other Bills is very good. But it is, quite frankly, pretty disgraceful that this is the background to the Bill and that it comes to us clothed in such ill feeling.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08012268000148"></a>That prompts me to make some more general remarks about the way in which the Government approach the business of legislating in the criminal justice area. I speak from my background of years as a juvenile court magistrate, as a one-time member of the Parole Board, and as somebody who has been involved with many voluntary organisations working in this field.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08012268000149"></a>It simply is not a competent way to run a service to have so much legislation poured into those who have to work in the system and operate it, such as magistrates, probation and prison officers. As we have heard, the law is changed time and again. As Liberty reminds us, it is the Government&#146;s 37th criminal justice or policing Bill since 1997. I was horrified to hear the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, say that the figure was 57, so there is a little inconsistency there. But the resources are simply not there for everyone to be properly retrained to meet the demands of this legislation. As we also heard, much of it is never implemented and some of it is repealed before it is even implemented. I suggest to the Minister that we would have a much better outcome from the criminal justice system if only the Government were more minded to listen to those who work in it and who struggle to do a good job in increasingly difficult circumstances.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08012268000150"></a>I have a complaint about something that was not much covered, if at all, in the Bill. On 6 December 2007, the Government published their response to the Corston report on women in the criminal justice system. As your Lordships will recall, the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, was commissioned to report to Ministers after the tragic deaths of six women in Styal prison. Her excellent report, published in March 2007, concluded against imprisoning, at huge cost, vulnerable women offenders who pose no risk to the public. Instead, the report called for the closure of women&#146;s prisons over a 10-year period, along with the establishment by the Government of some small custodial units for dangerous offenders and a larger network of support and supervision centres.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08012268000151"></a>These centres would be based on the existing successful community centres visited by the Corston review group and would provide access to services to help women deal with addictions, mental illness, rape and domestic violence, trauma and debt, while helping them gain skills and take responsibility for their families. A study undertaken by the New Economics Foundation and the Prison Reform Trust demonstrates conclusively that such an approach would be highly cost-effective.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_142"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80122-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08012268000152"></a>In my view, the Government&#146;s response to the review of the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, has been weak and insubstantial. Ministers agreed with the report&#146;s analysis of the problem and nearly all of its recommendations; but they have failed to support the key recommendations&#151;first, for dedicated funding and, secondly, for establishing a women&#146;s commission to drive things forward. Ministers have also failed to use this legislative opportunity, which is being used for many other matters, to introduce any changes in the way that women are treated. Many other noble Lords will, I am sure, join me in expressing grave disappointment at this.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08012268000153"></a>I said earlier that I spent many years as a juvenile magistrate. Through that experience I learnt the importance of taking the greatest care when dealing with the damaged children who come before the courts, often from the most poverty-stricken backgrounds&#151;poverty-stricken not just in terms of just money but in aspiration and preparation for life. If children are to survive such backgrounds and not grow up to be the residents of adult prisons until, sadly and often, they meet an early death, they need solutions that deal with what has happened to them and thus try to transpose their prospects. I fear that Keith Joseph's &#147;cycle of deprivation&#148; that he outlined many years ago is all-too-obviously alive and kicking today.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08012268000154"></a>Imprisonment is simply not the answer, but despite that the number of children and young persons under 18 in prison doubled in 15 years, from 1,405 in 1992 to some 3,000 last summer. I want to tell the Minister again what he has heard me and others say previously&#151;children should not be in prisons or in establishments run like prisons. If they are dangerous to themselves and others they must be in secure settings, but which should be run on child care and human rights principles.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08012268000155"></a>So I welcome very much the involvement of the Department for Children, Schools and Families in the youth justice system and the appointment of the new chairman of the Youth Justice Board, Mrs Frances Done, who comes from a local authority background. But I cannot welcome the youth justice proposals in this Bill, because they constitute no more than a further fragment of piecemeal reform of the system and completely miss the opportunity to address its fundamental flaws. In particular, we need legislation and policy for children in trouble with the law to be made much more congruent with that which deals with children and families more broadly, in respect of welfare, safeguarding, education and health.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08012268000156"></a>I hope, too, that we can make some progress in Committee by introducing a much higher threshold for the use of custody. That is strongly supported by the Standing Committee for Youth Justice, the Local Government Association and the Joint Committee on Human Rights. I hope also that we can remove the possibility of violent offender orders being used for those under the age of 18. There are already sufficient powers to deal with that tiny and tragic minority of children who need continued supervision. It would be a great step forward if we could persuade the Government that breach of an anti-social behaviour order should not lead to a child being put into custody. That power does not exist in Scotland, so why do we need it here?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08012268000157"></a>I turn briefly to the measure on prostitution. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, will speak on this; he has done much to raise awareness of the need for better treatment of women involved in this work. I welcome the provision that defines a brothel, but I fear that the proposals on compulsory rehabilitation, and the possibility of 72 hours&#146; imprisonment for failure to attend this, will not make women safer. Instead, they will add pointlessly to the prison population and will not address the depth of the problems that some of these women face. I hope that we can persuade the Minister to look again at these proposals and to consider seriously their utility and practicality in terms of the use of resources. Is it intended that these measures should apply not only to those who work in prostitution, but also to those on the buying side? Surely there should be equal provision&#151;although I would prefer that the whole of this area be taken out of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08012268000158"></a>It is clear that this House has a long haul ahead of it. I look forward to hearing the concerns of other noble Lords about this Bill and particularly to hearing what hope the Minister can give us when he concludes.</p>

I shall leave the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool to touch on those parts of the Bill that affect the working of the criminal justice system. I hope that noble Lords will forgive me if I allude to two issues, neither of which was contained in the Bill when it was introduced in another place, but to which the Minister referred in his opening remarks.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08012268000160"></a>The first is what might be described, in the light of some comments already made, as the elephant in the room&#151;I refer to the intention to abolish the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel, which was announced by the Government in a debate on an amendment at Report stage in the other place. It would not be appropriate to enter into substantive arguments now but it would be strange if no mention of it were made from this Bench. The noble Lord, Lord Henley, referred to statements made by the Church of England&#146;s Archbishops. On his recent visit to Durham, the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury said that the Church of England would not resist this measure, given the awkward and not very workable legacy of the law. This will have come as no surprise to those who heard the debate on the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill in November 2005. The former Bishop of Oxford, now happily among us again as the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, indicated in answer to the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that the church&#146;s opposition to abolition rested on issues of timing rather than principle. I say today that we welcome the consultation that the Government are undertaking before introducing their amendment, to which the Minister referred in his opening, supportive remarks about the Church of England. The Church of England itself is consulting other churches and religious bodies, and we hope the outcome of those consultations will be revealed shortly.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08012268000161"></a>Before moving on, I would like to correct a common misapprehension about the law of blasphemy. It is often said that it protects only the tenets of the Church of England, but that statement is based on a faulty reading of case law. The judgment of the Administrative Court in the Jerry Springer case on 5 December 2007 usefully confirmed that the factual basis of the offence includes,</p>
<ul><a name="08012268000308"></a>&#147;contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous and/or ludicrous material relating to God, Christ [or] the bible&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012268000282"></a>The law therefore protects the basic tenets and scripture of the Christian religion. I mention that because it means that response to the proposal for abolition is not a matter for the Church of England alone but for Christian denominations and groups more generally, although of course, as I have already indicated to your Lordships, we are playing a central part in all those discussions at the moment. Incidentally, I assure the Cross-Benchers&#151;in particular, in this centenary Week of Prayer for Christian Unity&#151;that the Christian churches together hope to speak on this matter with one voice.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08012268000162"></a>My second topic also relates, as I said, to an amendment put forward by the Government. I refer to the creation of a new offence of incitement to hatred on the ground of sexual orientation, which is contained in Clause 126 and Schedule 26. I want, first, to enter a caveat about the principle of legislating to protect particular groups, not because I believe that they do not deserve protection&#151;they do&#151;but simply because we already have a battery of public order provisions which apply to everyone. Sections 4A and 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 prohibit words, behaviour or displays of written material intended to cause harassment, alarm or distress, or which are heard or seen by a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress. We must of course hold to the principle that it is wrong to threaten or stir up hatred against anyone on any ground.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08012268000163"></a>That said, we on these Benches recognise that members of sexual minority groups may indeed be subject to all kinds of threatening and hate-filled behaviour based on irrational prejudice. The report of the Select Committee on religious offences pointed out that incitement has often been criminalised,</p>
<ul><a name="08012268000309"></a>&#147;as a reaction to the perception that a novel social mischief has arisen or that an existing mischief has become particularly damaging to society&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012268000283"></a>Whether that is now the case may be debated. Paradoxically, the demand for such a law may reflect society&#146;s increasing intolerance of hostility to sexual minorities but, by that token, it may be less necessary than it once was.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08012268000164"></a>If there is to be a new offence, it raises some of the dilemmas with which we became familiar in the debates over religious hatred. The churches are concerned that the offence should clearly exclude from its scope the expression of traditional Christian teaching about human sexuality, marriage and the family, and consequent criticism of particular forms of behaviour or lifestyle. Frankly, freedom to advance those convictions is part of life in a free society, and it should be distinguished  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_145"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from freedom to threaten or stir up hatred against people with whose behaviour and lifestyle Christians and others may disagree.</p>

<a name="80122-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08012268000165"></a>The Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church made a joint submission to the Public Bill Committee in the other place, expressing support for the new offence, on the condition that it clearly distinguished between incitement and controversial statements of opinion. They thought that this condition would probably be satisfied by the requirement of intention to stir up hatred, coupled with the restriction of the offence to threatening, rather than abusive or insulting behaviour. They raised the question of whether there should also be a provision to protect freedom of expression, similar to that introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, into the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill. As noble Lords know, such an amendment was moved and defeated in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08012268000166"></a>I very much hope that the discussion on this proposal will continue as we reflect on the balance&#151;and it is a delicate balance&#151;between protection of the vulnerable and freedom of expression, and ask ourselves whether this measure has got that balance right.</p>

The law is sometimes misunderstood by those who govern us; they often forget that the law is the bedrock of our nation. It tells us who we are and what our values are. It has a huge impact on our lives. I am afraid that, too often, Governments&#151;and I mean that in the plural&#151;see the law as an instrument to be used to secure seemingly sensible outcomes, when in fact the law is a fabric, where one thread pulled can cause unravelling well beyond what was anticipated by Ministers. Sometimes, short-term populist gains blind those who govern us to the long-term consequences of tinkering with well established legal principles.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08012268000168"></a>I share the concerns of other noble Lords. I am concerned about the youth justice proposals, about the expansion of prison places without consideration of the Corston recommendations, and about the abandonment of due process in the violent offender orders. In relation to self-defence, the law that we have is perfectly adequate, and I am interested to see that we are replacing an objective test of what an accused believed was necessary, and moving to a subjective test. The very argument for the importance of introducing objectivity was the reason for changing our test in relation to rape. We decided that a subjective test of what an accused in a rape case believed was not a good test, and we should make it objective, using as our allegory what was done in relation to self-defence.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08012268000169"></a>There are many myths about the criminal justice system. There is the myth that large numbers of criminals are getting away with it when, in fact, the vast majority of people arrested plead guilty or are found guilty. There is the myth that judges are soft touches who rarely send people to jail, which has never been my  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_146"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 146</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>experience. Only last week we were presented with the new myth that murderers are getting bail, which is, again, far from the truth. Then we have the myth that people get off on appeal because of a technicality. I regret that the Government have drawn on that myth in introducing Clause 42. Appeals are rarely successful. The majority of criminal appeals are filtered out; they go in front of a single judge as a paper exercise, then in front of a court as an application for leave to appeal. Legal aid is often withdrawn from appeals that are hopeless. When an appeal goes in front of the court and eventually succeeds, that is invariably for a very good reason. Winning an appeal is hard. The judge says, &#147;Lady Kennedy, the jury saw your client, it heard his story, and the verdict would have been no different if it had known about the matters of which you complain&#148;. The test applied by the Court of Appeal is: was the verdict rendered unsafe?</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08012268000170"></a>We must remember that in a just system of law, things matter beyond the individual case. The criminal appeal process exists not only to ensure that the innocent are not punished but to uphold the rule of law. The function of criminal appeals is not just to see that in a given case the right result is obtained, but to ensure that the law, rules of evidence and procedure are respected and applied. Anything else would act as an incitement to undermine procedure. It would give a green light to police officers, for example, to take shortcuts. It sends out powerful messages to those who act on behalf of the state as to how to conduct themselves. In extreme and unusual circumstances the Court of Appeal will quash convictions that are tainted by grave breaches of the law or serious failures to apply the rules, irrespective of the factual guilt or innocence of the accused.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08012268000171"></a>I emphasise that it is rare when that is done, but when it is done it is because of the belief we share that a criminal conviction is acceptable only if it carries moral authority. A decision reached in defiance of the basic rules that society prescribes for criminal investigations and for trials does not carry moral authority. If convictions can be upheld where the authorities have flouted fundamental tenets, the self-restraint that the authorities are expected to show in keeping to them will be undermined. It will send a signal that breaking or bending the rules can pay. Those who enforce the law should obey the law and not benefit from breaches or irregularities.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08012268000172"></a>Few in this House would argue with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, who, in the case of Randall, said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012268000310"></a>&#147;it is not every departure from good practice which renders a trial unfair ... But the right to a fair trial is absolute. There will come a point when the departure from good practice is so gross, or so persistent, or so prejudicial, or so irremediable, that an appellate court will have no choice but to condemn a trial as unfair and quash a conviction as unsafe, however strong the grounds for believing the defendant to be guilty&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012268000284"></a>The concern that I and many of us involved in the law have is that we are changing the basis on which our Court of Appeal functions. We are interfering with the rule of law.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08012268000173"></a>Clause 105 is, again, about interfering with important principles within our system. It will extend the powers for non-legally qualified persons to act as prosecutors  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_147"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the magistrates&#146; courts. We are allowing efficiency gains, which are all to the good in most circumstances, but which should never outweigh fair trials. To allow the prosecution of a case in the magistrates&#146; court by unqualified staff, where there might be a loss of liberty or a conviction for dishonesty affecting someone&#146;s life fundamentally, would, we must agree, be quite wrong. I hope that the Government will look again at some of those changes.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08012268000174"></a>Law is the glue that holds together the constituent parts of our society, and it is a civilising force. As soon as we forget that, we run serious risks. Law is what makes the centre hold&#151;to refer to my favourite poet, Yeats. It is the mortar that fills the gaps between people and communities. A just system of law is the invisible substance which sustains social well-being, social and moral consensus, and mutuality of interest and trust. It is built around principles. The principles of the rule of law should not be subject to change without great care. If we interfere with those principles which underpin law, fritter them away and pick them out of the crannies of our political and social architecture, restoration becomes impossible. Therefore, I will be asking the Government to think again about a number of the changes in the Bill, which again are interfering with those well established principles which we should hold dear.</p>

There has already emerged in this debate more of a theme than can be detected in the Bill. That theme is, in fact, that the Bill has no theme. I call to mind those old ironmonger shops in the country, which used to be crammed and cluttered with an astonishing collection of items; so prolific were they that they were frequently suspended from hooks on the ceiling, nails in the walls or even less usual projections. Where they were to be found and why they were to be found there would be apparent only to the proprietor, and not always to him.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08012268000176"></a>This Bill puts me nostalgically in mind of those shops, whose chaotic arrangements seem now to have made them almost extinct. In the Bill, dangling from the same hook&#151;it is labelled Part 7, &#147;Criminal law&#148;&#151;we find provisions relating respectively to the protection of nuclear facilities, loitering for the purposes of prostitution, hatred on the ground of sexual orientation and imprisonment for the purpose of unlawfully obtaining personal data. Part 11, on &#147;Policing&#148;, provides a nail which is shared between provisions for &#147;Police misconduct and performance procedures&#148; and provisions for securing that police authorities may themselves be inspected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08012268000177"></a>Lest we were to doubt whether this has anything to do with criminal justice, the Long Title, which takes up 11 and a half lines in inventory itself, assures us that it does. Right at the end of the Bill&#151;as it were, at the very back of the shop&#151;lodged behind the provision for special immigration status, we find provisions which even this heroic draftsman has been obliged to label &#147;Miscellaneous&#148;. From making it unlawful once again

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08012268000178"></a>This is almost beyond parody, but there is more. Now the entirety of Parts 4 and 5 are to be withdrawn, for reasons which have been given to us by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, only this afternoon. I am afraid that they are being withdrawn for being unfit for purpose. This is a fundamental defect affecting the management of the Bill as a whole. This is not a proper way to legislate. It is certainly not an efficient one. Draft legislation ought to have a comprehensive theme and not depart from it. Efficient scrutiny in Parliament and outside depends on this principle being fulfilled. Without it, the legislation is unlikely to impinge fairly on those who it may affect.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08012268000179"></a>The Government cannot plead that they have not had enough opportunity to legislate for such matters; they have taken advantage of at least 35 previous opportunities. Nor can they claim in mitigation that each of these provisions received ample debate in the other place, however late in the day they were hung upon the Bill. As your Lordships now well know, Ministers took pains to use their majority to whip their supporters into denying debate to the elected other place, so that important provisions have never been debated at all. No more than 30 minutes was allowed for the Third Reading of a Bill which now, as we have heard, extends to 202 clauses and 18 schedules when it had begun with not much less than half that.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08012268000180"></a>Once again, it falls to this unelected Chamber to redress the balance, which I hope we shall. That will be for the remaining stages but, meanwhile, we encounter straightaway how this kind of legislative abuse impinges on Second Reading contributions: they have to jump about from item to unconnected item and can easily become more detailed than is appropriate for Second Reading.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08012268000181"></a>Bearing my own warning in mind, I turn first to Clause 10, as have other noble Lords, which will remove from magistrates&#146; courts the power to pass suspended sentence orders for summary-only offences. It is to be noted that Crown Courts will also be affected where such cases come up to them for sentence. In my view, the suspended sentence is a thoroughly admirable device. It marks the gravity of the offence while, at the same time, allowing the offender the chance, by his reformed behaviour, of avoiding going to prison and saving the taxpayer the expense of keeping him there as well. He has not got away with it because, if he reoffends, he can be made to serve the remainder of his term, with more for the latest offence.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08012268000182"></a>Now it is said by the Government that courts are using that option inappropriately, by preferring it to the non-custodial community sentences that the offence would otherwise attract. Therefore, the suspended sentence for summary-only offences is to be removed from them, even though it was only given to them by this Government in 2003.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08012268000183"></a>The Magistrates&#146; Association states that this argument is misconceived. For a suspended sentence to be available, the facts of the offence must have crossed what is  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_149"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>called the custody threshold, so the choice for the court would not necessarily have included a community sentence. If it can no longer suspend a custody sentence, it may be driven to impose an immediate sentence of custody. Supporting the Magistrates' Association, the Police Federation estimates that a further 1,000 prison places may be necessitated. Is that what the Government want?</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08012268000184"></a>The Sentencing Guidelines Council is available to correct any perceived mistaken approach. After all, we are dealing with a magistracy that is more comprehensively trained than ever before in its history. I hope that the Government will think again about that.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08012268000185"></a>I turn next to Clause 31, which removes the requirement that, before the Secretary of State may decide whether to recall a prisoner serving a life sentence or indeterminate sentence for public protection, he must, except in an emergency, obtain a Parole Board recommendation. I am not aware of any objective ground for dissatisfaction with the performance of the independent Parole Board in this context. I agree with what Liberty says&#151;that Parliament should not agree to give Ministers this and similar unencumbered powers to deal with the sentences of individual offenders in individual cases. It is unsafe and it risks arbitrary decisions.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08012268000186"></a>That proposal seems to emanate from ministerial irritation, evidenced elsewhere in the Bill, at recent decisions by those who hold independent responsibilities in the criminal justice system. I fear that it stems from the desire on Ministers&#146; part to acquire unencumbered control for themselves&#151;or more of it. That must be stoutly resisted.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08012268000187"></a>I am led, therefore, at once to the more complex provisions in Part 3, limiting the power of the Court of Appeal to overturn a conviction&#151;noble Lords have already focused on that, and I am very glad of it&#151;if it considers the conviction unsafe. That is in Clause 42. That stems with ministerial irritation with the decision of the Court of Appeal in a case already referred to, Mullen in 2000.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08012268000188"></a>The Court of Appeal has for years had jurisdiction to overturn a conviction on the single ground that it is unsafe. I acknowledge that, at first sight, there is some attraction in legislating to provide that a conviction is &#147;not unsafe&#148; if the court thinks that there is,</p>
<ul><a name="08012268000311"></a>&#147;no reasonable doubt about the appellant&#146;s guilt&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08012268000285"></a>but in also providing that the court is not required to &#147;dismiss the appeal&#148; if it thinks that it would,</p>
<ul><a name="08012268000312"></a>&#147;seriously undermine the proper administration of justice&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08012268000286"></a>to allow the conviction to stand. However, I think that closer examination establishes that it is itself unsafe for Parliament to presume to instruct the Court of Appeal as to what is unsafe and what is not.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08012268000189"></a>We will need to look very closely at that clause, which the Government amended in Committee. It is essential to recognise three things. The first is that the state&#146;s misconduct, for example, in securing the rendition of the appellant to this country, can have been irredeemably heinous. In Mullen&#146;s case, the words were,</p>

<p><a name="08012268000287"></a>We cannot claim to be honourable upholders of the rule of the law if we permit ourselves, by law, to profit from the product of such behaviour, which fortunately is rare indeed, but might not remain so if this possible sanction were removed. That would be a slope positively glacial in its slipperiness.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08012268000190"></a>Secondly, we should remember that it is important to recognise that the Court of Appeal has shown that an appeal will succeed only on proof of the gravest wrongdoing or procedural mistake, such as would have led the court in the first instance, had it known about it, to stay the proceedings. The court can, and often will, order a retrial when it overturns a conviction on the grounds that it is unsafe. Lastly, contrary to the impression given by the Government, we should remember that the facts in the case of Mullen stand alone. In reality, there is no problem.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08012268000191"></a>One has to stick to time, otherwise I would have liked to examine many more items that hang incongruously on their hooks and which need rigorous scrutiny in Committee. They include the provision on self-defence, which disarmingly states that it is only intended to clarify the common law, but which will create difficulties all its own. They certainly include the provision to authorise non-legal CPS staff to conduct serious trials in Her Majesty&#146;s courts.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08012268000192"></a>However, the Government have produced a Bill that contains many good things, among many that are not. As a whole, these items resemble the ill assorted contents of a badly cluttered shop. If we are to improve that shop, we are going to have to spend a lot of time in it and that I look forward to.</p>

I would have to turn to France where you can find everything from a chestnut roaster to grout. However, as he correctly said, time is limited, so I will resist that temptation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08012268000194"></a>This Government, under Gordon Brown, when he became Prime Minister, made much of saying that they wanted to strengthen the role of Parliament. Therefore, I find it extraordinary how this first piece of important Ministry of Justice and Home Office legislation under his premiership, has proceeded. As other noble Lords have said, the Government treated the elected Chamber with total disregard when it came to guillotining discussion and introducing important clauses with no time to debate them. If this had been a technical, uncontroversial Bill&#151;in which case, it would have started in your Lordships&#146; House&#151;that would not have mattered. However, this Bill contains some very controversial items which need to be debated.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08012268000195"></a>I am going to talk about three of those issues, two of which I will particularly concentrate on in Committee. I want to mention the issue of young people&#151;I will not be discussing it so much in Committee, but it needed debating in the other place. The issue is very much in the headlines at the moment, with talk of feral children, and little can be more important than instances of violence perpetrated by children. It is  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_151"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>something which shocks society. The Bill&#146;s response to how we treat young people&#151;their rehabilitation, their response to the justice system and how to make that system effective&#151;really needed to be debated by elected Members and I hope that we will be able to do it justice in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08012268000196"></a>It is not simply the legislative response but also the ministerial guidance that follows it. That comes out so clearly in debate. For example, Clause 39 provides for imposing orders that will enable a court to impose an unpaid work requirement, a curfew requirement or an attendance centre requirement. When discussing these, we should debate whether the provisions are to be used only when a young person will not pay rather than cannot pay. Ministers will have to be sensitive in the guidance they issue and should give assurances regarding the resources that the legislation requires. That is because far more pressure will be put on youth offending teams and probation services, both of which are currently overstretched.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08012268000197"></a>The two issues I shall concentrate on are set out in Part 7&#151;the first is extreme pornography. It is a difficult issue to debate at all, but one to which I hope we shall bring some cool and objective thinking. Again, it did not really receive the sort of examination in the other place that it should have had. We have had an interesting briefing from a large number of academics such as lecturers in media studies and so on who have joined together on this issue. The first point they make bears repeating at this stage: the Government have been using a rapid evidence assessment to back up their claims that legislation is necessary in this area. They say that the REA document is based on largely discredited research emanating from particular psychology and sociology traditions once favoured in America and that the supporting evidence has no real connection to the British case. That is the sort of issue that we need to examine in Committee.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08012268000198"></a>Legislation needs to be objective and evidence-based, not subjective. Personally, I do not like pornography and believe it to be essentially degrading to the spirit, and violent pornography is even worse. Indeed, anything depicting extreme violence is, I think, dangerous as regards the well-being of society. However, I also do not believe in censorship unless it is absolutely essential to protect people, and my personal view is not what I want the House to focus on. We need to concentrate on the fact that this sloppy clause is dangerous.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08012268000199"></a>On 6 December last the Minister said that the Government believe that the individual pornography user will have no difficulty in recognising pornography. That is not an objective or evidence-based approach. Surely it cannot be for the possible perpetrator of a crime to judge whether he actually is committing a crime. A great deal more thought needs to go into exactly how these clauses have been drafted, and I recognise that the Minister has suggested that the Government will bring forward something which I hope will be more evidence-based. Further, I am extremely glad that we will have the benefit of the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights before us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08012268000200"></a>Before I leave this point, I refer to the specialist interest material we have received from the Outsiders Trust, which represents the interests of physically disabled people. That is the sort of issue I hope we will come back to in Committee.</p>

<a name="80122-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08012268000201"></a>I turn now to the provisions on prostitution. Given that the Government started to create a strategy in this area with the publication of guidance in 2000 entitled <I>Setting the Boundaries, </I>followed by legislation with the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and a year later a consultation paper entitled <I>Paying the Price, </I>to which they received responses and then developed a strategy, I am shocked that the result of all that work is simply two short clauses which represent a pathetic response to a severe problem. The fact is that prostitution happens. People are willing to pay for sex and others are willing to sell it. Within that framework, whether we like it or not, it is going to take place. The responsibility of the legislation is to make prostitution as safe as possible so that it presents a small health risk to both the buyer and the seller and minimises as far as possible the physical risks for the women who operate in the trade. It is also a question of striking a balance between privacy and safety.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08012268000202"></a>It is a mistake to regard all prostitutes as victims or unwilling participants, but that is the line the Bill is taking. It is a Victorian Bill because it talks a lot about rehabilitation of prostitutes. I was interested to learn that Ministers have been to Sweden, which has gone down the criminalisation route. It has criminalised the user as well as taking the further step&#151;I know the Minister will deny this&#151;of criminalising the seller. The Bill will criminalise those who do not fulfil their rehabilitation orders.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08012268000203"></a>The Ministers could have chosen to visit New Zealand, which has gone down the decriminalisation route, and seen if that has worked better since legislation was introduced there. That is a point I will want to explore in Committee. Women who own brothels and run them well and safely should be able to do so without fear of prosecution under the trafficking laws if they are employing people who are there of their own free will. I believe that that would be safer. But I do not believe we can achieve all this in this Bill, and I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, that we need to remove the clauses dealing with prostitution in their entirety.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08012268000204"></a>That is what I will be concentrating on. I shall also be looking carefully at exactly how the clauses on immigration in Part 12 are going to affect the children of immigrants and at all the issues raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights on those provisions. It raises serious issues, and I look forward to debating them in Committee.</p>

We have been deeply touched by the dignity of Stephen and Melanie Jones and properly challenged by the analysis of our social

The mood of the public is that the perpetrators of such crimes should be punished, but when such murderers are young people, we need also to understand how we, as a society, have failed them. Without diminishing their responsibility for what they have done, we share in the culpability of creating a society in which lawless young people can hold such devastating sway.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08012268000206"></a>I remind your Lordships that these two murders did not happen in areas of multiple deprivation but in leafy suburbs of owner-occupiers. It is evidence that it is not easy to contain such violence by disturbed young people. We on these Benches welcome the Bill&#146;s recognition of the youth offender teams and the youth rehabilitation orders, although we share some of the critical observations offered by the Prison Reform Trust, and by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. When it comes to youth crime, we need to probe and examine the history of the offender. We need to understand their character and how it was formed. We need to investigate the circumstances of their life and analyse the culture that has desensitised the conscience and stultified the imagination so that the offender is unable to feel the pain they are inflicting on their victim.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08012268000207"></a>If society is to a degree responsible for the moral deficiency of these young people it begets, then society&#151;namely ourselves&#151;must also bear the cost of the remedy. The diversionary processes are labour-intensive, necessarily expensive and require commensurate expenditure.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08012268000208"></a>I welcome the Bill&#146;s provision for assessing the offender&#146;s needs concerning mental health, drug abuse and education, but I am alarmed that, according to the Bill, these orders can be issued only where such a provision is already in place. What happens when they are not available locally? Youth offending teams are under huge pressure today. We should not lay upon them such a burden of caring for juvenile offenders in society if we are not prepared to support them adequately.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08012268000209"></a>It is of the utmost importance that when youth rehabilitation orders are issued they are properly tailored to the capacity of the young person. If they contain unrealistic expectations then, as has already been said, these young people are being set up to fail. There needs to be a proper assessment of the maturity of the young offender, their emotional age and circumstances, so that they stand a chance of succeeding. The young person and society are the losers if they fail and the young offender ends up with a custodial sentence which could have been avoided by proper assessment.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08012268000210"></a>The purpose of the orders must be the rehabilitation of the young offender and the welfare of the young person. All this takes time and, inevitably, money and resources. I know that the Government hear the cry that they should spend more money from all quarters all the time. This must be uncomfortable when, at the same time, they are asking for cuts across the whole Prison Service. My concern is that some of the cuts being proposed will prove to be false economies. For example, the core day, soon to be implemented in all prisons in England and Wales, will have a direct impact on the work done by chaplains of all the faith communities who engage volunteers to come into prison in the  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_154"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>evening and at the weekends. The Government rightly welcome the faith alliance as a key partner in rehabilitating prisoners back into society, but then pulls the rug from beneath its feet by making prisoners unavailable at a time when the volunteers can come.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08012268000211"></a>The Bill brings into sharp focus the purpose of prison. Is it a means of social control of a criminal underclass, or is it to be a place of redemption, restoration and rehabilitation? Plans for super prisons that incarcerate large numbers, with less staff per prisoner, less contact with families and less opportunity for social contact, feed the notion that prison is simply there to control the criminal underclass. Plans that offer courses for education, training and restorative justice emphasise rehabilitation. They ensure that prisons are not just warehouses for criminals, but greenhouses where the prisoner can breathe and grow and live and prepare for planting back into the wider community.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08012268000212"></a>We on these Benches would like to see a nationally costed commitment to programmes of restorative justice and to programmes of education and training, such as drug awareness, healthy relationships and anger management. Only with these in place, costed and budgeted nationally, do we have any chance of the offender management scheme working in the way that we all hope that it will. We look forward to scrutinising the Bill in its passage through the House and to amending it appropriately.</p>

He need not despair; they have not all vanished. I can take him to one in Dorchester which fully satisfies his rigorous requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08012268000214"></a>It is almost hopeless to engage in a Second Reading debate on the Bill. There is far too much in it. In my view, a lot of it was ill considered at the drafting stage and so much of it has not been considered by the first House. I shall take two examples. I hope to show that the first, the defence of self-defence, needs a good deal of further thought. The other relates to Clause 42, which deals with the right of appeal and how the Court of Appeal will be required to conduct its caseload in future if the Bill is enacted in its current form.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08012268000215"></a>On self-defence, the Explanatory Notes state:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08012268000299"></a>&#147;Clause 128 provides a gloss on the common law of self-defence and the defences provided by section 3(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1967 and section 3(1) of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967, which relate to the use of force in the prevention of crime or making an arrest. It is intended to improve understanding of the practical application of these areas of the law. It uses elements of case law to illustrate how the defence operates. It does not change the current test that allows the use of reasonable force&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012268000288"></a>So we have something that is glossing the existing law&#151;in an unspecified way, from what I have read so far&#151;and is explanatory and is intended to improve understanding, so it has a sort of teaching role, but the law is not changed.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_155"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 155</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08012268000216"></a>With that introduction, the clause itself then sets out various provisions. Clause 128(7) says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08012268000300"></a>&#147;This section is intended to clarify the operation of the existing defences mentioned in subsection (2)&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012268000289"></a>one of which is self-defence. It is a very odd to find within a clause a provision saying that the clause&#146;s function is to clarify the common law defence, which we are told in the Explanatory Notes has not in any way been changed. However, if the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, is correct, the law is changed. Clause 128(8) says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08012268000301"></a>&#147;For the purposes of references in this section to what D&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012268000290"></a>that is, the accused&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08012268000313"></a>&#147;believed, it is immaterial whether ... any belief of D&#146;s was mistaken, or ... (if it was mistaken) the mistake was reasonable&#148;. </ul>
<p><a name="08012268000291"></a>As I understand it, that changes the law. It is odd that we are not told what the gloss is and that an earlier subsection says the clause is merely clarifying what the existing position is.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08012268000217"></a>Some of the provisions are couched in the most extraordinary language. Clause 128(5), which sets out what the jury will be asked to consider, says that a person,</p>
<ul><a name="08012268000314"></a>&#147;acting for a legitimate purpose&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08012268000292"></a>I am a bit puzzled by that; presumably a &#147;legitimate purpose&#148; is self-defence, so the whole thing is circular&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08012268000315"></a>&#147;may not be able to weigh to a nicety the exact measure of any necessary action&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012268000293"></a>So the jury will be asked to consider whether the defendant could have weighed &#147;to a nicety&#148; the measure of force to be used. That is pretty incoherent. It has not been thought through properly at all.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08012268000218"></a>That is a minnow, however, compared with the destructive operation of Clause 42, which deals with the function of the Court of Appeal. I remind your Lordships that, for the purposes of Section 1A of the existing 1968 Act, a conviction is not unsafe if the court thinks there is no reasonable doubt about the appellant&#146;s guilt. While listening to the debate, I have jotted down typical examples of where under current practice one might expect that the Court of Appeal would want to upset a conviction. I shall give your Lordships four of them, and see what fate would befall the appellants now. First, the judge in his summing-up failed to put the case of the defendant to the jury. Secondly, he misdirected the jury on the applicable law on a relevant point. Thirdly, he wrongly refused to allow the defence to call three witnesses. Fourthly, it emerged after the trial that the prosecution had in its possession written statements which might have given some support to the defendant&#146;s case.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08012268000219"></a>Let us go back to the first example: failure to put the case of the defendant to the jury. Under the Bill, the Court of Appeal would say, &#147;Well, we have had an excellent exposition of the case of the defendant; we fully understand it. We have had that knowledge. We now ask ourselves whether there is any reasonable doubt about the defendant&#146;s guilt. No, we do not think there&#146;s any doubt about it. It does not make any difference that the case was never put to the jury and  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_156"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>summed up for them&#148;. Let us go back to the second example: misdirection on some point of law in the case. The Court of Appeal would now say, &#147;That does not matter. We know what the law is. That rule of law affects our thinking that this man was guilty and there is no reasonable doubt about it&#148;. And so one can go on. In the third example, the judge refuses to allow certain witnesses to be called. The Court of Appeal now says, &#147;We have read those witness statements. We do not find them convincing; we do not suppose that a jury would have found them very convincing, so appeal dismissed&#148;. The same would apply with the statements which were not made available. It may be misconduct by the prosecution, which can be criticised, but the court will say, &#147;It is not a ground on which we can allow the appeal, because we read those statements and, once again, we are satisfied that the evidence before the jury, even if the statements had been available, is enough to ensure guilt&#148;.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08012268000220"></a>The clause completely undermines trial by jury. It substitutes trial by the Court of Appeal for trial by jury. That is a grave development, which should not be allowed to happen. I remember the late Lord Devlin giving an address in which he attacked a decision of the House of Lords, sitting judicially, wherein, in his view, it had done precisely what the Bill does: it had substituted its view of the facts of the case and restored a conviction where a lower court had not taken quite a different view but could not interfere with the verdict of the jury.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08012268000221"></a>That is the vice in Clause 42. I shall content myself with those two points.</p>

However, it is clear that a full and considered response by the Minister to the observations of the Joint Committee on Human Rights is essential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08012268000223"></a>I was struck by the observations of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool. Rehabilitation must surely remain a central, muscular objective of penal policy. Too often, it becomes a hollow refrain. Of course it may be necessary to register the unacceptability of criminal behaviour by some degree of punishment, and protection of the public is vital, but the worse the crime, the greater the challenge to a self-confident, civilised society tirelessly to strive for rehabilitation. To fail is a failure of civilisation; it is to fail the individual and it is usually an economic nonsense, with all the economic and social costs of reoffending.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08012268000224"></a>Our prisons have far too many people in them who should not be there at all. Too many prisoners are suffering from mental illness, learning difficulties and similar conditions. Prison, far from helping, frequently aggravates their condition. Concerned and highly professional prison staff, of whom there are many, will be the first to speak of this, yet we seem to be locked into an inadequate and self-defeating pattern of expenditure, as the plan for a huge expansion of prisons indicates. If we were to start from scratch, we could almost certainly have a purpose-built and secure rehabilitation-oriented system at no greater cost, thereby achieving substantial success in curbing reoffending with all its gravely adverse consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08012268000225"></a>I declare an interest as until recently, for nine years, a president of the YMCA, which does significant work with young people in prisons and detention centres. Children in penal custody are among the most disadvantaged among our society. More than 25 per cent have a literacy or numeracy ability of only seven years or younger, while 85 per cent have symptoms of personality disorder. Ten per cent appear to have psychotic illness, while more than 50 per cent have been in care or involved with social services and 41 per cent have been excluded from school. The Youth Justice Board has indicated that up to nine out of 10 children in custody after having committed a serious offence have been previously abused or suffered severe traumatic experiences. But far too often they simply do not get the help that they need while detained. In secure training centres, which hold younger children, self-harm rose by 803 per cent between 2001 and 2004. Too many children still die in custody. So far, despite imaginative and highly effective work by NGOs and others, overall arrangements for rehabilitation have not been a success. Three-quarters of youngsters reoffend within a year of release.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08012268000226"></a>Too often the children involved in crime&#151;even the worst cases&#151;are first and foremost themselves victims, and what they need above all is help, not just punishment. To be candid, too often our society totally fails to grasp this. Children should never be in prison. If, but only if, for the protection of the public it is essential to detain them, such detention should invariably be in secure but also properly resourced, purposely designed and professionally staffed special accommodation. With the vast expenditure envisaged for the new prison-building programme, this is surely the time to start applying a more rational and appropriate approach. Future crime prevention and good economic logic demands this.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08012268000227"></a>The Standing Committee for Youth Justice brings together almost 20 organisations with extensive front-line experience of working with children and young people. It includes the Association of Youth Offending Team Managers, Nacro, the National Children&#146;s Bureau, the NSPCC, the Children&#146;s Society, Voice and others. The committee has assembled a succinct and powerful brief on the Bill, listing its principal remaining concerns. I hope that my noble friend will ensure that he and his colleagues personally read that brief&#151;it is not in any way hostile&#151;and take it fully into account. It would be good if today he would reassure us that they have or will.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08012268000228"></a>On youth rehabilitation orders, while the standing committee welcomes the principle of generic community sentences, it is concerned about too much subjectivity in the court&#146;s approach, which may be difficult to counter in cases towards the higher end of the community sentencing range. It believes the Bill has to be amended to prevent a standard custodial sentence&#151;a detention and training order&#151;being imposed unless a youth rehabilitation order or intensive supervision surveillance order has previously been tried. It also believes that the Bill should establish that sentencers are required to take into account the age and circumstances of children and young people before them, and not to overload the sentence content and duration beyond their reasonable capacity to comply. It reminds us that such children are frequently unstable and immature.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_158"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80122-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08012268000229"></a>Among other concerns are the importance of retaining the power of the court when dealing with a breach, to allow the order to continue without imposing additional punishment, if this is the most appropriate course to take, and the unacceptability of removing the specification that the court may impose an intensive supervision and surveillance requirement or a custodial sentence for a breach of an order when the original offence did not warrant custody or was a non-prisonable offence.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08012268000230"></a>It is also concerned about the absence of a guarantee that children should have access to justice with proper legal representation, whatever the form of youth rehabilitation order being imposed, and not just before requiring local authority residence or foster care, as envisaged in part 2 of Schedule 1. It is necessary to make the promotion of children's welfare an explicit primary purpose of sentencing. Similarly, it is important to replace a punishment purpose for children with a requirement that sentences are proportionate to the offence.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08012268000231"></a>We need to take into account the relative success of referral orders with their problem-solving and restorative justice approach by making provision for second referral orders, provided that a youth offending team or equivalent officer recommends that. There are similar concerns about the youth default orders in Clause 39.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08012268000232"></a>We need to extend the otherwise good step in Clause 98 of a youth version of the conditional caution to those under the age of 18. We also need to abolish the power to prosecute children under 18 for prostitution, which was surely intended by the Department of Health guidance on safeguarding children in prostitution issued in 2002. Children must be seen as the victims of social inadequacy and worse, as they almost always are.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08012268000233"></a>The Standing Committee also notes the absence of convincing supporting evidence to justify the introduction of violent offender orders. It asks whether proportionate and appropriate use can be made of such orders with children and young people. It emphasises the dangers of counterproductivity among children inherent in anti-social behaviour initiatives. Therefore, while it welcomes the principle of periodic reviews, it stresses the importance of ensuring that these are available at any stage, not just after 12 months. It also stresses the importance of removing a custodial sentence for the breach of an ASBO by a child and of ending the iniquitous practice of naming and shaming, which not only breaches our international obligations on privacy for the child, but too easily becomes a badge of honour. It is also important to reduce the minimum length of the child ASBO from two years to three months.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08012268000234"></a>There is also an imperative need for an assessment under the common assessment framework before an order is made to ensure that mental health difficulties or conditions such as autism have been identified, so that the children affected by such conditions get appropriate treatment and not just an inappropriate ASBO.</p>

<a name="80122-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08012268000235"></a>The children covered by this Bill are, in many ways, already among the most excluded in our society. In our deliberations, we must be very careful indeed lest in any way some provisions of the Bill inadvertently tend to institutionalise that exclusion.</p>

We have looked into it in depth. Our committee is chaired by a very able member of a different party from me from another place and we arrived at our conclusions effortlessly and unanimously. Our committee noted with disdain the amount of clauses that went undebated in another place. This Government&#146;s lack of respect for Parliament and government Back-Benchers&#146; supine acceptance of timetable Motions is nothing short of pathetic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08012268000238"></a>The Government claimed that they would rebalance the criminal justice system. What exactly does this mean? In giving evidence to one of our committees in 2005-06, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, stated that there was no need to rebalance the criminal justice system. Could we please have some help on which of those two things the Government mean?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08012268000239"></a>I start with the changes to the Court of Appeal, which were dealt with extremely well by the noble Lord, Lord Neill. I really should not have anything to add but as I am trying to summarise what the JCHR has said, I ought to try. We are concerned about the fact that the judges will be asked to adjudicate on fact&#151;which is the proper job of a jury&#151;and not on the conduct of the trial. Surely the job of the Court of Appeal is to find whether the trial has been properly conducted and whether there are grounds for a retrial or for the throwing out of the conviction. I believe this has arisen because there is a rumour going about that the Court of Appeal has been letting criminals off because of triviality. There is no evidence of this and the court has found no evidence of this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08012268000240"></a>In previous reports on monitoring breaches of human rights we have noted that the UK law does not allow the reopening of criminal cases following an ECHR judgment.

I have unfortunately lost my Latin copy of it; otherwise, I would have quoted it to your Lordships. However, I certainly would not dream of translating it. Luckily, we are of a much less classical generation so I hope that most of your Lordships would not have understood it. I once quoted it on the wireless&#151;on a Radio 3 programme about pornography rock with the encouragement of the noble Lord, Lord Alli, and a minor payment. This little sideline concerns what is meant by extreme porn. &#147;Extreme&#148; is an extremely subjective word. The law

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08012268000242"></a>We wrote to the Minister, asking for a definition that was sufficiently precise and foreseeable to pass Article 8, relating to respect for privacy, and Article 10, relating to freedom of expression, and asked whether the new offence was necessary in a free society. We are concerned at the vagueness of the offence. We question whether Clause 113 is precise or foreseeable enough to meet the Convention requirements. The offence requires the image to be extreme. That is an extremely subjective judgment in itself. The Explanatory Notes state that the new offence was made to protect individuals from participating in degrading staged activities or bestiality, to cut supply and to prevent others from accidentally coming across such material. We question whether the behaviour criminalised in Clause 113(6)(a) and (b) should be so if carried out by adults in private.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08012268000243"></a>Self-defence and force used to prevent crime are welcome. Our committee thought that the Government clarified it&#151;although the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, said that they did not, so we will have to work that out later&#151;rather than extended the existing law. The noble Lord, Lord Neill, said that that put &#147;a gloss&#148; on it, which is a good expression. However, the issue also brings into focus the question of reasonableness in the circumstances, regardless of the reasonableness of that belief. This can be summarised thus: if a racist householder shoots a black visitor because he believes that all black men are burglars, should that be classed as a reasonable thought and should it be taken into account?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08012268000244"></a>Violent offender orders were not debated at Report in the Commons and they raise serious human rights issues. First, is the power to make them sufficiently defined as to be compatible with the Human Rights Act? Secondly, are they fair in accordance with Article 6? Thirdly, are there sufficient safeguards against retrospective punishment? We think a power to impose VOOs that interferes with Convention rights is not well enough defined to satisfy legal certainty. Unlike the Prevention of Terrorism Act or the Serious Crime Act, the Bill does not include an indicative list of prohibitions, conditions or restrictions that may be imposed. The Explanatory Notes to the Bill state that VOOs are not punitive and do not constitute sanction.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08012268000245"></a>On that issue, we asked the Government three questions: first, would they distinguish between VOOs and indeterminate sentences for public protection; secondly, why is it appropriate to use civil proceedings in circumstances of criminal conviction; and, thirdly, why are criminal guarantees not appropriate in the light of the McCann case? I shall quote the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, who stated in the Court of Appeal that the procedural protections must be commensurate with the gravity and consequences of the controlled individual. He stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08012268000302"></a>&#147;In our view, the combination of the fact that a VOO will only be made where an individual has already been convicted of a serious violent offence, the risk being protected against is the risk of that person causing serious violent harm in the future by committing a serious criminal offence, the severity of the restrictions to which an individual may be subject under a VOO, and the possible duration of such an order (up to two years and infinitely renewable) means that in most cases an application for  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_161"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a VOO is likely to amount to the determination of a criminal charge for the purposes of Article 6 and therefore to attract all the fair trial guarantees in that Article&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012268000246"></a>The Government have accepted in the Commons that criminal standards will apply, but they must be in the Bill. The Minister has confirmed that hearsay evidence and written rather than verbal evidence will be allowed. This evidence must be open to challenge on behalf of the accused, otherwise it will not be subject to Article 6.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08012268000247"></a>Interim violent offender orders can be imposed for four weeks initially and renewed indefinitely. No proof of individual behaviour is necessary. These two conditions are excessive. There must be prima facie evidence and a limit on renewability. The Government dispute that VOOs may clash with Article 7 of the Convention on the possibility of retrospective punishment&#151;that is, the imposition of a VOO arising out of a conviction prior to the Bill becoming law. The Government say that VOOs are not punishment, but are preventive measures; but imposing a curfew sounds to me extremely like, and not dissimilar from, punishment.</p>

There is no respite and I suspect that this pattern will continue in future years. This is at a time when the police are in conflict with the Home Office regarding their pay. Prison officers have not hesitated in taking industrial action. The Probation Service is at breaking point in some areas and demands adequate resources. The future of NOMS is still in question and, more importantly, police and court cells are still being used to house some prisoners, because of overcrowding. In my 30 years of involvement in various parts of the criminal justice field, I have never come across such a sorry state of affairs.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08012268000252"></a>I shall concentrate on two aspects. The first is about immigration. I am tempted at this stage to deal with Part 12, which relates to special immigration status. It affects those who have committed terrorism or other serious criminal offences and who cannot be removed because of Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. I shall of course leave that to my noble friend Lord Avebury who will have a lot to say on that subject. My concern relates not to what is in the Bill but what we have failed to rectify.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08012268000253"></a>As noble Lords will know, Prime Minister Gordon Brown has just returned from his visit to India. This is his second visit. I am aware that during his previous  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_162"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>visit, the Prime Minister of India discussed with him the impact of retrospective changes affecting migrants and their families who entered the UK legally from the Indian subcontinent under the Highly Skilled Migrants Programme (HSMP). The Joint Committee on Human Rights in its report on the HSMP stated that these retrospective changes were unlawful in ECHR law. The Human Rights Commission and the then Commission for Racial Equality stated that the changes were discriminatory and breached Section 71 of the Race Relations Act.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08012268000254"></a>Why do I mention this? The effect on individuals has been catastrophic. We are criminalising groups of people who may be reluctant to leave the United Kingdom. There are those who have returned to India with their families and have lost everything. They felt that the British Government had cheated them. The UK Government unfairly went back on their promise that the HSMP would lead to settlement, but the retrospective changes made that impossible. They have nothing left in their home country&#151;no jobs, no assets, no hope and in some cases not enough money to travel back. These are qualified people. They were deemed to have skills which were required here. To retrospectively alter their status and ask them to leave is inhuman and does not fit with the liberal values we espouse.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08012268000255"></a>If we are concerned about the impact of the Human Rights Act on those who damage this country and wish to remove them&#151;as we intend to do in this legislation&#151;should we not, by the same token, meet our obligations to those whom we trusted under our Highly Skilled Migrants Programme? This was the golden opportunity to rectify this shameful decision, but it does not form part of the Government&#146;s legislative programme. We on our part would certainly wish to explore amendments in Committee to see if this gross injustice could be rectified.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08012268000256"></a>I come to the second part of this Bill, which concentrates on criminal justice matters. I do not wish to sound disgruntled because the Bill may to a small extent help to reduce the prison population. To me, any criminal justice legislation must be measured against its impact on our prisons and its unacceptably high population; and my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford has pointed out our serious concern as to whether that reduction would happen in reality. I have no doubt that the Bill includes a number of provisions that will help to slow down the rapid and alarming increase in the prison population. The most significant of these are the badly needed restrictions on using the indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public protection. The legislation introducing this sentence was so badly drafted that it has led to large numbers of offenders being given indefinite sentences who are far from being the dangerous offenders for whom an indeterminate sentence is appropriate. Half the offenders who have received these sentences have been given tariffs of 20 months or less, showing that their offences are at the less serious end of the spectrum. At least the Bill will limit these sentences to cases involving tariffs of two years or more and will remove the presumption that indefinite sentences should be passed simply because the offender has a previous conviction for a similar offence. Let us hope  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_163"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that this will help to prevent the inappropriate use of these sentences for offenders whom it was never envisaged would receive them.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08012268000257"></a>The Bill also stipulates that non-dangerous offenders who have breached their licences should be recalled to prison for a fixed period of 28 days. This may help to prevent the lengthy and disproportionate imprisonment of offenders who have been recalled for missing, or being late for, probation appointments. But again, as my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford pointed out, there must be judicial oversight, rather than executive power exercised by the Home Secretary or the Justice Minister. The rising number of prisoners being recalled for breach of licence has put increasing pressure on the prison system&#151;they now make up 11 per cent of the local prison population. Although I welcome the Bill's provisions on this point, I would like to see the Government go further by introducing a graduated scale of punishment for breach of licence, with prison being used only when less severe penalties have been tried. Even more important would be to ensure that there is adequate machinery to monitor the outcomes of such punishments.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08012268000258"></a>The Bill provides for the restriction of suspended sentences to indictable offences and those that can be tried either way. There is evidence that courts too often pass suspended sentences where they could have passed a community sentence. Even where courts use the suspended sentence properly to replace an immediate jail sentence, they often fix suspended periods of imprisonment longer than the immediate prison sentence that they would otherwise have passed. If the criminal reoffends and the sentence is activated, the offender is imprisoned for longer than if he had received an immediate prison sentence in the first place. Let us hope that the Bill will at least limit this damage by prohibiting the passing of suspended sentences for minor summary offences.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08012268000259"></a>The new sentence requiring convicted prostitutes to attend three meetings with a supervisor has been controversial. On the one hand, this would be a better option in many cases than the self-defeating sentence of a fine, which drives the offender straight back to the streets to earn more money to pay the fine. In some cases the new sentence could steer prostitutes towards services that will help them to sort out the drug and housing problems that are usually driving them to solicit. On the other hand, it would be unfortunate if the new sentence led to a procession of women, who have failed to turn up for meetings with supervisors because of their chaotic lifestyles, being brought back to court and jailed for failure to attend meetings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08012268000260"></a>Some of the Bill's provisions could help to provide more appropriate ways of dealing with young offenders. It is important that we have an effective probation service, with measures that identify a way forward. One is the extension of conditional cautions to young offenders aged 16 and 17, which provides an additional means of diverting young people away from the formal criminal justice system. Also welcome is the requirement that courts passing an anti-social behaviour order on a juvenile must consider imposing an individual support order alongside the ASBO. But do we have the resources  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_164"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 164</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and the probation structures to ensure that this will happen? One of the main problems with ASBOs is that they are entirely negative measures. They prohibit specified behaviour by the young person, but provide no help to the offender or to their family to change that person's behaviour. Individual support orders can provide a degree of help with the problems that contribute to anti-social behaviour, but courts currently use them in only a small proportion of cases. The Bill should help to increase the number of cases in which positive help is provided to young people who are the subject of an anti-social behaviour order.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08012268000261"></a>I have repeatedly expressed my concerns about the impact of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. I welcome the extension of the Act to bring cautions, final warnings and reprimands within its scope. This will mean that unconditional warnings and cautions are immediately spent for the purposes of the Act and that conditional cautions are spent after three months. After that, they will not have to be declared when the offender is applying for a job. This is welcome, even though I would have preferred to see it as part of legislation involving comprehensive reform of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. However, this does give me an opportunity to introduce reform in a Private Member&#146;s Bill.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08012268000262"></a>Although the Act includes a range of measures that are individually welcome, overall they amount to merely tinkering around the edges of a sentencing and penal system that is in crisis. The prison population is at record levels, the prison system is in a state of extreme overcrowding and the Government's plans to build new, bigger prisons will absorb vast resources that could be better spent on improving prisoners' rehabilitation. I would have preferred to see a Bill that tackled the problem of this country's over-punitive sentencing system head-on. Such a Bill would have legislated to require sentencing guidelines to take account of the capacity of the prison system. It would have removed prison as an option for low level, non-violent crime. It would have prohibited courts from imprisoning offenders, other than the most dangerous, unless they had first tried an intensive community sentence. As it stands, the Bill contains some sensible ideas but fails to take the root-and-branch approach necessary to reform our criminal justice system and to reduce our prison population to levels that are more in line with those of our European neighbours.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, has described the situation very well. The Bill that we need would be more realistic and would set narrower boundaries, not broader ones, for what a criminal justice system should do to protect the public and administer justice. It would make well-grounded decisions about what resources to allocate now and in the future, and then plan how to use them most effectively so that the system could cope with its workload. It would devise a framework enabling those who work in the system

If we were moving towards such a system, we would be moving towards a safer and less frightened country. Sadly, we are not.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08012268000264"></a>The way of making policy that the Bill exemplifies, with a bit of this and a bit of that and without proper analysis and assessment of the unintended consequences, has not served us well. Those of us who spent many days debating the Offender Management Bill and questioning the realism of the Government&#146;s claims are not surprised that the NOMIS database, which was meant to be the holy grail in allowing for end-to-end offender management, has been scaled back and will now be used only by prisons. Nor are we surprised that end-to-end offender management has been brought in only for a very small group of offenders. That is a sensible outcome, but the realities should have been understood from the start.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08012268000265"></a>Therefore, my starting point is that if we were making evidenced-based policy and using resources to best effect, we would not be here today debating this Bill. However, we are, so is there anything in it to welcome? I am sure that we all welcome the decision to rectify some of the mistakes and misjudgments of earlier legislation: for example, introducing a minimum tariff of two years for IPPs and extended sentences; giving credit for bail on electronic monitoring; realigning the 1991 and 2003 Acts&#146; early release provisions; and fixing the period of 28 days for recalled offenders.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08012268000266"></a>I also warmly welcome the Minister&#146;s announcement in his opening remarks that the clauses on the Commissioner for Offender Management and Prisons are being withdrawn. Although it is highly desirable that this office is placed on a statutory footing, the Government&#146;s proposals as they stood were deeply flawed. However, I support the remarks of my noble friend Lady Howe about the Government&#146;s weak-kneed approach to the proposals made by the noble Baroness, Lady Corston.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08012268000267"></a>I want to concentrate specifically today on one aspect of the Bill&#151;that is, the compatibility of these proposals with the Government&#146;s human rights obligations. We are fortunate that, thanks to the dedication and hard work of the staff of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which I am a member, a report on these matters was agreed yesterday evening and produced overnight so as to be available for this debate. I hope that the Minister noted at the beginning of that report the appreciation expressed for the full Explanatory Notes on human rights compatibility, which the committee found &#147;unprecedented&#148;. I hope that this comprehensive report will be of use to the many noble Lords who are interested in the Bill, and I am glad that it has already been referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, my noble friend Lady Howe, and the noble Lords, Lord Henley and Lord Thomas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08012268000268"></a>Perhaps I may say a word about youth justice. Our youth justice system is a scandal and has been the subject of adverse reports from all the main human rights bodies. It subjects some of the most vulnerable children in our society to punishments that they do  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_166"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not understand, because their lives so far have been nothing but punishment, in places that are not in any way appropriate to hold them and meet their needs and where they are subjected to practices such as strip-searching&#151;sometimes forcible strip-searching while they are restrained&#151;and pain infliction. Those practices are clearly inhumane and degrading.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08012268000269"></a>I never thought that I would see the day when the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, which among other things concerns itself with prison conditions in Russia and what happens in police stations in Turkey, came here and told Her Majesty&#146;s Government that it was not acceptable in children&#146;s prisons to hit children on the nose until they felt pain to make them do what they were told. I assume that that is what happened as, soon after the committee&#146;s visit, the Government announced that this practice was to be discontinued. We must be grateful that the Government abandoned it. In that respect, I should like to mention the Labour Member of Parliament for Northampton North, Sally Keeble, who has campaigned with such determination to get these practices changed. We must also be grateful that the Department for Children, Schools and Families became involved and that two esteemed professionals with childcare backgrounds were brought in by the Government to look at what I would describe as the gross and indefensible use of restraint in children&#146;s prisons. Those of us who have met these two professionals are optimistic about the outcome of their work. In order to take forward this reform agenda, it is essential that we change our approach to the use of custody, and therefore I hope that the Minister will listen carefully to those who urge us to amend the Bill to create a threshold for the incarceration of children.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08012268000270"></a>In response to arguments about reforming the youth justice system, Ministers have tended to say that critics fail to appreciate that some children commit serious crimes. Of course they do; those who urge reform know that children from abused and violent backgrounds may well commit serious crimes. These are the children who need particular skilled, painstaking care and attention if they are to grow into adults able to lead violence-free lives. This is not just a human rights issue; it is a case of recognising the evidence and devising policies accordingly.</p>

<a name="80122-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08012268000271"></a>I turn specifically to the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. The committee welcomed the introduction of the generic community sentence for children under 18 on the basis that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012268000316"></a>&#147;it has the potential to enhance the legal protection for the human rights of children and young people in the criminal justice system&#148;.</ul>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80122-0008.htm"/>



<p><a name="08012268000294"></a>However, the committee is concerned that custody should be a last resort and that punishments should be proportionate&#151;not only to the offence but to the child&#146;s age and intellectual and emotional maturity. Therefore, it recommends that we remember the requirement of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child that in all measures taken in regard to children, the best interests of the child should be paramount. The committee therefore finds unacceptable the thrust of Clause 9&#151;that the best interests of the child should be subordinated to the principal aim of the youth justice system. It recommends that the Bill  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_167"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 167</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be amended to make it explicit that the sentencing court should have regard to the welfare of the child &#147;as a primary consideration&#148;.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08012268000272"></a>The committee noted with surprise that there is no presumption that children are entitled to publicly funded legal representation in criminal proceedings and it recommends an amendment to provide such a right. The Joint Committee was also concerned about the proposal to cap the amount of compensation payable to those who suffer a miscarriage of justice. It did not accept that there should be a cap and envisaged that &#163;500,000 might be very inadequate recompense for someone who had been unjustly imprisoned for a large part of his or her life. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, put that point very well in his opening remarks. The committee recommended that this provision be deleted.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08012268000273"></a>The committee supported wholeheartedly, as will all noble Lords, the need for rehabilitation of the very many vulnerable people involved in prostitution. This would be a human rights-enhancing measure. But we were very concerned that enforcement could result in 72-hour detention and might lead to imprisonment. We hope that the Minister will consider deleting this provision.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08012268000274"></a>The Joint Committee has produced some model amendments on these and other matters that we hope to be able to table in Committee, and we look forward very much to the work that we have to do to make this a better Bill.</p>

I join those who have criticised the size and, indeed, the content of the Bill. Here we have yet another large criminal justice Bill to add yet more criminal offences to the already overburdened statute book at a time when there is an acute shortage of prison places.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_spopq0"></a><a name="08012272000002"></a>In the 10 years since 1997, 3,000 new criminal offences have been added to the statute book. In light of the acute shortage of prison places, I tabled a Written Question to ask Her Majesty&#146;s Government,</p>
<ul><a name="08012272000013"></a>&#147;whether, in light of the acute shortage of prison places, they will review all the criminal offences created since 1997 carrying a prison sentence&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012272000010"></a>I thought that I would get a reasonable response to that, and that the Government would be as worried as I am about all these offences, with perhaps many unintended consequences, which they had not thought of in the beginning. The Answer was:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08012272000012"></a>&#147;The Government do not consider that it would be helpful to review all offences created since any particular date, but all departments that propose new offences are required to refer these to the Ministry of Justice for consideration of prison population implications&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>7/1/08; cols. <I>WA 170-71</I>.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012272000011"></a>Has that department seen this Bill? Have they considered all the implications of all the new offences that carry a prison sentence? Have they considered whether they are all necessary and, indeed, whether the prison system can cope with them in its present parlous state? We shall have to see what the answers to those questions are.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_168"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08012272000003"></a>Another item has, understandably, not received much attention. As a trade unionist since the age of 16, I was particularly perturbed that a Labour Government, who had opposed a previous Tory Act that limited the right of prison officers to strike, should itself re-import that provision into this Bill. Whatever has happened to collective bargaining, which the Labour Party and the trade union movement have fought for throughout their existence? That provision is a disgrace to the Labour Party, which, after all, was created out of the trade union movement and which, I hope, still believes in free collective bargaining. Public servants should not be in any worse a position than private-sector employees in fighting for their pay and rights. It was particularly insensitive of the Government to introduce this provision just as they were telling the police that they could not have the full award of the police pay committee.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08012272000004"></a>I move on to Clause 126, which deals with hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation. We have already heard all the reasons why that clause should not appear in this Bill from the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester. I want to approach it from a secular point of view. In 1957 I was a member of the court and council of the University of Reading. The vice-chancellor of the university at that time, whom I liked and knew well, was Sir John Wolfenden. Of course, Sir John produced an excellent report. Unfortunately, it was 10 years before it was implemented. Sir John brought the issue alive and said why homosexuality should be decriminalised for consenting adults over the age of 21. I supported that absolutely. That was a time when, if you supported the Wolfenden report, you were held in great suspicion. Make no mistake about that; it was not very easy.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08012272000005"></a>Things have moved on, and I am very glad that they have done so. Unfortunately, some of the leaders of the gay and lesbian community&#151;Stonewall in particular&#151;are now demanding not equality, which we all agree with, but privilege. That goes too far. We are perfectly in favour of equality in matters of sexual orientation, but I am concerned about the implications of Clause 126 for free speech, particularly as it omits the free speech protection given in respect of racial and religious hatred legislation.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08012272000006"></a>People are already confused about what they can and cannot say; that, in itself, is a restriction on free speech. Indeed, they are at risk of arrest. Frightening cases have already been brought by the police, which should give us pause before passing this clause. Let me remind noble Lords of some of them. In 2005, a Christian couple, Joe and Helen Roberts, were interrogated by the police because they complained about their local council&#146;s gay rights policy. All they did was make a complaint. The Bishop of Chester was investigated by the Cheshire constabulary in November 2003 after he told his local newspaper of research showing that some homosexuals reorientated to heterosexuality. He was perfectly entitled to say that without being interviewed by the police. In December 2005, the police questioned the family values campaigner, Lynette Burrows, after she expressed the view on a radio programme that homosexual men may not be suitable for raising children. She was entitled to express that opinion without the police coming down on her like a ton of bricks.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_169"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 169</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80122-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08012272000007"></a>Apparently Stonewall has a solution. Ben Summerskill, one of the main proponents of a homosexual incitement offence, believes that such an offence would allow religious beliefs about homosexuality to be stated, provided they were expressed in a temperate way. Who is going to judge what is temperate? We could all produce differing definitions. There are real dangers in this point of view.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08012272000008"></a>In conclusion, Stonewall appears to have undue influence on Government policy. It is certainly due to their pressure that this clause was introduced. Stonewall does not have the unqualified support of the gay community; make no mistake about that. Peter Tatchell and Matthew Parris have both spoken against the clause because they believe that it will not help homosexuals and lesbians. Furthermore, Stonewall appears to believe that somehow gays are less able to stand up for themselves than everybody else. I do not believe that that is true. They are just the same as anybody else and can fight their corner as they wish. By its actions Stonewall is putting them at greater risk of physical attack.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08012272000009"></a>I believe that the clause is unnecessary and should be struck out. If not, at least we should have the paragraph about free speech added to it as it applies to other legislation on race and religion. Without that it will be an extremely dangerous clause.</p>

The clause cries out for amendment to protect the right to free speech, and no doubt such amendments will be debated in Committee. Right now the question is whether there is any need for the clause at all in light of the fact that there are already laws to deal with those who are minded to stir up hatred against gays. The question is whether this is not just another example of the Government&#146;s enthusiasm for creating more and more offences without proper consideration on whether they are really necessary or whether they interfere unnecessarily with personal liberty.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08012289000002"></a>Let me make one thing absolutely plain. There is no place in a civilised society for hatred towards gay people. The existing law, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester reminded the House, already bans threatening, abusive, insulting words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress, with&#151;incidentally&#151;tougher penalties when the conduct is aggravated by hostility towards someone because of his sexual orientation. Far from the existing law being weak, difficult to apply and ineffective, it has been used extensively in recent times, sometimes raising legitimate concerns on whether the police are very expert at analysing people&#146;s utterances to determine whether they have gone beyond comment and criticism and are abusive, threatening or calculated to stir up hatred.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08012289000003"></a>Let us be absolutely clear. The police already have power to arrest someone who they think is whipping up homophobic hatred. Really serious cases, and cases  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_170"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when the Public Order Act does not bite because no one present is likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress, can be dealt with under the Serious Crime Act 2007, which, in toughening up the old law on incitement, makes it criminal to encourage or assist the commission of crime&#151;to use, for instance, words that recklessly encourage criminal violence. Contrary to what the chief executive of Stonewall told the Commons Public Bill Committee, there is no gap in the law to allow rap lyrics which, in the example given by Stonewall, encourage the killing of gay people. That is clearly criminal, but in the vast majority of cases the present Public Order Act is potent enough. It allowed the arrest of the evangelist Stephen Green for handing out leaflets containing the notorious passage from Leviticus. It allowed the prosecution to conviction of a Bournemouth man who displayed a placard saying, &#147;Stop homosexuality, stop lesbianism&#148;.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08012289000004"></a>It is an unfortunate fact that the police have not always used the existing law wisely. As the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, said, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester was investigated after he referred in an article to the possibility of some homosexuals being reoriented to heterosexuality. Robin Page, the former presenter of &#147;One Man and His Dog&#148;, was arrested for making some frivolous and tasteless but certainly not criminal remarks at a country fair, and a retired couple have recently recovered damages for the harassment and intimidation to which they were subjected after complaining about Fleetwood Council&#146;s gay rights policy. There was then, as your Lordships will remember, the absurd arrest and prosecution to conviction of the Oxford student by police who chose to construe a joke about a horse being gay as criminally homophobic. Then there was the interrogation of Lynette Burrows in the circumstances that the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, again outlined.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08012289000005"></a>None of this means that there should not be strong laws to protect gay people but it makes one wonder what conduct the Government envisage will be caught by this law that is not already covered by existing legislation. It also shows that the police have not been very adept at applying existing hate-crime laws and makes one doubt the case for their spending even more time in this area. With violent crime rampant, which was made very plain by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, I encourage the police to spend more time on men&#146;s actions and less time on their utterances.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08012289000006"></a>It is no use the Government saying that the new power can be used only when the offending words are specifically intended to pose a threat and are not merely humorous, mocking and abusive. It is no use the Government going on about the need for the Attorney-General&#146;s consent. A police officer, armed with the power to arrest without warrant, will in the first place be the judge of what has crossed the line from the abusive to the threatening. There is nothing in recent history to persuade me that the police will be sensitive to the difference between robust criticism and incitement to hatred, or that they will behave moderately any more than did the police in Bournemouth who persecuted the unfortunate, and now deceased, Mr Hammond.</p>

The Government even defended the proposition that it was criminal to read out a list of those killed in Iraq from the steps of the Cenotaph. We should not now be creating more criminal offences without being 100 per cent sure that they are necessary and will not be misused.</p>

<a name="08012289000009"></a><b><a name="80122-0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08012289000129"></a>Baroness Linklater of Butterstone:</b> My Lords, along with others today, I find something heart-sinking about yet another enormous criminal justice Bill covering a multitude of issues without any discernible theme or thread, as it moves through a range of young offender, sentencing and other criminal justice provisions. Then, having dropped the proposal for a commissioner for offender management and prisons, it moves on to criminal law, policing and immigration before ending up with &#147;Miscellaneous&#148; and then &#147;General&#148;, to mention just some of its 14 parts. Like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, I find I am humming along to the same theme; that this is a Bill without a discernible theme. It is indeed a hotchpotch of provisions, some good and some bad. Sentencers will be putting back the towel they had on their heads as they got around the Criminal Justice Act 2003, then the Police and Justice Act 2006 and then the Offender Management Act 2007, to mention just a recent few.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08012289000010"></a>It has also escaped nobody that scandalously scant time was allowed for scrutiny in the other place&#151;scrutiny which now falls to this House to try to rectify. However, I fear that the more we tinker, the more complicated and opaque the result becomes. It seems to me that the heart of the problem is the complete disjunction between the stated aims of our criminal justice system and the way policy and practice is carried out.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08012289000011"></a>There is clear unanimity at every level of government and the judiciary, as well as all the agencies, both voluntary and private, that custody should only ever be used as a last resort and then only for the most dangerous, violent and prolific offenders. This has been repeated by all recent Home Secretaries and Lords Chancellor, as well as loudly and eloquently by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice, and echoed by everyone in the field, including those who wrote the Home Office strategy paper which laid the groundwork for much of this Bill.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08012289000012"></a>The solution, we know, has to be found in community-based penalties, which are not only cheaper and work better, but involve a measure of making good by the offender, putting something back into the community against which there has been an offence. They make a constructive connection. Above all, they create the opportunity for offending to be reduced, which is the ultimate goal and overarching justification for all the sentencing options and policies we try to construct.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_172"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80122-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08012289000013"></a>Above all else, the public want the offender not to do it again. Polls have repeatedly demonstrated the recognition by the public that prison is not the answer to cutting crime, and that the public are not pressing for the punitive measures the press and many politicians would have us believe. We have consensus but, despite all this, what do we actually do? We send more people to prison than almost every other country in western Europe; the number of people given custody at magistrates&#146; courts has more than doubled between 1993 and 2005 and has risen by one-third in the Crown Courts. Crucially, people are sent to prison for longer. We have such a problem as a result with overcrowding that it is not possible for prisons to do the job we want them to do with the dangerous prisoners they should be dealing with. There have been times when these prisons have operated beyond safety limits. Yet, for example, last year more than 50,000 people were sent to prison for less than a year. They were not dangerous, violent people from whom we needed protection.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08012289000014"></a>It should become clear that it is absolutely vital that enough proper community alternatives are available in order that sentencers have the necessary confidence and can use them. What have we done about the alternatives&#151;the sanctions expressly deemed appropriate for the minority of all we deem offenders? They are largely provided, as we know, by the Probation Service along with the range of other agencies working with offending and vulnerable people of all ages. But what we have actually done is to require agencies such as the Probation Service to cut back on their budgets&#151;in the case of the Probation Service, by somewhere between 3 and 5 per cent year on year over the next three years. Simultaneously, however, the Government have now agreed to spend around &#163;3 billion to solve the prison crisis, and no one has blinked. That is a crazy failure of the right hand to have any connection with what the left is doing. It is even crazier when the Secretary of State himself is on record as having said that we cannot build ourselves out of this crisis.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08012289000015"></a>There is evidence galore of the price that is being paid socially, economically and financially in our country. I am aware that most of what I have said is probably quite familiar to most of us in this Chamber, but it has to change. Even as far as this Bill is concerned, nearly every clause carries with it some financial implications, resources which are necessary to make things a reality without which we remain in a world of unreality. Every new measure involving the courts and community costs something, but I am not aware of plans for the commensurate growth in front-line community resourcing which in any way relates to the investment in prison building.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08012289000016"></a>However, I will say that I welcome the impact statement in the Explanatory Notes on the Bill. The Government have calculated that once the provisions have been fully implemented, I think in a few years&#146; time, there will be a net reduction of 4,300 prison places, which of course will be a start. The alternative disposals will have to be supplied and paid for. I entreat the Minister to tell us how the mismatch of the allocation of resources between prison building and community-penalty resources can be rebalanced  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_173"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 173</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in order that the appropriate provision exists and our debates on this Bill can indeed become rooted in reality.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08012289000017"></a>I will confine the remainder of my remarks to one or two of the youth justice aspects of this Bill. I am grateful to the Standing Committee for Youth Justice for its briefing, and the PRT, among others. I have dealt with children in trouble in Scotland as well as England. The difference is that in Scotland no child gets near the criminal justice system because of the children&#146;s hearings. This explicitly recognises the paramount importance of the welfare of the child, as is the requirement of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. I understand that the committee is to examine the UK Government again this year. I would like to think that this Bill could offer an opportunity to look again at how we are, in fact, increasingly criminalising young children and using custody more and more. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, for referring to what is a true blot on the record of this country&#151;that we should be imprisoning so many children in what were called secure training centres and have now become acknowledged and recognised as part of the Prison Service system. We could consider introducing the concept of a custody threshold for children, which she also mentioned.</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08012289000018"></a>The Home Office strategy paper underpinning much of this Bill does say that we believe it is important to keep children out of prison if at all possible. This is not to say that children in trouble will not sometimes badly need secure accommodation, but of course as we know prison is not the answer. Prison is least effective and most damaging for children, with their reoffending as high as 80 per cent and over. As the noble Lord, Lord Judd, mentioned, one of the most alarming and distressing statistics is that self-harming by children rose by 803 per cent between 2001 and 2004, and six children have actually died in custody in the past five years. It has been suggested that the threshold for custody could be triggered if the offence causes serious harm or if custody is necessary to protect the public. This would inter alia bring us more in line with similar European countries, including of course Scotland. Will the Government be prepared to comply with the UNCRC on that issue?</p>

<a name="80122-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08012289000019"></a>The new youth rehabilitation orders are interesting, because they are an attempt to provide a real alternative to custody and, as such, should be welcomed, despite their many shortcomings. They represent an attempt to provide a more flexible and creative package of sentencing which could, if used properly, more nearly fit the individual young person, not least if he or she reoffends. However, 11 community sentences have been replaced by 16 requirements that, among other things, do not include the reparation order, which can be an important element. Why? What is really interesting here is that, in two cases&#151;that of intensive fostering and of the drug treatment requirement&#151;they cannot be imposed unless the Secretary of State has notified that the provision is locally available. Here is one actual reference to the need for provision to be in place. After all, what is the point of including in the Bill provision that is not actually available?</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08012289000020"></a>It is also helpful that the purposes of sentencing are clearly set out in the Bill, but what is not clear or set out is that the welfare and best interests of the child are and must be at the heart of the youth justice system. Article 37 of the UNCRC commits us explicitly to separate the system for dealing with children who have trouble with the law from that for adults. At present, the evidence is that punishment is put before welfare in this country. I sincerely hope that we can address that in Committee, and I hope that the Minister will agree to look at that.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08012289000021"></a>Much needs to be done on the detail, as well as the general thrust of the Bill. I am sure that there will be stimulating and important debates, because there is much work to be done and some important issues to be dealt with. I hope&#151;although not very optimistically so&#151;that we will all be the wiser for it.</p>

<a name="08012289000022"></a><b><a name="80122-0009.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08012289000130"></a>Lord Lloyd of Berwick:</b> My Lords, many Members will have received, as I did, the briefing paper from the Bar Council to which the noble Lord referred earlier, criticising, in particular, Clauses 42 and 105. Clause 42 has already been very well covered, notably by the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, and by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, but, if I may, I would like to add my penny-worth to the argument.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08012289000023"></a>The inclusion of Clause 42 seems to me to show that the Government have no clear idea of the existing powers of the Court of Appeal, or, indeed, what the Court of Appeal is there for. It is simply not the case that appeals are allowed because of minor procedural errors. If there are such errors, the appeal will certainly be dismissed on the grounds that it will not have affected the safety of the conviction. If the errors are more serious, the conviction may well be quashed but, very generally, there will be an order for a new trial&#151;apparently, in one-third of all cases where convictions are quashed. That seems to me to show that the existing system is working well.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08012289000024"></a>There remain those cases, the very few cases&#151;Mullen is always the one given by way of example&#151;where, for whatever reason, the defendant has not had a fair trial. In those cases, the conviction must be quashed, even though there is no possibility of a retrial. Why? Because it is an overriding duty of the Court of Appeal to ensure that defendants have a fair trial, no matter how guilty they may seem to be. That has always been the function of the Court of Appeal, and that is now the court&#146;s duty under Article 6 of the European convention. If the defendant has not had a fair trial in accordance with the rule of law, his conviction must be quashed. It is as simple as that.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08012289000025"></a>It therefore seems to me that proposed new subsection (1A), by requiring the court to dismiss the appeal if it is satisfied of the defendant&#146;s guilt, is clearly in conflict with the court&#146;s duty under Article 6 of the convention. It is true that new subsection (1B) would go some way to cure the defect created by new subsection (1A) in some cases, but it does not go far enough. In any event, what could be the point of enacting new subsection (1A) to cure a defect or fill a gap that does not exist and then create an express

That simply does not make sense, and I hope that, in due course, we will see to it that Clause 42 is removed.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08012289000026"></a>As for Clause 105, designated case workers clearly perform a very valuable function, but they are not qualified legally to conduct trials. As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, suggested, it seems to me that Clause 105 has been included as a cost-cutting exercise. It may not even be effective as that, but whether it is effective or not, it must not be allowed to interfere with justice.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08012289000027"></a>Like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, my eye was caught by Part 13, quaintly entitled &#147;Miscellaneous&#148; provisions. One might ask exactly what was the dividing line between the provisions included in Part 13 and the rest of the Bill? However, the Bill being what it is, it is perhaps better at Second Reading to stand back a little from the detailed provisions and consider in what way the criminal law is now moving.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08012289000028"></a>The first and obvious question is: why are we being asked to consider this massive criminal justice Bill so soon after the Criminal Justice Act 2003? If there had been any serious defects in the criminal law, which I do not believe that there were, surely they ought to have been cured when the present Government came back for the second time with the 2003 Act. So why do we have this massive new Bill? I suspect that one answer is the Government&#146;s perceived need&#151;perceived by the Government, but not by me or, I suspect, by the rest of us&#151;to reassure the public from time to time that they are being tough on crime. Of course, that has the additional advantage of putting the official Opposition in the awkward position of not wanting to oppose unnecessary provisions for fear of appearing soft on crime.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08012289000029"></a>Thus, what goes into a criminal Justice Bill nowadays seems to be at least in part driven by what will play well with the public. There is thus little time left for the serious consideration of basic defects in the structure of our criminal law&#151;a good example of which is the law of murder, on which we touched the other day during Questions. Everybody knows that the law of murder is in a mess, and has known long before the Law Commission said so in clear terms in its report in 2006. Everybody knows that one of the difficulties in making sense of the criminal law is the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. It causes great injustice in individual cases. The Law Commission sought to solve that problem by dividing the law of murder into two degrees, only one of which would carry the mandatory life sentence.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08012289000030"></a>That is the sort of question that we ought to be considering today. But what do the Government do? They shelve the problem. Yet again, they have decided to consult on one aspect only of the Law Commission report: on the so-called partial defences. The Law Commission reported on that subject as long ago as 2004 and still nothing has happened. And why not? Because neither of the main political parties will dare to tackle this obvious problem without the co-operation of the other, for fear of what the <I>Daily Mail </I>might say. I am sorry to put it in those rather blunt terms, but that is the truth as I see it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08012289000031"></a>The second purpose of bringing forward this massive Bill so soon is to correct the mistakes, which have now become apparent, made in 2003. That brings me to Part 2 of the Bill. Everyone accepts that Parliament has a proper role in fixing general levels of sentences. However, if it does, Parliament must take account of the consequences. A good example&#151;I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, dealt with this point&#151;is the new indefinite sentence for the protection of the public; the flagship of the 2003 Act.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08012289000032"></a>Judges already had ample powers to impose discretionary life sentences for the public&#146;s protection and they used those powers. However, the Government thought that more powers were necessary. The effect is that we now have 3,100 defendants serving indefinite sentences, nearly half of them for relatively minor offences, such as street robberies. The average tariff for all of them would have been 30 months. That is a slightly different statistic from the one given by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, but it is another one that shows what has happened.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08012289000033"></a>Surely the Government should have realised that this would happen. Surely they must have realised what would be the effect on prison populations. However, they did not. As a result, as the Lord Chief Justice said in a lecture the other day, after court prisoners are being driven around for hours on end in a desperate search for a prison that can squeeze them in. As often as not, two or three hundred are spending the night in police or court cells. We simply cannot go on like this.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08012289000034"></a>It is particularly unfair on people serving these indefinite sentences because they cannot go before the Parole Board to prove that they are not dangerous until after they have served on a training course; but they cannot get on to a training course. That is a great injustice. I am glad that not before time the Government have decided, at least in part, to backtrack on the effect of indefinite sentences.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08012289000035"></a>At the other end of the Bill, I am equally concerned, as I am sure the noble Lord will realise, about violent offender orders. I shall oppose them in exactly the same way, and for exactly the same reasons, as I opposed serious offender orders. Ever since we hit on ASBOs, it seems that the law has been going down the long road in trying to make civil preventive orders do the work of the criminal courts. Once again, I will have some things to say about that when the time comes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08012289000037"></a>I wish to speak about Clauses 181 to 187, dealing with special immigration status. On 7 February 2000, an Afghan plane carrying 186 passengers landed at Stansted, having been hijacked by a few of the passengers. Three days later, the hostages were all released and the hijackers agreed to surrender unconditionally to the Essex Police. The Home Secretary, then Mr Jack Straw, said that he personally would decide any applications for asylum by persons on board the aircraft and was determined to see that, if legally possible, the passengers would all be removed from the UK as soon as possible. I stood surety for 13 of them in their application for bail, in the sum of &#163;3,900, for well over a year, until the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, gave instructions for that guarantee to be withdrawn. I therefore declare an interest.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08012289000038"></a>In due course, 10 hijackers were charged with a number of offences and an 11th man was found unfit to plead. At the first trial, the jury failed to agree and, in the second, one person was acquitted and the remaining nine were convicted on all counts, but given comparatively light sentences on account of the mitigating circumstances. It was acknowledged by the prosecution that they belonged to a political organisation whose members had been arrested and tortured, and they were threatened with the same fate.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08012289000039"></a>In June 2003, the Court of Appeal set aside the convictions because the trial judge had misdirected the jury in relation to the defence of duress. No retrial was ordered as most respondents had, by that time, served their sentence in full. The panel of three adjudicators who considered the nine men&#146;s applications for asylum concluded that Article 1F of the refugee convention, which applies to a person who,</p>
<ul><a name="08012289000112"></a>&#147;has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08012289000099"></a>excluded them from the protection of the refugee convention. We welcome the recommendation of the JCHR that the statutory construction of Article 1F should be repealed. However, the panel went on to say that the rights protected by Article 3 of the ECHR were unqualified or absolute and not restricted by the appellant&#146;s conduct. It therefore granted the appeals under the ECHR and the tribunal refused an application by the Secretary of State for leave to appeal. This left the Home Secretary with only one option, to grant short-term discretionary leave to enter. However, the Home Secretary prevaricated for over a year&#151;those are the Court of Appeal&#146;s words, not mine&#151;and promulgated a new policy under which discretionary leave would no longer be granted and a person could be kept on temporary admission indefinitely, with all the consequences that would follow in terms of denial of access to employment and public services, including health and social security. On 3 November 2005, the Home Secretary, then Mr John Reid, &#147;broke his long silence&#148;, retrospectively applying the new policy to the Afghan nine and putting them on temporary admission.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08012289000040"></a>The nine then applied for judicial review of this decision. Sullivan J found on 12 May 2006, in an &#147;impeccable judgment&#148;, that it was unlawful because the status of temporary admission or temporary release had no parliamentary sanction.

The Secretary of State did not challenge the finding that delay in granting the nine leave to enter was unlawful or the quashing of his decision to hold them on temporary admission. However, he did challenge the court&#146;s order that he should grant the nine discretionary leave to remain. Finally on 4 August 2006, the Court of Appeal rejected that submission, observing that during the six years that the Afghans had been in the UK, there had been ample time for the Secretary of State to clothe himself with the powers that he had awarded himself, without parliamentary approval, in the August 2005 instruction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08012289000041"></a>What we now have before us , in Clauses 181 to 187, is the creation of special immigration status to cover persons such as the Afghans hijackers, who are excluded from Article 1F protection but who cannot be removed because it would put them at risk under Article 3 of the ECHR. In order to strengthen the BIA&#146;s ability at some future date to send back the tiny numbers involved to where they came from&#151;we understand that there are no more than 50 of them now&#151;the Government intend to consign them to a limbo, as my honourable friend David Heath put it, where they will have no access to employment or to public services other than very limited subsistence and accommodation along the lines that NASS provides at the moment for asylum seekers, although the details remain to be spelt out. They will not be entitled to local authority housing, social security or NHS services except in emergencies, and I believe that their children will be denied education in the state system. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that. Moreover, these conditions will continue indefinitely. The Afghans are a good example because they have lived under them for the past eight years.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08012289000042"></a>Will the Minister confirm that it is the Government&#146;s intention to apply the new status to these nine people, and how do they justify that breach of the principle that legislation should not be retrospective? In Committee we will examine in more detail the circumstances of the dependants, to whom Article 1F does not apply, even under the Government&#146;s notoriously broad interpretation, and we will want to know why the BIA has failed to respond to some of their independent asylum applications made over the past eight years.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08012289000043"></a>Under existing law, people who are not removable for human rights reasons are given discretionary leave to remain for six months at a time, and on each occasion this is renewed, the BIA has the power to review the circumstances and consider whether it might then be safe to remove them. After 10 years applicants may seek indefinite leave to remain, although there is no obligation to grant it. As we see it, the Law Society is right in saying that the new status is unnecessary, and we shall also argue that it is inconsistent with the Government&#146;s declared objective of simplifying immigration law, a project that we wholeheartedly endorse.</p>

<p><a name="08012289000100"></a>We tried to argue the case on the NIA Bill at the time. But now we have a different threat. Everybody who is a foreign criminal convicted of a specified offence, whether it is hijacking or shoplifting, and everyone to whom Article 1F applies whether or not he has been convicted of any offence, can be designated by the Secretary of State, giving him what the Law Society rightly describes as &#147;enormous discretion&#148;. In the words of Justice,</p>
<ul><a name="08012289000114"></a>&#147;the breadth of conduct giving rise to the possibility of designation is extraordinarily and inexplicably broad&#148;.</ul>

The person would also be potentially subject to electronic monitoring or tagging, and failure to comply with any of these conditions may result in a criminal conviction and a sentence of up to 51 weeks&#146; imprisonment. These conditions may last indefinitely and may be applied not only to the person himself, but to his spouse and children, making them subject to the hardship of special status through no fault of their own, contrary to Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. One lawyer with whom I discussed this effect called it &#147;grotesque&#148;, and I agree.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08012289000046"></a>Worse, the ability to rebut the presumption that a designated person is a &#147;danger to the community&#148;, as in Section 72 of the NIA Act, is to be set aside, so the Afghan hijackers whose conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in its judgment of 6 June 2003, and who were found not to be a danger to the community or the security of this country and therefore not caught by the exclusion of Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention, are still liable to designation. There is no independent review mechanism to oversee the use made by the Secretary of State of these extensive powers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08012289000047"></a>When the Government have deliberately persisted in conduct which they knew was unlawful and then come to Parliament seeking to change the law so as to validate the past illegality and allow them to persist in the same conduct in the future, we hope that your Lordships will reject their impudent proposals. The prime duty of Parliament, as we heard earlier today, is to uphold the rule of law and not to acquiesce meekly when governments twist it to match what Prime Ministers say they are going to do, without reflection, in the heat of the moment. These costly and far-reaching clauses, offering no protection to the public, should be removed from the Bill.</p>

<a name="08012289000048"></a><b><a name="80122-0009.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08012289000132"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> My Lords, there are many aspects of the Bill on which I am tempted to speak, but I intend to confine myself this evening to Clauses 123, 124 and 125 in Part 7, those dealing with street offences. I start by expressing my disappointment that the Government have not taken this opportunity to carry out a comprehensive reform of the law on prostitution, which everyone who studies the subject agrees is long overdue. They are instead proceeding in what must be seen as a piecemeal way. The best government publication on the subject in recent years is <I>Paying the Price</I>, published in 2004, and it is worth reminding ourselves what it said about street-based prostitution. Paragraph 1.6 reads like this:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="08012289000108"></a>&#147;A common pattern is for men and women to be trapped in street-based prostitution after having been coerced into it at a young age or to fund their own&#151;and often their partner&#146;s&#151;problematic drug use. Those involved in this way rarely benefit, apart from ensuring their drug supply. The profits of the &#145;trade&#146; go straight into the pockets of drug dealers. While some may become involved &#145;to buy nice things&#146;&#151;and for some it is undoubtedly a highly lucrative business&#151;for the 80-95% of those involved in street-based prostitution to feed a serious drug habit the reality is very different&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012289000102"></a>We have to bear in mind that the street-based sector represents only about 15 per cent of the total of perhaps 80,000 sex workers, a statistic which is either ignored or misunderstood by a number of politicians and others who comment on these matters.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08012289000049"></a>In <I>Paying the Price</I>, serious consideration was given to the possibility that local authorities would be allowed to sanction red-light toleration zones, with sex workers licensed and regular health checks introduced, an approach followed in a number of other countries, including Australia and Holland. These are worth looking at, as is the kind of decriminalisation introduced in New Zealand. <I>Paying the Price</I> was a real step forward, and it was the hope that legislation to implement its proposals would not be long in coming, but unfortunately we are still waiting, because this Bill is certainly nowhere near that.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08012289000050"></a>As your Lordships may be aware, I have raised some of these issues in the House on a number of occasions over the past seven years. I first did so during the passage of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, which strengthened the law on carding&#151;placing cards advertising sexual services in phone boxes. Sections 46 and 47 of that Act had the effect of making it harder for women working in the relative safety of their own flats to advertise for clients, with the consequence that many were tempted to resume soliciting on the streets, where the risk of serious assault is many times greater. I pointed out that research carried out by the Economic and Social Research Council among indoor and street-working prostitutes in three British cities found that women working on Glasgow&#146;s streets were six times more likely to be violently attacked by clients than those working indoors in Edinburgh, and four times more likely than indoor workers in Leeds.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08012289000051"></a>In a debate on sentencing initiated by the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury in March 2004, I described for the House what happened when I was invited by the Metropolitan Police in January of that year to join its street offences and  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_181"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 181</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>juvenile protection unit on patrol in Brixton. The officers were conducting a four-week intensive campaign on street soliciting. The evening started with a briefing at a police station in Camberwell, two walls of which were covered with photographs of prostitutes known to work in the area. I was told that it was certain that a number of those women would be arrested for soliciting during the night&#151;and that was exactly how it turned out.</p>

<a name="80122-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08012289000052"></a>One of them was a 23 year-old woman known as Judy. As a known prostitute, she was arrested walking down a side street in a red-light district of Brixton. She had a string of convictions for soliciting and a reputation for never appearing in court unless taken straight there from a police cell. She worked in the sex industry to fund her cocaine habit. I found it particularly disturbing that no one appeared to make any attempt to get her off drugs. Instead, she was in a cycle of soliciting, arrest, a court appearance, a fine, and then more soliciting to pay the fine and buy the drugs. That evening made a profound impression on me, and since then I have tried to judge the various proposals that have emanated from the Government and other well meaning bodies for dealing with street prostitution on whether they are likely to be of any real value or help to women like Judy.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08012289000053"></a>I have read with great care the <I>Hansard</I> reports of proceedings in another place on this Bill, and particularly the debates in Committee on the clauses dealing with street offences. On Second Reading on 8 October, John McDonnell, MP for Hayes and Harlington, articulated the concerns of the Safety First Coalition, which is a remarkable group of individuals and organisations including religious groups such as Zacchaeus 2000, as well as the Royal College of Nursing, the National Association of Probation Officers and the English Collective of Prostitutes. Their stance is supported by medical consultants and the British Psychological Society, using practitioner knowledge and evidence from the top medical and legal journals.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08012289000054"></a>The coalition came together following the murders of the five young women in Ipswich, to put forward the point of view that everyone deserves to be safe, regardless of gender, race, occupation or lifestyle. This received widespread support from the people of Ipswich, who rather than blaming such women themselves believe that everything possible should be done to ensure their safety in future. The coalition organised a well attended meeting in Committee Room 10 last Wednesday. A number of Members of your Lordships&#146; House were there to hear unanimous criticism of the clause, which, to quote from its briefing,</p>
<ul><a name="08012289000115"></a>&#147;introduces compulsory rehabilitation under threat of imprisonment&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80122-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08012289000055"></a>On the surface, Clause 124 may appear a well meaning effort to get people out of the sex industry. I respect my noble friend Lord Hunt for putting forward that point of view in his opening speech. Indeed, it is linked to a proposal in Clause 123 to do away with the term &#147;common prostitute&#148;, which dates back to the Vagrancy Act 1824. That is long overdue. Yet what chance is there that women such as Judy, to whom I referred a moment ago, would ever turn up for these rehabilitation sessions? The answer is almost none at all. Have we forgotten what we know about  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_182"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 182</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>addiction? Compulsion does not work, and the person must be willing and supported in order to be able to change her life.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08012289000056"></a>The Safety First Coalition believes that a failure to appear would lead to a summons back to court, possible imprisonment for 72 hours and that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012289000116"></a>&#147;women could end up on a treadmill of broken supervision meetings, court orders and imprisonment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012289000057"></a>This is clearly a view with which the Joint Committee on Human Rights concurs, in its paragraph 155 on page 117, as the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, pointed out in her brilliant speech a little earlier. In other words, this measure could increase the criminalisation of consensual sex with the effect that, instead of seeking help to get out of the sex industry or deal with a drug dependency, it would be driven further underground. Driving prostitution underground is guaranteed to increase sex workers&#146; vulnerability to rape and other violence, as violent men would know that the risk of arrest deters sex workers from reporting assaults.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08012289000058"></a>The truth is that recent piecemeal legislative changes mean that we now have some of the most punitive laws on prostitution anywhere in the world, particularly given the increasing numbers of anti-social behaviour orders being directed at women working in the sex industry who then end up in prison for breach of the orders. The female prison population has doubled in the past 10 years and, while we do not know exactly how many women are there for offences relating to prostitution&#151;via the breach of an ASBO or the non-payment of a fine which would have originated from soliciting&#151;the number seems substantial. This is a grave situation, especially when we consider that many are young and in need of support, and may be mothers who are then separated from their children. At the same time, we are doing little to &#147;design out&#148; the vulnerability of sex workers, which criminologists show we can, or to tackle the influence of pimps on those women.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08012289000059"></a>I also regret that this Bill does little to address the fundamental reasons why young women&#151;some young men, too&#151;go into prostitution in the first place. We undoubtedly need extra resources to address practical needs such as housing, debt, a viable income and drug addiction treatment.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08012289000060"></a>I would like to be able to say that these clauses were extensively debated in the other place, before they came up to us here. Sadly, that was not the case, as the noble Lord, Lord Henley, pointed out in his opening speech. The longest debate in the other place was whether Britain should adopt the practice adopted in Sweden of criminalising the purchase of sexual services but not their sale. I do not intend to take up the House&#146;s time tonight by debating what has been happening in Sweden, but I counsel my noble friend that there are as many or more powerful arguments against doing what Sweden has attempted as there are for trying it. I for one will certainly oppose such a proposition if it comes before us during the later stages of this Bill.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08012289000061"></a>Finally, bearing in mind that we are promised a substantive piece of legislation reforming the law on prostitution in the next Session&#151;David Hanson, the

I hope that there will be substantial support for this point of view in all parts of the House, and I intend to table amendments in Committee which will do that.</p>

I would go further: it is in most parts good and wholesome. It has been attacked for being a ragbag. That was the expression used by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. Yet he then suggested half a dozen other ragbag provisions that should be added to it. It is, of course, a miscellaneous provisions criminal Bill. All criminal Bills, with few exceptions, are miscellaneous provisions Bills. The condemnation of the noble Lord, Lord Henley, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, that there is a lack of theme to the Bill does not demolish it completely. The late Winston Churchill once growled at a waiter who had presented a blancmange before him, saying &#147;Take it away, it has no theme&#148;. Miscellaneous provisions Bills, by definition, cannot have themes, so should not be judged by that yardstick or measure&#151;no more, for example, than a road traffic Bill should be. It involves so many different and disparate matters that it is essential, if one is to take advantage of legislation passing through the House, to add all manner of disparate parts to it.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08012289000063"></a>I have two general comments. First, we appreciate that for the past 40 years Parliament has suffered a surfeit of criminal justice legislation. This, we are told, is the 39th Bill of a criminal nature to be introduced in the past 10 years. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, gives a higher figure and he may very well be right. We appreciate that the law must change with changing events, and change swiftly. Nevertheless, the pace of change in relation to legislation has been wholly excessive. Her Majesty&#146;s loyal Opposition need take no comfort from that. They need not dress themselves in any white sheet of purity because their fecundity regarding criminal justice legislation over the 18 years preceding 1997 was, if anything, greater than the record of the present Government.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08012289000064"></a>There seems to be a mentality which suggests that once a criminal justice Act has been in existence for a period of time, one should, at best, tinker with it and, at worst, take it to pieces. Both the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and the Theft Act 1968&#151;I had the privilege, as a Minister in the Home Office, of taking the 1968 Act through the other place&#151;are, with very few exceptions, as fresh, as useful and as competent today as the day on which they received Royal Assent. The fact that something is ageing and aged does not mean that it has to be thrown away. Perhaps I should declare an interest because of my age. I feel, mischievously sometimes, that as an obverse to the Bill of Rights of the late 17th<sup></sup>century, there should be a provision that Parliament should not be allowed to pass more than one criminal justice Bill per annum.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_184"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 184</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08012289000065"></a>The second matter I wish to refer to is the most vicious of vicious circles in the relationship between the volume of criminal justice legislation and the apprehension of the public in relation to their safety from crime. Parliament rolls out criminal justice Bill after criminal justice Bill; the public are incensed to believe that their position is becoming more and more desperate. As the public take up such a position, more and more criminal justice Bills come through Parliament. You may say, &#147;Hold on. A dread of crime is, after all, a legitimate and natural reaction in any civilised community. Why should people not feel shock and horror at young people being knifed and shot on their streets? Why should the weak, the aged, the infirm and the otherwise wholly vulnerable not feel terror at the prospect of being robbed or burgled? Why should not society feel abhorrence in relation to the scourge of drugs, especially among young people?&#148; That is not my case. Anyone who does not react to those fears would be callous and indifferent. But when you have a situation of near hysteria in society, when the community seems to be saying, &#147;We are engulfed by a tidal wave of crime and the courts, the police and Parliament are impotent to protect us&#148;, that is the point at which we have to consider the viciousness of these vicious circles.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08012289000066"></a>In the past 10 years crime has decreased in Britain by about 35 per cent. I agree that it may, to some extent, very well be part of a general trend, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said. In the preceding 18 years, crime doubled. One would have thought, therefore, that there might have been some prospect of one graph line going down and being roughly tracked and paralleled by the other graph line&#151;but they are moving in wholly different directions. As was suggested by my noble and learned friend Lord Lloyd of Berwick, that may have a great deal to do with the editors of tabloid newspapers. I think it has something to do also with ruthless and unprincipled political propagandism, but that is a matter for another day.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08012289000067"></a>There are many measures in the Bill that I support. I commend, on the whole, the provisions for the rehabilitation of youths. There are difficulties, which no doubt will be discussed in detail in Committee, but I particularly welcome the activity aspects of a rehabilitation order and the fostering provisions, which are imaginative and link up with the more general law relating to children and young persons. It is a step forward to seek that ASBOs for young people should be reviewed every 12 months. That is a progressive and intelligent development.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08012289000068"></a>On pornography, it is only right that we should tighten the law in regard to its most scurrilous and dangerous form, if only to protect people from being murdered in sadistic sexual cases where the stimulation seems to come from such sources.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08012289000069"></a>I greatly welcome the protection that is specifically spelt out for NHS personnel and NHS premises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08012289000070"></a>There will no longer be the threat that highly dangerous criminals might, theoretically, have to be released at a much earlier date than anticipated in the light of the totality of their sentence. This was brought to light in the Cardiff case about a year ago when the Home Secretary of the day, to his great discredit, attacked  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_185"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the learned judge who was simply carrying out the letter of the law and could not have passed any other sentence. In that connection, I make a plea for judges to be trusted and not to be shackled. Four hundred years ago, Lord Bacon said that if justice had a voice it would be that of an English judge. Provided the English judge is not confined to Anglo-Saxons, I believe that that principle still holds good in our day and age.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08012289000071"></a>On Clause 42 and the self-defence provision, that is intended to be declaratory of the current law, and nothing else. Some suggestion has been made in the debate that it extends the law to some extent, but I doubt whether that is the case. In 1984, in the case of Gladstone Williams, the Court of Appeal made it perfectly clear that an honest belief, albeit an unreasonable belief, held by the defendant was good enough. That was repeated in a number of other cases over the next two or three years, particularly in the case of Beckford, a Privy Council case, in 1988.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08012289000072"></a>I would quarrel with the wording of the provision because it relates to the defence of self-defence. Self-defence is not a defence; it is a matter that the prosecution has to expunge beyond reasonable doubt. I hope that it will be reworded to remove that mythology.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08012289000073"></a>I end on a theme to which I have returned on many occasions over the past few months&#151;the question of the prison population. I have no doubt but that the Government have striven manfully to increase the number of prison places; I have no doubt that the Carter report, in advising&#151;and that advice has been accepted by the Government&#151;that there should be 6,500 extra places by 2012 is sound, with a further 5,000 to come onstream. We now have 81,000 prisoners in our prisons, which are bursting at the seams. We are imprisoning more people and, as my noble friend Lady Stern pointed out, more children than any other country in western Europe. We will never be able to build ourselves out of this problem. There is only one way we can tackle the problem, and that is by sending fewer persons to prison. You may say that is impossible. It is not. Our citizens are no more wicked, no more predilected to crime than the citizens of Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Greece and the other European countries. We have to inculcate, in one way or another, a different culture with regard to sentencing.</p>

The first is that more than 20 years ago I was proud to be the parliamentary consultant to the Prison Officers&#146; Association. The second is that I had the great honour last year to be made a life member of that organisation, to add to a life membership of my own trade union, the National Association of Co-operative Officials. The third is to reveal that one of my proud possessions is a slate from the roof of Strangeways prison, Manchester, inscribed with the words, &#147;To Lord Graham of Edmonton, a true friend of the POA&#148;. I am very proud of that; it signifies the work I have done for the association.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08012289000076"></a>The House will appreciate that, having declared those three interests in this matter, I have what is called &#147;form&#148;. I do not resile from revealing that to the House. Society rightly incarcerates those found guilty of crimes, some of a heinous nature, to spend time locked up away from the outside world. Many of them, men and women, seek to serve their time without aggravation or violence. Sadly, there are others who continue behind bars their lifestyle of violent behaviour. Who faces them 24 hours a day, dealing with their hatred, their violence and their terror? With respect, it is not the judges, the juries, the police, the public, the media or the man in the street; it is the dedicated men and women who serve within our prisons&#151;and who also serve a sentence themselves because they are locked inside as well.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08012289000077"></a>Prison officers deserve our gratitude for facing as humanely as possible those whom society puts behind bars. They are entitled to our support and do not deserve to be denied justice and equity, especially by a Labour Government. I appreciate what the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said on that point. The crux of my argument today lies in the issues that on 9 January in another place formed what was then called new Clause 36 but now forms Clauses 189 and 190. Clause 189(1) says:</p>
<ul><a name="08012289000117"></a>&#147;&#145;industrial action&#146; includes the withholding of services as a prison officer and any other action likely to affect the normal working of a prison&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80122-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08012289000078"></a>The words &#147;the normal working of a prison&#148; are the kernel of the dispute. They have caused deep resentment, anger and dismay. This is in the aftermath of Section 127 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act. The POA believed that statements made by the then leader of the Labour Party, Tony Blair, met its aspirations when he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08012289000109"></a>&#147;'An incoming Labour Government will want to put this situation right and ensure once again that prison officers are treated in the same way and with the same working rights as other public servants and recognise the status of the Prison Officers&#146; Association as an independent trade union&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012289000103"></a>There is great significance in the words that have been used. I was delighted and grateful when I read <I>Hansard</I> of another place to see that the Minister for Justice recognised that&#151;and I was just as grateful for the words the Minister sitting in front of me used when raising this issue&#151;when he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="08012289000110"></a>&#147;In the hope of being helpful, while I cannot give an undertaking now as to the terms I am certainly ready to sit down and consider ways in which that provision can be tightened, with a view to bringing forward amendments in the other place&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012289000104"></a>That is where we are today; we are in the other place. I do not want to spoil the situation, but I am very hopeful.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08012289000079"></a>To what was the Minister for Justice referring when he made that statement, and what is the possible way out of the impasse? The Minister here today can be in no doubt that there is deep disquiet bordering on anger at the treatment the POA believes it has received in recent times. Consultation and agreement on the precise words, matched by an agreed alternative, can lift the atmosphere of suspicion of deception. That atmosphere can be dispelled by using words with new meanings. The Minister knows, as do I, that this is an ongoing situation and it is not too late.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_187"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08012289000080"></a>The Minister for Justice said, in replying to the honourable Member for Morecambe:</p>
<ul><a name="08012289000118"></a>&#147;prison officers ... are dedicated staff ... they are not losing the right to strike&#151;the POA voluntarily signed up to legally binding undertakings not to take industrial action; it accepted the case that I am now making. It did not have to sign up to it; it did sign up to it&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 9/1/08; col. 332.]</ul>
<p><a name="08012289000105"></a>So the question is: why did the POA sign up to it? Because it thought it had a deal, a quid pro quo, whereby it inherited better, more equitable pay negotiation procedures. What has happened since? The Minister for Justice justifies breaking his agreement on pay by saying that there were &#147;exceptional economic circumstances&#148;. Thus the arbitrary power to scupper an agreement is seen by the POA as a reneging on that agreement.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08012289000081"></a>The situation does not affect only the POA but has seeped into all public sector trade unions. In a letter dated 14 January, Brendan Barber, the general secretary of the TUC, tells me that the TUC expresses,</p>
<ul><a name="08012289000119"></a>&#147;strong support for full trade union rights for POA members&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012289000106"></a>The most significant paragraph in his letter reads as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="08012289000111"></a>&#147;Neither the POA nor the TUC view the prospect of industrial action in this essential service lightly, and the POA is fully prepared to commit to binding arbitration processes to resolve disputes without the need for industrial action. In turn, however, the Government and the Prison Service need to commit to return full trade union rights to the POA as held by other public sector unions rather than thinking that an arbitrary legal restriction on trade union rights is the solution to industrial relations tensions in this vital service&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80122-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08012289000082"></a>A new beginning is badly needed. That may come through the report by Ed Sweeney of ACAS, which proposes, as in similar public sector services, the establishment of minimum cover arrangements instead of a statutory ban. Those proposals ought to be discussed at meetings on 24 January. They should not be jeopardised or put at risk, and no words of mine seek to exacerbate the situation. The offending words to which I have referred could, and should, be substantially changed. I urge the Minister to draw back from making industrial relations in the Prison Service worse than they are. In my view, the ball is in the Government&#146;s court.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08012289000085"></a>The Bill has been variously described as a hotchpotch and a ragbag. This makes it difficult to know exactly how to react. Again praying in aid the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, I say that a degree of miscellaneous provisioning is necessary in criminal justice legislation as the system is progressively fine-tuned to meet changing circumstances. There is obviously, therefore, good as well as bad in the Bill. As well as being a ragbag and a hotchpotch, it is also a curate&#146;s egg. There is good especially where the Government are putting right failures of legislation that have gone before.</p>

<a name="80122-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08012289000086"></a>On the other hand, one must doubt whether such a ferment of legislation is the best way to develop a rational criminal justice system. One might even say that the Government&#146;s approach to criminal justice legislation has suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. One may especially beg leave to doubt whether all the late changes, and some of the early ones, are so important and urgent as to require such a precipitate legislative process. Some of them could have waited and would certainly benefit from greater discussion. Of one thing, however, we can be sure: in my short time in this House, and on most of the occasions when I have attended a Second Reading debate, the Minister&#146;s stock response has been: &#147;Well, it&#146;s pleasing to see that the Bill has been so widely welcomed on all sides of the House&#148;. I defy the Minister to make that response today.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08012289000087"></a>However, I shall concentrate the bulk of my remarks on the sentencing provisions in Part 2. It is no secret that the prison system is in crisis. Much of the crisis is of the Government&#146;s own making. According to research by the Prime Minister&#146;s strategy unit, there has been a 22 per cent increase in the prison population since 1997. This is estimated to have had the effect of reducing crime by around 5 per cent&#151;I am not sure how one estimates that, but that is the estimate&#151;but it is at a time when overall crime has fallen by 30 per cent due to other measures and trends. Notwithstanding that, the number of people found guilty by the courts has remained broadly constant: 1,645,000 in 1995 and 1,783,000 in 2005. The number of people given a custodial sentence by magistrates&#146; courts has risen from 25,000 in 1993 to 57,250 in 2005: it has more than doubled. I repeat that that is at a time when crime is falling overall. The number of people given a custodial sentence at Crown courts has also risen, from 33,722 in 1993 to 43,986 in 2005. In particular, the introduction of a raft of mandatory penalties and, under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, of a new, indeterminate sentence for public protection has led to substantial inflation in sentencing.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08012289000088"></a>Against this background, the overall thrust of the sentencing provisions of the Bill has to be welcomed. I am not one to accuse Ministers of U-turns when I see them trying to put right mistakes of their own making. The Bill&#146;s intention is to reduce the prison population by a modest but useful 4,300&#151;that is about 5 per cent of the present total&#151;mainly through Clause 10 and  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_189"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Clauses 13 to 18. Clause 10, which abolishes suspended sentences for summary offences, is a step in the right direction. If it presaged an intention on the part of the Government to move towards a general presumption against imposing custodial sentences for summary offences, or even the abolition of custody all together, it would be even more welcome. As many speakers have said, prisons have become too much a dumping ground for the socially excluded. Much of the pressure on prison places could be eased if the Government&#146;s stated commitment to reserve prisons for serious and violent offenders could move from the realms of general aspiration to that of determination.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08012289000089"></a>The restriction on imposing community sentences in Clause 11 is a sensible measure, which appears to provide for greater use of financial penalties. The introduction of a system of income-related fines was recommended by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, in <I>Managing Offenders, Reducing Crime</I> in 2003. Day fines operate successfully in much of Europe and can, alongside diversion schemes, help to avoid unnecessary use of community sentences and imprisonment. However, one of the most misconceived innovations of recent years has been the sentence of indeterminate public protection, or IPP, which has been one of the main drivers of the increase in the prison population.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08012289000090"></a>I am indebted to the Prison Reform Trust, whose report on the pathology of IPPs has exposed how fundamentally flawed the IPP system is. IPPs have been heavily criticised also by, among others, the Lord Chief Justice, the chairman of the Parole Board and the Chief Inspector of Prisons. IPPs were aimed at offenders convicted of a serious violent or sexual crime and whom the judge believes pose a threat to the public. In practice, however, IPPs have not been used as was intended: as a specialised tool to deal with the relatively small number of dangerous violent or sexual offenders. Instead, they have been used more widely and for less serious crimes. As a result, they have bombed on two counts: they have fuelled an increase in the prison population and they have done nothing to reduce levels of violent and dangerous crime. Currently, there are three times more IPP prisoners than the Minister predicted during the 2003 Act&#146;s passage. By 2012, that number is expected to triple again.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08012289000091"></a>The USA has doubled its prison population during 15 years through risk-based sentencing that has the same logic as the IPP, yet it still has frightening levels of violent crime. It is a shame that the Government have not taken a little longer to reflect on the experience of the USA in that regard. If they are serious about refining IPPs, and not flooding the prison system or planting a time bomb for the Probation Service, they might start by refining the list of crimes that qualify for an IPP.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08012289000092"></a>Clauses 13 to 18 are thus part of the Government&#146;s leisurely repentance for a hasty and ill-considered measure. Raising the minimum tariff to two years is only common sense. Allowing the judge wider discretion in assessing dangerousness should also be seen as a welcome result of mature reflection.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08012289000093"></a>I was a criminologist for a number of years, but that was some time ago, so I am still becoming reacquainted with this area of policy. It has been clear  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_190"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 190</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to me from listening to the contributions of other noble Lords that I still have a great deal to learn before I am capable of rivalling their level of analysis. However, it would greatly assist me and, I hope, the House if the Minister answered a couple of questions.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08012289000094"></a>In a Written Answer on 27 November, the Government estimated that there were 428 IPP prisoners being held beyond the expiration of their tariff. Can the Minister tell us whether the situation has improved? &#147;Exceeding their tariff&#148; is a neat euphemism, evoking images of a Parisian caf&#233; overcharging gullible tourists. In at least some cases, however, it signifies people imprisoned with no real hope of release, thanks to the unavailability of the rehabilitation courses that they need to attend to satisfy the parole board that they can be safely released. Will the Government provide figures on how many of the prisoners who have committed suicide since the introduction of IPPs were serving such sentences? This is far too important an issue to be lost behind the cost limits of parliamentary questions, as has previously been the case.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08012289000095"></a>Public protection is a worthy goal in criminal justice, but sooner or later prisoners are freed. On current rates, two-thirds of them will have committed another crime within a couple of years. Jailing people for public protection without rehabilitation is a cruel deception. I am still not sure whether these sentencing reforms stem from that understanding or necessity.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08012289000096"></a>Before I conclude, I want to say a word or two on the provisions in the Bill relating to unqualified legal representatives. Academic lawyers&#151;and I know because I was once one&#151;sometimes envy the earnings of their peers in legal practice, but never so much as the Government seem to. Lawyers argue that quality legal representation is one guarantee of justice. It will be said, &#147;They would say that, wouldn&#146;t they?&#148;. But I share the concerns of other noble Lords about the proposals to extend the powers of non-legal staff to represent accused persons in court and hope that they will receive close scrutiny in Committee. Quality legal representation entails the expertise and advocacy skills that attend qualification for legal practice. I recognise that there are routine cases that can be handled other than by qualified barristers or solicitors, but I am not sure that the Government have adopted a sufficiently focused and targeted approach in Clause 105, which would allow non-legal staff to conduct a variety of very serious proceedings.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08012289000097"></a>The Minister might like to offer his reflections on research carried out in 2003 by the Crown Prosecution Service which showed that two-fifths of such staff had undertaken work beyond their existing remit. On this point, the reference to Section 3(2)(g) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 is entirely opaque, and the Explanatory Notes are vague. Will the Minister write to me with a full list of the powers already assigned and the powers potentially assignable under the provision?</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08012289000098"></a>Another aspect of quality seems to me even more vital than knowledge and skills&#151;independence. Barristers and solicitors receive ethical training before they qualify, as well as years of training in the law and its practice. They are regulated to strict professional standards, owe allegiance to the court itself and depend on no one but themselves for career progression. These are

I do not think that any of them apply to non-legal staff. Failures of justice are not, to my mind, acceptable collateral damage from efficiency savings in the court system, and I look forward to returning to this in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08012295000002"></a>I have several concerns about this Bill, and at this late stage do not propose to go into them in any detail. I very much oppose Clause 42, which is obviously wrong, for reasons that have been so well set out by others. I also have great concern about Clause 105, which has already been so well expressed by my noble friend Lord Low of Dalston. The effect of the Legal Services Act is to set out clearly the disciplinary processes for barristers and solicitors who fall below acceptable professional standards. No such process exists for those who are not trained lawyers, including non-qualified Crown Prosecution staff. They do not owe the same overriding duty to the court that all professional lawyers owe. This is a matter of very considerable concern, as there is a danger of potential miscarriage of justice&#151;and I shall say a lot more about it in Committee. Perhaps I should add that the presence of the clause appears to owe a great deal more to the benefit of cost-cutting than to any advantage whatever to the administration of justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08012295000003"></a>I should like to speak today on children, and children who offend. I commend the Government on their drive towards prevention and early intervention for children as well as the good work of youth offending teams, but I feel that a lot more should be done. I preface my comments by a recognition that some children, even young ones, commit serious crimes, which under our system cannot be overlooked. They face the rigour of the law and have to do so in exactly the same way as the young men who kicked a man to death and were convicted of murder. But children who offend were not born bad; they may be born with character defects and they may have developed behavioural problems, but inadequate parenting, the family and social environment, as well as their character defects, have a part to play&#151;often a very large part&#151;in their offending.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08012295000004"></a>As the House knows all too well, there is a great deal of research on this subject, which makes clear the impact on children of problems in the home such as drink, drugs, domestic violence and mental health problems&#151;as well as households where there are many other offenders. Early intervention and diversion from offending or reoffending should play an important part in the approach towards children. We must remember, as other noble Lords said earlier, that children who offend are also children who need help. I very much support the proposal of my noble friend Lady Stern on Clause 9 to give priority to the welfare of the child, especially to younger children. I was also greatly impressed by and very much support the contribution of the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, to this debate.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08012295000005"></a>More could and should be done at an early stage to identify the problems in the family, rather than necessarily treating all children as offenders. YOTs deal with children after they have been to the youth court. I propose to put down some amendments, and I hope that the House will bear with me as I explain their background. I have proposals for the diversion of young offenders, starting with 10 to 12 year-olds, so that they do not go to the youth court at all and therefore do not have a criminal finding of guilt but are dealt with in the family court system and not the criminal court system. I suggest that 10 to 12 year-olds who offend and whom the police or the Crown Prosecution consider should be dealt with by the youth court should be looked at by a local committee, chaired by either a judge or magistrate with representatives from police, CPS, probation, social services, education and health, to see whether the offence is so serious that it has to go to the youth court. It may well be known that the family is dysfunctional or the committee may consider that there should be an investigation to see whether there are reasons for offending that might be dealt with so as to avoid repetition of offending and without the child receiving a finding of guilt. That would give social workers an added burden, but it could have the effect of stopping or at least alleviating the cause of offending and, if so, would save years of repeated visits to the criminal courts, with the huge cost per person of an adult in the criminal courts.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08012295000006"></a>If the circumstances point to family or other influences pushing the child into committing crimes, the family proceedings court may be where the child and family should be considered rather than the youth court. The local committee might decide that informal intervention by social workers might do the trick or that the local authority should issue care proceedings to give the family proceedings court the power to deal with the case&#151;it does not have that power at the moment. Social workers would then have to be prepared on such a recommendation to issue care proceedings. The youth offending team could be involved before the child is found guilty rather than afterwards.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08012295000007"></a>An alternative&#151;or, indeed, concurrent&#151;possibility is that, on the child's arrival at the youth court, the magistrate should have the power, which is sometimes called the Section 37 power of the family proceedings court, to require a social report on the child before the child pleads guilty, to see if this is a case for social work intervention rather than a decision of the criminal court. That would no doubt require the family to agree, but if the alternative is for the child to be found guilty, the family may well agree. The youth court, on receipt of the social work report, could then decide whether to deal with the child within the criminal proceedings or adjourn or dismiss the criminal proceedings and transfer the child's case to the family proceedings court. Again, that would require primary legislation. It would also require the local authority to be prepared in some cases to make the appropriate application in the family proceedings court, which some local authorities, on past experience, have not been at all keen to do.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08012295000008"></a>There would be an added burden on social services and local authorities or possibly the youth offending team, but if it diverted the child from reoffending, it

My proposals might fit well with those that I know are being considered for restorative justice for children. Together, the proposals might go forward. I would therefore like to add my proposals to Part 1 of the Bill.</p>

<a name="08012295000009"></a><b><a name="80122-0011.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08012295000037"></a>Baroness Falkner of Margravine:</b> My Lords, the origins of the Bill seem to lie more in a desire to respond to newspaper headlines than a considered analysis of what needs to be done and then to change the law carefully and proportionately to reflect the changes that are needed. The broad sweep of the Bill, comprising piecemeal measures on youth justice and rehabilitation, sentencing, the establishment of new bodies&#151;now to be withdrawn, we are told&#151;changes to compensation, new powers and penal policy indicate that a huge area of the civil and criminal justice systems were frozen in a time warp, have now entered the 21st century and hence need urgently updating. But as my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford has already stated, that is not the case. We have had numerous such Bills over the lifetime of this Government. This can mean two things: that our criminal justice system overall is so inadequate as to require constant readjustment, or that previous legislation in many these areas was not thought through properly. Most people would conclude the latter.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08012295000010"></a>I now turn my attention to the principle that will guide our approach to the Bill from these Benches. There is a concern that when the state interacts with its citizens and uses its powers of sanction against them, it is duty bound to do so proportionately and with regard to an end which, in the majority of cases, is rehabilitation. This will entail the Government putting forward arguments based on evidence&#151;something not readily visible in the provisions we find here today, as my noble friend Lady Miller stressed.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08012295000011"></a>If we take the area of youth justice, the need for those principles becomes even more evident. Where children and young people have broken the law, it is a combination of other factors, including inadequate parenting, poor life skills and familial and social causes that have led this person down the route that they have taken. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, reminded us of the stark statistics of deprivation and the speeches of several other noble Lords will indicate to the Minister how contested this area will be.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08012295000012"></a>In dealing with measures on youth offending, the current approach is to have a range of measures of differing requirements. While the replacement of the previous orders with youth rehabilitation orders may be more straightforward, the prescriptive nature of several of the measures envisaged in Part 2 give cause for concern. We will explore the rationale behind legislating in statute for certain areas, rather than allowing for the greater discretion to be built into the system, bearing in mind the circumstances of each individual case.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="08012295000013"></a>Moreover, at this stage, we are not convinced that the Bill incorporates adequate safeguards for children and young people to be treated as far as possible outside the custodial sentencing regime. As the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights points out,  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_194"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 194</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not only is proportionality to be sought, but the child&#146;s age and emotional maturity is relevant to the use of custody, which the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, has already mentioned. There is a risk that young people will fall into the trap of entering into custody, not only, as the JCHR states, because of the seriousness of their offence, but because of their failure to comply with the terms of their community sentences. We hope that the Government will take the considered views of the JCHR on board and come forth with revised proposals.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08012295000014"></a>We will also seek to explore the rationale behind elements of Part 6 of the Bill, which seeks to extend the adult conditional caution scheme to young people aged 16 and 17. It seems that the constructive engagement intended for young people, in order not to criminalise them, which should be the basis of cautions has, through the addition of &#147;conditional&#148; turned into a sentence. We intend to explore whether the options available to young people through this measure will be proportionate, workable and suitable for that age group. Before I leave this area, I must say to the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, that we look forward to hearing more about her amendments&#151;they sound intriguing&#151;and seeing whether we can work with her on them.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08012295000015"></a>Many noble Lords have expressed concerns about violent offender orders. My noble friend Lord Thomas foreshadowed our broad concerns with these orders, not least their extremely broad reach. As Liberty points out:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="08012295000032"></a>&#147;At the heart of these is the extraordinary scope available for the imposition of restrictions on individual freedom&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012295000031"></a>Restrictions for the type of offender envisaged here already exist within the current system, not least through imprisonment for public protection measures, licences and parole measures. If the scope of these orders in practice is wide&#151;that is, overly generalised&#151;and the conditions are overly restrictive, they may well be in breach of Article 7 of the ECHR. We would be back in the territory of relegislating, as we have had to do with terrorism. The JCHR report points out that these orders are analogous to control orders and serious crime prevention orders. In this case, to satisfy the requirement of legal certainty, at minimum an indicative list of the types of prohibitions, conditions or restrictions that might be imposed should be published. We intend to press Ministers on that point in Committee.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08012295000016"></a>A further issue relating to violent offender orders is the danger of excessive use and the numbers that could be imprisoned. According to the Prison Reform Trust, when the proposal was announced, it was suggested that the orders would lead to an increase of 3,000 in the prison population. I understand that the Government contest this figure and expect smaller numbers of prison places being taken up. However, in the words of the Prison Reform Trust, ministerial estimates in past debates, such as on indeterminate sentences for public protection, made during the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, have been confounded by reality and serve to demonstrate the importance of properly debated and drafted legislation.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08012295000017"></a>I echo the disappointment of the noble Baronesses, Lady Howe and Lady Stern, that an opportunity to act on the report of the noble Baroness, Lady Corston,  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_195"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 195</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on women in prison was not taken in this Bill. It would have helped Ministers generate some positive focuses in this area in an otherwise rather uninspired and possibly deleterious piece of legislation.</p>

<a name="80122-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08012295000018"></a>Many noble Lords have spoken today on many aspects of the Bill that we will have an opportunity to review further. We have had a considerable number of briefings and many hundreds of pages of advocacy. In the weeks ahead we will no doubt hear elegant and erudite perspectives on issues of concern. My noble friends have identified several areas where we will probe, question and debate the purpose and workability of the laws envisaged. As ever, it is our intention to work constructively with all sides to improve what seems yet again to be hastily prepared and ill-thought-through legislation. We hope that by the end of this process we will have law which serves both the criminal justice system and society better than the current system.</p>

I think that he might have been slightly unfair to the profession of ironmongery. It seems to me, rather, that the Bill as it has arrived at your Lordships' House is a vast exercise in political displacement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08012295000020"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, argued that the fact that the Bill does not have a single theme should not be the basis for condemning it; and I agree with him. Many criminal justice Bills have miscellaneous provisions and inevitably have to cover a wide range of different offences. But I do not think that the core of the criticism of the Bill is its lack of a single theme; it is its failure to grapple with the central problems that the criminal justice system is facing.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80122-0012.htm"/>


<a name="80122-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08012295000021"></a>One very good example exhibited today is that of youth crime. The Government had only to listen to the noble Baronesses, Lady Howe, Lady Stern and Lady Linklater, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and many other of your Lordships who have, in no uncertain terms, underlined the deep shortcomings of the Government&#146;s approach to youth offenders and youth crime. The Bill contains many new dispositions for offences which carry imprisonment; and yet we know very well that there are no places for people to go to prison, let alone courses in those prisons to rehabilitate the prisoners who are sent there. Much of the Bill also makes disposition for community offences, but community offences are in a state of crisis. Not only is there under investment in them but there is also a deep lack of public confidence in community dispositions for a whole range of reasons which need facing up to in the immediate future. Our main criticism is the Bill&#146;s failure to confront the reality that our society has to confront today in this sector.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08012295000022"></a>My noble friend Lord Henley rightly pointed out to your Lordships that much of the Bill was unscrutinised in another place. The scale of this lack of scrutiny is staggering. I give just one example. At the Report stage of the Bill the following new clauses were introduced:  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_196"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 196</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>clauses on bail conditions, credit for a period of remand on bail, sentences of imprisonment and detention for public protection, extended sentences for certain violent or sexual offences, release on licence if prisoners are serving extended sentences; release of fine defaulters and contemners, early release of long-term prisoners, and electronic monitoring of persons released on bail. None of these extra provisions has been examined in another place. Effectively, the Government have required another place to subcontract all this work to your Lordships' House. I am sure the Minister can be in no doubt that the Committee stage on these matters will necessarily have to be very detailed and extensive because of that.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08012295000023"></a>Inevitably, I cannot look at every provision in this Bill, and so many of them have been so adequately dealt with by your Lordships that it is not necessary for me to do so. So, I will turn my attention to two or three issues, the first being youth rehabilitation orders. Under the Bill the court is given an immense menu of different requirements to impose on a young offender. It can impose an activity requirement, a supervision requirement, an unpaid work requirement, a programme requirement, an attendance centre requirement, a prohibited activity requirement, a curfew requirement, an exclusion requirement, a residence requirement, a local authority residence requirement, a fostering requirement, a mental health treatment requirement, a drug treatment requirement, a drug testing requirement and an education requirement. Are the Government confident that they have the resources to meet all these dispositions or, indeed, any of them? What analysis have the Government done on the availability of resources to underpin this very important new order? What kind of guidance will judges get on the hierarchy of these orders? Are they all of equal weight? Are some more important than others? Are some to be given in clusters or can they be given singly? What happens if there is a breach of an order? Is it one strike and you&#146;re out or is the child sent back to do the particular task again? Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us on this. There appears to be no lower age limit for these orders. For example, could a 10 year-old be subject to a youth rehabilitation order? The Minister may not be able to answer all these questions now but I should be most grateful if he would respond as best he can. The most important point that has been made about youth rehabilitation orders and all the youth provisions in the Bill is that the Government have not sought to put them in their social and welfare context. That is the message that the Minister should take away with him tonight.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="08012295000024"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and others spoke about Clause 42 and, I believe, Clause 104. It is not necessary for me to repeat the substance of the argument on Clause 42; it was extremely well argued by those who spoke. However, I want to emphasise a point behind it. I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, underlined the crucial point about what I summarise as due process&#151;that the Court of Appeal has a duty to ensure due process irrespective of the outcome of the trial. This duty rightly undermines the Government&#146;s amendment.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_197"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 197</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80122-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08012295000025"></a>In a way I suppose we should not be surprised to find the Government seeking to undermine due process because, if we look back at their history in relation to the conduct of criminal trials since 1997, we see that there have been many attempts to undermine due process. For example, there have been sustained attempts to remove jury trial, not just from fraud cases&#151;many of your Lordships will remember an earlier attempt to limit the number of defendants who had the right to opt for jury trial in the Crown Court. It was only because of the determination of your Lordships&#146; House that we saw that off&#151;and rightly, too. One of the most terrible depredations of the criminal trial process was the change in the rules on propensity in the 2003 Act&#151;changes that I hope will be reversed some day. Then, in another context, we saw the denial of the requirement to make a prima facie case by someone who faced extradition. Your Lordships may well remember the attempt to oust judicial review altogether in certain cases.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08012295000026"></a>Those examples would have been unthinkable before 1997 and I see Clause 42 in exactly the same context; it is yet another attempt to undermine due process. I am afraid that one of the difficulties we have to face is, curiously enough, the Human Rights Act, because this Bill has been certified as conforming to that Act. It is right that jurisprudence on the continent does not entertain the kind of criminal process that we have&#151;jury trial&#151;so there is no case law in the Human Rights Act. The Government have been quite cute in saying that all these provisions conform to the Human Rights Act. We badly need to fill that gap in our law and bring back the old common-law protections for the criminal process that the Government have sought to abandon, piece by piece.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08012295000027"></a>Many noble Lords spoke to Clause 104 on the appearance of non-lawyers in contested cases in magistrates&#146; courts. The clause is astonishing. We spent most of last year considering a Legal Services Bill that was intended to improve the supervision of lawyers appearing in criminal or civil cases&#151;whether they were barristers or solicitors. The strictest possible regulation is now imposed on a member of the profession. The next thing that the Government do is to say that it is perfectly all right for non-members of the profession to appear as lawyers; and, of course, they are not regulated. I regard that as rank hypocrisy by the Government and I do not understand what the origin of this can be, unless, as the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, said, it is economic.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08012295000028"></a>Is it actually economic? Is it economic to take people out of the CPS, who would normally be doing the kind of things that they do in the CPS, and let them take a lot of time off to appear in the magistrates&#146; court? We had this battle during the Access to Justice Bill in 1999. Until then members of the CPS were not allowed to appear as counsel in criminal trials. The Lord Chancellor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine, took the Bill through your Lordships&#146; House and the Government decided to give the CPS rights of appearance in the Crown Court. I was very surprised that the Bar Council did not oppose that, but the Opposition certainly opposed it&#151;and rightly, too&#151;because there is a basic conflict of interest between being employed by the

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08012295000029"></a>At the time, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine, assured the House that an independent barrister would be unavailable only in a very few cases. In fact, it has become almost regular practice in certain parts of the United Kingdom. I wonder, quite apart from the principle, whether that makes economic sense. I am sure that the CPS says that it does. Does it really make sense for these people who are employed in an organisation that prepares the background to the trial then to appear in the trial, day after day, week after week? We may well need to test this matter in Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08012295000030"></a>Many other matters will be before us in Committee. Two will be of particular interest&#151;blasphemy and homophobic hate. They are issues upon which the Opposition&#146;s view is that we will have a free vote. I listened carefully to what my noble friend Lord Waddington said in his outstanding speech. I will not trouble the Minister any further on other issues at this moment, but will allow him to wait and see the amendments emerge. I wish him luck and look forward to hearing him.</p>

I agree that it would be good to have a wider debate on the purpose of criminal justice legislation and particularly, as the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, said, on its impact on public confidence. None the less I would argue that the measures in this Bill are useful and help to deliver our objectives of protecting the public, reducing reoffending, promoting the rehabilitation of offenders and strengthening confidence in the criminal justice system. Whatever disappointment noble Lords have expressed about parts of the Bill, we share those overriding objectives. We should also acknowledge that crime has fallen by 32 per cent since 1997 and that the fear of crime is lower. We will always argue about statistics, but there is sufficient hard evidence to suggest that we are on the right lines. Whatever doubts there are about government policy, it is important to put them in perspective.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08012299000005"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Howe and Lady Stern, were disappointed that the Bill is not being used as a vehicle to put into practice the report of my noble friend Lady Corston. The timing is not right for that, but two valuable debates will come up in the next 10 days on women&#146;s justice issues and the report of my noble friend Lady Corston. The Government have largely accepted the recommendations of my noble friend&#146;s report. I say to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, while not repeating our debate of last week on the structure of murder offences, that I hope that he will accept that this is not shelving. We are attempting to look at the partial defences first and then to come back to the overall framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08012299000006"></a>Since I have been in this position, we have had a number of interesting debates on youth justice. I know that this subject is dear to the hearts of all noble Lords. We are all concerned about the rate of offending and reoffending. The position at least is stable, with rates of reoffending by young people having fallen by 3.8 per cent since 1997. Of course, that is no excuse for complacency. I understand the points raised by noble Lords about the use of custody for young people, and about the intent of the youth justice system in general. I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, that we are responsive to the concerns expressed about the use of physical restraint in under-18 establishments. We debated the statutory instrument and set up an independent joint review. That is currently taking evidence and is due to report to Ministers in April.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08012299000007"></a>On the wider question of youth justice, we accept the need to look at this in a comprehensive way&#151;to consider what more can be done to prevent children and young people coming into the criminal justice system, to make more effective use of the time that they spend in the system and to reduce reoffending. There is nothing between us on these matters and proposals on how to tackle this will be set out in a youth crime action plan, to be published in the summer. I listened with interest to the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and I am sure that whatever the fortunes of the many amendments that she is going to put down, they will certainly feed into this wider review and be very useful.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08012299000008"></a>On the question of youth rehabilitation orders, I will respond in detail to noble Lords in writing. The intention is that the requirements, which will apply to 10 to 18 year-olds, will be flexible enough for each youth rehabilitation order to be more onerous than the last and to address directly the offending behaviour. I agree with the right reverend Prelate about the need for proper tailoring. We expect youth offending teams to work with the courts to provide them with appropriate information that they can use to help them decide which requirements should be attached to the orders. I do not know whether that has convinced the right reverend Prelate but the intention is certainly to have a kind of hierarchy with the emphasis on preventing reoffending.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08012299000009"></a>I well understand that we shall have a debate on the threshold, although I point out to noble Lords that the courts already have to have regard to whether a custodial sentence is justified. We will also debate the purpose of juvenile sentencing. The Bill makes it clear that, when dealing with young offenders, the court must primarily have regard to the principal aim of the youth justice system, which is the prevention of offending by young people. It also makes it clear that the court must have regard to welfare needs. However, when a court is sentencing a young offender, welfare needs never have taken, and in our view should not take, priority over the prevention of offending. We shall come back to that matter and also to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08012299000010"></a>I turn to the subject of the Prison Service, about which we had a lot of very interesting comments. The allegation is that, through various legislative programmes, the Government are engaged in knee-jerk reactions to media attention on the problems that we have with the prison population. I have started to visit prisons again over the past few months and, although the Prison Service is under considerable pressure at the moment, I pay great tribute to the improvements that have taken place. I have seen an enormous improvement in healthcare in prisons. There is more to be done and that is why we have the review of mental health issues, but we have also seen much more effort being made in relation to educational and housing support for those leaving prison. There is much more to do but let us pay tribute to what has been achieved.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08012299000011"></a>I know that we will be discussing Titans, although they are not subject to legislative provision. I emphasise that the noble Lord, Lord Carter, proposed large campuses, which could benefit from investment in good design and management but could also have smaller units where the benefits of smaller-scale institutions could be brought to bear.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="08012299000012"></a>My noble friend Lord Graham and the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, raised concerns about the prison officer disputes and the reserve power that we wish to take. I pay tribute to prison officers, who have an incredibly difficult job. They do not often get a good press outside or, indeed, even in your Lordships&#146; House. The great majority of prison officers do a fantastic job but we face a very difficult situation in view of the action taken in August and the decision of the POA to withdraw from the current joint voluntary agreement. I say to my noble friend Lord Graham  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_201"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that we hope it will be possible, before Royal Assent, to agree a new dispute resolution and trade union recognition agreement with the POA, but we think that we need the reserve power. We do not believe that the kind of industrial action that took place could ever be justified in the prison context, not least because of the prisoners&#146; welfare considerations.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08012299000013"></a>A great deal of attention has been paid to indeterminate sentences for public protection, and we shall come back to that in Committee. I am the first to acknowledge that these have not been targeted well enough and that too many cases with short tariffs have caused problems with managing and rehabilitating offenders in the prison system. That has had a knock-on impact on the availability of programmes that IPP sentence prisoners have to undertake before the Parole Board can consider their eventual release. Clearly, we have to deal with that. We believe that the proposals in the Bill will enable us to ensure that these are focused on the most serious and dangerous offenders.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08012299000014"></a>I turn to the subject of extreme pornography. The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, and a number of other noble Lords expressed some concerns, which I well understand, about the definitions and how they might be applied. The reasons for bringing this matter before your Lordships&#146; House are well taken: some very disturbing cases, with disturbing impacts, have arisen from the availability of extreme pornography. Equally, I accept that we have to be very careful about the definition; we do not want it to be wider than we intend. I said in my opening speech that we will bring forward amendments&#151;in Committee, I hope&#151;to make that absolutely clear.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08012299000015"></a>We have had a very interesting, almost cameo, debate about prostitution. I certainly accept the comments of my noble friend Lord Faulkner and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, that we need to see this in the round, as part of a comprehensive approach. Noble Lords have rather made fun of my ministerial colleague&#146;s recent visit to Sweden, but it should be seen as a positive, fact-finding tour and a contribution to this wider debate. It feeds into a six-month review in tackling the demand for prostitution. My noble friend Lord Faulkner accepted that the intent of the clauses in the Bill is positive. It deals with the revolving-door problem of people being consistently caught by the police, brought before the courts and then reoffending. That is the aim of the clause; it aims to help people to address the causes of offending. The consensus I sensed from the comments of noble Lords is that we need to have programmes that are designed to help people get out of the position that they are in.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08012299000016"></a>I thank the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester for his comments on blasphemy. No doubt he will take on board the earnest request of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, to speed it up even more than the church is already doing. I pay tribute to the church for its work in this area. As for homophobic offences, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, that there is a distinction between the Public Order Act, which protects individuals from harm, and the clause, which deals with incitement to hatred of people as a group on the basis of their sexual orientation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08012299000017"></a>Police activity obviously comes down to their operational independence, but like most organisations I suspect that they must go through a learning process. The Crown Prosecution Service will always assess a case and bring a prosecution only if there is a reasonable prospect of conviction. Let me emphasise that this new law will not prevent free speech or debate; it will not prevent jokes or expressions of religious belief. We recognise the importance of safeguarding freedom of expression, conscience and religion. I give way.</p>

<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="08012299000018"></a><b><a name="80122-0012.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08012299000076"></a>Lord Stoddart of Swindon:</b> My Lords, in light of what the noble Lord has just said, will the Government be prepared to accept an amendment safeguarding free speech, as we have in racial and religious legislation?</p>

<p><a name="st_97"></a>
<a name="08012299000019"></a><b><a name="80122-0012.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08012299000077"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, the short answer is no. We do not consider it necessary, but I am happy for us to debate that after Second Reading. The noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, rather responded to my noble friend on self-defence. I re-state that we do not intend to extend the law. It is clear, despite the excellent work of the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Crown Prosecution Service in public education, that public concern and confusion remain. The existing law clearly works better than most people think; I readily acknowledge that, but it does not work as well as it could or should. The Bill&#146;s aim is to aid understanding.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08012299000020"></a>On the issue of quashing convictions, I undertake to write in detail to noble Lords on those matters. Perhaps I may do that in the light of the meeting that is to take place with the Bar Council in the next 24 hours or so. I can tell my noble friend Lady Kennedy that we have always acknowledged that the provisions in Clause 42 would impact on very few cases, but the fact that we think there will be only very few cases is no reason for not taking action. One of the cases in which some concern was expressed was Smith, when the defendant was convicted after submission of no case to answer had, in the court&#146;s opinion, been wrongly rejected by the trial judge. In that decision the court not only quashed the conviction but made it clear that it would have done so even if the defendant had gone on to plead guilty after his submission was rejected. I will follow this up with a more detailed explanation.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08012299000021"></a>Given the time, I shall now come on to caseworkers. Designated cases were first introduced in 1999. In the nine years since, the general view is that the system has worked well and a good reputation has been earned. I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that this is not justice on the cheap, nor does it undermine the role of magistrates&#146; courts. It is about the most effective use of resources. I make no defence about saying that, given the resources we have, we must use them more effectively.</p>

<a name="80122-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="08012299000022"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, raised two issues: first, the threshold of the case and, secondly, regulation. On the latter issue, the Crown Prosecution Service is holding discussions with the Institute of Legal Executives concerning membership for its designated caseworkers and accreditation for training programmes. I hope to report back at a later stage on the outcome of those discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="08012299000023"></a>I listened with interest to the comments on violent offender orders, as did my noble friends. We are satisfied that such orders are compatible with convention rights, but I understand that we shall have to reply to the committee&#146;s response. We had a very interesting discussion on special immigration status. The noble Lords, Lord Dholakia and Lord Avebury, asked some important questions to which I shall respond. I have to say that the Government do not think it right that people who have committed serious offences should be entitled to leave to remain, including access to key mainstream benefits and employment on the same basis as law-abiding migrants simply because they cannot be removed at present.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="08012299000024"></a>I think that noble Lords welcomed the Government&#146;s intent to move to withdraw clauses on the ombudsmen. I shall take that with me, as it was good to get some welcome. I reiterate that the Government are committed to getting that on the statute book and no doubt bringing back the kind of criminal justice Bill that noble Lords wish to see in the future. In the mean time, we shall work very hard to see what consensus can be achieved. This has been an educative and highly informed debate. I look forward to Committee and to debating these matters in great detail.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08012299000027"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in the early 1990s the positive possibilities of the Madrid conference of 1991 and the Oslo process kindled some hope for progress, including in Northern Ireland where I remember many people saying to me that if they could do it in the Middle East and in South Africa, which was also on the road to peace at that time, then surely we could do something in Northern Ireland. While South Africa and Northern Ireland have indeed moved ahead since that time, the first Gulf War increased US involvement in the Middle East. Antipathy was stimulated to that involvement, not only in the regimes in Iran, Iraq and Syria, but also on the Arab street. The US war on terror, its response to the 9/11 attacks, further polarised opinion and strengthened anti-western sentiment. The Iraq war, which from 2003 brought Sunni governance in Iraq to an end, strengthened Iran and added a further dimension of Sunni-Shia tension.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="08012299000028"></a>A resurgent Russia and an emergent China&#151;driven by strategic political and economic ambitions now, rather than by ideology&#151;are also fashioning their involvement in the region. This creates an increasing complexity and instability in the region. The models which are generally used to guide our policy in such issues seem to be based on resource and commodity questions&#151;oil and water in particular in that region&#151;our relations with the United States and, in the case of the Middle East, the historic line of peace plans from Madrid to Annapolis.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_204"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 204</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80122-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="08012299000029"></a>These are important issues and some progress has been made in various areas. We can now speak about negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians towards a two-state solution without being laughed out of court, as would have been the case especially before Oslo. However, in overall terms the situation is grave and deteriorating. My own experience in the past two or three years of visiting many of the countries in that great arc from Indonesia to Morocco&#151;where the majority of the population are Muslim&#151;is that the antipathy towards the West has grown enormously in the past seven or eight years. The unresolved difficulties between Israelis and Palestinians have come to have a symbolic significance, especially in the minds of ordinary people. This is even the case in those countries whose leaders are tolerably well disposed to the West, but are increasingly fearful of the mood of their people. As an Egyptian Cabinet Minister in Cairo said to me some months ago, &#147;The people walk on one side of the street and the Government walk on the other side&#148;.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="08012299000030"></a>In the 10 years or so since the Good Friday agreement, I have given a good deal of thought to the experiences of other processes which we drew upon in Northern Ireland, as well as the question of what of our experience was relevant and what was not transferable to other places and people. Especially since 2003 and my later time as Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, I visited and studied experiences in various parts of Europe, especially the Balkans, but also various countries in Latin America, Africa, South-East Asia and the wider Middle East.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="08012299000031"></a>I have spoken from time to time about a number of conclusions about long-standing violent political conflicts and how to address them. While resource questions such as water, minerals and energy sources are important, it is how they lead people to deal unfairly with other people that is the cause of the conflict, rather than availability or scarcity. While poverty and deprivation lead to unhappiness, it is the relative injustice of their distribution which leads to conflict. Though, politically, disagreement may lead to division, it is a sense of humiliation and disrespect that predisposes to violence and terrorism. These general conclusions imply that it is the way we deal with disturbed relations rather than the particular solutions we propose which is crucial for a positive outcome. This is a different way of addressing such problems.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08012299000032"></a>Take the case of post-World War 2 Europe, which initially took coal and steel, and later economic co-operation and trade in general, as the instruments through which historic enemies could find common ground. The key issue was not to come up with a clever plan for what to do with particular resources or the Common Market&#151;indeed the plans changed constantly&#151;but to create, as was the case, a set of institutions through which new ways of relating with each other were developed, and, in particular, ways of disagreeing without going to war.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="08012299000033"></a>That required everyone to be at the table&#151;not just big and powerful countries, and not just the Governments and governing parties either. It was especially important that traditional enemies, as well as historic allies, engaged with each other. Of course, we think particularly of France and Germany, but not them alone in the EU  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_205"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>context. Such processes involved a great deal of time. They are not the result of some weekend retreat or peace conference. The survival of any agreements that they reach is dependent on continued, long-term involvement together, and the independent monitoring of agreements reached&#151;in the case of the EU, through the Commission and the court.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="08012299000034"></a>The arms control processes and NCSCE are further large-scale examples of inclusive, semi-permanent institutions that brought traditional enemies together over long periods and which have demonstrated a degree of success. In many ways, the much more localised but relatively successful processes in South Africa and Northern Ireland have also demonstrated those characteristics of inclusivity and sustained involvement, until and beyond agreement, both by those directly involved and by interested parties from outside&#151;the maintenance of the process being extremely important.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="08012299000035"></a>One key region where I have spent a good deal of time during the past three or four years is the Middle East, where I have been struck by a profound fear of the slide into chaos&#151;a capacity for and an openness to thoughtful engagement on all sides. The kind of things that have repeatedly been said to me by leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah are so reminiscent of my conversations with Gerry Adams and his colleagues in the early days of the peace process. The anxieties of the unionist leaders and people, with which I have been very familiar for many years, are strikingly mirrored by the profound and realistic fears of many people who may have met in Israel.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="08012299000036"></a>I do not believe that any such situation, including the Israel-Palestinian problem, can be solved by splitting people into good guys and bad guys, however persuasive and tempting such a view may be. The problems are problems of disturbed and damaged relationships. They can be resolved only by giving people on all sides a sense of confidence that their concerns are appreciated and will be addressed, and by finding a way to create a process in which all of the players can engage.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08012299000037"></a>I am very much aware that even the word &#147;process&#148; is a bad word in the Middle East, because of the profound disappointment at the failure of the Oslo process. Perhaps we must find another word, but the fact is that that way of working over a period is critical. It is a long-term proposition, I know, but even starting on the road can begin to change the climate of opinion, because people who are given a chance to state their case sense that they, and those whom they represent, are being treated with at least a modicum of respect. That can in itself be transformative.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="08012299000038"></a>That is not the situation in the Middle East. The current process is not inclusive. It appears to hiccup along with an increasing sense of despair on all sides. The post-Annapolis process, for example, like what went before, is overseen by a quartet that represents only external powers&#151;nobody who lives in the region. A first step in inclusivity could involve expanding that instrument to include the Arab League. When I raised that with Secretary-General Amr Moussa, he said, &#147;Of course I would welcome that. At the moment, they do not even pay attention to our concerns at the United Nations, where we are represented&#148;.</p>

The Syrian Government have made very clear on a number of occasions their preparedness to engage. Our response should be to engage with them, not with the diplomacy of finger-wagging and threats, as has, sadly, being the case before now. The same is true of that most complex society in Iran, where there are senior figures who do not at all hold to the wilder public remarks of the president, but to find little possibility of engagement while the country as a whole is treated as a pariah and an enemy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="08012299000040"></a>In a recent private meeting in Finland, at which Jeffrey Donaldson, Martin McGuinness and I, along with some others from Northern Ireland, as well as &#147;Mac&#148; Maharaj and Roelf Meyer from South Africa, met with a couple of dozen Sunni and Shia parliamentarians and senior leaders. Martin McGuinness made a very interesting comment, which was that he and his colleagues had come after a number of years to the conclusion that, they eventually had to engage with those with whom they disagreed. They could postpone it for five, ten or more years, but, in the end, it was a political problem that would have to be addressed politically. He challenged the Iraqis there that they could do the same: delay for five, 10 or more years and, in the end, come to the table, or, move more quickly and with the help of others from outside.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="08012299000066"></a>I have been gratified that my proposals, over the past few years, for an inclusive, semi-permanent conference, have been taken up by a number of research bodies. The Oxford Research Group in this country, the Strategic Foresight Group in India and the Friedrich Naumann Foundation in Germany, have all developed this theme, although in some cases, such as that of the Oxford Research Group, they have taken lines that significantly differ from what I have proposed. I have emphasised the importance of governmental and political involvement, while others have focused on NGOs and experts.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08012299000067"></a>I raise this with Her Majesty&#146;s Government because we are at an important juncture. On the down side, there are vulnerable leaders in Israel and the Palestinian Authority and the US presidency is coming to a close. However, for the first time, for some time, we have a US presidential election in which neither the vice-president nor vice-presidential incumbent are candidates. There will be a new administration at the end of this year and the beginning of the next. This gives a key opportunity for Her Majesty&#146;s Government to be imaginative, to build on our experience in Europe, Northern Ireland and elsewhere and to project a view&#151;a strategy or an approach&#151;to this important region in the Middle East that is positive and creative in developing western policy, rather than simply espousing and following others. I trust that it is possible for the Minister to give us a positive indication of this kind.</p>

The first was the importance of the issue. The second was that I knew that he, with all his experience, would, even in the short time available,

He has certainly set the tone. I am sure he would, however, join me for a moment in wanting to put on record, at a difficult time, appreciation and really a tribute to my noble friends in government for the determined lead that they have been giving on trying to find a solution. That applies to the Foreign Office, but also very much to DfID. In this context, the &#163;243 million pledged at the Paris conference, the unqualified calls for the restoration of Gaza fuel supplies and the condemnation of the counterproductivity of unacceptable and internationally illegal collective punishment are welcome.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08012299000042"></a>I have spent a lifetime, outside this House, working in organisations very much caught up in this sort of situation. One of the things that I have learnt is that building peace is very different from imposing or fixing peace. There are no shortcuts. Widespread ownership is essential to the process and that has to be inclusive. Of course, outsiders can play a part as facilitators, but the moment that they begin to cross the line and start wanting to arrange it all and set the agenda, there are difficulties ahead.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08012299000043"></a>At the time of the first Camp David initiative under President Carter, I was Minister of State at the Foreign Office. When I reflect on that period, I realise that the flaw in his highly committed, dedicated approach was that it was not inclusive enough. I remember saying to some officials in the Foreign Office, &#147;The trouble is, at the bottom of the pile, there are still very significant Palestinian elements who are not being included. They don&#146;t feel any sense of ownership of what is happening&#148;. One has to give priority to trying to cast ownership and inclusion as widely as one can, and the real challenge is to bring in the most difficult, not the easy ones with whom it is possible to talk. As an observer of Northern Ireland from across the water, what I thought took tremendous courage&#151;no one should underestimate what it took in that situation&#151;was the willingness to start talking to the political representatives of the IRA.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="08012299000044"></a>I think that the same is true of Hamas. I know that it will be difficult for my noble friend to agree to that, but I hope he takes the point. Hamas is not an absolutely frozen institution in which everyone is the same. There have been differences and there is pluralism in the organisation, although misguidedly the external pressures have done their best to eliminate that pluralism and drive control of Hamas into the hands of the extremists. Although it will take extraordinary imagination and courage by Israel, there needs to be a willingness to realise that securing the guarantees for Israel&#146;s existence&#151;to which I take second place to nobody&#151;may have to be something that comes out of the process rather than laying it down in tablets of stone as an unnegotiated precondition of any conversations or talks about how that objective can be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="08012299000045"></a>More widely in the region it means involving Syria and, yes, trying to involve Iran. I say that because, if I have learnt anything about conflict resolution, it is that one must avoid demonisation at all costs, and there have been some crassly insensitive and stupid things said about Iran. They demonstrate the total  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_208"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>lack of a sense of history on the part of some of those who should know better. Iran is an extraordinarily significant regional power, at the moment feeling increasingly excluded. It will be a terrific challenge to bring Iran back into the fold, but if we really want stability in the region, what is the alternative? Incidentally, it has to be said that, in the polarisation, Iran is not the only potential nuclear threat in the region. Everyone knows that and to pretend to speak as though Iran is the only one does not help.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="08012299000046"></a>At this juncture I pay tribute to the courageous Israelis and Palestinians who see all this and stand for a negotiated, mutual approach, perhaps especially those brave personnel in the Israeli military who have refused to take part in operations which they think are unacceptable. In 1967, before I was in government, as a young Labour Back-Bencher, I was in Israel at the time of the war and became caught up in it. What impressed me at the time were the Israelis who said to me, &#147;It&#146;s all right for some people to talk in these extreme terms, but we&#146;ve got to build peace with these people in the future&#148;. I do not say that they were in the majority, but they were important voices. There have always been such Israelis, and we should seek all the time to strengthen their role.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="08012299000047"></a>The Middle East and the plight of the Palestinians is central to global security and recruitment for militant extremism, leading to terrorism across the world. Why is that? It is because there is a real sense of injustice, and to deny it is just stupidity. It is a sense of injustice compounded by frustration at what are seen as corrupt and at times brutal authoritarian Arab regimes with which we are prepared to deal. They are regimes seen by many of the Islamic faith as hypocritical in their religion. That again is an underlying truth we have to face. We may not like it but that is the reality, and perception becomes an important part of political reality.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="08012299000048"></a>All this is also underlined by what are seen as self-fulfilling prophecies about unreliable, ineffective government&#151;for example, of the Palestinians&#151;while fostering humiliation, instability and the impossibility of an effective, unified, well administered Palestine as a state, with the disruption and hardship caused by the wall, the attacks on centres of government, and all the adverse economic consequences of trade blocks and border harassment.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="08012299000049"></a>I declare an interest. I am a former director of Oxfam and remain close to it. Oxfam keeps me well briefed on its front-line experiences as of now&#151;today&#151;in this situation. The cuts in power have been having grave and far-reaching impact on water supplies, sewage systems, hospitals and healthcare in general. Like other NGOs in that area&#151;as well as international institutions&#151;my Oxfam friends have become exasperated at the consequences of violence and its total counterproductivity on both sides. It is absolutely counterproductive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="08012299000050"></a>I will finish by quoting the present director of Oxfam, Barbara Stocking, whom I greatly admire. She has recently come back from the area and has been commenting on the most recent events. Her words are worth considering:</p>

We are all in his debt for doing so, and for allowing us the opportunity to have this discussion. The noble Lord played a distinguished role in the peace process in Northern Ireland as leader of the Alliance Party, as one of the negotiators involved in the Good Friday agreement, as Speaker in the Northern Ireland Assembly and recently in his work for the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. He should know that in Grand Committee this afternoon in this House, Members of all parties paid tribute to the work of that commission and the progress it has made. He speaks with considerable authority and experience on these matters.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="080122100000002"></a>He has acknowledged that some of his views on the development of peace processes have changed. This evening, as on other recent occasions, he has made it clear that he is committed to the concept of the inclusion of the extremes as a necessary prerequisite. I think he would agree that this was not his starting point on these matters, but it is now his current position. There is no doubt at all, as I said, that he speaks with considerable knowledge of what has happened in Northern Ireland. I hope he will forgive me for also saying that he is perhaps influenced to a degree by his training as a psychiatrist in the ways he thinks about issues of human hurt and healing. If you take the Northern Ireland settlement as an example of community psychotherapy as it now operates, you can see that the noble Lord&#146;s work and training have not been in vain.</p>

<a name="80122-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="080122100000003"></a>It is therefore with some reluctance that I question at least some of the assumptions that lie behind the noble Lord&#146;s argument today about the applicability of the Northern Ireland model to the Middle East. It is true that since Annapolis a kind of conference table has been constructed, even if it is not exactly along the lines that the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, would like to see. The broad principles which underlie the approach of the quartet were summarised a long time ago, in the Rose Garden, by President Bush. Flanked by, among others, Condoleezza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld, who is not as loved on the Liberal Democrat Benches as much as he might be, the president said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="080122100000026"></a>&#147;It is untenable for Israeli citizens to live in terror. It is untenable for Palestinians to live in squalor and occupation. And the current situation offers no prospect that life will improve. Israeli citizens will continue to be victimised by terrorists, and so Israel will continue to defend herself ... My vision is two states, living side by side in peace and security ... The Israeli occupation that began in 1967 will be ended through a settlement negotiated between the parties, based on UN resolutions 242 and 338, with Israeli withdrawal to secure and recognised borders&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080122100000004"></a>That scenario imposes heavy costs on Israel. But it is also clear that in President Bush&#146;s mind there was no place in this dialogue for parties which continue to use

That is the broad context in which we are moving forward. Those remarks were made in June 2002 and, five and a half years on, in terms of the definition of the tragedy of the situation, they were fairly accurate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="080122100000005"></a>Members of the House will be aware of the remarkable think tank associated with the name of Mr Peter Hain, the former Northern Ireland Secretary and now Works and Pensions Secretary. We were impressed that it had not produced any pamphlets, lectures and so on, but that can be misleading because it has made us forget that Mr Hain, as Northern Ireland Secretary, produced one major lecture at Chatham House, which I was fortunate to hear, in which he outlined his vision of the lessons of Northern Ireland for the Middle East and elsewhere. His argument there&#151;which has, to a degree, been argued by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, today&#151;was that the key thing in the Northern Ireland process was the avoidance of preconditions and that, for example, to say that Israel&#146;s right to exist must be accepted may be not an enabling precondition for the Middle East peace process.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="080122100000006"></a>That is not my view of what happened in Northern Ireland in the 1990s. In effect, all the parties were told in political terms, &#147;You can have whatever settlement you want as long as you accept the principle of consent, power sharing plus an Irish dimension&#148;. It was Henry Fordism in politics; that is what they were all told. It is true that preconditions as regards arms being handed over were flouted, but on the broad political structures both the British and Irish Governments made it absolutely clear that there were very firm preconditions. Indeed, it was very interesting that Mr Hain, in answering questions, respected this difficulty in the way he dealt with the matter in discussions at Chatham House on that day.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="080122100000007"></a>The media today stress the lack of optimism of both Israelis and Palestinians about the Annapolis process. In fact, this lack of optimism is not a particularly significant indicator of the prospects of success one way or the other. Both peoples have long and bitter experience of the other. The citizens of Gaza who are suffering because of Israel&#146;s decision to close the local power station can hardly be expected to like it. The people of Israel recall that Israel left Gaza in 2005 and since then Gaza has been used not as a platform for democratic and economic Palestinian uplift but for attacks on Israel. Since then, more than 1,000 rockets have been fired into their state.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="080122100000008"></a>What matters is something else. Most Israelis have for a long time, according to polls, been in favour of an historic compromise. The most recent polls, which I read at the weekend, showed that 71 per cent of Palestinians, too, want their leaders to seek a peace settlement with Israel. Interestingly, for what it is worth, the same polls showed a drop in confidence in Hamas. These are difficult matters. All of us who are familiar with Northern Ireland know that these polls can be misleading but, none the less, they represent a comparison of like with like within the same polling organisation over a period of time.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="080122100000009"></a>In the end, everything here depends on the role of political elites. It is not true, as it is often sentimentally said of Northern Ireland, that the people were ahead  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_211"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 211</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the politicians; it was the political elites that drove the process and surprised the people by achieving a result. Achieving a settlement in the Middle East will be a far more difficult task than it was in Northern Ireland. In the past two months two remarkable books have been produced from within the Jewish tradition and the Palestinian tradition: Professor Ruth Wisse&#146;s <I>Jews and Power</I> and Professor Sari Nusseibeh&#146;s <I>Once Upon A Country: A Palestinian Life</I>. Both books are written with profound and deep culture and historical imagination, yet the differences between both writers on fundamental points of politics and religion are greater than the differences that existed in Northern Ireland, if you take two books written by representative intellectuals of the two communities in the 1990s.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="080122100000010"></a>We have to respect how difficult this is going to be, given the generosity and wisdom of both those writers. Indeed, if we are to use an analogy from Ireland, it is more the Troubles of 1921-22 than those of the 1990s that are applicable. At that time the British state made a decision, in dealing with a revolutionary challenge, to make a deal with a more moderate faction and then at a later date allow the irreconcilables of that deal to come into the process; that is, if any Irish analogy applies in the first place.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="080122100000011"></a>In the time that remains for me, which is running out fast, I shall make some brief points about other differences that exist. One has already been alluded to by the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice&#151;selfish strategic interest. The Middle East is awash with selfish strategic interest: Iraqi, Iranian, Chinese, Russian, American and so on. In Northern Ireland the precondition part of the agreement was dealt with when the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, declared in 1990 that Britain had no selfish strategic interest in Northern Ireland. The Irish state, for its part, eventually moved to remove its territorial claim from the constitution. Again, there is no comparison in the state of play within these movements. We now know that British intelligence had a very high level of penetration of the IRA and therefore knew a great deal about its level of war-weariness, in a way that no one knows about where Hamas and Hezbollah are to this day.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="080122100000012"></a>Then there is the level of hatred. Noble Lords may have listened at the weekend to the report on the BBC website of the words of Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, the goading, ghastly, horrific language that was used, about Hezbollah&#146;s possession of the body parts of Israeli soldiers. No IRA leader, no matter how cruel or solipsistic, would ever have used such language. It is a simple fact; that would have been beyond the pale. Again, it is an indication that we are dealing with deeper hatreds here, and we have to respect that. The noble Lords, Lord Kilclooney and Lord Maginnis, have just reached their 70th birthdays&#151;people will know that they are very lucky to have done so because they survived assassination attempts&#151;and they would say that no IRA leader would use such language.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="080122100000013"></a>I want to talk about the conflicts forum. The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, is a distinguished member of its advisory board. I have looked at some of Dr Assam Tamimi&#146;s texts. Dr Tamimi is controversial because some sections of the media have raised the issue of his views on suicide bombing, but I was more concerned  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_212"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 212</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about the general political tone: glee that earlier peace deals had failed, a sense of catastrophism and pleasure in the mounting catastrophe in the Middle East. That is really worrying. It is something the Israelis would find it difficult to cope with.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="080122100000014"></a>I understand and respect the good intentions behind the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice. More than most people in this House, I know how much he has contributed to the peace process in Northern Ireland. However, inclusivity is not in itself a magical solution. It depends above all on the mood of the revolutionary movement you are dealing with. Is it war weary? Is it resigned, which was the case with the IRA in the 1990s, or is it maximalist, enthusiastic and increasingly bitter, which looks to be the case with Hamas and Hezbollah in the first decade of the 21st century? I regret that there is no sign that the resigned, war-weary mood that overtook the IRA in the 1990s is taking over Hezbollah and Hamas in the first decade of the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="080122100000015"></a>Despite its great importance, we can at times overemphasise the Arab-Israeli dispute. We must remember also the work of the noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown, on the Arab<I> Human Development Report</I> when he was the UN. It stressed the general issues of economic failure in that region, some of which are not fundamental consequences of Israeli policy. That was very important work by the noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown, which also is worth placing in context. I thank again the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, for giving us the chance to have this discussion this evening.</p>

I have some strong memories of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, on which the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, partly bases his proposal. It was a Soviet initiative, intended to hold to the status quo of Soviet domination over eastern Europe and cleverly used by the Germans above all to begin to change the nature of the discussion between hostile states in western and eastern Europe. It left us with the problem of how we dealt with states and dissident groups. The Charter 77 groups, which used the Helsinki final act as a lever and a rationale for standing up against their Governments, were not something with which western Governments found it easy to deal. Did we deal formally with the socialist states, or did we support those who opposed them? It is not such an easy model on which to base this proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="080122100000017"></a>However, I strongly support my noble friend Lord Alderdice in his suggestion that we need to build a broader group in which to operate, that we need to treat the region as a whole, and that we have to bring the Arab League more formally into the discussion about the future of the Israel-Palestine peace process. At my own party conference, we passed a resolution on the Arab-Israeli negotiations in which we called for the quartet to be expanded into a quintet, bringing in the Arab League. It is clear that the Saudis are key

What Prince Turki said yesterday in Germany about opening up the rest of the Middle East to the Israeli economy after a settlement was a very positive step forward.

It is clear to all of us that, in any move towards a process for negotiations about the region, Israel will not accept being left on its own. The United States, the European Union and probably Russia have to be engaged as counterweights to the Arab League. I take it as given that the United Kingdom cannot usefully act alone&#151;that we have to make the best of our role as a player within the European Union, which is part of the quartet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="080122100000019"></a>As noble Lords have already said, there is also the problem of movements and what we do about those powerful, non-state actors, particularly Hezbollah. Whether we regard Hamas as part of the Palestine Government&#151;it was elected as so&#151;or as a hostile movement is a question with which we have to grapple. It is a huge mistake of the Israeli and American Governments to attempt to delegitimise Hamas, which is what they are doing, in the hope that collective punishment in Gaza will reduce popular support for Hamas, relegitimise Fatah and so provide a more reasonable Palestinian authority with which to negotiate. The noble Lord, Lord Trimble, will remember the long history of British Governments preferring to choose the more reasonable people in Northern Ireland with whom to negotiate rather than negotiating with the less reasonable people. It was not always very successful there, unfortunately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="080122100000020"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Judd, has talked about some of the immediate issues. We shall get nowhere if Gaza collapses. The immediate humanitarian crisis there has to be dealt with. I was briefed today by a distinguished Israeli academic on the current situation there. I have to say that he is remarkably optimistic that President Bush&#146;s recent initiatives and the clear change of direction from the US Administration is going to take us forward relatively rapidly towards the beginnings of a settlement. I hope that he is right, but we will not achieve that if Hamas collapses into civil war and disorder in the next few weeks. We have to grapple with that&#151;which means that we cannot entirely ignore Hamas.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="080122100000021"></a>I am happy to understand that there are informal conversations going on between the Americans and Syria. That is very positive. When we look at it, we all understand that there is a basis for an agreement between the United States and Syria. One knows what the only acceptable settlement between Israel and Palestine could be in outline, but I fear that reaching even the heads of agreement of that between now and next January 20, when President Bush leaves office, leaves us very short of time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="080122100000022"></a>We also agree that we must be inclusive with regard to the current Iranian regime; nothing would do more to weaken the power of President Ahmadinejad than for us to embrace the Iranian regime, offer it security guarantees and show the Iranian public that the West

We have to hope that we get over these short-term disagreements. I desperately hope that President Bush is able to push things forward, that Prime Minister Olmert can carry his Government&#151;having lost the right, holding on to the left&#151;and that there are a Palestinian Government able to respond with the positive support of the Saudis, a more constructive response from Syria and a constructive response from Egypt. The question is how we make that stick.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="080122100000023"></a>However far these negotiators get in the nine months, they can achieve only the beginnings of a different peace process. That is where the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, has some very useful things to say about a collective continuing conference for the region, with outside support, which will open up economic exchanges and encourage social interaction and educational interchange. The Middle East already has some advantages over a wider Europe in the 1970s and early 1980s, when we had great difficulty communicating across the east and west of Europe. Western television reached only parts of East Germany and western radio was jammed, but television carries all the way across the Middle East, and multichannels with different programmes and points of view are already beginning to transform the discussions within some of those authoritarian regimes.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="080122100000024"></a>We need to bring together Iran and the Arabs across the Gulf region and the Arabs and Israelis across the Fertile Crescent. Whether we can also include the countries of the Maghreb I am not entirely sure; it saddens me desperately that that Algerian border remains closed with Morocco and Tunis. Both those neighbours of Algeria should be trading actively and interacting tremendously closely, or the Maghreb simply does not work, never mind sorting out the detail.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="080122100000025"></a>I urge the noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown, to outline support&#151;to encourage us to believe that the European Union would like a more active and continuing multilateral process rather than just have the external quartet handle the immediate problem of the Arab-Israeli process and the longer-term problem of how we build a more peaceful and economically integrated Middle East.</p>

The noble Lord and I have a similar background and we have worked together, so I also wish to acknowledge the considerable contribution that he made to the positive developments that have taken place in Northern Ireland over recent years. Although he may not be aware of the full details, one thing I remember fondly from the final day of those talks nearly 10 years ago was the occasion on which I managed to prevent a member of my party from physically assaulting him.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="080122105000005"></a>It is natural, given the positive experience in Northern Ireland, for us to look at other areas in the world to see whether there are ways in which the example can help or lessons can be drawn. But we must approach this very cautiously. We may be dealing with similar issues, but in every situation there are different circumstances  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_215"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 215</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and different histories and we must treat each case on its own merits. We must not approach a situation with a vision that is conditioned from somewhere else. Reference was made to respect for the parties. If we approach a situation such as the Middle East and say, &#147;We did this in Northern Ireland therefore you should do it&#148;, we would not be paying respect to the parties there. We should follow through what we mean in that situation.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="080122105000006"></a>I was fascinated by the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Bew, about 1920 being a more relevant comparison with regard to the Middle East than 1998. I can see where he is coming from, as they say, but I do not want to get involved in a detailed discussion. It would make an excellent seminar to be held in another place, but cannot be included in speeches limited to a few minutes, as we have here.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="080122105000007"></a>I emphasise that we must be careful about drawing analogies and about reading over from one situation to another, but I see some points of similarity. Again, referring to comments that were made about respecting the parties and individuals, that ties up with the centrality in the Northern Ireland situation of the principle of consent. That was not fully followed in practice by successive British Governments in the early days, when they sought to impose their views, but in the latter stage, the existence of the respect for that principle was crucial in giving parties the confidence to enter into discussions, which might otherwise have been quite difficult, and to fashion their outcome.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="080122105000008"></a>Equally important&#151;and this should help to clarify some of the issues with regard to participants in the situation in the Middle East&#151;was the emphasis on having a democratic basis for involvement. That determined that parties should have a mandate, and that only those parties with a mandate could be involved. We were dealing with parties inside a state whereas in the Middle East there are competing states and non-state parties as well. There are differences and we should be cautious in terms of how we proceed.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="080122105000009"></a>I am with the noble Lord, Lord Bew, on the question of the conditionality of the process and in expressing scepticism about the suggestion that one should drop preconditions and engage in inclusive dialogue with everyone, no matter how unpleasant and nasty they appear to be. In Northern Ireland, the process was highly conditional&#151;not only on there being a complete cessation of violence, as the noble Lord suggested in a Question the other day; there were also the conditions summed up in the Mitchell principles and preshadowed in the Downing Street Declaration of 1993. The endorsement of the Mitchell principles by the republican leadership led to a major split in that organisation and bound it into a democratic and peaceful process. As the noble Lord, Lord Bew, said, from the Downing Street Declaration right through to the framework document, there was a degree of conditionality as to outcome. Stating the consent principle and requiring people to endorse it also conditioned the outcome because that meant there could be only one outcome to the basic underlying constitutional issue. But we have to be careful; this was a more conditional process than some people now recollect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="080122105000010"></a>Reference was made to the paper published in, I believe, July of last year by Peter Hain. Some noble Lords may know that I responded to it in a paper published at the end of September entitled <I>Misunderstanding Ulster</I>, in which I went into detail on these matters. I refer noble Lords to that and if they have difficulty finding it they can obtain it on my website free of charge. In fact, it is free anywhere you get it, but that is by the way.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="080122105000011"></a>I note the proposal that is made regarding the development of talks in the Middle East but I am not sure that it will be helpful at present. We have a process which has been going on for a long time although it is episodic. It started at Oslo. To my mind the crucial thing that happened at Oslo was that a significant section of the Israeli body politic came to the conclusion that it had to divide the land and that there had to be a two-state solution rather than Israel continuing in occupation. As we know, that decision at Oslo was controversial at that stage within the Israeli body politic. But by the time of Camp David there was a clear majority within Israel for a compromise solution, and the conversion of Sharon to that view was hugely significant. While Likud might stand a little detached from the process at the moment, in view of what Sharon did I very much suspect that it will come back into it on the same terms that Sharon would have done. So I think there has been a sea change in politics in Israel.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="080122105000012"></a>It is not so clear whether there has been a similar sea change within Arab or Palestinian politics. I note the opinion poll that was referred to. We see the commitment of the Palestinian Authority leadership at the moment, but there must be huge reservations about whether Palestinian, let alone Arab, opinion is ready for a two-state solution at this stage. But there is a process even if, as I say, it has been episodic. It went from Oslo to Camp David, to the attempt a couple of years ago to start talks, to the talks that are now taking place. While one may regard the quartet as being outside it, or in some way supervising it, those are essentially talks between Israelis and Palestinians. But the talks will go wider. Reference was made to Saudi Arabia. Because the talks will necessarily have to deal with the Temple Mount, the Saudi Arabians, as the keepers of the holy places, will inevitably be involved, as they were involved at Camp David in giving approval to the regime for the governance and administration of the Temple Mount.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="080122105000013"></a>If there is a prospect of agreement, Syria will want to come in because it will want Golan, but there cannot be a resolution of the situation with Syria unless the Lebanon is sorted out because while the frontier on the Golan is quiet, that is mainly because Syria is conducting a proxy war through the Lebanon, so it involves sorting out the Lebanon as well. It comes back to the point that the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, made about the importance of the Israel/Palestine issue. It has general symbolic status but trying to resolve it involves going broader and wider, and that will inevitably happen.</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="080122105000014"></a>I do not want to spend too much time commenting on the particular situation. The position of the Conservative Party is clear. We believe that the peace process ought to be based, and concluded, on the basis  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_217"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column 217</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of a two-state solution. The final settlement should be the outcome of negotiations and envisage a secure Israel and a viable, democratic Palestinian state. The Conservative Party remains opposed to steps by either side that would compromise the two-state solution, which remains the only hope for a lasting peace in the region. However, a two-state solution does mean that the parties are prepared not to seek victory, but to accept an accommodation. While people may criticise the quartet conditions on accepting the state of Israel and all the rest of it, it really comes down to that issue: are they prepared to have a compromise outcome or are they still seeking victory?</p>

<a name="80122-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="080122105000015"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, quoted Martin McGuinness in a recent meeting at which he said the republican movement eventually came to the conclusion that it would have to engage with others. Decoded, that means that the republican movement came to the conclusion that it could not achieve a victory over others and that it would have to settle for the continued existence of the other and, therefore, accommodate itself. The republican movement came to that conclusion because its violence had failed; not only had it failed but, as the noble Lord, Lord Bew, said, it had become so thoroughly penetrated by intelligence that it faced defeat. It is not polite to say that, because we had a negotiated outcome with which I am very content, but the reality lying behind that is that the republican movement came into that process with a degree of reluctance, because it had nowhere else to go. We have had so many difficulties with the implementation of that process since 1998 because of that same degree of reluctance. That is true not just of the republican movement but of the Democratic Unionist Party. We now see two parties that perhaps would have preferred something else ending up together because they had nowhere else to go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="080122105000016"></a>We may find a similar situation in Israel and Palestine, because, at the end of the day, Israelis and Palestinians have to accept that the other is not going to go away and they have to find an accommodation, which will be a two-state solution. When we see the full account of what happened at Camp David, we will discover how very close it came to a successful outcome and how, when we get a successful outcome between Israel and Palestine&#151;which may happen this year, but may not be until some subsequent point&#151;it will turn out to be very close to the arrangements and final offers made to the Palestinians at Camp David regarding the borders of the state. Those offers have not been fully disclosed, but enough broad hints have been dropped to enable one to work out what they are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="080122105000017"></a>At the end of the day it will come down to both those parties being prepared to accept the other and then to work out a modus vivendi. That will take time, particularly in view of the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Bew, on the degree of antipathy that exists in that situation. But there is no other place for the parties to go. We should do what we can to assist them in doing it, but we will not do anyone any favours by glossing over the need for one to accept the other and to move away from an attempt to achieve a total victory.</p>

I suspect that I share with all those who have spoken who are neither Northern Irish nor Arab or Israeli the view that we have been allowed to sit in on a very special discussion between three fine Northern Irishmen. On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, that this was not the time for a seminar, every now and again I wanted to close my eyes, lean back and think that I was back in the best kind of graduate seminar where we had three extraordinarily well informed points of view on what were or were not the lessons of Ulster for the Palestinian-Israeli problem of today.</p>

<a name="80122-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="080122105000020"></a>For those of us not wise enough to be able to conclude who was right and who was wrong on the lessons drawn, there was nevertheless one common conclusion: that, for those of us who remember both conflicts, in Northern Ireland and the Middle East, and the frustration that we all felt in seeing so many of the world&#146;s other conflicts resolved, these two intractable stubborn ones just sat out there, refusing, it seemed, to bend to reason or solution. We were all struck by the statesmanship and vision of those men and women of Northern Ireland who brought that conflict successfully to port and to peace. We can draw the general conclusion: if Northern Ireland, why not Palestine and Israel? This discussion gives us cause for hope. There should be no conflict from which we cannot find a peaceful way forward. We all support the peace process in the Middle East. But we are also aware&#151;as we heard from three noble Lords tonight&#151;that it is the parties themselves that make the key decisions. There was a discussion about which side drew their conclusions for peace when and where. But in some ways the British, while vital to this process, nevertheless were secondary to the decisions of the immediate parties in Northern Ireland. The lesson here is that without the buy-in of Arab neighbours, of different Palestinian groups and of Israelis, no approach can be effective. The international community must stand ready to help where it can, but ultimate responsibility for the details of the negotiations must be taken by the parties themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="080122105000021"></a>This Government work hard to help the peace process become sufficiently robust to survive any setbacks. The bedrock of our approach to the Middle East peace process remains our unstinting support for the principle of a two-state solution. We give every support to those who are committed to peaceful progress in the region, and we support economic and social development across the Occupied Palestinian Territories. First under Jim Wolfensohn and now under former Prime Minister Tony Blair, we have been proud to support efforts to build that economic self-interest that was referred to earlier in the context of the European Union&#151;where driving self-interest allowed political institutions to be built on top of it, and conflict could be contained within peaceful

Similarly in the Middle East, we hope to create the underpinnings of a peace that will provide a basis on which political trust can be built.</p>

<a name="80122-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="080122105000022"></a>Although we remain open to initiatives and certainly to the ideas that were expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, in terms of the table, we want to make sure that we do not displace or confuse the existing initiatives that are working towards a two-state solution. We have great hopes for what began at Annapolis. To those who have pointed out that the peace process in Northern Ireland was heavily conditioned, I say that we still look for the commitment of groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah to peaceful progress in the region. We continue to call on Hamas to adhere to the quartet&#146;s principles of non-violence, recognition of Israel and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the road map. We still consider that these principles are not unreasonable and remain the fundamental conditions for a viable peace process. A political dialogue is impossible so long as one party is dedicated to violence and the destruction of the other. The option for engagement is in the hands of Hamas and Hezbollah. In saying that, we in no way condone Israel&#146;s blockade of assistance to Gaza and its continued building of settlements that we consider illegal. In that sense, we appeal to both sides to hold back in order to create the space for peace and to learn the lesson of Northern Ireland that peace talks must be built on acceptance by both sides of the principle of the other&#146;s right to exist. There is no way round the fact that they share a geographic space and must learn to live with each other.</p>

<a name="80122-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="080122105000023"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, raised the question of the quartet&#146;s representativeness&#151;a point echoed by others&#151;and asked whether there should at least be room for it to become a quintet with the addition of the Arab League. Obviously, in its original conception the quartet was exactly that&#151;outside. The idea was to provide a group of outside friends to try to encourage the local parties and neighbours to move forward in a peace process. They were the external guarantors, and it was deliberately intended that the United States, Russia, the European Union and the UN should not be privy to the conflict.</p>

<a name="80122-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="080122105000024"></a>However, the Annapolis process, which is much wider but therefore much more inclusive because it contains essentially everyone with an interest in the conflict, wherever they are geographically located, is an attempt to create a more inclusive situation while allowing the United States, as the country that everyone looks to as being critical in the whole situation, a lead role, even beyond the one that it has played in the quartet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="080122105000025"></a>Going forward, the question is: how do we find a balance between the external guarantors and drivers of the process while allowing space not just for the Israelis and Palestinians but for the neighbours in the Arab region to play an adequate role and, indeed, for the peace process to touch not just on the Palestinian/Israeli issue but at least on Syria and Lebanon as well? Although the matter has not been raised tonight, I

<a name="80122-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="080122105000026"></a>In that regard, I am very grateful for the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Bew, on the Arab <I>Human Development </I><I>R</I><I>epor</I><I>ts</I>. In commissioning those reports, it was my hope that they would spur the Governments of the region to take the quality of governance and human rights and the political and economic progress of their region into their own hands. The message of the reports was, rightly, that you cannot blame everything on the Arab/Israeli conflict. Indeed, you need to look wider and understand that history is passing you by because you have chosen to allow yourself to be caught in the rut of ancient conflicts as the rest of the world moves on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="080122105000027"></a>Prime Minister Fayyad was in London earlier today and met my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary. It is through leaders such as him and President Abbas on the one side and Prime Minister Olmert, Foreign Minister Livni and Minister Barak on the other that we have seen in the past few months a real glimpse of progress. We hope that what began at Annapolis will follow through to real peace. In that regard, I devoutly hope that the unexpected optimism of the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, around an American diplomatic initiative is well placed and that it will lead to progress this year. None of us can doubt the real commitment of President Bush and Secretary of State Rice to try to notch up a success in this area before they leave office at the end of the year.</p>

<a name="80122-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="080122105000028"></a>As I have said, the role that our Northern Ireland colleagues and Peers have played tonight reminds us of both what is possible and how high a mountain we have to climb. Nor is it a static mountain, as my noble friend Lord Judd and others have pointed out. This is a time when the humanitarian situation in Gaza only worsens. The level of deprivation for the people of that stricken area only grows. This is not a situation that can wait for ever for peace.</p>

<a name="80122-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="080122105000029"></a>Therefore, we need to take inspiration from the three Peers of Northern Ireland who have spoken tonight. Perhaps I may quote one other great leader of that province. As John Hume said in his Nobel lecture in 1998, before any of us knew that peace would conclude successfully, at a moment when, perhaps, it looked almost as distant as peace in the Middle East looks today:</p>

<p><a name="08012267000008"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08012267000105"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Passenger and Goods Vehicles (Recording Equipment) (Downloading and Retention of Data) Regulations 2008.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000009"></a>The noble Lord said: The regulations represent the final stage of a series of legislative changes that are necessary to reflect the introduction of digital tachographs throughout the European Union. The EU drivers&#146; hours and tachograph rules require most HGVs and some buses and coaches to be equipped with a tachograph to monitor drivers&#146; driving times and rest periods through recording the time, speed and distance of journeys. The rules also require that drivers and operators keep records of hours worked. The first generation of analogue tachographs recorded the information on paper disks. However, due to increased abuses and manipulation of the equipment, digital tachographs were developed and, for vehicles first brought into service on or after 1 May 2006, these new tachographs are now mandatory under EU legislation. The digital tachograph records information electronically on both the unit fitted to a vehicle and a magnetic card that is personal to an individual driver.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000010"></a>The EU legislation requires member states to ensure that the data necessary to enforce the rules can be made available for at least 365 days after recording and under conditions that guarantee the security and accuracy of the data. Because of the risk of overwriting of data or its loss for other reasons, the EU regulation makes regular downloading of data mandatory. However, the rules leave the frequency of downloading to individual member states. These regulations would specify that data must be downloaded at least every 56 days for vehicle units and at least every 28 days for drivers&#146; cards.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000011"></a>In addition, the new EU legislation requires drivers to keep records covering the previous 28 days in their vehicle. That is inconsistent with existing domestic  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC58"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>legislation, which requires drivers to return records to their employer within 21 days. To avoid conflict, the regulations extend the period within which drivers must return records to their employer to 42 days. The regulations will apply throughout Great Britain. Similar provisions are being made for Northern Ireland. The regulations have already been considered and approved by the other place. Happily, I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000012"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Passenger and Goods Vehicles (Recording Equipment) (Downloading and Retention of Data) Regulations 2008. <I>4th Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee.</I>&#151;(<I>Lord Bassam of Brighton</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="08012267000013"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08012267000106"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> I welcome the regulations, which will obviously help to improve safety on our roads. I do not oppose them in any way, but I have one or two questions for the Minister, so that we know exactly where we are going. In another place, there was discussion of how the regulations might affect rural bus services. Where there is a distance of, I think, over 50 kilometres&#151;that will obviously be the case in some rural areas&#151;the bus driver might be required to conform to the regulations. I gather that discussions are ongoing and are not yet finalised. Perhaps the Minister could tell me where we are on bus drivers and the regulations.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000014"></a>I gather that recent figures on the checking of offences have shown that one in 27 offences is caused by drivers from the European Union whereas for UK drivers the figure is only one in 99. Are the Government doing anything about the fact that there is considerably more offending by European drivers? I would also like confirmation&#151;I think that it was confirmed in the other place&#151;that the regulations apply only to vehicles that were registered after early 2006, so that older vehicles, such as horse boxes, do not have to be regulated in this way at the moment. This year, the requirement by VOSA to check drivers has risen from 1 per cent of days worked to 2 per cent. Perhaps the Minister could explain that to me. We very much support the regulations, but I should like these questions to be answered for the sake of clarity.</p>

<p><a name="08012267000015"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08012267000107"></a>Lord Newby:</b> I apologise that my noble friend Lord Bradshaw is unable to be here this afternoon, but it is a great pleasure for me to be discussing subjects other than those that relate to the Treasury brief.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000016"></a>We, too, have a number of questions, although we welcome the regulations as a whole. As we have heard, there are serious issues about the way in which the regulations are being implemented in respect of bus drivers, particularly rural bus drivers. I believe that the Minister made an offer to my noble friend Lord Bradshaw when these matters were discussed previously that a meeting would be arranged with the relevant Minister, Mr Fitzpatrick. My noble friend would like to know whether that offer still stands and, if so, when a meeting might be held.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000017"></a>This issue has also been raised, but how will foreign lorries, of which there are increasing numbers on British roads, be covered? Who will be responsible  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC59"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC59</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for enforcing the regulations, which are repeatedly breached, particularly by Irish and eastern European drivers? How secure does the Minister think that the smart cards are? What steps are being taken to prevent forging or dual use of cards&#151;that is, a driver possessing more than one of them? Finally, why is the evidence of speeding not routinely accessed and looked at by the enforcement authorities? Anybody who has driven more than a few miles on a motorway knows that speeding by vehicles covered by these regulations is rife and is a deliberate way of avoiding the drivers&#146; hours regulations. We support the thrust of the regulations but would be grateful for answers to those questions.</p>

<p><a name="08012267000018"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08012267000108"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I am grateful to both noble Lords who have participated, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Newby, who is acting as a stand-in for the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. He has usefully alighted on issues that I know the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, has close to his heart. As the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, will remember, the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, raised the issue of rural bus services, on which we have had some useful discourse.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000019"></a>It is perhaps worth reminding ourselves why we have these regulations. They are intended to promote road safety; I do not think that there is anything between us on the importance of doing that. They are also intended to promote decent working conditions and fair competition. Those are all important objectives. As such, they are of particular importance to the road transportation industry and to drivers throughout Europe, as we have been reminded by some of the questions asked this afternoon.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000020"></a>The regulations will improve the security of drivers&#146; hours recording and prevent abuses. It has been estimated that, in the longer term, they will save money by reducing administrative burdens associated with the current analogue system. This is relevant, because we estimate savings of around &#163;15 million a year in 2009, rising to &#163;24 million a year in 2010. That is no insignificant saving.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000021"></a>The regulations complete the legislative process through which they were introduced. One can fairly argue that they more than offset other operating costs to operators, which I am sure will be welcome to smaller operators, in particular those operating bus services. In preparing the regulations, we consulted widely and took on board many of the comments received. Our final proposals on downloading default periods received strong support from the industry, the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency and the police, who have responsibility for enforcing the EU drivers&#146; hours and tachograph rules across Great Britain. Without the downloading requirements set out in the regulations, enforcement authorities would have difficulty obtaining key information from digital tachographs and those few unscrupulous operators would find it easier to avoid providing these data. That would have an adverse impact on road safety.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000022"></a>It is also worth reminding ourselves that there is a need to amend existing legislative requirements on record keeping to avoid a conflict with the new EU requirements and to ensure that drivers and operators  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC60"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are not put in a position where they cannot comply with the law. The revised period of 42 days for drivers to return records to their employer reflects views put forward by the industry during consultation. The regulations provide for enforcement of the new requirements. They will make specific provision for proceedings against corporate and unincorporated bodies for offences under the drivers&#146; hours and tachograph legislation generally. The burden of record keeping will now be firmly placed on transport operators.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000023"></a>Both noble Lords referred to rural bus services; I had the full version of the concern about that when this matter was discussed last year. Both old and new EU regulations apply to bus drivers operating on routes of more than 50 kilometres, so in that respect nothing has changed. The new EU regulation has changed some core provisions on breaks and rest periods. In addition, drivers on regular services on routes of more than 50 kilometres now need to record their hours using tachographs rather than written records, so the scope for falsification is more limited. When the new EU regulation was being negotiated, the Government received little evidence from the industry to suggest that these changes would cause any problems for bus operators, particularly rural bus operators. Our flexibility to provide dispensations for particular circumstances is very limited. I see no realistic prospect of securing the necessary level of support from other member states to change the regulation.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000024"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked about the meeting that I agreed to organise. Jim Fitzpatrick, my colleague, recently met representatives of rural bus operators and the Confederation of Passenger Transport to explore the issues that have been raised this afternoon and the solutions that there might be within the constraints of the new EU regulation. Following that meeting, he agreed to provide further clarity on what constitutes a route for the purposes of the 50-kilometre limit. Officials will shortly be holding discussions with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency and the Confederation of Passenger Transport on the issue.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000025"></a>In the end, it is for the courts to interpret the law. The Government can vary how the domestic drivers&#146; hours rules apply to drivers of regular services on routes not exceeding 50 kilometres, but not to the extent that the rules would conflict with or undermine the EU regulation, which takes precedence over domestic legislation. In the past, the courts have ruled that attempts to split a route artificially&#151;for example, by changing the destination board on a vehicle part-way through a journey&#151;do not have the effect of dividing a longer route into two shorter routes. We are not in a position to overturn that decision. That is as much information as I can provide on that issue. I understand the point that is being made on it, but I think that the companies will have to adjust. Some of the savings that they will make in the cost of operating the system will compensate them for some of the additional costs that they might have to bear in rostering and so on.</p>
<h5><a name="08012267000099"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000026"></a>Both noble Lords raised the issue of enforcement against foreign drivers. That is understandably a matter of concern. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, gave  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC61"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC61</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some figures, which sounded familiar to me. They underline a problem of which we are very conscious. It is not surprising that foreign drivers find it more difficult to comply with UK road regulations; I am sure that UK drivers experience similar difficulties abroad. That does not mean that they should be immune from the full force of the law and proper regulation.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000027"></a>We in this country rightly pride ourselves on our efforts to drive up driver standards. For a long time we have proudly told the world that we are one of the best and safest countries in the world in which to drive. That is certainly still the case. I think that our road safety record is the third or fourth best in Europe, which is a great credit to the way in which Governments of both faiths have endeavoured to drive up standards.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000028"></a>All commercial vehicles and drivers are required to comply with the law, irrespective of whether their operating base is in the UK or elsewhere. VOSA targets the non-compliant using modern technology, such as automatic number-plate recognition to spot operators who have a poor track record of compliance and weigh-in-motion centres to spot overweight vehicles. I am sure that that approach is the most effective use of resources and that it minimises the risk of inconveniencing the compliant.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000029"></a>VOSA also makes considerable efforts to share information about non-compliance across the EU, as we would obviously prefer such car drivers not to enter the UK in the first instance. Since the beginning of 2006-07, VOSA has significantly stepped up the level of enforcement activity in respect of commercial vehicles undertaking international journeys. It has also doubled the number of enforcement checks on potentially non-compliant vehicles during the past financial year and will increase the level of checks again by a further 20 per cent in the current financial year. It has committed 10 extra front-line staff around the country to extend the work of the now completed south-east international pilot for transport nationally and it has been given an extra &#163;2 million in 2008-09 for HGV enforcement.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000030"></a>All drivers are required to carry records for the current day and the previous 28 days to enable enforcement authorities to check compliance with EU drivers&#146; rules at the roadside. The regulations do not affect enforcement at the roadside. They are necessary to ensure that GB operators maintain sufficient records so that drivers&#146; hours checks can be undertaken by enforcement officers at operators&#146; premises.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000031"></a>Enforcement against non-Great Britain HGV operators is now easier and we have endeavoured to ensure that the burdens on courts are proportionate. The Road Safety Act 2006 introduced new measures to allow foreign offenders to be issued with on-the-spot fines. Those measures will enable VOSA and the police to issue fixed penalties to both UK and foreign offenders in respect of non-endorsable and endorsable offences. Where offenders cannot show that they have a satisfactory UK/GB address, they will be required to pay a deposit on the spot, equivalent to the level of the fixed penalty. Vehicles can be immobilised by the police or VOSA. The only case in which a driver or vehicle is prohibited  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC62"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from continuing a journey is if it seems likely that the driver will abscond or when they have declined to pay the requested financial deposit. The penalties will be graduated so that they reflect the severity of the number of offences committed and the scheme is equivalent to the on-the-spot fines levied by the enforcement agencies in most other member states.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000032"></a>I made reference to the south-east pilot. In recognition of concerns about the greater proportion of vehicles breaking the rules being those driven by drivers on international journeys, last year VOSA increased the level of roadside enforcement resources available in the south-east. The objective of that was to increase fivefold the number of vehicles checked at south-east ports, as compared with the previous financial year, and to double the number of vehicles on international journeys checked inland. That pilot resulted in a significant increase in the number of vehicles checked for roadworthiness and the number of prohibitions issued for non-compliance. Those prohibitions can have a fairly dramatic effect. The pilot has now been wheeled out nationwide.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000033"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, asked about the application of the requirement to fit a digital tachograph. My understanding is that the requirement applies only to new vehicles put into service from 1 May 2006; I think that that is the answer that the noble Lord is after. There is no mandatory requirement for operators to retro-fit older vehicles with a digital tachograph.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000034"></a>I have probably covered all the points raised. If I have not, Members of the Committee are free to ask again.</p>

<p><a name="08012267000035"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08012267000109"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> Will the Minister comment on why VOSA increased the number of vehicles checked, in terms of days worked in the year by drivers, from  1 per cent to 2 per cent? I just want an explanation for that; I am not necessarily against it.</p>

<p><a name="08012267000036"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08012267000110"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> The level of enforcement checks is laid down in EU legislation. Up to the end of last year, there was a minimum requirement check of 1 per cent of days worked by drivers, which was roughly 1.1 million tachograph charts per annum. From 1 January this year, this has increased to 2 per cent, which is roughly 2.2 million charts.</p>

<p><a name="08012267000037"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="08012267000111"></a>Lord Hanningfield:</b> What is the reason for doing that? As I say, I am not necessarily against it. Was it just to be more effective in checking vehicles?</p>

From the information that I gave earlier, it is clear that our enforcement activity is beginning to hit hard and show results. That is to the credit of the enforcement agency and, of course, means that we can have more confidence in continued improvements in driver standards, including, we hope, for those drivers not from the UK over the longer term.</p>

<h5><a name="08012267000100"></a>3.52 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08012267000040"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="08012267000113"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000041"></a>The noble Lord said: I start by setting out the purpose of this order. At present, the Financial Services Authority&#151;the FSA&#151;is responsible for regulating the sale of general insurance products, including travel insurance sold by insurers and insurance brokers. However, the sale of travel insurance products sold as a package alongside a holiday, which I will call &#147;connected travel insurance&#148;, was exempted from regulation when the Government implemented the EU&#146;s insurance mediation directive in 2002. Although this decision was based on a desire to control the regulatory burden, the Government were aware of concerns with this market and were committed to review that position in due course. Since then, there has been continuing concern that the unregulated position of connected travel insurance may mean that standards are lower, putting consumers at risk. Moreover, consumers have less protection and redress when buying insurance from an unregulated supplier.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000042"></a>In 2006, therefore, the Government launched a review into this issue and called for evidence. Last June, they announced their intention to extend the scope of FSA regulation to include the selling of connected travel insurance and published draft legislation and a consultation document. In December, they published a summary of the responses to that consultation and confirmed that regulation would be extended to connected travel insurance. The order before us puts that decision into effect by amending Article 72B of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 to limit the exemption set out in that article.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000043"></a>The order will mean that the exemption from FSA regulation no longer applies to the greater part of connected travel insurance. The exemption will, however, still continue to apply to insurance linked to an event where the travel is provided by the organiser of that event and to the hire of a vehicle that does not provide sleeping accommodation&#151;car hire is an obvious example. The Government are retaining these exemptions because they have not been made aware of any concerns relating to the sale of insurance in those markets.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000044"></a>I will now explain the reasoning behind the decision to limit this exemption and the reasons why I hope that the Committee will support this order. Travel insurance is an important product that offers both financial protection and peace of mind. However, it is not a comprehensive product. It is important that consumers understand under which circumstances they will and will not be covered. Travel insurance is also a relatively complex insurance product, which often provides medical, emergency, repatriation and liability cover.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000045"></a>As I said, in recent years there have been growing concerns from consumer groups and sections of the industry that the market is not working as well as it could. In 2006, a <I>Which?</I> survey found that only 35 per cent of 26 travel agents surveyed asked medical questions, only 19 per cent explained what the policy covered and no explanations were given of what the policy did not cover. In all cases, the disclosure standards of regulated banks and insurers selling the same product were far higher. Research commissioned by the British Insurance Brokers Association also found consistently higher standards of disclosure by regulated companies.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000046"></a>Promoting and ultimately requiring higher standards of disclosure across the board is an important reason to regulate. Not only should customers know what they are and are not buying, but one of the features of insurance law is that a policy can be voided if the customer has made incorrect or simply insufficient disclosures. Regulation is designed to reduce the risks of that happening. Perhaps even more important, if incorrect or insufficient disclosures occur under a regulated sale, consumers will have far greater options for redress and compensation than might otherwise be available. The Financial Ombudsman Service and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme provide a comprehensive dispute resolution service covering regulated companies with an upper compensatory limit of &#163;100,000.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000047"></a>This order, therefore, not only makes it less likely that things will go wrong but ensures that, if they do, customers are better protected. Protecting customers is the most important reason for the Government&#146;s decision to regulate, although there are others. Regulation will establish a level playing field for all insurance providers. Currently, I am sure that most consumers would find it bizarre that travel insurance is regulated when they buy it from insurance experts but not when they buy it from firms that specialise in travel.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000048"></a>However, we do not take decisions to regulate lightly. The decision has been carefully consulted on through the call for evidence in 2006 and the consultation document published in June 2007, to which the majority of responses called for regulation. The FSA published a consultation paper in December last year, which deals with the detailed issues of implementation. The Treasury Select Committee has also recommended FSA regulation. It said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012267000094"></a>&#147;We see merit in the introduction of a coherent and unified system of statutory regulation for the travel insurance market and we believe that the FSA is best-placed to deliver such a system&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000049"></a>Throughout the process, the concerns that I know exist in the connected travel insurance industry have been considered, but let me explain why we have decided to regulate. First, I know that some will say that there is not a problem to address, or that, if there is, regulation will not resolve it. The Government believe that the evidence suggests that there is a problem to address and that FSA-regulated firms do a better job in product disclosure and navigating the consumer through the sales process. As I said, regulation would also make a difference by providing better rights to redress.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC65"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000050"></a>Secondly, it has been argued that regulation is disproportionate and would be burdensome for the travel industry&#151;something that we consider carefully. The Government believe that the benefits of this change outweigh the costs and that this is therefore proportionate. Although only a small percentage of travel insurance policies are claimed on&#151;about 4 per cent&#151;it is vital that when claims do arise, often when the consumer is stranded in a foreign country, consumers know what their level of cover is, that their claim will not be denied and that they will have proper compensation if things go wrong.</p>
<h5><a name="08012267000101"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000051"></a>The details of the cost-benefit calculation are set out in the regulatory impact assessment published last month alongside the summary of responses to the June 2007 consultation, and the FSA is currently consulting to ensure that its regime is proportionate and risk-based. It is also important to remember that travel companies will not have to become regulated if they choose not to do so. They can instead become an appointed representative, with a regulated firm responsible for them; an introducer appointed representative, which allows them to direct customers to an authorised seller; or an unauthorised introducer.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000052"></a>The final argument sometimes used against regulation is that travel firms will simply stop offering insurance and that consumers will therefore not buy it at all. It is certainly important that we do not discourage people from taking out the appropriate insurance, but this argument may be misleading for two reasons. First, travel insurance is a highly competitive market, with many easily accessible consumer outlets, including banks, post offices, brokers and internet and phone sales. Over the past few years, more and more consumers have been taking advantage of these extensive outlets. Secondly, as I have outlined, even if travel companies choose not to offer insurance themselves, they will still be able to direct their customers to regulated providers; in fact, they are required to advise consumers on the availability of travel insurance under the existing package travel regulations.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000053"></a>In conclusion, this decision has been taken after comprehensive consultation and careful consideration. We are committed to regulating only where necessary and only where the benefits outweigh the costs. In this case, they do. The current FSA consultation should also ensure that regulation is brought in in a proportionate and risk-based way. As I have said, the order will improve consumer protection. It will make mis-selling less likely, increase standards of vital disclosures and provide better routes for redress and compensation. It will also level the regulatory playing field across this competitive sector. I therefore hope that noble Lords will agree to this important change and support the order. I beg to move.</p>

Even those on the extreme wing of the consumerist agenda could not claim that travel insurance is one of the great wrongs in society waiting to be righted by yet more regulation.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000056"></a>In 2003, after the Government consulted on the insurance mediation directive, they concluded that in the regulation of travel agents selling travel insurance there was insufficient evidence for gold-plating the directive and increasing the regulatory burden. At that stage, the Treasury found little evidence of consumer detriment and no evidence whatever of systematic actual consumer detriment. Somehow, however, three years later in 2006, the Government reached the view that there were,</p>
<ul><a name="08012267000097"></a>&#147;growing concerns from consumer groups and sections of the industry that the market is not working as well as it could&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012267000091"></a>The source of those concerns was not spelled out, but as is so often the case the Government&#146;s action opened Pandora&#146;s box, which led inexorably to more regulation.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000057"></a>The Treasury Select Committee in another place carried out its own inquiries. The summary of its report, issued in February last year, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012267000095"></a>&#147;We conclude that there is significant evidence of consumer detriment in the travel insurance market&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012267000092"></a>However, that comment was aimed at the insurance industry overall, as the criticisms generally concerned consumer awareness of exclusions and the effects of pre-existing medical conditions. When the Select Committee considered the narrower area of bundle travel insurance, paragraph 19 of the detailed report said only that the committee had received &#147;some evidence&#148; of significant consumer detriment. Needless to say, in the Select Committee, the consumer groups were keen to press regulation as a solution, as were some organisations in the insurance industry, doubtless on the grounds that if they had to suffer regulation, others should as well. I fully expect my noble friend Lord Sheikh, who has much experience in the insurance industry, to tell us its view.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000058"></a>I cannot see anywhere in the Government&#146;s papers or the Treasury Select Committee&#146;s report any strong evidence to support the imposition of further regulation. We start from the principle that legislation should be considered only when other approaches have demonstrably failed. We have not seen any evidence of widespread failure of the current arrangements, although there are plenty of assertions about the extent of that failure. The <I>Which?</I> report cited by the Minister was based on a very small sample, and complaints levels within the travel industry are generally very low. Therefore, we cannot see the case for the heavy-handed regulatory response in this order.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000059"></a>Even the largely risible regulatory impact assessment does not make a case for regulation. The regulatory option is expected to impose one-off costs of up to &#163;8.1 million and an annual cost of up to &#163;5.1 million, and it is expected to yield benefits worth &#163;173 million. The option of strengthened self-regulation will accrue 80 per cent of those benefits, up to &#163;138 million, at a   


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC67"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC67</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>negligible one-off cost and a maximum annual cost of &#163;1.5 million. I thought that the benefit calculations in the regulatory impact assessment were in cloud-cuckoo-land, but, if we take them at face value, the Government&#146;s figures suggest that improved self-regulation is a no-brainer. On a best-estimate basis, the net present value of the net benefit of regulation compared with improved self-regulation is less than &#163;3 million, which is well within the margins of error.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000060"></a>The Government&#146;s regulatory solution will bear down heavily on small firms, which is the very thing that the Government keep promising that they will not do. Many travel agents and tour operators are very small businesses operating on slender margins. The vast majority of the members of the Association of British Travel Agents are small businesses. ABTA believes that regulation will drive many more companies out of providing travel insurance alongside travel products. That is what happened when ABTA&#146;s self-regulatory mechanisms were sharpened up after 2002. The Minister hopes otherwise, but that is just hope. If fewer travel businesses sell travel insurance alongside travel products, that will tend to increase the number of people travelling without insurance&#151;it is currently estimated that around 14 per cent of travellers do so&#151;which is in direct conflict with the Government&#146;s policy, as promoted by the Foreign Office, that those who travel abroad should have cover.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000061"></a>There is another reason to cast doubt on the Government&#146;s judgment in bringing forward this order. The Treasury Select Committee in another place recommended that regulation be carried out by the Financial Services Authority if the Government were satisfied that the FSA could meet the requirements of consistency across the travel insurance market and of being principles-and-risk-based. The Government&#146;s response was that they were so satisfied. However, the report and the response were written ahead of the Northern Rock debacle last summer. While we do not yet have a full picture of the precise failings of the FSA, it is clear that it did fail. How else can the FSA explain the lack of, or inadequate, monitoring of solvency? Anybody who visits the City will find views, often very strongly expressed, about the FSA&#146;s other failings in banking supervision and its other activities. The FSA is not an organisation on top of its role and therefore able to expand its regulatory functions. It might be willing to do so, but that is not the point. The regulation of travel insurance is clearly not a top priority for any Government. At best, the FSA is overburdened; at worst, it needs a major overhaul. It borders on lunacy for the Government to pile on to such an organisation something that may be in the &#147;nice to have&#148; category of regulation but could not be placed any higher than that.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000062"></a>It is not too late for the Government to think again about the impact on the FSA. It is not too late for them to reconsider whether they have properly considered the impact on small firms. It is not too late to stop adding yet more examples of gold-plating to that long list of embellished EU directives. I hope that the Minister will say that the Government are prepared to think again.</p>

I was clearly far too naive and had underestimated the ability of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, to find fault with this order.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000064"></a>The noble Baroness and I agree that the aims of the regulatory regime are worth while, in that it is important that firms are fit and proper and properly resourced; that their staff are competent to undertake the business that they do; that consumers get clear, concise and consistent information about the products; and that if things go wrong consumers are able to seek redress. So far, so good&#151;I suspect that all of us are of that view. The question is then what is the best way of ensuring that that is the case.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000065"></a>I was rather surprised to see in the regulatory impact assessment the estimate that currently 25 per cent of policies are mis-sold. That is a very high figure. If it is true&#151;and the statement claims that the figure has been arrived at on the basis of evidence provided by ABTA, the British Insurance Brokers Association and <I>Which?</I>&#151;this is a strong prima facie case for statutory regulation as provided for in the measure that we are discussing today. If we assume that the assumptions are correct, the potential benefits of the measure are significant. I would therefore be grateful if the Minister could reassure me, even if he is incapable of reassuring the noble Baroness, that these figures are robust; the whole case for regulation rests on that. If they are, the case for the order is made.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000066"></a>In my experience, insurance connected to travel is not properly taken into account by many vulnerable people who are buying a package with an insurance element attached. I am not thinking of myself; I am thinking of my mother and her friends, who go on coach tours around the UK. I know, because I fill in the forms for her, that travel insurance is attached. I am pretty sure that, by and large, that group of people is not spending a lot of time looking at the travel insurance small print. It is therefore important that they are reassured that that insurance is being sold properly, that they are not being overcharged and that it covers the things that they expect it to.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000067"></a>I am supportive of the principle of effective regulation. I am not opposed in principle to this being done via the FSA; that is what the FSA is there for. We have the FSA because self-regulation has frankly failed in many cases. This should be a small addition to the overall work of the FSA. I always share the noble Baroness&#146;s concern when we are adding burdens to the FSA, because it is an overburdened body. However, we are doing so because we have found scandals in the selling of financial service products in area after area. That is why we have so much regulation in this area. It is not a question of the Government, any of the opposition parties or the FSA empire building for the sake of it. It is because consumers have been consistently misled across whole swathes of the population and across a whole raft of financial services products. Therefore, although I

<h5><a name="08012267000102"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08012267000068"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08012267000116"></a>Lord Sheikh:</b> I declare an interest as the chairman and chief executive of an insurance broking organisation. I have been a director of the British Insurance Brokers Association and previously was a regional chairman. I welcome the order and I strongly support the regulation of travel firms that sell travel insurance in connection with a travel product. I should like to set the scene by highlighting some salient statistics about the travel insurance market, with which, no doubt, Members of the Committee are familiar.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000069"></a>First, in 2006, 21 million travel insurance policies were purchased, making a total premium income of &#163;670 million. Secondly, it is believed that only 66 per cent of people buy travel insurance when they go away. Finally, it seems hard to obtain an accurate picture of the number or value of policies bought from travel firms, because the figures are different, depending on which organisation is quoting the figures. The Association of British Travel Agents believes that the travel industry&#146;s share of the travel insurance market is about 25 per cent.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000070"></a>I support this amendment to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 for many reasons. I shall briefly outline what I believe to be the main arguments in its favour. The Financial Services Authority has four statutory objectives, one of which is consumer protection and securing the appropriate degree of protection for consumers. The existing regulatory system for the insurance industry excludes travel insurance sold by travel agents and tour operators. Therefore, it does not provide protection to all consumers. The fact that consumers are given varying levels of protection depending on where they choose to buy the insurance is unsatisfactory. To allow the FSA to achieve its aim of protecting consumers, the sale of connected travel insurance must be brought within the scope of FSA regulation. </p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000071"></a>Currently, unregulated travel agents and tour operators are not obliged to outline the cover, terms, conditions and exclusions of the policies being sold. In December 2006, the British Insurance Brokers Association commissioned research, the results of which are startling. For example, 72 per cent of consumers buying travel insurance from a travel agent were not advised whether their policy included terrorism cover. Consumers buying products that they do not fully understand could result in consumer detriment, which is evidenced by customers making claims on their policies unaware that cover is not in place for the incident or loss in question. It is also vital that consumers are made aware of how to make a claim under the policy, as this can vary depending on the section of the policy to which the claim relates. There is no obligation for travel firms to highlight this, which may be detrimental at present.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000072"></a>Bringing travel firms into the existing regulatory environment would compel them to abide by the  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC70"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC70</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>FSA&#146;s insurance conduct of business rules. Those rules ensure that customers are provided with such information to allow them to make an informed decision when buying insurance; the rules outline what information must be disclosed to a client as part of the sales process. That will result in consumers making educated decisions and reduce the risk of consumer detriment. Consumers must also be made aware that travel insurance is specifically designed for short periods and particular scenarios and is not to be seen as an alternative for private medical cover, home insurance or personal accident insurance.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000073"></a>Full FSA regulation of travel agents and tour operators will give consumers who buy travel insurance from one of those firms access to the Financial Ombudsman Service, an independent dispute resolution service. Furthermore, consumers will have access to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which protects consumers in the event of an insurance company being unable to meet its financial responsibility to clients. Allowing customers recourse to both the FOS and the FSCS is, in my opinion, an important protection mechanism. I also point out that creating protection for people buying travel insurance from a travel firm will serve to enhance the reputation of travel insurance policies over time. In return, it is hoped that that will help to increase the number of people who purchase this important form of insurance.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000074"></a>It is also important that such regulation of an industry does not create a competitive disadvantage for any group of businesses. The system in place at the moment clearly does not achieve that. Travel firms selling travel insurance have a clear advantage over insurance intermediaries and brokers selling the same products. Travel firms do not have any compliance costs, whereas brokers and intermediaries do. The proposal before us will address that imbalance and ensure that all firms operate on a level playing field.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000075"></a>Throughout the discussions on the regulation of travel firms, significant time has been devoted to the cost of compliance for those businesses. It is worth noting that many travel firms receive in excess of  25 per cent commission on each policy that they sell. In the light of that, I believe that the costs associated with regulation will not have a significant impact on those firms and, as such, cannot be used as a reason not to regulate travel agents and tour operators.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000076"></a>Several options are available to travel firms that do not wish to become directly authorised by the FSA. They can form relationships with existing regulatory firms by becoming appointed representatives, introducer appointed representatives or simple introducers. Each of those options would reduce the compliance costs involved with regulation while still ensuring that the standards remain high. In light of the reasons that I have outlined before the Committee, I support the order in its current form and wish to see it adopted.</p>

<p><a name="08012267000077"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08012267000117"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to all who have contributed to the short debate and to the two noble Lords in particular.

I certainly did not underestimate her, nor did I fail to predict that gold-plating would emerge at some stage in the discussion, as well as the Financial Services Authority and Northern Rock. The noble Baroness has deployed her case with her usual skill but, as I hope to convince the Committee, not with sufficient conviction.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000078"></a>Let me make it absolutely clear that when we implemented the directive in 2003, we wanted, as it will be appreciated, to keep the regulatory burden at an absolute minimum, which is why we did not include provisions covered by the order. We brought forward the order on the basis of the weight of evidence that has emerged over the three years. We did so not because we are enthusiastic about adding burdens to industry&#151;far from it; the Government stay committed to light-touch, minimum regulation&#151;but because we must regulate where discerned and defined difficulties occur.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000079"></a>The noble Baroness suggested that the Treasury Select Committee in the other place expressed little anxiety about the position. However, it said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012267000096"></a>&#147;In the context of meeting the challenges that face the travel insurance industry and those who sell travel insurance, we observe that there is evidence to suggest that problems in the sales process are likely to be accentuated when sales take place away from the professional regulated insurance environment through an intermediary such as a travel agent&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012267000093"></a>That was the burden of the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh. He identified where consumers could be at risk if they did not deal with a proper agent who knew exactly what insurance terms should obtain and did not ask the right questions.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000080"></a>It is quite difficult to buy insurance and then commit oneself to reading the very small print. Yet the very small print is often the absolute essence of what the insurance offers. It is all too easy, particularly in a widening market where inevitably there are many players, for seductive arguments to produce the necessary impetus for the consumer to take up the offer, who then perhaps neglects the essential aspect of being sure that the insurance does what it says.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000081"></a>The problem with travel insurance, as I indicated in my opening remarks, is that being inadequately covered can be quite disastrous, because the issues come to light only when one is already stranded abroad. We are all too well aware that, because we benefit from certain healthcare provisions in this country and have reciprocal arrangements in the European Community and with a number of other Administrations, it is easy for people to assume that they do not need to be absolutely clear about the policy or absolutely sure about the authenticity of the person who is selling it. They then go to somewhere such as the United States where medical costs can prove to be absolutely crippling when things go wrong and they are utterly inadequately covered.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000082"></a>I appreciate the noble Baroness&#146;s argument that we should be careful about regulation, but the Government have demonstrated their care. We did not regulate in this area after the first initiative in 2003 and we have come to this position only as a result of evidence that has been produced. I mentioned the Treasury Select

The noble Baroness will therefore recognise that we are motivated not by the wish to regulate but by a clear and defined need.</p>

<p><a name="08012267000083"></a>I do not need to repeat the arguments or the statistics that the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, gave to the Committee. One of the benefits of this House is that someone such as he, who has vast experience and detailed knowledge of an industry of this kind, can make as good a job of understanding the issues as the Government. I cast no aspersions on the team that supports me; it is absolutely excellent. I would regale the Committee with a vast battery of statistics at this stage, but the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, has largely presented the case for the order in detail and in such a way that I need not detain the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="08012267000084"></a>I need to address the question of this being a distraction for the Financial Services Authority, with some noble Lords saying that it has other big fish to fry. Of course it does. How could one not be aware  of the challenges facing the Financial Services Authority, given the circumstances in which we have had the Northern Rock situation over the past five or six months, which has dominated a great deal of the financial and economic agenda? To suggest that this small amount of additional regulation will break the back of the Financial Services Authority&#146;s capacity to cope with its work stretches things somewhat far. It will be recognised that the scope of the legislation is very limited. We think that an extension is necessary, but we do not have the slightest doubt about the capacity of the FSA to monitor this position, and no one who has suggested regulation has indicated that a major problem might be the Government&#146;s ability to guarantee that their regulatory authority would not be up to the job.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000085"></a>On other challenges, I will listen to the noble Baroness, as I am obliged to. Some of the big challenges will not go away in the short term, as she well knows. In an area such as this, to suggest that, because a body has a major issue before it, it cannot be expected to have the regulatory capacity for a relatively marginal issue such as this is stretching credulity too far. Will small firms go under because of this additional regulatory burden?</p>

<p><a name="08012267000086"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08012267000118"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> I always like to make sure that the Minister is answering the points that I make. I did not at any point suggest that any small firm would go under; I suggested that small firms would not carry on doing travel insurance.</p>

Her point is important and we want to encourage the take-up of travel insurance. The percentage to which the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, referred, is a great worry. A far too high percentage of people travel without cover; they are taking conspicuous risks. I agree with her that the objective is not in any way to reduce the availability of travel insurance, nor to produce a disincentive to participation.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000088"></a>As far as travel firms are concerned, this issue is a small element in their overall operations; the profit dimension is between 1 per cent and 2 per cent. Therefore, I do not think that one is saying that regulation in this area would be the straw that breaks the back of an organisation or causes it to recast its position. It is essential that those who provide travel insurance are capable of providing the product that fulfils the intended purpose. The consumer needs support in this area. After all, it will be recognised on all sides that insurance is one of the more complex consumer goods to purchase. With a great deal of other consumer goods, the guarantees are all too clear, although the small print on guarantees regarding direct consumer goods needs to be looked at carefully. With insurance, it is notoriously difficult for people to be sure of the range of their coverage; we all know the nature of exemptions and excess clauses, which present difficulties of understanding. We want the providers to be fully qualified and regulated and to give an effective service.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08012267000089"></a>We maintain that we have sufficient evidence after several years that there is a problem here in which a small additional burden of regulation, which is well within the capacity of government and which the industry is readily able to bear, creating fairness across the industry and all companies involved in travel provision, merits action being taken. Therefore, I hope that noble Lords will support the order.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="08012274000001"></a>Electricity and Gas (Carbon Emissions Reduction) Order 2008</h3>
<h5><a name="08012274000031"></a>4.35 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08012274000002"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08012274000033"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Rooker)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Electricity and Gas (Carbon Emissions Reduction) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000003"></a>The noble Lord said: The order places on electricity and gas suppliers an overall target for reduction of carbon emissions in the household sector in Great Britain, known as the carbon emissions reduction target, or CERT; while I do not generally use acronyms, because of the constant reference to this I will say &#147;CERT&#148; from now on. We held extensive informal consultations with a wide range of stakeholders on the development of the CERT, culminating in the issue of formal consultations in May 2007.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000004"></a>The CERT is planned to run from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2011 and will build on the success of the previous two phases of the energy efficiency commitment, with the current phase ending in March this year. Gas and electricity suppliers will meet their targets by encouraging and assisting household consumers to take up carbon abatement measures, specifically the promotion of measures for the following purposes: achieving improvements in energy efficiency; increasing the amount of electricity generated or heat produced by microgeneration; increasing the amount of heat produced by any plant that relies wholly or mainly on wood; and reducing energy consumption. By reducing  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC74"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>carbon emissions and using energy more efficiently, household consumers will have the opportunity to reduce their carbon footprint, lower their fuel costs or be able to enjoy greater comfort.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000005"></a>The main aim of the CERT is to make a significant contribution in the household sector to the United Kingdom&#146;s targets and ambitions under the climate change programme. The CERT will have an overall target of 154 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over its lifetime. That is equivalent to annual net savings of 4.2 million tonnes by 2010, which is equivalent to the emissions from 700,000 homes each year. This will build on the 2.9 million tonnes of CO2 that we expect to be delivered by the previous phases of the energy efficiency commitment.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000006"></a>The CERT will also give particular help to low-income consumers and the elderly, who spend a larger proportion of their income on energy or are more vulnerable. Energy suppliers will be required to achieve at least 40 per cent of their target by directing activity at householders in receipt of income or disability benefits or tax or pension credits. In order to ensure a focus on the most vulnerable members of our communities, we have also included all those customers aged 70 or over. The CERT will also introduce a new priority group flexibility option, which will support energy suppliers that wish to focus some of their CERT activity with low-income customers on those who are especially vulnerable or at risk of fuel poverty, using measures that will make a real practical difference for those hard-to-treat households. We expect that these new approaches will allow the CERT to contribute effectively to the alleviation of fuel poverty. On 6 December, the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy fifth annual report was published. It sets out our wider approach to tackling fuel poverty in the UK.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000007"></a>We also want to ensure that we are ready for the carbon reduction challenges ahead. The CERT will introduce creative and significant support for innovation, offering space for energy suppliers to explore and experiment with totally new routes for carbon abatement in the household sector, including specific encouragement for microgeneration activity. The order sets an overall obligation on all relevant electricity and gas suppliers of 154 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over the lifetime. This is a challenging target at about twice the level of the current energy efficiency commitment, but we believe that it is achievable and will drive the effective promotion of carbon reductions in the household sector.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000008"></a>The cost of meeting the obligation will fall on energy suppliers. However, we expect that, even if suppliers pass those costs on in full to customers, that would be no more than about &#163;105 per household for the three years of the programme, or about 70p a week. Those costs are balanced by a range of direct and indirect benefits. We expect the average ongoing financial benefit for consumers, in terms of lower energy bills or increased comfort, to be about &#163;29 per year for the lifetime of the measures installed, which could be up to 40 years in the case of cavity wall insulation, for example. An equivalent measure would be to fit four energy saving light bulbs, which, over their lifetime, would pay for the cost.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000009"></a>The regulator, Ofgem, is responsible for administration of the CERT. The order provides the framework for Ofgem to set the targets for individual electricity and gas suppliers and to monitor their progress in achieving them. Ofgem will also be responsible for enforcement. We intend to monitor the continuing development of the CERT. Ofgem is required to report annually to the Secretary of State on suppliers&#146; progress towards achieving their targets. We want to help and support householders in understanding and reducing their carbon footprint. The CERT will be an important part of this process and will sit effectively with other major policies and initiatives aimed at meeting our climate change ambitions in this sector.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000010"></a>Looking to the future, the Government have already made a commitment to some form of supplier obligation after the CERT to at least 2020. The new flexibilities introduced with the CERT, including new routes for innovation and for working with those most vulnerable in our society, will offer the opportunity to prepare effectively for new approaches.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000011"></a>I hope that the Committee will agree to the Motion. I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, who has given me advance notice of some of his questions. I am happy to set out some of the answers before he speaks, so that he can comment on them later.</p>

<h5><a name="08012274000032"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08012274000015"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="08012274000036"></a>Earl Cathcart:</b> I thank the Minister for introducing this order. From our debates on the Climate Change Bill, I know that he shares my interest in reducing carbon emissions. While the Bill is setting out the framework for the effort to stem climate change, orders of this kind are the nuts and bolts. Thus, I welcome the opportunity to debate this order.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000016"></a>Under this Government, emissions have risen. There is no chance of the Government meeting their target of a 20 per cent reduction of CO2 by 2010. Scrutiny is therefore important. We need to ensure that opportunities for improvement are not missed, so it is important that the potential benefit of some of the provisions in this instrument are realised. The carbon emissions reduction target could play an important role in emissions reduction. Indeed, the housing stock in this country accounts for 27 per cent of our CO2 emissions. Targeting housing, then, is a welcome step.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC76"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC76</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000017"></a>The CERT will build on the energy efficiency commitment, which stimulated tremendous investment&#151;&#163;600 million&#151;in energy efficiency. The net benefits to householders are estimated to be over &#163;3 billion. This can claim to be a success. However, I remain sceptical about the way in which the Government are rolling out a scheme and trying to stimulate microgeneration. The goal in all our efforts to stop climate change is to reduce emissions and to secure for the UK a genuinely greener energy sector. Thus, we must not be, as was said in another place, too quick to pick winners in the mix of available technologies. Reducing carbon emissions through the various microgeneration technologies that are allowed to be used by suppliers under this order is by no means bad in its own right. However, it skews the market towards a narrow way of thinking about reductions. There does not seem to be enough to stimulate real investment in further green technology that could provide potentially much greater benefits.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000018"></a>The point here is one of emphasis. Does the Minister think that enough has been done with this instrument to encourage innovation? If we are to tackle the problem of climate change, there needs to be nothing short of a revolution in energy supply. Does the Minister see this order as the best example of encouraging the necessary innovation? Suppliers can currently claim back 50 per cent if they make market transformative actions. Will the Minister explain what constitutes a market transformative action? What standards are used to judge this? Does he think that it is adequate to encourage suppliers to innovate?</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000019"></a>My concern is that there does not seem to be a clear enough mechanism for making a real change to energy supply. There seems to be a risk that suppliers will focus on the cheapest short-term solutions that tick the box; that is, even if the targets can be met, that will be done in such a way that suppliers are locked into a higher-carbon method of providing energy than they would be if serious emphasis were placed on greater capacity for innovation.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000020"></a>The order places an overall target for reduction in carbon emissions in the household sector on energy suppliers. The regulation, enforcement and determination of what measures can be used to meet the targets will be the responsibility of Ofgem. This is also a cause for concern. The report of the Government&#146;s own Sustainable Development Commission, <I>Lost in Transmission</I><I>?</I>, calls for huge changes to the structure of Ofgem to ensure that it prioritises the transition to low-carbon energy supply. Has the fact that a large regulatory burden is placed on a body that has been criticised by this report been considered? Has the report been considered and have the necessary changes been made to Ofgem? The accountability of the suppliers to Ofgem and of Ofgem to the Government is unclear in this instrument. Could the Minister explain the mechanism that will ensure that suppliers are accountable to Ofgem?</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000021"></a>As the instrument stands, we will not know the progress that suppliers are making towards the targets for a three-year period. Article 22 requires Ofgem to determine whether or not a supplier has met its obligations regarding emissions cuts. The cuts must occur between 1 April 2008 and 31 March 2011, after  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC77"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which Ofgem will present a report to the Secretary of State. Can Ofgem intervene, if progress is not being made to meet these obligations? Will there be any interim reporting? Is there any mechanism to ensure that the efforts made by the suppliers will be on course with meeting their obligations? What if suppliers do not meet the overall targets?</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000022"></a>When the CERT was put out for consultation, grave concerns were expressed by some of those who would be involved, particularly regarding the targets, which some respondents considered very challenging. There was concern about the fact that there might be significant costs to consumers. What will happen if consumers do not get on board? Does the Minister think that there is a need to increase customers&#146; willingness to participate in the scheme through incentives or marketing? There was also concern that Defra&#146;s estimation of the costs had been too low. Consumer participation seems to be essential in ensuring that this works. If the burden on the consumer is considerable, there will be no scope without further incentives to encourage microgeneration or other types of innovation. Considering the scepticism of the consultation, what further measures have been taken to ensure that the targets are feasible?</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000023"></a>I also wish to express some concerns regarding fuel poverty. The energy providers will be obliged to achieve 40 per cent of their reductions by promoting measures to those on benefits and tax credits and to householders over 70. In the consultations, energy suppliers and climate change groups considered this target to be unachievable. Has the fact that this target has already been deemed unrealistic been taken into account? How are the energy suppliers to identify the priority group in the first place? I know that my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding may speak to this part of the statutory instrument. None the less, I want to mention the lack of clarity surrounding just how this group is going to be reached. Is the Minister convinced that enough people will volunteer for this scheme? Will energy companies be obliged to spend money advertising that there are schemes for those on benefits?</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000024"></a>We must ensure that the benefits of this instrument will be long-term benefits. For example, this is supposed to promote microgeneration, but are there provisions that allow for small generation to sell back to the grid? Are there any price-controlling mechanisms to ensure that small generators can prove to be a worthwhile investment?</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000025"></a>It would be a cruel fate to see measures such as these, with so much potential to make a real step towards stimulating green energy and energy reduction in this country, being scuppered by quick-fix solutions and ineffective accountability. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="08012274000026"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08012274000037"></a>Lord Redesdale:</b> We on this side also welcome the statutory instrument, especially the provisions for microgeneration and fuel poverty, which, given the recent rise in gas prices, will be very necessary for a growing proportion of the population.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000027"></a>The order omits to mention boilers, which are the most important generators of carbon in the domestic sector. It talks about insulation, which is a worthy and  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC78"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cost-effective way of keeping the heat in. It talks about cavity wall insulation, which is also needed, as vast numbers of properties do not have it. However, boilers have been neglected in this sphere, which seems rather strange, because boilers emit the carbon in the first place. Inefficient boilers, such as the 4 million G-rated boilers in this country, which account for 75 per cent of the energy produced through water heating and space heating, are an area where improvement could reap vast rewards in terms of carbon.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000028"></a>The Climate Change Bill is going through the House at the moment. While microgeneration is being given a degree of support in the order, just replacing G-rated boilers would ensure a much more effective reduction in carbon dioxide. That could be done by using EPCs&#151;another flagship policy of the Government&#151;through the HIPs to look at the state of boilers in every home. EPCs are of course carried out at the point of sale, but that does not have to be the case; many of the energy companies could carry out an EPC for any property in which they wished to install energy efficiency methods. The CERT could then be used towards replacing G-rated boilers. A G-rated boiler has a pilot light. I learnt a great deal about boilers recently, but I did not realise that a pilot light sticks 10 per cent of the energy straight up the chimney, with no benefit to the consumer at all. Removing the 4 million G-rated boilers, with a resulting 10 per cent efficiency gain on each and every one, would be a helpful method of vastly reducing the carbon dioxide.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000029"></a>One good thing about the statutory instrument is that it gives Ofgem the flexibility to look at these issues. One of the reasons why I make this point is that, although I know that Ofgem is interested in looking at this and can bring about the changes, I very much hope that there is a mood change within Defra to look at boilers, because the letters that we have received from Ministers until now have questioned the value of replacing G-rated boilers. The big problem with those boilers is that they are so simple that they rarely break down and you can keep them going for ages. I have a G-rated boiler, which I am about to change. However, my gas fitter turned around and said, &#147;What a fabulous boiler. They&#146;re so easy to maintain, this will go on for ever. They don&#146;t break down. You shouldn&#146;t get rid of this&#148;. Of course that is fairly disastrous in carbon terms.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08012274000030"></a>In the area of fuel poverty, many older people will have a G-rated boiler that they will nurse for many decades because of the cost of replacing it. The CERT could be a way of giving a grant towards replacing these boilers, which would vastly reduce the amount of carbon dioxide. I therefore very much hope that the Minister can say that he will look flexibly at this and that Defra officials will start doing the work to realise that this is a good thing.</p>

<p><a name="08012287000002"></a>I start my speech with a quotation from <I>Hansard</I>. As the Minister noted, I have given him notice of this. On 26 April, there was an exchange on the Floor of the House about fuel poverty. The questions were answered by the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, who was then a government Whip. I asked him what the point was,</p>
<ul><a name="08012287000039"></a>&#147;of setting targets for the gas and electricity suppliers to help families in fuel poverty if they are denied the information to know who they are&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012287000024"></a>The noble Lord answered by saying,</p>
<ul><a name="08012287000040"></a>&#147;the noble Lord makes a valid point. We are working on sharing data, but we must bear in mind issues such as the Data Protection Act and the protection of individuals&#146; information. We are, however, working on sharing data between government departments to ensure that we target better those who need support. We are working actively to achieve that&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 26/4/07; col. 758.]</ul>
<p><a name="08012287000025"></a>I ask the Committee to concentrate on the words &#147;between government departments&#148;, because it is not government departments that need to share information. Indeed, a huge amount of information is already shared between them. The order puts obligations on the supplier industries, which are the ones that must target households. Exactly the same question was asked last week when the order was debated in another place. Mr Phil Woolas, the Minister who replied to my honourable friend Greg Barker, did not even attempt to answer the question about how the industry was to get the names and addresses.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000003"></a>I remind noble Lords, and emphasise the point that the Minister outlined very clearly, that at least 40 per cent of the carbon emissions reduction obligation must be achieved by action carried out in the priority group. Article 2 defines &#147;priority group&#148; as those who get benefits or tax credits as listed in Schedule 2, have the relevant income of &#163;15,592 or less or are at least 70 years old. I was interested that the Minister said that that last group is the most vulnerable. I fear that I have to declare an interest, as I come into that group. I am over 70, as is my wife, but I had not hitherto regarded myself as vulnerable, although I recognise that there are many pensioners who are.</p>
<h5><a name="08012287000043"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="80122-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000004"></a>The Minister explained that the order doubles the level of energy emissions to be saved from the household sector as compared with the previous EEC target. That has nothing to do with the European Community; it is the energy efficiency commitment. The Minister&#146;s honourable friend in another place called it &#147;eek&#148;. I shall not call it &#147;eek&#148; because I think EEC is best. Given this major increase in the overall target and, within that, the 40 per cent target to come from the priority group, it seems clear that considerable difficulties will be created for energy suppliers. Indeed, my inquiries have revealed that they are already facing considerable difficulties, even before this order.</p>

<p><a name="08012287000005"></a>My first port of call to find out what the Government are going to do about this was the Explanatory Memorandum that accompanies this order. To my astonishment, it runs to no fewer than  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC80"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC80</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>79 pages; it is a substantial document. Note A of that document, which runs from page 51 to page 57, spells out in considerable detail how many households are in the priority group. The figure for households on benefit is 8.5 million. If the over-70s are added&#151;regardless of income, as the order makes clear&#151;the total comes to 11.2 million target households in the priority group. However, there is nothing in all 79 pages of the Explanatory Memorandum about the problem faced by the industries in identifying which these 11.2 million households are. Even if one looks at Annexe A, &#147;Brief Summary of Consultation Responses&#148;, there is no reference to the problems faced by the industry. It is said that those responsible for the practical delivery of measures,</p>
<ul><a name="08012287000041"></a>&#147;considered that the proposed 40% priority group obligation was not achievable&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08012287000026"></a>but their view that one of the main reasons why it is non-achievable is the difficulty in identifying the target households is completely ignored.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000006"></a>When I started consulting the industry, a different picture emerged. I started with the Energy Retail Association. It provided a valuable brief on the Energy Bill, which has been introduced in another place, entitled <I>Fuel Poverty, Social Tariffs &amp; Vulnerable Customers. </I>Section 8 is headed, &#147;Government needs to share data with industry on vulnerable customers&#148;, and starts:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012287000033"></a>&#147;Identifying vulnerable and fuel poor customers has always been a challenge for the industry, and it is keen to share more data with Government Departments to help improve targeting&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012287000027"></a>In a recent press release, the chairman of the Energy Retail Association said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012287000034"></a>&#147;It is crucial that the support available is reaching the right people. Energy suppliers offer a wide range of help for vulnerable and older people to help them reduce their bills, but they have no information to identify those households&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012287000028"></a>I find it astonishing that that did not figure among the representations in response to the consultation and does not figure in what the department chose to put in its summary of those consultations.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000007"></a>So we are already facing a considerable difficulty. However, it is not all hopeless. I am told that last year there was a small pilot scheme run jointly by the industry, the Department for Work and Pensions and DBERR. It apparently did not involve Defra; when I asked, I was told that Defra does not seem to have been involved. This pilot scheme in England and Scotland was seen as a special project. Certain limited information about some of the most seriously vulnerable customers, 250,000 of them, was involved. That represents about 0.02 per cent of the 11.2 million that I referred to earlier.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000008"></a>The industry pays for the mailshot, which the Department for Work and Pensions sends out to the target households, including a coupon and a freephone helpline; the industry responds when customers return the coupon or phone in. The pilot scheme was regarded as a success and I think that it was a promising initiative. I therefore ask the Minister whether it will be, in the Government&#146;s favourite phrase, rolled out to more than 0.02 per cent of the priority group. If so, when? When will there be a report on that pilot scheme?</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC81"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC81</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000009"></a>Having discovered all that from the trade association, I went to two of the suppliers. I buy my gas from British Gas, which I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, passed my boiler the other day as extremely efficient. At the end of its press release after it had to put up its prices by 15 per cent, it made a good deal of what it does for poor customers. It quoted a report from Energywatch that said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012287000035"></a>&#147;British Gas has and will have made the most significant voluntary commitment to measures to reduce the impact of fuel bills on its vulnerable customers&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012287000010"></a>I got straight on to British Gas and asked how it did it. Its spokesperson, an extremely capable young lady, immediately responded and I met her yesterday. The main message is that the whole situation has been very difficult since the EEC started. She went on to describe what British Gas in fact does, a good deal of which is just advertising and blanket leafleting. However, it also goes to the local authorities, which can and do give it postcodes where people on housing benefit may be living.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000011"></a>British Gas told me that it tries to work in partnership with local authorities&#151;housing departments, social services and so on&#151;to find areas of local deprivation. Of course, it is not given names and addresses. It sounds rather like a municipal game of hide-and-seek: &#147;We cannot tell you where they are, but we can tell you where to look&#148;. I suppose that that is better than nothing, but it does not sound to me like a very cost-effective method. Indeed, British Gas estimates the cost of this hide-and-seek and its other measures as &#163;2.5 billion over the three-year period of this order. It has put the cost of its past efforts to find customers at &#163;6 per customer per fuel&#151;many customers take both gas and electricity. Its latest estimate is that this is now going to cost &#163;20 per customer per fuel. That is all customers, including the target customers, so a customer who buys both gas and electricity will be paying &#163;40 for the cost of searching for the priority group.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000012"></a>British Gas also told me that it is in no doubt whatever that the process that it has to use involves huge inefficiencies and that much of the &#163;2.5 billion that it has estimated is simply wasted. One reason for that is that it finds that an increasing number of these target households have already benefited from the Government&#146;s Warm Front scheme. That means that this is a complete waste, because the household has already got insulation, or whatever it might be. Will the savings from Warm Front households count towards a supplier&#146;s 40 per cent target? If, as I suspect may be the case, the answer is no, is not that likely to make achieving the 40 per cent target even more difficult?</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000013"></a>I have also had a brief from Scottish and Southern Energy, whose representatives I met last week. That company is also finding identifying priority group households extremely difficult. That phrase is used over and over again. I found it used by the Energy Retail Association; it is always &#147;extremely difficult&#148;. It expressed concern that, even with the help that it can offer vulnerable customers once it has found them, the amounts that customers will have to pay towards the cost of the improvements available under the CERT will be beyond the means of many of them.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC82"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC82</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000014"></a>My noble friend mentioned Ofgem. I looked at the latest Ofgem five-year strategy consultation document, which is for 2008 to 2013. It is dated very recently&#151;14 January. Chapter 6 is headed, &#147;Helping to tackle fuel poverty&#148;. Paragraph 6.6 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012287000036"></a>&#147;The challenge remains getting the message across to those who most need the help and ensuring that once identified they can benefit from the full range of help available&#151;the &#145;find and fix&#146; approach. This requires a joined up approach from Government, industry and other agencies. It is also dependent on the Government using its sources of information to improve the targeting of the help available&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012287000029"></a>The CERT is mentioned in paragraph 6.8, but not much is said about the monitoring role. It seems to me that Ofgem has identified this problem perfectly properly and that it needs more joined-up thinking, if I may put it that way, as others are asking for.</p>
<h5><a name="08012287000044"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000015"></a>My attention was drawn to eaga, the Energy Action Grants Agency, which originally was an agency but is now a very successful private sector company owned by its employees. It has been successfully delivering Warm Front across England for Defra and equivalent schemes in Wales and Northern Ireland. Eaga told me that it cannot identify the costs that it has incurred in identifying constituents who are eligible for Warm Front grants, but it gives some interesting information. I quote:</p>
<ul><a name="08012287000037"></a>&#147;eaga reaches Warm Front eligible constituents through numerous channels (ranging from partnerships with Primary Care Trusts to liaising with minority ethnic community groups), so it is not possible to put a firm single figure on the cost of identifying those eligible for Warm Front ... Our work differs from that of the energy suppliers; for example, they are able to utilise their billing of customers to make them aware of CERT energy efficiency programmes. eaga relies on raising awareness of the programme to generate applications from the public ... However, our extensive experience in dealing with vulnerable customers&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08012287000030"></a>I accept that that is true&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08012287000042"></a>&#147;local knowledge and work with other stakeholders means we believe the costs associated with identifying eligible vulnerable constituents are far outweighed by the benefits of the energy efficiency improvements we deliver&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012287000031"></a>To which one might say, &#147;Well, they would say that, wouldn&#146;t they?&#148;. I am, however, very impressed by eaga. I did not know about it before, but I have looked at its excellent website and had long discussions with its people, and it is a good organisation. Much more of this scheme might well be routed through it, as it seems to have the experience of doing this. Many of the companies are obviously finding it difficult.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000016"></a>Eaga goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08012287000038"></a>&#147;However, whilst we recognise that the absolute number of Priority Group households benefiting from CERT will technically increase, we believe it is very much worth noting that Priority Group customers are likely to pay 100% more under CERT and to receive only 44% of the additional benefits. This is worrying as these customers are the least able to meet these costs&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08012287000032"></a>Would the Minister care to comment on that? I say straightaway that Warm Front has been an undoubted success and that eaga is entitled to much of the credit for the delivery of the scheme, so I regard its anxieties as pretty worrying.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC83"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC83</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000017"></a>Given the real concern in the industry and in Ofgem, is it not genuinely surprising that in the entire 79 pages of the Explanatory Memorandum put out by Defra the problem of identifying priority group customers is not even mentioned, let alone addressed? Would I be unreal in thinking that this begins to look like a conspiracy of silence in Defra? I hope that that is not true, and today&#146;s debate offers the Minister the chance to disprove it. Again, will the Minister say what Defra is doing to help the energy industry to identify PG customers and so help the industry to achieve the challenging 40 per cent target?</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000018"></a>In conclusion, and in a lighter vein, I make three suggestions. The first is that the names of all the tax credit claimants are put on to a couple of computer disks and sent in an anonymous envelope to the Energy Retail Association. The second thing might be to arrange for the local authority to put all its information into an unnetted skip and let it fly out over the roundabouts on the bypasses. The third thing is that the Department for Work and Pensions could put all its information on to a laptop computer and arrange for it to be stolen. I say this in a lighter vein, but all these things have happened.</p>

<p><a name="08012287000019"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08012287000046"></a>Viscount Brookeborough:</b> I had not intended to say anything&#151;I am here to discuss the next order&#151;but I felt that I should make a very general remark after listening to the debate. I welcome the order and anything to do with energy conservation and reducing carbon emissions. A number of years ago, we on the European Communities Committee held an inquiry into renewable energy. Of course things have moved on, but much of what the Government are doing now largely involves panic measures. Governments&#151;previous Governments, not necessarily this one&#151;have failed to do anything for years.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000020"></a>The European Communities Committee visited Denmark because it has a climate extremely like our own. We found that how little we had done and are still doing was embarrassing in Denmark. At that time, the use of energy&#151;electricity&#151;there had not increased in the previous 20 years, although GDP had gone up as much as ours had. Why? Because Denmark had conservation measures that actually worked. We were informed that our building control regulations were miles behind those of that similar country. The opinion was offered that this was partly because of the power of the construction industry within the wheels of government and everything else. However, our regulations were miles behind for whatever reason. They are still behind those of Denmark, which is so similar to our country. Why are our building regulations not such that we are conserving more energy than we ever did? We are not up to speed with other nations.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000021"></a>Secondly, there is all this encouragement for microgeneration, which I find rather interesting. It was introduced in Northern Ireland about six months before it was brought in here. Denmark went along that route 20 or 30 years ago, which helped it a great deal. Because of the eyesore problems, cost and so on, Denmark is now providing incentives to group microgeneration schemes together so that it is no  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC84"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC84</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>longer for individual houses. Yet it appears that we are starting back where Denmark started, having learnt precious little from its experience.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000022"></a>We have heard this evening that the Government have not always given a lead. Without a doubt, that was the finding of our inquiry: the Government were not giving a lead or the correct incentives to the suppliers to provide what was required to meet our targets. We are now at a stage where, although it may not appear like panic, we are rushing everything through. Although I am entirely behind nuclear, it appears that the decision on it the other day was introduced in exactly the same way. I am delighted by the decision because I believe in nuclear, although I do not have a thorough knowledge of it.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012287000023"></a>A symptom of how the Government do not provide incentives is the number of projects that have failed in the past five to 10 years, whether for planning reasons or because of insufficient incentives to get the project right in the first place. I am talking about projects such as the Holsworthy biogas project in the south-west, where there was not enough incentive to get the filters right and it did not work. This Government and previous Governments are very much to blame for not giving enough of a lead. There is not enough information out there and not enough incentive for business to come to this in a major way. I hope that we achieve those targets. I welcome the order, but we need a lot more to get down to grass-roots level.</p>

<p><a name="08012292000003"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08012292000099"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> I say to the noble Viscount that we have one&#151;I hope&#151;day left in Committee on the Climate Change Bill. I look forward to him participating in our debate on Wednesday. He brings valuable experience.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000004"></a>I have no brief on this, but the short answer to the noble Viscount&#146;s point about Denmark is that coal and North Sea oil and gas made us incredibly lazy and inefficient in this country. It made everybody ignore renewables, as there was no pressure. The Danes did not have those resources, so they went down their route. What has happened in this country is an absolute disgrace and, of course, we are making up for it now. As the noble Viscount rightly says, there has been a push in this respect in Northern Ireland because of the former Secretary of State, Peter Hain. That was in the face of some pressure that I know of&#151;I sat at the table with him&#151;against even the turbine experiment at Strangford Lough. It took enormous pressure to drive that through to see what we could do with renewables.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000005"></a>I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, about eaga. I pay tribute to the support that it gave to my former constituents. It is an absolutely first-class organisation, both when it was an agency and since it has been in the private sector. It provides a valuable service, as any Member of the other place would confirm.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000006"></a>I shall do my best to answer the specific questions. I shall take first those asked by the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart. He asked about the CERT, the incentives for innovation and how it would work. We think that there are two key routes for innovation: the market  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC85"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC85</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>transformation route and the demonstration route. The market transformation activity is that for which the carbon saving is known but which was not used in the energy efficiency commitment phase 1. As an incentive for these measures new to the market, they will be attributed with an extra 50 per cent carbon saving. Solid wall insulation and ground source heat pumps are also included since, although they were used in small numbers under the energy efficiency commitment phase 1, we wish to support market transformation for those measures. Demonstration action will allow energy suppliers for the first time to count towards their obligation innovation measures in which accurate carbon savings cannot yet be determined. In return for an upfront score based on the cost of the project, energy suppliers will make publicly available the results of their demonstration projects so that we can all benefit from a better understanding of these new approaches.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000007"></a>The noble Earl asked how the delivery of the CERT will be overseen. The draft order makes Ofgem the regulator responsible for overseeing the delivery of the CERT. I know nothing about the background to why Ofgem was chosen as opposed to any other body. I am giving the position at the moment following the consultations and the approval by the other House. The order makes Ofgem responsible for overseeing the delivery by monitoring suppliers&#146; progress towards meeting their obligations. Suppliers&#146; proposals for meeting their targets must be approved by Ofgem, which will determine the reduction of carbon emissions that will be attributed to them. In August last year, Ofgem issued a consultation paper on its supplier guidance for the operation of the CERT and expects to issue its final administrative arrangements as soon as this order comes into force.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000008"></a>The noble Earl also asked what happens if a supplier fails to meet the obligation. Ofgem will be responsible for the enforcement of each supplier&#146;s CERT obligation. It has the power to impose on a supplier a financial penalty of up to 10 per cent of company turnover if it fails. The Electricity Act 1989 and the Gas Act 1986 are the primary legislation that requires Ofgem to be the administering body. Article 16 requires Ofgem to submit annual progress reports to the Secretary of State&#151;that goes without saying, but you always have to say these things. Those reports will also be in the public domain.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000009"></a>The noble Earl said that the issue depends on individual consumers taking action. I admit that there will be some difficulties. We are talking about what household consumers in this country can be persuaded or incentivised to do. In the past six years of the energy efficiency commitment, suppliers have shown that they can work effectively and creatively to deliver action from individual customers. The Government are committed to helping individual consumers to overcome real and perceived barriers to action, such as poor information, high upfront costs, apathy and the hassle factor. We intend to build on the successful Act on CO2 campaign with TV, online and press advertising, and we continue to work at local and grass-roots level. In November, the Prime Minister announced that the Government would provide &#163;100

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000010"></a>The level of the target is based on an analysis of an illustrative mix of a balanced selection of possible measures generally regarded as cost-effective. The analysis is informed by information and data provided by energy suppliers, representatives of the industries concerned and experts, including the Building Research Establishment and the Energy Saving Trust. We recognise that the costs to suppliers of achieving their CERT obligations are passed on to consumers through their bills. The Government have sought to ensure that the cost to consumers is kept at a reasonable level.</p>

It declined to go any further than that.

<p><a name="08012292000013"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, raised the issue of boilers. They are not eligible for the CERT because efficient boilers are required under building regulations. You cannot buy an inefficient boiler today anyway. It would therefore not provide additional activity under the CERT. We are, however, promoting the early replacement of boilers through the energy performance aspect of the building directive. There is an issue with boilers and, as the noble Lord has rightly said, with inefficient ones the energy is going straight up the chimney. More and more are being replaced.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000014"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, was kind enough to give me some advance warning of the point he wished to raise. I therefore have some detailed responses. If they are not sufficient, I will follow them up. The noble Lord asked what is the point of setting targets for gas and electricity suppliers to help families in fuel poverty if they are denied information about who they are. He also asked what Defra is doing to find people in the priority group. Under the CERT, energy suppliers will be required to direct at least 40 per cent of carbon savings to a priority group of low-income and elderly consumers. They are not necessarily the same&#151;I made that point about the over-70s&#151;but nevertheless a large element of the low-income target group is the over-70s. The priority group is defined as those in receipt of certain income-related or disability benefits, tax credits or pension credit, as well as those aged 70 or over. Suppliers may use a variety of methods to identify that group of customers. They include setting out the priority group criteria in

More generally, we are committed to using knowledge of those who are likely to be in fuel poverty to ensure that they can get help. We are considering a number of options with the energy suppliers and fuel poverty programme managers. They include the Government writing to benefit recipients on behalf of those offering the help or providing information where there is a high propensity for people to be on benefit.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000015"></a>Although it was said in jest, there was a serious point behind what the noble Lord said at the end of his speech. I take his point because what has happened with the recent information lapses has been nothing short of a disgrace and complete lapse in good standards in public administration. But there are serious issues about individual names, addresses and personal information. This winter, for example, we are going to support a mail shot to 250,000 pension credit recipients offering free insulation and help to install central heating. We want to look at these options before we consider fully sharing the personal data of millions of people, most of whom will not be fuel poor or eligible for assistance. We are continuing our large-scale Keep Warm Well campaign, aimed at vulnerable households in England, which gives information on the health benefits of keeping warm in winter and details of the grants and benefits available. That brings together cross-government communications that are, I hope, co-ordinated and accessible.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000016"></a>The noble Lord was quite right when he asked the question, and gave the answer, about Warm Front savings contributing to the 40 per cent target, which is surely impossible. As he said, the figures in the note to the statutory instrument do not take that into account. In the consultation proposals on how it would administer the CERT, the regulator, Ofgem, made it clear that where a supplier undertakes action in conjunction with the government programme, there should be no double counting of carbon savings. Ofgem will shortly issue its supplier guidance on the carbon emissions reduction target, which will set out the criteria for ensuring additionality. We are obviously very keen to encourage interaction, where possible, between the CERT, Warm Front and other government programmes, so that they support the arrangements between the CERT energy suppliers and the Warm Front scheme manager as private companies to maximise the benefit to vulnerable people.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000017"></a>The noble Lord asked what Defra expected a householder on the Warm Front scheme to do about microgeneration. Although Warm Front does not currently offer microgeneration technology as part of a portfolio of measures, it can provide, and has mechanisms for assessing, alternative technologies that could be brought into the scheme. In this light, Warm Front is undertaking a pilot exercise of solar-thermal systems, which will assess whether that  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC88"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC88</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>technology is suitable for inclusion as a main Warm Front measure. It is also useful to note that, since the summer 2007 consultation, we have expanded the scope of the CERT priority group; the over-70s were not in the original consultation. The supply target has therefore increased by some 2.5 million households. The assumptions on which the CERT target is based recognise that the priority group consumers will receive the measures at little or no cost.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000018"></a>That gives rise to another question, which the noble Lord did not touch on but alluded to. It is generally known that those in some of the severest fuel poverty in the country pay more for their electricity and gas than the rest of us because they are still on coin meters. There is no doubt that that is a massive attack on the marginal cost of electricity. That issue is not part of this, but it will have to be dealt with in due course because there must be fairness between one section of society and another. There is no sense in targeting low-income, fuel-poor people with all these schemes but penalising them because they are still on coin-operated meters, which is what the utilities do. That issue is not in my brief, but I offer it from my experience as a constituency Member of Parliament. It is a paradox because the Government can be accused of promoting schemes to assist those people when other measures could be taken to help them directly with the cost of electricity. The hassle factor and the upfront costs of investing even in such things as energy-saving bulbs are what put them off.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000019"></a>There is another major issue. We currently have no proposals in legislation to allow energy suppliers to have the names and addresses of people on various benefits. That is not part of the operation. It might have been thought a good idea to do it that way around, but it is not being done that way. We must find other ways of doing it and must find out whether we can be successful. Before any Government ever submitted such a proposal, they would have to win acceptance in both Houses, let alone among the public, of what would, in effect, be a massive and intrusive measure that would require information that is got for one purpose to be given to the private sector for another. You would have to have a very good case that you had tried every other conceivable, reasonable way of targeting those people for their own benefit to lower their bills and their carbon footprint, thereby assisting us to meet our national targets. I am not saying that that is not somewhere down the road, but it is certainly not on the agenda at present. It might have been thought to be on the agenda in the past, but it is not a route. As the noble Lord will appreciate, given his former role, passing information about benefit claimants, let alone tax credit claimants, to the private sector would be highly sensitive, and is not a route that we will use at present. I am not saying that it will be ruled out in future, however.</p>

The documents are printed and paid for by the energy companies. But, as the noble Lord has said, I entirely understand the arguments about why large numbers cannot just be handed over. Is that not the way ahead? Could not other authorities perhaps do the same, so that they could be the channel through which the energy companies would eventually reach the target audience which they need to have if they are to get their 40 per cent?</p>

This winter, the Government are just about to send a mail shot to 250,000 pension credit recipients. We will send out the information as regards central heating and insulation, but we need to know the results of that before we can go further. That is the answer: the Government are sending out the information from the suppliers because we hold the information. It is quite legitimate for the Government to target because that is the information we have. We know who the pension credit recipients are. As I said, we are about to do that this winter. We need to test the process to see what the value, the results and the benefits are of doing it that way around, so we are doing that.</p>

I apologise if I suggested that he did not deal with that, but there has already been one pilot scheme last year. I am told by the Energy Retail Association and by those who participated that the result was regarded as a success. It may be that the Government are thinking that they may need another pilot in perhaps a district. If that is happening, it will take some time. Three years starts next April. Presumably, this will all count towards the 40 per cent target. I just do not see these things adding up or how they hang together.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000023"></a>The noble Lord reeled out a long list of other initiatives, and one is getting the impression of a system which will simply collapse under the weight of its own bureaucracy. Yet, in the mean time, we wait for what seems to be the most hopeful approach on this, which is what the first pilot has already successfully achieved.</p>

This pilot is being done under this scheme. I freely admit that the Government works incredibly slowly. That is my experience of the past ten and a half years. You get an idea and you imagine something happening, but three or four years later, you think, &#147;Where are we?&#148;. The money does not flow through the system very fast, except to Northern Rock&#151;which I should not have said! Once Ministers allocate expenditure, it is an incredibly long time before you see the flow through the system and the output. I can only apologise to the noble Lord. Frankly, we are now targeting this group for pension credit for this period, and it is probably was not the same group as last time. But it is a good lesson to pilot things before letting

The lesson of history is that if you have an idea like this which you want to roll out, try it out either by benefit or area first, rather than going the whole hog across the country. There may be a benefit with that in the long term. It is frustrating to the noble Lord, as it would be for those who are running the schemes, that it all appears to be so slow. I apologise for that.</p>

I can also sympathise with the noble Lord, having been, if not in exactly the same position, at any rate in what was the same department some years ago, and these things do take time. But, in the mean time, we have a scheme starting under the order on 1 April. The 40 per cent obligation starts then. However, until these pilots have been properly appraised and it has been decided how to roll them out, British Gas will have to go on playing municipal hide and seek. That does not seem very satisfactory. The fact that the noble Lord&#146;s explanatory memorandum did not have a single word to say about this fills me with some dismay. It gives the impression that Defra neither knows about it or, if it does know about it, does not care. That might be an unfair judgment, but anyone reading 79 pages of that explanatory memorandum is likely to draw that conclusion.</p>

It is not necessarily a CERT invitation, but it is the same targeting. We use government information on people whom we know&#151;in this case, the 250,000 on pension credit&#151;to send out the information on the schemes for insulation and central heating. Once the order is passed, Ofgem will run the scheme, so the pressure is on Ofgem. I realise it is slow and the 40 per cent target starts from 1 April. The other scheme folds and the new scheme starts. I accept that three years is not a long time. This time next year, looking at the review of the first year, it will be fair to ask: are we on a trajectory that will deliver? I am not in a position to say at the moment. I just hope we are.</p>

He quite rightly said&#151;I expected it was so&#151;that the savings from the past Warm Front expenditure do not count. So be it. What about future Warm Front expenditure?

The Minister and I know from previous experience that a knock on the door and speaking face to face with someone who really understand the situation is always more likely to produce results. Is it possible for the fuel companies to fund staff employed by the government agencies so that those agencies with the information on fuel poverty could then knock on the doors? They would know which doors to knock on. Would it be possible under this or other schemes for fuel companies to pay for staff who would be employed by the government agencies&#151;not by the fuel companies&#151;and for that to count towards their achievement of the target? It seems that that is more likely over time to avoid a situation in which leaflets are sent out encouraging people to apply or to respond but the very poorest and those most at risk do not take up the opportunity. That is the tragedy for those whom we are talking about.</p>

As soon as I can get some information I shall write to the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000031"></a>The issue of the other schemes is quite important: what can be counted and how they go about trying to find the information, as I said, through social housing landlords and others. To my noble friend I say that I will get an answer, but I am not sure. In the past couple of years, I have come across schemes where there has been incredible difficulty, even within government, of one department using another department&#146;s personal information to facilitate what is public-good policy, simply because of data protection. There is an example&#151;nothing to do with fuel and energy&#151;where only government departments were involved, but the information had not been given for the original purpose. It is incredibly difficult and yet it seems so obvious.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000032"></a>On the other hand, the objective is to try to find these people and target them. You may know that they are poor in a financial sense, but they may not be in fuel poverty. We do not know how people spend their money. People do not take kindly to someone knocking on their door and saying, &#147;We&#146;ve discovered that you&#146;re poor and we&#146;ve come to help&#148;. The last thing people need to be told is that they live in a slum or that they are poor. One has to be incredibly sensitive when dealing with this, as my noble friend will be aware. His suggestion about those who have the information being seconded or paid by those who need the information to deliver this public-good policy seems so sensible. I shall certainly get information on that and write to noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="08012292000036"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0005.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08012292000113"></a>Lord Rooker</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning Act 1997 (Amnesty Period) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000037"></a>The noble Lord said: First, I want to acknowledge and welcome the Lord, Lord Trimble, to his Front-Bench position.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000038"></a>Before I turn to the substance of the order, a draft of which was laid before the House on 4 December and which is well known to noble Lords, I shall set out the Government&#146;s position on decommissioning more generally, which I hope the Committee will find helpful. Decommissioning is a matter of considerable public importance and it has played an essential role in achieving political progress in Northern Ireland. It is vital that we ensure it can continue so that paramilitary weapons can be put beyond use. In September 2005, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning reported that it and independent witnesses had determined that the Provisional IRA has,</p>
<ul><a name="08012292000091"></a>&#147;met its commitment to put all its arms beyond use in a manner called for by the legislation&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000039"></a>That position has been supported by subsequent reports by the International Monitoring Commission, which have illustrated the progress made by this organisation. At one point, the IMC considered the Provisional IRA to be the most sophisticated and potentially most dangerous of the terrorist groups in Northern Ireland. In contrast, in April 2007, the International Monitoring Commission reported that the Provisional IRA was firmly committed to a political path. None of us can deny the progress that has been made and the part that decommissioning has played in that. We now want to see a determined effort from other paramilitary organisations, including loyalists.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000040"></a>We have seen some progress over the past year with statements by the UVF and UDA acknowledging that the war is over and calling on all active service units to stand down. However, the Secretary of State was right to say at the time that,</p>
<ul><a name="08012292000092"></a>&#147;they will be judged by their actions, not their words&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08012292000090"></a>Engagement with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning and the decommissioning of its weapons is vital. This order enables decommissioning to take place.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC93"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC93</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000041"></a>I turn to what the order does. The current amnesty period identified in the non-statutory decommissioning scheme is due to end on 20 February this year. This order would extend that deadline for a further year to 14 February 2009. The amnesty period is the time during which firearms, ammunition and explosives can be decommissioned in accordance with the scheme. The amnesty provides immunity from prosecution for the offences set out in the schedule to the 1997 Act; offences that might be committed during the decommissioning process. Most such offences relate to the possession of weapons, but others may stem from a person&#146;s participation in decommissioning, not necessarily centred on the weapons involved but on the behaviour that may accompany participation, such as the withholding of information or making arrangements with terrorists.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000042"></a>Section 2 of the 1997 Act, as amended by the Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning (Amendment) Act 2002 and the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, requires that a scheme must identify the amnesty period, and that it must end before 27 February 2010, unless the Secretary of State by order appoints a later day. The purpose of the order before the House is to extend that period for a further year</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000043"></a>The extension of the decommissioning amnesty period had become something of an annual event. I think this is the third one I have brought to the House. However, the amnesty will not and should not continue indefinitely. The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning&#146;s last report confirmed its assessment made in September 2005 that the Provisional IRA had met its commitment to put all its arms beyond use in a manner called for by the legislation&#151;an assessment that it has since confirmed.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000044"></a>The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning&#146;s report also observed that the arms of loyalist paramilitary groups, as well as that of other paramilitary organisations, remained to be addressed. Its January 2006 report emphasised the concentration on loyalist paramilitary groups and the desire to attempt to engage with them in the pursuit of their mandate. We are bringing this order because the Government are committed to securing the decommissioning of all paramilitary weapons, and because in our judgment it would be premature to close off this route to achieving that objective. To that end, discussions continue to secure decommissioning proposals with the UPRG. Those discussions have included representatives from the UDA. The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning believes that this represents a willingness to address the issue of arms.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000045"></a>It is important to emphasise that work with these groups is ongoing with a view to helping them to make the transition from conflict to peace and to bring about their desire to transform not only themselves but their communities. We must acknowledge the UVF statement of 3 May 2007 and the progress that may produce. However, the statement needs to be supported by clear and visible action, including decommissioning and, to that end, continuing contact between the UVF and the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. Decommissioning is a crucial feature

The LVF has not resumed formal contact, but it has authorised informal discussions with intermediaries.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000046"></a>It is essential that we build on the progress already made by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning next year. In order to achieve that, it is essential that we continue to provide the statutory framework necessary to make decommissioning a reality. This order does exactly that. Its extension for one year is a measured and prudent response to the current situation. I beg to move.</p>

I reassure him about this; I carry with me the apologies of my noble friend Lord Glentoran, who is otherwise engaged. I am merely spelling for him on this occasion. One should not read too much into that.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000049"></a>As the Minister has said, this is a routine order which is necessary for the functioning of the IICD in the event of there being decommissioning, and it is necessary that this is made available to the IICD. I know that, in some quarters, people get excited when they see this order because of the word &#147;amnesty&#148;, but the provision that can be described as such within this structure is very limited, is for a specific purpose and is clearly necessary to facilitate decommissioning. It is a usual, routine event which enables us to comment on progress or otherwise regarding decommissioning generally and with regard to paramilitaries.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000050"></a>The Minister has done so by recording how mainstream republicans have completed their process, but unfortunately he has had very little to report regarding loyalist paramilitaries. I noticed that the farthest he could get was to say that the present interaction between the IICD and the UPRG&#151;and whatever paramilitary representatives that are contained in that&#151;is seen as, &#147;willingness to address the issue of arms&#148;. That is a very limited and cautious statement, which does not disclose any serious engagement. That is how I interpret that phrase. While they might be meeting and having a little discussion, there is not yet serious engagement on the issue.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000051"></a>It is necessary to spell that out and to say very clearly to the loyalist paramilitary organisations, to the UDA and the UVF&#151;which have come out with some encouraging statements about their general orientation but which have not carried it through with the appropriate action&#151;that it is very difficult to be patient with this situation. Considerable efforts have been made by a wide range of people over the past few years to try to encourage and facilitate the loyalist paramilitary organisations&#146; transformation, but the progress is very disappointing indeed. Those organisations cannot expect society and the Government to continue to tolerate that slow progress. That must be said.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000052"></a>I observe parenthetically that, by not decommissioning, the loyalist paramilitaries are delaying the point at which the IICD publishes its inventory of decommissioning, which enables a certain cloak of privacy to be cast over the republican decommissioning events. It is ironic that the loyalist paramilitaries, by their dilatoriness, are saving the republicans from the embarrassment of having the extent to which they decommissioned clearly seen.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000053"></a>The present situation goes further than just slowness in terms of engagement with the IICD. We saw just a few weeks ago action by a paramilitary organisation on the Shankill which indicates that rather than making progress we are going backwards. That incident was where two persons who were alleged to have been involved in crime were publicly paraded and humiliated on the street. We were told by the <I>Belfast Telegraph</I> yesterday that the organisation that was responsible was the UDA. That might or might not be accurate; it probably is. But that action was a most retrograde event. I noted that, unfortunately, the Police Service of Northern Ireland arrived on the scene but later departed, saying that no further action would be taken because the persons concerned did not make a complaint. That does not seem to be an appropriate approach to policing. The events clearly demonstrated that something untoward and probably of a criminal nature had occurred. I would have thought that it would have been incumbent on the police to investigate further. I notice also the silence of the human rights lobby. Clearly, the human rights of those individuals were trespassed upon, but we hear nothing said about that.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000054"></a>It is like the bad old days, when paramilitaries were acting with impunity. We do not want to see those bad old days come back, and we do not like the sight of a paramilitary organisation flexing its muscles to intimidate the general population of an area. That may not be seen to be directly relevant to decommissioning, but it is relevant to the state of mind in that paramilitary organisation or grouping. If that is their state of mind, it does not encourage us regarding the decommissioning process.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000055"></a>It is incumbent not so much on the IICD, the remit of which is very limited, but on the Government, in the direct or indirect contacts that they may have with such groups, to ensure that our impatience and displeasure are made known to them. It is  also incumbent on the Independent Monitoring Commission, which has done so much good work over the past number of years, to clearly highlight this situation, as it can in the report that is coming in April. We look forward to that IMC report in the hope that it will vindicate its reputation, point the finger and perhaps indicate what the Government can do to increase the sanction on the paramilitary organisations which have not yet taken advantage of the opportunities available to them to move into normal, peaceful operation and to leave behind the paramilitarism and criminality that has been such a disgrace to them and those who would identify with them.</p>

I also congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, on his first outing as a Front-Bencher with his new cause, even if it is in well-worn territory; I know that he is moving on to other pastures before the day is out.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000058"></a>The only constant thing in our consideration of Northern Ireland matters is our need for patience. There is something inevitable about this order being brought before us. In a couple of months&#146; time, it will be 10 years since the Good Friday agreement; I am amazed by how time flies. The noble Lord, Lord Trimble, referred to the IRA decommissioning, as did the Minister, which goes back to September 2005. Yet we have the latest monitoring report of the present position stating that, although there appears to be willingness, decommissioning is not happening at present on the loyalist side. What pressure are the Government bringing to bear on the paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland that still have not got on with the show? Is there anything that the Minister can do?</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000059"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Trimble, spoke about &#147;state of mind&#148;. One of the problems is what is the future is for people who have made it just about the career of their adult lifetimes to be involved in paramilitary activity? I have heard it expressed that perhaps there should be some old comrades&#146; organisation set up&#151;a billiards saloon or whatever. It may well be that something must be done, but that would be down to the devolved Assembly. Is that which the Minister and his colleagues have to do in representing the Northern Ireland Office, and that which could and should be done by the devolved Assembly and its Ministers, properly working in parallel to achieve the objectives that we all wish to see? Clearly, shuffle diplomacy and patience are still required. I hope that there are some answers to that.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000060"></a>We urge the Government to put pressure on the loyalist paramilitary groups to move away from crime and to decommission their weapons. Can more be done by the Government and the devolved Assembly, working together, to make another move forward? We support the order, which has to happen, but I would not mind teasing out whether things could be pushed that little bit further.</p>

<p><a name="08012292000061"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="08012292000117"></a>Lord Maginnis of Drumglass:</b> I thank the Minister for bringing forward this order and for the information that he has given us so far. However, I would have liked to have seen a little bit of hard information. We are talking about something as serious as guns, bombs and the means of detonating bombs. I remember raising this issue well over 20 years ago in another place, when I talked about having seen what was happening in South Africa. I talked about the need for disarmament if we were to move back towards a stable society. At that time and, indeed, up until very recently, the leader of another unionist party in Northern Ireland used to think that I was quite mad to suggest disarmament. &#147;There&#146;ll never be a gun or a bullet decommissioned,&#148; he would say. Thanks to the efforts of a lot of people but, in particular, the efforts of my friend the noble Lord,  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC97"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC97</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Trimble, we moved in 1998 to a situation where progress has been slowly, sometimes almost imperceptibly but none the less steadily, made over the past 10 years&#151; I sometimes cannot believe that it is 10 years since the Belfast agreement.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000062"></a>I was an officer in the Army 30 years ago, and I knew roughly what weapons the IRA had and what weapons the loyalist paramilitaries had. We talked about the substance of the problem. Now it is almost unheard of to talk about the substance of the problem. I no longer have any idea of the extent of the arms the paramilitary organisations hold. Do we know the number of weapons still outstanding? Do we know the types of weapons? Do we know how much bomb material and detonators we are looking for? If the Minister could reassure us that the present Police Service of Northern Ireland has any idea, as we used to have, that would be some reassurance.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000063"></a>I shall address two other issues. The first is the punishment fitting the crime. I would like the Minister to tell us how many people have been charged with the possession of weapons and how severe the punishment has been. If we create the opportunity for people to get rid of these weapons and move to a normal life, we should ensure that failure to do so is punished&#151;and I make no apology for saying punished most harshly. How many people have been punished for possession of weapons in the past year or so, and what were the lengths of their sentences? Are they a deterrent? I have a strange feeling that the answer to that may be embarrassing.</p>
<h5><a name="08012292000097"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000064"></a>Another issue is almost out of step with the lack of progress in disarming the loyalist paramilitaries. I should have emphasised that I am talking almost exclusively about loyalist paramilitaries&#146; weaponry. I know that we want the weapons of other groups, such as the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA, too, but we will have to dedicate a lot of effort to finding those weapons. As my noble friend Lord Trimble has already said, the matter is being hindered by the tardiness of the loyalists.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000065"></a>I want to make a promise&#151;one may think that it is a threat&#151;about the devolution of policing and justice. I will do everything in my power to dissuade my party from having anything to do with the devolution of policing and justice while the dregs of society are still in possession of these weapons. It would be totally unfair to an Assembly in Northern Ireland to put the onus on that particular body, with all its still remaining suspicions and the element of distrust that it will take years to remove. It would be nonsense to suggest that it should have responsibility for devolution and policing. I hope that the Minister will tell his friend Mr Woodward that we are not at all supportive of his constant reminder that he is moving towards this devolution in the short term. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some substantial answers on the substance of the problem.</p>

<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC98"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC98</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>think about how we are dealing with this, because we have dealt with widespread terrorism through the measures that we have had. Right now, we do not have that terrorism. On the republican side, we are dealing with dissidents. On the loyalist side, we are dealing with a group of leaders who we believe would like to come out of terrorism, but there are enough dissidents and active people to restrain them from doing so. I am not sure that the measures we are taking and the way in which we are approaching dissidents is quite right, because if the loyalists live in fear of their ranks, which are still dissident enough to put the fear into them, they will look at republicans and say, &#147;What have the republicans done? They have disarmed. They have done all that&#148;. But they have got dissidents and we have not found a way of resolving the problem of those dissidents.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000067"></a>Should the loyalists go down the same route, they can see that we still have not found a way to help such a leadership resolve the problem. Things are so well advanced in Northern Ireland compared with the way they were that I by no means criticise the Government for not having the right answer or an answer to it. But there must be something in the fact that we have not found a way of dealing with the dissidents on the republican side, who I realise are a very small problem compared with those on the loyalist side, and either bringing them in or punishing them well enough to stop them, and they are still active.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000068"></a>In an extreme way, I believe that there is a way to resolve this, but I realise that our current politicians will not take that way. For instance, if one takes the republican side, the politicians, who know who the dissidents are because they were on their books years ago, could quite easily say, &#147;Okay, listen boys, we will not bother you for three months, but you must stop in three months. We support the police. We support law and order and we support the constitution&#148;&#151;we hope&#151;&#147;and, if you do not give up, we will do something about it&#148;. I do not believe that we are giving them enough support to enable them to do that, even if that is a consideration.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000069"></a>I definitely do not think that the loyalists have a clue about how to bring in their grass roots. It is a social problem and an employment issue. As someone said, it has become their lifestyle. Are we really doing enough to bring those groups with us? This is part-punishment, part-carrot. Perhaps the carrot is not good enough. We do not have quite the right approach to this, because we have suppressed the terrorism but we do not have a dissident policy.</p>

I underline my support for it and for total decommissioning. We have waited a long time&#151;perhaps longer than we should have, as we know&#151;but things are getting there. I acknowledge the efforts made by people, some of whom are in this Committee tonight, in the whole area of decommissioning.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000071"></a>I also join my noble friend Lord Maginnis in his plea about the potential for the devolution of policing and justice to Northern Ireland. It is clear that arms and arms decommissioning are only one issue. There  


<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC99"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC99</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>must be more than that which allows the devolution of such important topics. I have yet to be convinced that there is much support from Sinn Fein for the Police Service of Northern Ireland. There is a lot of talk, but I ask noble Lords to cast their minds back to the dreadful murder of Robert McCartney several years ago in a pub in the centre of Belfast. That murder has destroyed the McCartney family, and his sisters have been uprooted and intimidated out of the area. Somewhere between 70 and 80 members of Sinn Fein were drinking in the bar that night and witnessed the murder, yet none of them has come forward.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000072"></a>Then there was the Quinn murder on the border, when a team of 20 people went out and battered the poor, hapless young gentleman to death. Now the Sinn Fein people are suggesting that if you want to co-operate with the police on either side of the border, you must go through a solicitor in Dundalk. That is the same system of vetting information and the same formula that they used in the case of the McCartney murder. It is interesting to note that Conor Murphy, a Minister in the Executive, had a meeting with the IRA a few days after the murder. The IRA informed him that they were not involved. I just wonder who drove him to that meeting, and what the topic of conversation was on the drive there.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000073"></a>I am very much taken with the Minister reminding us of the old saying of judgment on actions, not words. I am totally opposed to the concept of devolving policing and justice to Northern Ireland this year. We are not ready for it by a long chalk, and I think noble Lords will find that most people in Northern Ireland believe that. We need actions, not words, from Sinn Fein. When will it support the police by actively giving information and putting some of these dreadful murderers behind bars?</p>

<p><a name="08012292000074"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08012292000120"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> Notwithstanding the fact that we are dealing with this narrow order, I have heard the voices on the devolution of policing and criminal justice, and I will ensure that my ministerial colleagues hear them. I appreciate that not much Northern Ireland business goes through your Lordships&#146; House at present, and that noble Lords are relieved of the duty of listening to me drone on. However, I do realise that this issue will be up front. A message has been given tonight, and I will ensure that my ministerial colleagues are well aware of it.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000075"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Trimble, referred to the incident on 11 January, of which I am aware. I check the BBC website on Northern Ireland every day. It is curiosity, but I try to keep myself informed. It is not always possible, and I do not have the same responsibilities that I used to have, but I must be aware of things. My answer is what he would expect; acts of criminality must be dealt with through the criminal justice system. The fact of the matter is that although the Police Service of Northern Ireland did not receive any formal complaint from the people involved&#151;the victims, let us say&#151;I am informed that proactive investigation is ongoing and any information that has been made available is being followed up. That is inadequate, but that is the position.</p>




<notus-date day="22" month="1" year="2008" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC100"></a><b>22 Jan 2008 : Column GC100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000076"></a>I agree entirely with what the noble Lord said about the slow pace of loyalist decommissioning, and I think that has generally been agreed. We agree with everything that the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, said about that. The IMC in its 17th report noted that the pace of change remains far too slow. We want to see progress, and we simply urge all paramilitaries involved to engage with the decommissioning commission. That is what it is there for. It is there to help them, and it is as simple as that.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000077"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Shutt, asked about what the Government are doing. This is a difficult one. The Government have been engaged with loyalism over many years. Throughout that engagement, the focus has been to persuade leaders to abandon criminality and paramilitarism in favour of democracy. While progress has been slow and minimal, it has been real and genuine and, as part of our engagement, we have pressed on the leadership the need for paramilitary groups to engage constructively with the IICD. Over the past year&#151;2007&#151;both the UVF and the UDA have taken significant steps in that direction. As I think I said, in May 2007 the UVF issued a statement effectively saying that the war was over and that it had stood down as a military organisation. It also promised an end to all paramilitary activity and criminality. While that is progress, we have called on the UVF to actually decommission.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000078"></a>On the UDA side, we continue to support those in the leadership who are genuinely trying to move that organisation away from violence into a peaceful existence. While decommissioning remains a matter for the Northern Ireland Office rather than for the devolved Administration, the Executive have recently agreed a programme for government that includes important objectives on building a shared future. Frankly, we are not going to get a shared future without decommissioning, but a shared future should solve a lot of problems if it is taken genuinely by a lot of organisations. There is a way forward; there is something on the table, as I have said many times before. Those who come to the table can walk away with a gain. There is no issue of victory and defeat and that language. The key here is that those who come to the table gain something from it. That remains open for those who still want to arrive at the table; there is something to gain for them in doing that. That is the lesson of history, and it is certainly the lesson in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000079"></a>In respect of the proposed devolution of policing and justice, we believe that the target date of May 2008 is achievable, and we are working towards that date. It cannot be forced through. The issue of all the locks remain in place. I had a vision; I thought it that was a quadruple lock, but I will settle for a triple lock. I can remember it being fourfold; maybe I was thinking of two Houses. The triple lock remains in place. However, noble Lords are aware that it is the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister, the Executive and this Parliament. We do not believe that preconditions on the completion of devolution should be put in place. Indeed, the continuing confidence that would be demonstrated by the devolution of policing and justice would rightly make clear that weapons have no place in Northern Ireland. That message has to be got across to everyone.</p>

<p><a name="08012292000080"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, asked for statistics on the current paramilitary capability. I fully accept what he said. More than 10 years ago&#151;perhaps 30 years ago&#151;information would have been known, I suspect, by all parties. As time passes, and individuals and situations change, one is bound to get out of touch. As part of its reports, the International Monitoring Commission has continued to illustrate paramilitary capacity. Unfortunately, this was illustrated in its most recent November report, which concluded that there were three paramilitary murders in this period. Therefore, the Government and the police have to continue to combat paramilitary activity. The IMC is required to monitor trends and the incidence of violence, which provides a good, independent measure. Clearly, there are still gangs with these weapons, but I do not think that it is possible to be any more detailed than that on the scale of them.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000081"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, referred to the dissident strategy and I fully accept and understand why he said what he said. But the evidence indicates that the dissident republicans have no popular support. The evidence is there because politics is working. In my role as the English Minister with responsibility for agriculture is to persuade the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish to pay something towards animal welfare and animal disease control.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000082"></a>Just before Christmas I went to Northern Ireland on one of my journeys around GB. I did various things and visited people, but I arrived early at Stormont and sat in the public gallery during Questions on education. To watch the antics going on down below was enough to bring tears to your eyes, but the fact is that they were going on there. I am not criticising. During the short time when it was my responsibility to answer for the Government in your Lordships' House, we talked about that very thing so often. I saw Question Time in Stormont. There were arguments between and within the parties. The Minister got a thumping and gave one back&#151;in Belfast. They were going on about the schools of Northern Ireland in Northern Ireland, not here as we have been doing. Politics is working in Belfast, at whatever level. That is part of the foundation for getting that across to the population of Northern Ireland. Those dissidents cannot go around claiming that it was all a con, that it is not working and that

We in Northern Ireland have the best animal welfare in the whole of the United Kingdom and we do not intend to subscribe to the tardiness, the through-otherness and the institutions that send animal disease into the air in the south or south-east of England.</p>

<p><a name="08012292000086"></a><b><a name="80122-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08012292000124"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> It was not a good example, but I was in Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh to discuss cost-sharing and responsibility on animal disease control. I have made that lesson clear in Whitehall. I have been the spokesman effectively there for the big successes for Northern Ireland. But it is a classic case because we have discussed this. There has to be an Ireland policy on disease control. The UK has an issue here to deal with. It is right that the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, should leap on that and use that slight chink in my armour.</p>

<a name="80122-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08012292000087"></a>My point about saying why I was there was that I wanted to share what I saw with Members of the Committee. Politics is working at a level that takes away popular support for those dissidents. We are confident that the Police Service of Northern Ireland is able to deal with that. However, our objective is to get all those dissident groups disarmed and decommissioned at the table, living useful and productive lives, and contributing to the community. I cannot go into the sort of things that the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, may want. In Belfast, from either party, there is a limit to the number of taxi rides that people could take, as I know from my friends who have been over there. But there are great economic and intellectual opportunities in Northern Ireland, and the people of Northern Ireland would be very unwise not to grab those opportunities. The message to those dissidents is to come and share the success with everyone else.</p>

<a name="80122-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08012269000006"></a>The Child Maintenance and Other Payments Bill currently before Parliament provides for a non-departmental public body, the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission, to administer the statutory scheme of child maintenance in place of the Child Support Agency. The commission will require a robust financial and human resources system, which will be created through modification of the system in use by the Department for Work and Pensions. In order to avoid delay in the establishment of the commission, certain modifications to this system need to be made in advance of the Bill receiving Royal Assent. The cost of these modifications is estimated at &#163;1,012,000, which will be met through repayable cash advances from the Contingencies Fund pending parliamentary approval of the Bill and of subsequent supply estimates.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="08012269000007"></a><b><a name="80122-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08012269000013"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Peter Hain) has made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="80122-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08012269000008"></a>The extent to which two of my department&#146;s agencies&#151;the Pension Service and the Disability and Carers Service&#151;have a shared set of customers has been increasing over time to the point where, currently, more than half of all of the customers of the Disability and Carers Service are now over pension age and thus customers of both agencies. Current trends in longevity mean that this proportion will continue to increase in the future.</p>

<a name="80122-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08012269000009"></a>Against this background it has become increasingly evident that the separate management of the two agencies is no longer the best means of providing a more integrated and seamless service to their customers. Accordingly we have decided to establish, as from the beginning of 2008-09, a single agency, under a single chief executive, to take responsibility for the work of the two organisations.</p>

<a name="80122-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08012269000010"></a>The two existing organisations&#151;the Pension Service and the Disability and Carers Service&#151;will continue to operate under their existing names and their customers will continue to receive services from them as they do now. But, over time, the new agency will help us to provide a more cohesive service to its customers which will aim to meet more of their needs in a joined up and seamless way.</p>

<a name="80122-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08012269000011"></a>The creation of the new agency will not change the way that the DWP, and the DCS in particular, delivers services to its working age customers.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="08012273000035"></a>&#147;Our proposals for non-renewal of funding cannot be made available until our National and Regional Councils make final decisions.. This information is considered confidential and commercially sensitive during the response period. This is especially so in the case of a recommendation that might be overturned by the National Council or a Regional Council. Regularly funded organisations who have a right to respond to our recommendation, should be able to do so freely without fear that our intention to reduce or stop their funding is potentially unnecessarily, and without their consent, released into the public domain. A full announcement will be made at the beginning of February.&#148;</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_1"></a>What safeguards are in place to ensure that claimants whose only income is from a contribution-based employment and support allowance (ESA) are not disadvantaged compared to those on income-based ESA as they will not be entitled to local authority concessionary schemes and the Social Fund, and will need to make separate claims for help with prescription charges and legal aid; and [HL1344]</p>

Customers whose only income is contributory ESA will also be able to apply separately for passported benefits. This includes local authority concession schemes, although the eligibility criteria for these schemes remains a matter for the local authorities concerned.</p>

We are working with colleagues in the Department of Health to make access to its low income scheme easier for those who are not eligible for automatic passporting.

They continue to provide a direct channel of communication with the Chinese Government, allowing us to discuss difficult and complex issues in detail. The next round of the UK's dialogue will take place on 28 to 31 January. The EU will hold its next round in May. We and our EU partners regularly urge China to extend media freedom to its domestic journalists, both up to and beyond the Olympics, and will do so again at the forthcoming dialogues.</p>

We did this at the last round of the UK-China human rights dialogue in February 2007. More recently, the Director of Public Prosecutions discussed RTL with his Chinese counterparts during his visit to China in September 2007. The Chinese Government have informed us of planned reforms to RTL, but progress remains slow. We continue to urge China to implement these reforms as soon as possible.</p>
