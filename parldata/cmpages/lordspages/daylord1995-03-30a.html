<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Donoughue </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What were the total revenues of Camelot from the National Lottery by 4th March 1995 and, in granting the licence to Camelot to operate the lottery, what was Her Majesty's Government's estimate of the time it would take Camelot to recover its start-up costs.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of National Heritage   (Viscount Astor): </B>  My Lords, National Lottery sales until Saturday, 4th March totalled &#163;927 million. The total revenues of the Camelot Group cannot be determined until the end of the financial year when adjustments may be made so that it meets its licence commitments for the year in relation to retailer commissions, prize payments and payments to the National Lottery Distribution Fund.
<P>

<a name="50330-01_para0"></a>Over the seven-year duration of the licence Camelot is expected to retain between 5 per cent. and 6 per cent. of revenue to cover operating costs and profit. The Director-General of the National Lottery has stated that Camelot's retention of revenue was the lowest of the eight applicants for the Section 5 licence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply, which is in line with Camelot's latest statements. On the basis of that information we may assume that the lottery revenue in the first year, including the switch card, will be in the region of &#163;4 billion a year. That is very good. It is a success. Camelot's gross take will be between &#163;1.5 billion and &#163;2 billion over the seven years of the licence. Will the Minister confirm the figures that Camelot has given that at present the percentage of the revenue going to good causes is 26 per cent. rather than the 28 per cent. originally promised, the percentage going to prizes is 48 per cent. rather than the 50 per cent. originally promised, and the percentage currently going to Camelot is 11 per cent. rather than 5.8 per cent.?
<P>

<a name="50330-01_para1"></a>Does the Minister agree that the profits to Camelot from the gross take of between &#163;1.5 billion and &#163;2 billion over the seven years are bound to be very high, however much it inflates its costs? Was such a high return the Government's original intention or, in disposing of this public monopoly licence to print money, were the Government taken a little for a ride?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, I cannot comment on the speculative figures quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Donoughue. We do not know what the turnover of the National Lottery will be in the future. That will depend on its success. I can tell the noble Lord that it was Parliament's decision that the National Lottery should be run by a private sector company, regulated by an <P>


<a name="column_1704"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1704</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>independent regulator. In his evaluation of the eight bids the Director-General of the National Lottery took many factors into account. He selected Camelot because, in his opinion, it maximised the return for good causes, which is the purpose of the National Lottery, and Camelot's retention of revenue was the lowest of all the applicants.
<P>

<a name="50330-01_para2"></a>I can tell the noble Lord the figures so far. Up to the 19th week there have been sales of &#163;1,120 million; prizes of &#163;505 million, including a jackpot of &#163;156 million; 177 jackpot winners and 21 million winners overall. Tickets are now being sold in 19,000 different outlets. So far the proceeds for good causes amount to &#163;292 million.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spnew2"></A><B> The Viscount of Falkland: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Viscount give a layman's answer to a layman's question? What is the relationship between the profit of the operating company when the lottery is operating evenly and any increases which one hopes will arise in moneys available for good causes? Is there a relationship between the two that can be readily understood?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, there is certainly a relationship between the success of the lottery in selling tickets and maximising the amount available for good causes. Camelot has been granted a licence to operate the lottery until 30th September 2001. After paying 5 per cent. commission to retailers, Camelot will retain between 5 per cent. and 6 per cent. to cover operating costs and any profit. Obviously, the better it does maximises the amount for good causes, which is after all the purpose of the lottery.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clark of Kempston: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that whatever profit Camelot makes, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will receive corporation tax? Does he also agree that the Exchequer will also benefit from the profits made by retailers, on which they will pay corporation tax?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will do rather well. Not only will he take a sum of money from the sales of lottery tickets but, as my noble friend said, he will also receive money should corporation tax become payable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Shepherd: </B>   My Lords, the Minister said that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will do very well. Has he any evidence yet as to the consequences for other charities, such as Save the Children? I have heard that there has been a considerable fall in the moneys going to such charities as a consequence of the lottery. Has the Minister any evidence to that effect?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, it is extremely difficult to predict or analyse charitable donations. There is no evidence so far that charitable giving has suffered since the introduction of the National Lottery. Commitments were made during the passage of the Bill that the Home Secretary would monitor charitable income following the launch of the National Lottery. That monitoring has already started. The Home Office intends to report to Parliament in the future. It will also report to Parliament <P>


<a name="column_1705"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1705</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on the level of betting levy in the spring of 1996. The Government believe that the public will continue to buy tickets for society lotteries in order to support their sports club or favourite cause. The Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976 was amended to allow for greater prizes and larger levels of turnover for the promoters of small charities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Viscount confirm that since the advent of the National Lottery there has been a considerable adverse effect on the income of the pools promoters? Has he any evidence to show that as a result the pools promoters will reduce the very generous contributions that they make to the sports and the arts?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, the Government have taken heed of that possibility, and in response to a request from the pools companies we have relaxed the ban on advertising for the pools on TV and radio. That comes into effect shortly. The Government will then monitor the effect on pools turnover as a result of those changes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Viscount confirm that it is the Government's intention to count the disposal of the proceeds of the National Lottery as part of public expenditure? If that is so, will he indicate whether it follows that there would be some corresponding reduction in government funding in the areas in question?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spnew11"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, the Government have always made it clear that there will be no case by case reductions in the conventional public expenditure programmes to take account of awards from the National Lottery.
<P>

<a name="50330-01_para3"></a>I should tell your Lordships that the Sports Council has already made some awards. The Arts Council this morning made its first awards which included &#163;29,000 to Great Grimsby Borough Council for the purchase of a grand piano. It will probably be the grandest piano ever seen in Great Grimsby.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, although that may be the case, do the Government agree with me that the three options in the article I have in mind cover the field well and provide the possibility of a better development than the present position? If the House will forgive me, perhaps I may say this briefly&#151;-

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spnew13"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   No!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may ask the Minister whether he has read the article in question and whether he recalls that there are three options. The first is to continue as we are; the second relates to nuclear disarmament; and the third is to take a fresh approach to the nuclear question on an international basis. That proposal is made by Mr. John Gordon, a distinguished civil servant and one-time adviser on these matters in the Foreign Office. Therefore, will the noble Lord not dismiss the idea as being put forward by a candidate for nuclear disarmament?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199495/ldhansrd/vo950330/text/50330-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, obviously I would dismiss the idea if it were put forward by the noble Lord. There are, in fact, two papers published by ISIS. I have read the article to which I presume the noble Lord refers, which sets out three options. As the noble Lord quite rightly points out, the first of those options is very much the option which Her Majesty's Government pursue. For the reasons that I gave in my original Answer, we shall continue to pursue that option.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Chalfont: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that it might assist the House to put the Question into perspective if it knew that the ISIS organisation does not put forward proposals, but that those who write for it express their own private views? The private views on the subject of nuclear weapons of those who wrote these papers are fairly well known. Finally, the project is funded by an American organisation called the Ploughshares Fund, USA, the name of which I think sufficiently indicates its ideology.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I greatly welcome the noble Lord's very well informed contribution to the debate. As I said in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Putney, the first of the options put forward is in fact the option that Her Majesty's Government pursue and will continue to pursue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mayhew: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that it is important to consider carefully the source of unsolicited briefing on defence matters? In the old days almost all briefing came, directly or indirectly, from the Russians. Then the CIA caught up and one had to watch that aspect, too. It so happens that I have read the article and investigated the background of ISIS. I find it completely honourable. I even looked at the grants given by the Ploughshares Fund, USA organisation and <P>


<a name="column_1707"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1707</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concluded that a suspicious person might convict that body of some pro-Israeli bias. However, on the whole it is completely harmless and very informative.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that I can add much in answering the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, other than to repeat what I said in my original Answer: that we welcome all contributions to the debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Caldecote: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the British nuclear deterrent could be abolished in the twinkling of an eye, but that it would take 10 years or more to re-establish it, during which time world circumstances might change radically? Is it not sensible, therefore, to continue the nuclear deterrent at least for the time being?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is quite right. The nuclear deterrent has contributed a great deal to our security over the years. We are committed to securing an unconditional, indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. However, it would be naive to think that one could "disinvent" the nuclear deterrent overnight. Similarly, it would be unwise to remove our own nuclear deterrent unilaterally in the way that some suggest.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that I support wholeheartedly what the noble Lord, Lord Mayhew, said about ISIS? It is a non-party organisation entirely devoted to informing your Lordships and Members of Parliament on questions of the day. It does not pretend to be a lobbying organisation.
<P>

<a name="50330-02_para0"></a>Furthermore, perhaps I may support the views of the noble Lord, Lord Mayhew, on the Ploughshares Fund, USA. It is a charity which has been set up for certain purposes. I shall not read out the grants that have been given, but refer to King's College Centre for Defence Studies, and so on. Perhaps we may take it that it is not a pressure group in that sense.
<P>

<a name="50330-02_para1"></a>Coming back to the Question, will the noble Lord confirm that there are three options? Will he confirm, too, that the Government are taking into consideration the three options rather than simply sticking to the line that they have announced time and again? Is there no flexibility in the Government's view?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord asked a number of questions. I can only say that I note what he put forward in the form of questions. I note, too, his introductory comments regarding the three different options. I made my response quite clear in answer to his noble friend Lord Jenkins. There were three options. The Government welcome the fact that the first is the option which Her Majesty's Government continue to pursue. We shall consider other options as we welcome debate in these matters; but we do not believe that those options are as worthy of consideration as the first option.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord consider opening his mind a little on this point? Is he aware that the second option&#151;it is the one I ask him <P>


<a name="column_1708"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1708</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to consider&#151;is not a nuclear disarmament proposal? If he will open his mind he may find points in the article which the Government could at least consider.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I believe that if anyone should consider opening his mind it is the noble Lord opposite. Her Majesty's Government have listened to the noble Lord on this subject for a great many years. Many of my colleagues have answered the noble Lord's questions. I do not believe that there is much more that we can add.

<A NAME="50330-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will add to the agenda and scope of the Intergovernmental Conference, as set out in their memorandum FCO/19C/95 of March 1995, the question of the functions, powers and structures of the European Community institutions, including the need to make changes where necessary.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, some institutional questions, such as the number of commissioners and the arrangements for qualified majority voting, are already on the agenda for next year's IGC. Other items may be added.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord for that reply from which I gather that he does not propose to follow the line of action suggested in the Question.
<P>

<a name="50330-02_para2"></a>As the President of the Commission has already instructed the member states of the Intergovernmental Conference about the conclusions to which the Commission requires them to come, does the noble Lord agree that perhaps the time has arrived when the member states themselves ought to consider the position of the Commission? Instead of the Commission being the master over the whole process, it might be well worth while for the Council to assert its authority and for the Commission to become its servant rather than its master.
<P>

<a name="50330-02_para3"></a>I only ask for the matter to be considered; I do not act as an advocate. Does the noble Lord believe that these matters ought to receive some consideration after all this time?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, the European Commission is not in a position to give instructions to the Council of Ministers. It is the Council of Ministers that takes decisions in the European Union. Under Article N of the Maastricht Treaty it is quite clear that the government of any member state or the Commission <P>


<a name="column_1709"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1709</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>may submit to the Council proposals for the amendment of the treaties on which the union is founded. It is the Council that determines the agenda of the IGC.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew16"></A><B> The Earl of Clanwilliam: </B>   My Lords, as regards what the noble Lord said, by what authority does the Commission have the audacity, without the consent of the Council of Ministers, to address itself in provocative terms to the sovereign nation of Canada?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, later today my noble friend Lord Howe will answer a Question on the matter and it will be more to your Lordships' benefit to address that question to him. There will then be a great deal more time in which the matter can be widely canvassed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the history of the past 20 years in Europe might have been better had the relationship between the Commission and the member states been more along the lines indicated by my noble friend Lord Bruce? The idea that the Commission is the master of the Council of Ministers is a travesty to anyone who knows anything about the way in which it operates.
<P>

<a name="50330-02_para4"></a>Leaving aside whether the Commission is master or servant, will the Government confirm that they do not see the Intergovernmental Conference as a kind of constitutional convention drafting a framework for future European co-operation, but rather they see it&#151;at least I thought they did&#151;as an opportunity for assessing the effects of Maastricht so far and of pointing out some of the difficulties which might arise in the relatively near future?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Richard, described in general terms the Government's view about the IGC. After all, the Maastricht Treaty has only been working for about a year. These are early days and we must give the treaty time to bed down. We wish to see a thorough examination of the detail of how matters are working and where we can produce suggestions for improvement so that they work better not only for ourselves but for other member states. That is the approach that we shall adopt.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, I appreciate that the Government may wish to play down the IGC. Is the Minister aware that senior figures in the German Government and the German Parliament are pressing for quick implementation of economic and monetary union and a single currency? They also advocate the abolition of the three pillars&#151;defence, foreign affairs and home affairs &#151;and their incorporation into the Community idea along with qualified majority voting. Will the Government give the assurance that they will oppose all those ideas coming from the Germans and also from elsewhere?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord asked two separate questions. The first related to economic and monetary union. As he knows, there are provisions in place in the treaty relating to those matters which are outside the scope of the IGC.
<P>

<a name="50330-03_para1"></a>As regards the other matters, the noble Lord referred to German ideas which are at variance with the ideas of the British Government. The British Government are clear that the creation of the pillared structures in the Maastricht Treaty provides a good basis for future co-operation. We believe that the IGC should seek to improve their working and not replace them. That is our position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that enlargement and reform of the common agricultural policy are subjects to be included on the IGC agenda? If so, does he accept that to reach a successful result on these two subjects a conclusion must be agreed on the controversial subject of qualified majority voting, which he has mentioned?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lady Rawlings is right about enlargement which is on the IGC agenda. We understand that were the common agricultural policy in its present form, together with the structural funds, to remain unchanged, the joining of the four Visegrad countries would add an extra &#163;39 billion a year to European Community budget expenditure. We consider that that is unsustainable. It provides an overriding imperative for common agricultural policy reform.

As I described, a report was commissioned by the European Union into proposals for strengthening the existing sarcophagus at Chernobyl and building a new shelter around it. I understand that that report amounts to 2,000 pages and it has been presented, as I described, to the meeting in Kiev. It belongs to the European Commission and is confidential. Press releases were issued about it which led to the report to which the noble Lord referred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, it may be that I misunderstood the noble Lord's Answer. Is he aware that the one thing surely that Chernobyl taught us is that we all live on the same planet? If there is a further explosion and fall-out, we are one of the countries that will suffer. Will the noble Lord accept that we agree with him that the European Union has a central role to play? I am not concerned with the suppression of the report. But if there is a danger, does he accept that saying that it is a matter for the Ukrainian authorities in due course is a preposterous Answer? The Ukrainian authorities have nowhere near the money required to deal with the problem, if it exists. Surely this is at least a European Union matter; and it is almost certainly an international atomic energy matter. Should not the British Government be using all their good offices to see that something happens on an international scale, if for no other reason than we are ourselves at risk?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord gets to the heart of the matter. That is why, at the G7 Naples summit, proposals for an action plan were taken forward which involve very considerable sums of western money, if the Ukrainians agree.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Beloff: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend join me in making an appeal to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Putney, and certain other noble Lords opposite to stop reading the Sunday newspapers, which are full of reports, most of which are untrue?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, I take only one Sunday newspaper&#151;and that is normally one Sunday newspaper too many.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Molloy: </B>   My Lords, bearing in mind what my noble friend Lord Jenkins said and what the Minister himself said, does the Minister not agree that at the very <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>mention of Chernobyl millions of people in this country and throughout the British Commonwealth of Nations and the USA are of the opinion that, unless there is sensible and civilised collaboration among all countries, this terrible event could happen again on a much bigger scale? Are the Government prepared to hold talks with the United States, the British Commonwealth of Nations and other countries involved to see whether we can find some civilised way to make sure that such a dreadful event can never happen again?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord said, the name Chernobyl is inevitably associated with such disasters. It is the wish of all people in the world that such an event does not occur again. Action is being taken in all sorts of ways to try to achieve what the noble Lord refers to&#151;for example, the action plan that I mentioned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend accept that there have been serious investigative reports indicating that a very large number of the ex-Soviet Union installations are thoroughly unsafe and that the prevailing risk is very severe and should not be taken lightly?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is quite right. There are 13 other reactors similar to the type at Chernobyl that are currently operational in the former Soviet Union: 11 in Russia and two in Lithuania.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington </B>   moved Amendment No. 18:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 Page 12, line 19, at end insert:
<br>
("( (aa) after that subsection insert&#151;
<br>
"( ) For the purpose of ensuring the effective integration of clinical teaching and research within the National Health Service, the Secretary of State shall, in relation to any committee, office or other body which he establishes to exercise any regional management function within the National Health Service, provide, following consultation with the relevant universities, that at least one member of that committee, office or body is a representative of the university medical or dental schools within that region.".").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50330-04_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: In the absence of the noble Lord, Lord Walton, and with his permission, I rise to move the amendment, which also stands in my name and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Robson. With this amendment I also speak to Amendment No. 24.
<P>

<a name="50330-04_para1"></a>The purpose of these two amendments is to formalise the involvement of academic medicine in the new NHS structures, and to probe the Government's present rather unsatisfactory suggestions for resolving this question.
<P>

<a name="50330-04_para2"></a>Universities with undergraduate medical and dental schools have a key role in underpinning the National Health Service. The noble Lord, Lord Walton, who unfortunately cannot be with us today, and the noble Lord, Lord Dainton, were eloquent in exploring the importance of this role at Second Reading. The noble Lord, Lord Walton, in referring back to the debates on this subject that were held in this House in 1990 during the passage of the Health Service and Community Care Bill, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am absolutely convinced that, in the light of the important development in medical care, in medical education and research and in the education of the other caring professions, such a link"&#151;</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-04_para3"></a>the link between the universities and the health service&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is even more important now than it was at that time".&#151;[Official Report, 6/3/95; col. 26.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-04_para4"></a>Amendment No. 24 refers to the membership of the new health authorities. As the Committee will know, the Government accepted in the other place that the new health authorities will have a statutory duty to include a member from a local university where that is relevant. However, this is a provision to be contained in regulations&#151;regulations which are, of course, as yet unknown. But the professional bodies, led by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, is anxious that the regulations ensure that the new arrangements work at least as well as the existing ones.
<P>

<a name="50330-04_para5"></a>There are many concerns and uncertainties surrounding, for example, the merger of academic institutions and institutions involved with research. Members of the Committee will remember that we heard the noble Lord, Lord Walton, refer to the particular problems of the National Hospital for Neurology and Nervous Diseases earlier this week and the potential threat to academic work and research because of the potential merger when that hospital is moved. There are also concerns and uncertainties about the new arrangements for medical training and for funding <P>


<a name="column_1714"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1714</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>research. They are such that the Committee for Vice-Chancellors and Principals feels that its members would have much more confidence in the future if the Government were to accept this amendment and the requirement for university representation on local health authorities were placed on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50330-04_para6"></a>There is even greater anxiety about the new regional outposts of the Department of Health which are the subject of Amendment No. 18. At present, relevant universities have statutory membership of regional health authorities, which enables them to participate in planning and decision-making at that level. If the universities are not included in the new regional arrangements, their important contribution will be lost. And, very importantly, the issues of postgraduate medical education and the supervision of vocational training for general practitioners will be thrown into disarray.
<P>

<a name="50330-04_para7"></a>Another crucial area is the distribution of the special funding for teaching and research&#151;what the noble Lord, Lord Walton, referred to at Second Reading as "that animal known as SIFTR". This money, which sustains most of the innovative work in the health service, must be distributed on a strategic basis with universities playing a leading role. It is inappropriate that this should be done at the local health authority or trust level. It is difficult to see how the strategic role of the universities in distributing and helping to guide and advise on SIFTR can be achieved effectively if the universities are not formally linked to the new regional offices. That is the purpose of this amendment.
<P>

<a name="50330-04_para8"></a>I understand that there has been correspondence between the Secretary of State and Dr. Edwards, who is the chairman of the CVCP, about achieving effective arrangements without the statutory requirements of legislation. I understand that the Secretary of State told Dr. Edwards that regional directors have been reminded that they should take account of the views of the universities "in appropriate circumstances". However, Dr. Edwards wrote to the Secretary of State on 1st March stating that this was an inadequate safeguard. He said that there was a need for a clear and unambiguous formal mechanism. He went on to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The fact that letters have to be written reminding Regional Directors to take account of the views of universities 'in appropriate circumstances' underlines the very heart of the problem. From my own experience, and that of other statutory university representatives at the regional level it is precisely when they are in at the decision making level that their role is most valuable in alerting and reminding their colleagues of the implications of health service-led decisions on the research and teaching base. It is not clear from your letter who is to decide when and what would be 'appropriate circumstances'".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-04_para9"></a>The CVCP has further asked that, if it is unacceptable to the Government that the arrangement for a formal link between its members in the universities and the regional outposts is included in statute, they should at least be consulted about the regulations which will govern the appointments and arrangements. I understand further that the Secretary of State again responded to the CVCP in the past week offering informal discussion but no proper consultation about the regulations. Quite rightly, the CVCP does not feel that this is good enough.
<P>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1715</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-04_para10"></a>All of this is of great significance to distinguished members of the medical profession, and indeed to the universities in general. It is also very important to the users of the NHS. The academic medicine which has underpinned standards of care and improved services for patients has been a very important ingredient in the National Health Service in the past. We have heard that in the present and the future evidence-based health service care is to be the theme of the new health service. I hope very much that in the spirit of maintaining excellence, the Government will be able to accept these amendments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Robson of Kiddington: </B>   I rise to support these two amendments. We on these Benches consider them to be two of the most important amendments to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50330-04_para11"></a>The success of the NHS is largely dependent on the quality of doctors and dentists trained and educated in university medical and dental schools and on the research which leads to advances in medical care. Close co-operation between clinicians employed by the universities and those employed by the NHS is essential for the maintenance of medical standards in the future.
<P>

<a name="50330-04_para12"></a>Health authorities inevitably have to make decisions which may have an impact on medical training and research. It is most important that there is a member who combines expertise both in clinical practice and in teaching and research drawn from the universities. The Government have recognised the need for universities which have medical and dental schools to be members of the relevant health authorities. As the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, said, that will be a requirement contained in the regulations.
<P>

<a name="50330-04_para13"></a>I am not fond of things contained in regulations. This is such an important issue that it should be on the face of the Bill. On the other hand, at present the universities have statutory membership of the RHAs. When the RHAs are abolished and replaced by regional outposts of the NHS Executive, there is no requirement for relevant universities to be part of the regional office. To me that is an enormous mistake, I urge the Government to think again.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I agree with the statements that have been made about the importance of this issue, but I believe that it will be covered by regulations. I rise to speak on these amendments only because the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, brought out a point about the National Hospital for Neurology and Nervous Diseases, which I feel was rather a red herring. It was about as inaccurate as the Evening Standard reports, which said that this was a shotgun marriage and the hospital would be closed by the end of April. That is not the situation at all. The hospital has been told to choose a partner for itself.
<P>

<a name="50330-04_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Walton, is a great expert in this field and I am sorry that he is not in the Chamber. He might perhaps have put the case slightly differently or perhaps his points would have been accepted. But I do not believe that this amendment is in any way related to the future of that particular hospital. Everyone wishes to <P>


<a name="column_1716"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1716</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ensure a safe future for the National. The present decisions that have been made have been announced in order to give the hospital itself time to consider what it wants to do.
<P>

<a name="50330-04_para15"></a>As chairman of the Royal Free hospital, I know that we should love to have that hospital as a partner. But I read in the newspaper that it is much more likely to go to the UCL. But we do have close working links with the National now and there will be combined medical schools of University College and the Royal Free; so there is no question but that the institute will go to that combined body, as will most of the postgraduate institutes in that area.
<P>

<a name="50330-04_para16"></a>I feel that that matter is a small red herring in relation to these amendments. I could not let it go without some comment.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   Perhaps I may respond very briefly to the noble Baroness on that point. I am sorry if she felt that I spoke like the Evening Standard. That was not my intention. My hope was to sound much more like the noble Lord, Lord Walton. Obviously, I did not succeed.
<P>

<a name="50330-05_para0"></a>I heard the Question put by the noble Lord, Lord Walton, on Monday. It did not reflect the positive virtues or otherwise of any alternative plan for the future of the National hospital. Indeed, any hospital which acquired that particular resource would be very fortunate. I believe that the noble Lord was referring in part to the uncertainty around the whole area of research and development and the research focus on hospitals in London, as well as other places in the country. It was that concern in this administrative area that I sought to illustrate, giving an example of the way in which the universities, if included in planning and strategy, automatically have a voice at the table, which they might not have under the new arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I thank the noble Baroness for that clarification. I agree that the institutes and research are extremely important. But the message that comes through to me very clearly on a day to day basis in the National Health Service is that everyone is very conscious of the importance of research. I do not believe that any of those research facilities are threatened. In fact, I believe that they will expand as time goes by.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness McFarlane of Llandaff: </B>   As one who worked for 17 years in a medical school, I should like to add my support to this amendment. I worked and watched the very close relationship between the regional authorities, the health authorities and the trusts. I am convinced that it achieved a great deal in the interests not only of medical education, nursing education and education of other health professionals but also in research and the quality of clinical care. It would be unthinkable that we should lose any of that very close relationship between the authorities and the universities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I share the view of the noble Baroness, Lady McFarlane. It is unthinkable that there should not be a very proper close and continuous interaction between the medical schools, the universities <P>


<a name="column_1717"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1717</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and in particular the deans of the medical schools&#151;I would also add the Royal colleges&#151;and the organisation of the health service.
<P>

<a name="50330-05_para1"></a>The problem arises with the abolition of regional health authorities and the conversion of the regions into outposts of the management executive. They are birds of a different feather; a different kind of animal to which one does not appoint, as it were, outside members. I have absolutely no doubt about the future turbulent process of change, which is already in train and affecting medical education and research. There is the Culyer Report and the Calman Report on the changing patterns of training for doctors; there will be the merger of two of the training grades (registrar and senior registrar); and there is the whole process of continuing postgraduate medical education. As employers address these matters, they will have a profound impact on the way in which the whole of the medical clinical manpower of the health service will be deployed.
<P>

<a name="50330-05_para2"></a>I have previously declared my interest as chairman of the Forest Health Care Trust. That trust has had a preliminary look at the whole raft of issues which it will have to address. It has already indicated that some sort of prioritisation of those issues will be considered. It is a huge agenda.
<P>

<a name="50330-05_para3"></a>I put to my noble friend on the Front Bench a point which I raised at Second Reading of the Bill; namely, that I am not yet convinced that the whole of that process, which is very properly being driven by the Department of Health and the management executive&#151;indeed, principally by the chief medical officer and others&#151;is at the moment being meshed in with the process of change, which is the subject of this Bill. It comes to a head with Amendment No. 18, with which I have some sympathy. I look forward with great interest to hearing whether my noble friend is able to put a little more flesh onto the bare bones of the suggestion that this matter will be dealt with by regulation. We want to hear exactly how the universities will have that continuing interaction at the regional level, so that the many issues which affect medical education and research are addressed with the full understanding and input of the universities. It is enormously important.
<P>

<a name="50330-05_para4"></a>During the passage of the 1990 Bill we secured the representation on a trust with a teaching hospital of a university representative. Noble Lords will remember that I spoke in favour of that. I have to say to the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, that I am less convinced that the same applies to commissioning authorities. Their role will increasingly develop into a different one. Therefore, I have rather less sympathy with Amendment No. 24 than I have for Amendment No. 18. However, in one form or another, Amendment No. 18 appears to me to have cardinal importance as the health service develops because of the huge agenda of change that surrounds the whole question of medical education.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-05_para5"></a>I know that my noble friend the Minister is well seized of the issue, and I shall not take up any more time before she is able to reassure us. I should just like her to know that I, too, am concerned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-05_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   I shall do my very best to clothe the skeleton to which my noble friend Lord Jenkin referred. I understand the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, and very much respect the views of the noble Baronesses, Lady Robson and Lady McFarlane.
<P>

<a name="50330-05_para6"></a>The Government are strongly committed to the vital partnership between universities and the new National Health Service. We will work with them to achieve the highest standards of education and research. Your Lordships will perhaps be aware of the major changes to the funding and support of research and development to which my noble friend has referred. Those developments were announced at the end of last year in response to the Culyer Report. The new measures will include: bringing together all NHS research and development funds into a single funding stream; an extra &#163;8 million in 1995-96 for research commissioned by the NHS; and the creation of a national forum to bring together the major funders of health research to provide advice to the NHS and the Government. The new system will be put in place at the same time as the measures in this Bill on 1st April 1996. Before then, we look forward to the report of your Lordships' Committee on Science and Technology when it has completed its current inquiry into medical research.
<P>

<a name="50330-05_para7"></a>There will continue to be a national NHS research and development strategy, but the regional offices will have an important role in informing national priority setting. Each region will have a director of research and development in a senior post.
<P>

<a name="50330-05_para8"></a>As your Lordships have emphasised this afternoon, the relationship with the universities is crucial. For that reason, we have already given a clear undertaking that we will include in regulations a requirement that health authorities whose areas include a medical or dental school must have a university representative as a non-executive member. Trusts with significant teaching responsibilities already have a similar requirement. It is in line with our general approach to membership to specify that requirement in regulations. These will be made shortly after the Bill's passage.
<P>

<a name="50330-05_para9"></a>The regional offices are very different bodies from the old RHAs. They will not have boards on which different groups are represented. Therefore, it will not be appropriate to have a university representative within the regional office. However, the Government recognise the need for links with universities at regional, and indeed national, level. There will continue to be important strategic bodies at national level, including the Steering Group on Undergraduate Medical and Dental Education and Research, chaired by the Department of Health's permanent secretary. Its members include representatives from the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, the general medical and dental councils and the Medical Research Council.
<P>


<a name="column_1719"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1719</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-05_para10"></a>The steering Group agreed the 10 key principles which will continue to guide NHS and university relationships. As regards medical workforce planning, the Advisory Group on Medical and Dental Education, Training and Staffing will continue. Chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, this brings together medical professional representatives with the NHS executive to advise Ministers and that executive. Planning the number of higher specialist trainees will be an important part of its work.
<P>

<a name="50330-05_para11"></a>At regional level my right honourable friend the Secretary of State has asked the regional chairmen to take particular responsibility for building links with the universities. The postgraduate dean will be a key link between the regional office and the university, and the consultation paper published by the Government this week will help to ensure that we get the right arrangements in place for medical education at this level.
<P>

<a name="50330-05_para12"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Jay, mentioned the correspondence that had taken place between the Secretary of State and Dr. Edwards, chairman of the CVCP. Correspondence has indeed taken place. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has willingly agreed to let Dr. Edwards have sight of and comment upon the final draft of the membership regulations as early as possible. In addition, the effectiveness and continuing relevance of the 10 key principles has just been examined in detail by the Joint Medical Advisory Committee of the Higher Education Funding Councils of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. They have concluded that the NHS and universities continue to conduct an effective dialogue. We will ensure that that continues under the new arrangements in this Bill. I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, will be content with this, because it concerns the issues that she raises in relation to SIFTR. An advisory group with senior medical and education membership is reviewing the future arrangements for funding NHS teaching. That body has been asked to report by the end of March, which will allow time for us to consult key groups before implementation in 1996-97.
<P>

<a name="50330-05_para13"></a>I deal finally with the point raised by my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes concerning the National Hospital. All of our endeavours are intended to strengthen the excellence and expertise of the institute and hospital. That was a point that I tried to make yesterday in the debate in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="50330-05_para14"></a>With those remarks, I very much hope that the noble Baroness will agree to withdraw this amendment.

<A NAME="50330-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   I thank the Minister for her very detailed reply. It put much more flesh on the bones which before had been rather bare. She mentioned the need for chairmen to achieve links with the universities, which were being encouraged by the Secretary of State. That is precisely the kind of informal arrangement, which depends on individual personalities and the good will of different people in different parts of the country, about which the CVCP has felt uneasy. But I fear that, though the Minister has put much more flesh on the bones, the clear and unambiguous formal <P>

However, as the noble Lord, Lord Walton&#151;the original author of these amendments&#151;is not present, on the understanding that he may wish to bring the matter back at Report, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington </B>   moved Amendment No. 19:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 Page 19, line 41, leave out ("appointed by the Secretary of State") and insert ("elected by members of the authority.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50330-06_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 19, I should also like to speak to Amendments Nos. 21 and 22. All three are exploratory amendments designed to look at ways to improve the selection of health authority members and suggest alternatives to those that are proposed by the Government. They try to address some of the public anxiety that surrounds the question of appointments to health authorities. They are also designed to root health authorities in their local communities and correct the so-called democratic deficit. If authorities and trusts are to retain and improve public confidence, a rigorous process of selection, appointment and reappointment of their boards is necessary. At the moment, the practice varies between the different territories and, within England, between the various regions. We know that the regions in their present form will cease to exist, and there is little evidence of awareness of a need for some universal standards to be applied.
<P>

<a name="50330-06_para2"></a>I remind the Committee that the Committee on Standards in Public Life of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nolan, has received more representations on the question of membership of health authorities than on any other subject. The evidence given to that committee by the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts was that, in order to improve the present situation, more people needed to be attracted to putting their names forward for consideration for appointment. Greater balance needed to be shown in the people appointed in order to embrace different skills, experience, attitudes and background, and the process of appointing and reappointing chairmen and non-executives needed to be transparent and more rigorous.
<P>

<a name="50330-06_para3"></a>Amendment No. 19 addresses the question of how the chair of a local health authority will be selected. The Committee will know that the Bill proposes that this should continue to be done directly by the Secretary of State for Health. The amendment proposes that, although this may continue to be someone appointed under a selection system, which I shall describe as one alternative in a later amendment, once one has agreed a group of local people (all, it is to be hoped, with local interests and local responsibilities) and who must know each other better, one assumes, than the Secretary of State, they should themselves elect their own chair. After all, that is done at every level in every organisation, whether it is a voluntary body, a political party, any form of charity or any other informal organisation.

<P>

<a name="50330-06_para4"></a>The amendment would correct some of the feeling that all chairmen are simply there as place people of the Secretary of State. I shall forbear this afternoon getting into the argument about whether they need to be political place people. If a simple system were adopted whereby on a more free basis members were appointed to authorities, there should be little to stand in the way of the local members, with their local appreciation of each other and their understanding of the qualifications of their colleagues, electing their own chairman.
<P>

<a name="50330-06_para5"></a>Amendment No. 21 refers to a method which was originally suggested by Mrs. Winifred Tumim. She has written about this proposal in the Health Director magazine this year and has also canvassed the idea very widely. She is a non-executive member of a London trust and has enormous experience in the voluntary sector. Drawing on that experience she has suggested&#151;I am in agreement with her about this possibility being considered&#151;that community health councils could act as a form of electoral college and that perhaps two or three board members could be elected by that local community health council. Candidates would have to agree to give a minimum monthly time commitment and a commitment to undertake training on appointment. It would not be possible to serve on both bodies simultaneously, although CHC members in their current role would be eligible to stand for election. Once selected, the elected board members of the community health council would serve as individuals and not as representatives of that council.
<P>

<a name="50330-06_para6"></a>Although that process may at first sight seem somewhat cumbersome, it is a proposal which enables people who are involved in their local community and who have already shown an interest in the management and operation of the health service to become more formally involved in the decision-making process and, indeed, to reach that level by a form of election. Community health councils, as we discussed during the previous Committee day debate, have sometimes come to feel rather marginalised in the new organisation of the NHS. This would be a way of ensuring a degree of community health council involvement at a very important level and would also add an element of election into new health authorities which I think could be very appropriate.
<P>

<a name="50330-06_para7"></a>I suspect that the Minister will reject out of hand both Amendments Nos. 19 and 21 partly because they include this element of election. But I would hope that she would look favourably at the suggestion of Amendment No. 22, which would simply bring the situation in England and Wales into line with what is now happening in Scotland. Perhaps I may remind the Committee of the situation in Scotland. Last August the Secretary of State for Scotland announced the creation of a committee of five, which I believe is chaired by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, to advise him on the appointment and reappointment of non-executive members of health boards and directors of trusts. That was repeating an earlier exercise which was conducted two or three years ago and was intended to broaden the selection base for health authorities and trusts.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-06_para8"></a>Invitations were issued in Scotland to a wide range of bodies which represented many different aspects of community life. Opposition party leaders were invited to put forward names, and advertisements were placed in newspapers across the country inviting people to put forward their names. Initial interviews are undertaken by the chairmen of relevant boards and trusts and recommendations are then forwarded to the advisory committee for consideration. In addition, reports are submitted of those existing members of boards and trusts who wish to be considered for reappointment. That seems to be a system which we could well adopt south of the Border. There seems no reason why this independent advisory body should not in some form or another be part of our system in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="50330-06_para9"></a>Consideration should also be given to the appointment of an advisory committee on appointments within each of the territories&#151;in England, each of the regions&#151;which would embrace regional chairmen or the regional non-executive members of the NHS policy boards, as they will be after April 1996, and eminent people from outside the NHS who could advise the Secretary of State on the appointments and monitoring process. That would be broadly similar, again, to the arrangement in Scotland. Once that advisory board had screened the names initially put forward, a chairman or a non-executive person nominated for such a position should be asked to attend a briefing seminar to make them aware both of the problems and the issues that may arise from being a member of a health authority board or trust and aware of the commitment that they would be asked to take on. That might absolve many of the authorities and trusts from some of the difficulties which we described as being current when we discussed an earlier amendment. People shortlisted for appointments should be asked to give the names of referees and should be interviewed by a panel established for that purpose.
<P>

<a name="50330-06_para10"></a>I would remind the Committee that when Mr. Langlands, the Chief Executive of the Health Service, described to Lord Nolan's Committee the arrangements which the Government are now suggesting for improving the selection to health authorities and hospital trusts, the committee members described themselves as being disappointed by the suggestions. They described the suggestions for reform, which also include advertising but no formal independent scrutiny by an independent body, as "inbred", and they criticised them because there was no suggestion of any form of election and, more specifically, because of the lack of independent assessment.
<P>

<a name="50330-06_para11"></a>These amendments, which are exploratory and designed partially to make suggestions about ways in which the present situation could be improved, would meet those three criticisms. They would meet the criticism that the Government's suggestions are inbred; they would meet the criticism that there is a lack of election; and they would meet the criticism of there being a lack of any independent assessment of those <P>

<A NAME="50330-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Tope: </B>   I rise to support Amendments Nos. 19 and 21, but not Amendment No. 22, about which we have reservations. The noble Baroness, Lady Jay of Paddington, has made the case very well indeed for some form of independent appointments committee. She is certainly right in saying that there is great concern about the current method of appointment to health authorities. The proposals she has put forward are an interesting way of trying to address some of those anxieties. At the very least, members of health authorities should have the right and should be trusted to appoint their own chairmen. After all, that is what the Government have allowed the new police authorities to do. If the Minister is not minded to accept the amendment, I hope that she will explain to the Committee why the Government feel that police authorities can be trusted to appoint their own chairmen but that new health authorities cannot be so trusted. We support Amendments Nos. 19 and 21.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-07_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   The appointment of the chairmen of health authorities by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State provides a direct line of accountability from the chairman, through her, to Parliament. To break that line by the election of the chairman by his or her colleagues on a health authority would reduce that accountability rather than improve it. An internal system of making such an important appointment flies in the face of all our moves to open up the appointments process. It would only lead to more allegations of "jobs for the boys and girls".
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para0"></a>The Committee will be aware that on 14th February the Secretary of State published new guidelines on the appointments process. They reinforce the key principles of the appointments process that all appointments should be made on merit and individuals appointed solely for the skills, experience and the commitment that they bring to the National Health Service. Appointments should be open to as wide a range of people as possible. The process for identifying appointees should be transparent and clearly understood by candidates and the public. A policy of equal opportunities should be pursued.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para1"></a>We could not ensure that these very simple principles were adhered to if the appointment of the chairman was conducted by the members of the health authority. This amendment would do nothing to make sure that appointments were made openly on the basis of merit.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para2"></a>The Secretary of State is able, when making the appointment of chairmen, to look at the matter impartially, with due regard to the advice of others. She can ensure that her decision is based on what is best for the health service rather than on what is best for those appointed to serve on the authority.
<P>


<a name="column_1724"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1724</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para3"></a>The appointment of chairmen by the Secretary of State means that national standards are applied to these key appointments, ensuring that every health authority across the country will benefit from the appointment of the highest calibre chairman.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para4"></a>The new guidelines on appointments made it clear&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-07_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Robson of Kiddington: </B>   The noble Baroness spoke about people having not the same feeling and desires to do the right thing by the health service because they have not been appointed by the Secretary of State. That is absolutely unforgiveable. The fact that people are members of an authority and elect their own chairman does not make that chairman less responsible to the Secretary of State. It certainly does not make them less able.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-07_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   As I continue the noble Baroness will realise that what we are also trying to achieve is criteria against which the chairmen are judged. The criteria are set out; they are public and people can then judge. We feel that that would not be possible if health authorities elect their own chairmen from within. Having been a former chairman, as I was, the noble Baroness will be aware that special responsibilities are laid on chairmen. It is a national health service. The Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament for the whole of the National Health Service. We believe it right that she should have confidence in the chairmen who represent her at local level.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-07_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   I am sorry to interrupt the Minister. That is a rather peculiar argument. If, on the Government's arrangements, all the members of a health authority are appointed by the Secretary of State&#151;and certainly in the subsequent amendments it is simply to improve the method of assessing the people who are appointed&#151;presumably they all enjoy her confidence. Therefore, what is to prevent members of the health authority, if they are all responsible people, from electing the person whom they feel is most appropriate judging, if one wishes, on the criteria which the noble Baroness says are published and available?
<P>

<a name="50330-07_time0"></a><H5>4.15 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-07_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   Serving on a health authority, the noble Baroness will appreciate that when one is trying to build a board one chooses people with different skills because they bring forward different talents. The chairman has a different role from many of those people. One would perhaps choose as a non-executive someone who has special skills in finance or special knowledge about voluntary organisations in that area. But the leadership role of the chairman is different. It is very logical that the Secretary of State, who has to have confidence in the chairman, should appoint that person, believing that that person has the special skills to lead the team and is not someone who just makes a contribution to a team.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para5"></a>I now turn to Amendment No. 21. The new guidelines on appointments make it clear that all new candidates for non-executive appointments will be sifted by a panel of at least three people. Those chosen to serve on sifting panels should be local health authority or trust chairmen <P>


<a name="column_1725"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1725</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>or non-executives. We believe that they are best placed to judge whether a candidate is suited to the demands of service as a non-executive director, because they are already working in this area.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para6"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned the Nolan Committee. The Government are committed to a transparent, fair appointments process for NHS boards. We will consider carefully any recommendations that come from the Nolan Committee.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para7"></a>We recognise the need to avoid bias. The guidelines emphasise that the members of sifting panels should not be all drawn from the same NHS health authority or trust board and that the panel may include an independent member. This might be a member of a local community health council, or, for example, a local justice of the peace. The views of people who are more detached from the NHS can also be valuable.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para8"></a>The panels will sift all new candidates against agreed criteria so that all those recommended for appointment possess the skills, personal qualities and experience required. This use of nationally agreed criteria, against which experienced NHS chairmen and non-executives will judge candidates for non-executive appointment, is the most important element of the sifting process. It will ensure that those being recommended are of a uniformly high standard.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para9"></a>The new guidelines also emphasise the role of regional chairmen in the appointment process. They will make their own assessment of candidates before making recommendations to Ministers. This means that the suitability of any individual candidate will be double checked before he or she is recommended. So the appointments process will be conducted objectively and fairly and those finally selected really will be the best people for the job.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para10"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Jay, mentioned the Scottish system. We do not agree with the noble Baroness that the Scottish system of appointments, where Ministers are advised by an independent panel comprising people from outside the NHS, should be adopted in England. The population of Scotland is broadly equivalent to one of the eight regions in England. Problems of scale would make it extremely difficult to adapt Scottish practice for use in this country. In England the regional chairmen, who are themselves appointed for their independence, will be responsible for the rigour and integrity of the new system and will advise Ministers on appointments.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para11"></a>As regards Amendment No. 22, we have already spoken during earlier debates about the valuable role of community health councils. They are the patients' defenders, friends and representatives and we know that they are diligent in monitoring the service. They have a well deserved reputation for independence, authority and insight.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para12"></a>Community health councils have a statutory responsibility to represent the interests of the community in the National Health Service. Indeed, they have the right to be consulted on any substantial changes in services to local patients. These are important safeguards which ensure that CHCs have a voice in the <P>


<a name="column_1726"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1726</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>management of the NHS. In addition, CHCs have observer status on health authorities and the right to meet them annually.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para13"></a>As I made clear in an earlier debate, there will be no change in the requirements of health authorities to consult community health councils.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para14"></a>But the Government are not convinced that the proposals in this amendment would improve the workings of health authorities or of CHCs. We have the same reservations as the noble Lord, Lord Tope. As I understand it, this amendment will add community health council nominees to the executive and non-executive members. I would be very concerned if, as a result, the health authority began to get much larger than the dozen or so members we now envisage.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para15"></a>More importantly, we need to keep CHCs and HAs quite distinct. Community health councils speak with an independent voice. They act wholly on behalf of the local community. There must be no risk of a conflict of interest or confusion about that role. The community health council should speak clearly from outside health authorities, or trusts for that matter.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para16"></a>Indeed, that is why the current regulations governing community health councils specifically disqualify members of health authorities and trusts from membership of a community health council. If we include on a health authority members elected by the community health council we risk eroding the distinct roles of the two bodies; and we risk undermining the effective working relationships developed over the years.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para17"></a>Health authorities and community health councils perform two completely different functions. The new health authority is responsible for ensuring that the health needs of the local communities are met. The community health council is there to provide a voice, although not necessarily the only one, for the views of the local community. It is important that these two functions remain distinct if they are to be performed effectively.
<P>

<a name="50330-07_para18"></a>Having listened to my remarks, I hope that the noble Baroness will not wish to press these amendments.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   I am very grateful to the Minister for that reply. I am disappointed by her response, particularly as regards the amendment on the election of a chairman of a health authority and her response to the amendment as regards the independent advisory body. For the reasons which I believe I gave in my earlier intervention and those which were expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Robson, I find the arguments which the Minister advanced for not having a chairman elected for a local health authority to be not very convincing.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para0"></a>I can only repeat what I said when I intervened earlier; that if all members of a health authority are regarded as being of equal responsibility by the Secretary of State, I am sure that the members of the health authority themselves will be perfectly able to distinguish between their relative skills. If the chairman of a health authority is clearly inappropriate to the tasks, <P>


<a name="column_1727"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1727</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>surely that can be left to the good judgment of the authority. There does not need to be somebody hand-picked from above by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para1"></a>On the question of independent bodies to advise on appointments, I understand what the Minister said about the size of Scotland and the relative numbers in the populations that are served by the different regional offices, but that does not seem to be an argument for not adopting some form of system. After all, that system could be arranged on the new regional basis by the regional outposts. The body does not necessarily have to consider appointments for the whole of England and Wales. That is not what was suggested by the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para2"></a>I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the Government will look closely at the recommendations of the Nolan Committee on this subject. Judging from the committee's questioning of the chief executive of the National Health Service, my suspicion is that its recommendations may come closer to some of the suggestions in our amendments than to the Government's present proposals.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para3"></a>As I said earlier, the amendments are exploratory. They were designed to explore some of the different ideas for improving the democratic accountability of health authorities. However, the Minister's response has made me feel that perhaps we should return to the subject on Report. I shall examine carefully what the Minister has said, but for the moment I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para4"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes </B>   moved Amendment No. 20:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 Page 19, line 43, after ("Authority)") insert ("at least one of whom shall be a health professional working in primary care").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50330-08_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: I rise to move Amendment No. 20 because I think it important that the new health authorities, as constituted, should have a clear recognition of the role played in the health service by primary care. I believe that those involved in delivering primary care form the basis of the health service. Although we have acknowledged that in central London people tend to visit accident and emergency departments as a first port of call, that is not the pattern throughout the country. Usually, someone will visit first their GP, the local community pharmacist, dentist, midwife, practice nurse or a health visitor who may be sent in by the local council. All of those people are involved in delivering primary care and are normally a patient's first contact with the health service.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para6"></a>The work done by those involved in primary care is close to the patient and the community and is of enormous value to the health service. That is the level at which decisions are made as to who needs more complicated or specialised treatment, who should be referred on, and to where. I fear that people working in primary care are being overlooked in the Bill because they are not specifically mentioned on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para7"></a>The Royal College of General Practitioners asked me to use the term "a medical practitioner in primary care" in this amendment. The reason that I did not do that, <P>


<a name="column_1728"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1728</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>although agreeing to move the amendment, was that I did not think that we should be too specific by mentioning a "medical practitioner". However, I acknowledge that most patients would view their general practitioner as their first port of call. Indeed, general practitioners are undertaking more and more work. Many more treatments are now given within practices and standards have improved greatly. Years ago in the area where I practised as a dentist, the local GP did not have a car because he said that people lived in such a confined area that he could walk around it more readily than he could drive. That was true because the living conditions in the area were terrible. That GP was very much at the centre of the community, although the practice was primitive. I am pleased to note the way in which practices have changed over the years and that the standard of primary care provision is now so high.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para8"></a>Those involved in primary care feel that they are being ignored in the reorganisation and that their role is not receiving the recognition that it deserves. They feel that the only way in which they can be confident of having a proper degree of input is to be specifically mentioned on the face of the Bill in the provisions relating to membership of the authorities.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para9"></a>As I have said, I believe that it would be wrong to specify any particular branch of primary care because to do so would be to define that profession, and that profession only, whereas many professions are involved. I believe that the Minister referred the other day to the fact that something like 20 different professions are involved in primary care. Under the terms of my amendment, a member of any one of those professions could be chosen. The amendment would not restrict the Secretary of State to any particular branch of primary care when making appointments. However, the provisions would be some recognition of that marvellously hardworking and progressive part of the health service. That is important because the primary care service is ever-growing. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   I fully support the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, in her amendment. Once again, I apologise to her if in speaking to her last amendment I seemed to suggest a hierarchy among the professions working in the family health services authorities. That is not my view. We are certainly all in the same boat together on this. I thank the noble Baroness for putting the case for the general practitioner. It means that I do not have to do that. The noble Baroness did it very well, and it is better coming from someone who is not a general practitioner. Perhaps I may point out, however, that, although I changed from visiting patients on foot to visiting them by car, the wheel has now gone full circle because you cannot park. I find that visiting patients by pushbike is the quickest way to get around. That is the same means by which I come to your Lordships' House.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para10"></a>There are anxieties among GPs, dentists, pharmacists and opticians about the new arrangements. Unlike professionals in hospitals, they are independent contractors and wish to remain so, and the Government have agreed that their independent contractor status shall continue. The system has worked well&#151;even though it <P>


<a name="column_1729"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1729</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has its critics, including myself, with regard to certain aspects of the independent contractor system, but that is another story.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para11"></a>The new health authorities will, by merging with FHSAs, regain a dual role in primary care&#151;both as purchasers and providers, thus functioning in that respect rather like the old district health authorities prior to the 1990 Act. The FHSAs and their predecessors, the executive committees and the family practitioner committees, have had to perform the balancing act of looking after some of the interests of the professions contracted to work for the NHS in the community while at the same time administering their contracts and, among other things, operating the complaints procedures against them. In other words, they have in a sense been both poacher and gamekeeper. In most cases, they have been remarkably successful in their dual role and are regarded as friends by most of the professionals involved.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para12"></a>However, when merged with the larger and financially more powerful district health authorities to form the new combined health authorities, there are worries, first, that that carefully built-up relationship will suffer and, secondly (despite the Government's very welcome aim of building a primary care-led service) that the costly needs of the hospital service will dominate, even though it is now held at arm's length through the purchaser-provider split, and even though hospitals are now semi-independent NHS trusts.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para13"></a>Logically, it is right that primary and secondary care should be purchased by the same health authority&#151;many of us have been suggesting that for years&#151;but safeguards are needed to reassure primary care providers that their needs, and particularly those of their patients and communities, are not to be submerged. The amendment is one way in which that reassurance could be given, at least partially.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para14"></a>I should like to see more details on the face of the Bill of how the new combined health authority will be structured and regulated. Failing that, I should like to ask the Minister whether regulations governing those arrangements will be laid before this place so that we can scrutinise them. It would be preferable if that were done before Report. At this stage I ask the Minister to accept this modest amendment. But I give notice that we shall probably return to the topic on report. Conversations about it in the meantime would be very welcome.

<A NAME="50330-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   We very much share the commitment to primary care of my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes and the noble Lord, Lord Rea. As the Committee will be aware, the Government's intention is to have eventually a primary care-led NHS. But we do not believe that the best way to achieve that is by restricting non-executive membership of health authorities to particular groups. That runs contrary to our aim of opening non-executive appointments to as wide a range of people as possible.

<a name="50330-08_para15"></a>We want the new health authorities to be compact and streamlined. There will be a maximum of seven non-executive members, although the normal number will be five. We could not hope to reserve a place for each organisation and group with an interest.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para16"></a>Of course, those working in primary care have a great deal to contribute. I am sure that many HAs will have non-executive members with experience in these areas. GPs, nurses, dentists and pharmacists will be welcome to apply provided there is no conflict of interest. Indeed, I hope that many of them will apply. But to reserve a place for a representative of each of the interested groups, even if it were possible, would not be enough.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para17"></a>Since we are moving towards a primary care-led NHS, the new HAs will be very different kinds of authority from the old DHAs and FHSAs. They will have a major new role in supporting and developing primary care. Every person working for HAs, from the chief executive downwards, will need to understand and support primary care provision. They will need to ensure that primary care practitioners contribute to the development of the HA's strategy. So they will need to involve fundholding and non-fundholding GPs and a wide range of other professionals working in primary care.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para18"></a>We do not believe that it would be possible for a single member to provide that broad spectrum of advice. We have discussed in detail under a previous amendment the Government's proposal to secure broad professional involvement&#151;by requiring health authorities to make arrangements for receiving advice from a wide range of professionals.
<P>

<a name="50330-08_para19"></a>We believe that that is the best way of securing advice, expertise and involvement of the range of health care professionals in the decision making processes of the new health authorities. I am grateful to my noble friend for reminding us that that must include primary care. I hope she will be able to withdraw her amendment.

<A NAME="50330-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I thank my noble friend for that reply, but of course I am disappointed that she is not accepting the amendment. If the NHS is to be so primary care-led, I find it difficult to understand why primary care is not of sufficient importance to be represented on the authority. My noble friend said that there would be seven members. I did not specify any particular person because I thought that to have one out of seven would be asking too much.
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para0"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool, who spoke on Tuesday in the debate on primary care and its great importance in Liverpool, wished to support the amendment but was unable to be here today. He would like to have that mentioned, because he said that people involved with primary care did such a marvellous job in Liverpool.
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para1"></a>I hope that my noble friend will think again.

<A NAME="50330-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   I want, for the record, to make it plain that the normal number of non-executive members will be five and, in exceptional circumstances, seven.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I thank my noble friend for that clarification. I thought that the number was to be five, but when I heard my noble friend mention seven I thought that was to be the norm. The one good bit of news that came out of my noble friend's reply was that some of the people I have mentioned will in any case be appointed and they are not ruled out. I hope that that will be the position. I accept entirely my noble friend's point that there will be a good method of consultation, but consultation is not the same as being represented on the authority. That is why I believe that the amendment is a good one. My noble friend gave a most interesting reply. I shall discuss the matter further with her at a later stage. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

 Page 20, line 4, at end insert ("and
<br>
(c) must on appointment declare and record in a public register any private interests which may be material and relevant to NHS business").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50330-09_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: In the absence of the noble Lord, Lord Dean of Beswick, I move the amendment which stands in his name and mine. I understand that the noble Lord's wife has been taken ill and that he has had to return home at short notice to see her. He is naturally very sorry at being unable to be here to move the amendment. I am sure that the Committee would wish to send its good wishes to his wife for a speedy recovery.
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para5"></a>This is a modest amendment which draws attention to an important omission from the Bill in an area which is currently of great general concern. It is at least a start. As I said earlier, my experience is primarily with local government rather than with the health service. I cannot help but contrast the absence of any provision in the Bill with the requirements placed upon members of local authorities.
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para6"></a>Under the Local Government Act 1989, the Secretary of State has made regulations which require local authorities to keep a statutory register of members' interests. Those regulations require councillors to enter details of employment and the name of any employer or firm of partners of which the councillor is a member. They must name any sponsor who has made a payment to the councillor towards expenses as a councillor, including election expenses&#151;which clearly would not be appropriate in this case. They have to enter current contracts with the council of which the councillor is aware in which the councillor may have an interest whether as an individual or as a director or shareholder of a company. They must enter any freehold, leasehold or short tenancy of any land in the area of that council, such as houses, buildings, mortgaged property, including joint tenancies. They must enter any licences of over a month to occupy land&#151;for example, for an allotment plot&#151;and any property owned by the council <P>


<a name="column_1732"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1732</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which is rented by a company of which the councillor is a director or shareholder. They must enter the name of any companies or other bodies in which the councillor has shares, securities or deposits, except building societies, which to the councillor's knowledge have a place of business in the area of that council, the shareholding or investment of which has a nominal value of over &#163;25,000 or is more than one-hundredth of the total share capital. The amount of the investment does not have to be declared.
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para7"></a>That is the requirement which the Government consider necessary for a register of interests for members of local authorities. If the Minister will not accept the amendment, I hope she will explain why it is necessary to have such a detailed and prescribed form of statutory register for members of local authorities but nothing for members of health authorities.
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para8"></a>Local authorities meet almost entirely in public. They are subject to much greater scrutiny by the press and by the public in the areas they represent than is the case with health authorities. Members of local authorities may be subject to investigation by the district auditor; they may be surcharged; they may be disqualified; and in extreme cases they may even be imprisoned. Above all, they are subject to the ballot box every four years; in other words, members of local authorities are already subject to public scrutiny to a much greater extent than are members of health authorities. Yet the Government consider it necessary to impose upon them a statutory register of interests. Most good local authorities have kept a voluntary register containing all that information and more.
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para9"></a>Health authorities have none of that. As has been mentioned in previous debates on the Bill, the matter has caused much anxiety in recent months. The amendment is modest and refers only to declaration on appointment. If it were to be carried we should require at least that the register be kept up to date, otherwise it would be of diminishing use. It relates only to matters of interest and relevance to the NHS; in other words, it is narrower than is the case with local authorities.
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para10"></a>If the Government are not prepared to accept the amendment, or at least to indicate that they will bring forward regulations requiring a register of interests to be kept for members of health authorities, I hope that the Minister will explain clearly today why it is deemed necessary to have a statutory register for members of local authorities, who are democratically elected and accountable and subject to constant public scrutiny through their local press, but to have no statutory register whatever for unelected and locally unaccountable members of health authorities. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-09_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   In the absence of my noble friend Lord Dean, I wish to support the amendment. I join the noble Lord, Lord Tope, in sending best wishes to Lady Dean for a speedy recovery.
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tope, clearly outlined the purpose behind the amendment which is to try to bring health authorities a little closer in line with the proceedings that are acceptable to and demanded by local authorities. I expect that in reply the Minister will <P>


<a name="column_1733"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1733</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>say that the codes of conduct for health authorities, which will become operational from April this year, are sufficient to meet the anxieties which the noble Lord expressed so well. However, I am sure that if my noble friend Lord Dean were present he would have referred to the scandalous proceedings in the Wessex Regional Health Authority. In that respect he, among many others, was instrumental in bringing to public attention anxieties about considerable interests that were held by members of that health authority and its managers in various computer businesses. That caused the problems with which all Members of the Committee will be familiar.
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para12"></a>It is interesting to note that the codes, which will be effective from April, were introduced only under pressure as a result of the recognition of inappropriate actions by members of health authorities throughout the country, by the Public Accounts Committee in another place and by other public bodies and scrutineers.
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para13"></a>I understand that according to the part of the new codes to which the amendment refers, members of health authorities will simply be required on their honour, as it were, to declare an interest as an issue arises in debate. That is rather like the convention in this Chamber. Surely it would be better&#151;as I believe it would be better here&#151;to have a published register in which all interests are pre-recorded. If that were enshrined in legislation, as required by Amendment No. 23, it would be much more forceful than merely being included in a code of conduct, which can be only a guideline. There can be nothing in guidelines which suggests sanctions if they are broken or which will carry the same weight as legislation.
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para14"></a>I hope that in the spirit of openness, which the Minister and members of the Government have expressed throughout the passage of this Bill, the Government will be prepared to go one step further and, rather than rely on codes of conduct and guidance, will accept the amendment.

<A NAME="50330-09_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   I too send my best wishes to Lady Dean for a speedy recovery. I sincerely hope that if she requires the services of the NHS it does her very proud. I am disappointed that the noble Lord, Lord Dean, is not in the Chamber today because I know that he feels most strongly about the issue. Indeed, we have spoken on many occasions about it. I am sure that he will be totally satisfied with the introduction of the amendment by the noble Lord, Lord Tope.
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para15"></a>The noble Baroness is accurate; I shall refer to the codes of conduct and accountability. They were published in April 1994 by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health. They make clear the expectation that those who serve the NHS should maintain very high standards of corporate and personal conduct.
<P>


<a name="column_1734"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1734</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para16"></a>On the subject of public business and private gain, the codes are quite clear and I wish to quote from them. They state:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Chairmen and board members should act impartially and should not be influenced by social or business relationships. No one should use their public position to further their private interests. Where there is a potential for private interests to be material and relevant to NHS business, the relevant interests should be declared and recorded in the board minutes, and entered into a register which is available to the public. When a conflict of interest is established, the board member should withdraw and play no part in the relevant discussion or decision".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para17"></a>As Members of the Committee can see, the codes are specific in their expectation that chairmen and board members will declare any interests that may be relevant to NHS business and that such information should be made available to the public. In order to ensure that those appointed to serve on NHS authorities and trusts are aware of the provisions of the codes of conduct and accountability, they are all expected to confirm, on appointment and in writing, that they are willing to subscribe to the codes.
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para18"></a>Having introduced the codes of conduct and accountability, we have begun the process of monitoring their implementation. An initial early check will be completed next month and the results will be reported to Ministers shortly afterwards. The noble Lord, Lord Tope, drew a comparison between local authorities and health authority membership. He will be aware that the two are very different in that councillors are directly accountable to their electorate and can raise a local tax. Of course, health authority members cannot raise a local tax and the Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament for the finances of the National Health Service. She is subject to scrutiny by Parliament and the Public Accounts Committee, which local authorities are not.
<P>

<a name="50330-09_para19"></a>It is a little naive to think, if I may suggest it, that the press does not also scrutinise health authorities. I can assure the Committee that those who serve on health authorities feel that they are under very close scrutiny. Therefore, we have absolutely no objection to the principle of the amendment. However, we do not believe that it is necessary to make specific reference to such a requirement in the Bill. We believe, and I hope that I have been able to reassure Members of the Committee, that the steps that we have taken are the right ones to ensure that public service values remain at the heart of the management and operation of the NHS. I believe that we have taken a strong line and therefore I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="50330-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Tope: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for her reply. However, I remain far from convinced about why members of health authorities are deemed to be in such a different position from members of local authorities. Local authorities have had a national code of conduct at least since 1974. It is drawn to the attention of all councillors when they are first elected. Most authorities, including my own, include that national code of conduct with their standing orders. I believe that it is along similar lines to the code of conduct to which the Minister referred. It is always required of councillors to declare their pecuniary and non-pecuniary interests.
<P>


<a name="column_1735"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1735</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para0"></a>It was held not only by local authorities but also by the Government that a national code of conduct which is to an overwhelming extent complied with by all local authorities and councillors is not enough. The Government decreed that a statutory register was necessary, presumably in order to reassure the public and those with an interest, and to ensure openness.
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para1"></a>It is right that local authorities can raise a local tax, but health authorities cannot. But surely the real issue is the contract into which local authorities and health authorities enter. A conflict of interest is far more likely to arise in that connection than as regards any level of tax.
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para2"></a>I did not intend to suggest that local authorities were not subject to scrutiny by the local press. However, I suggest that in most areas, if not in all, a local newspaper is likely to be full of what the local council is or should be doing than with matters concerning the health authority, except under exceptional circumstances.
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para3"></a>I shall withdraw the amendment today. As the Minister said, the noble Lord, Lord Dean of Beswick, feels strongly on this issue. Sadly, he has not had an opportunity to express a view today so I suspect that we shall return to the subject at a later stage. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
("(2) In making regulations under paragraph 2 above the Secretary of State shall have regard to the need to include members with experience in providing nursing care.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50330-10_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: On the first day of Committee and again today we have had lengthy discussions about the pros and cons of professional representation on the health authorities. I am sure that it may seem tedious to move yet another amendment which seeks to plead that point.
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para7"></a>In moving the amendment, I have tried to take into account what the Minister said on Second Reading. She said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Government do not in general support reserved places on authorities for representatives of particular groups".&#151;[Official Report, 6/3/95; col. 70.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para8"></a>Indeed, she has reaffirmed that position in her answer this afternoon to Amendment No. 20.
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para9"></a>I agree with that position, and I am not seeking to plead a representative position on the authority. I am trying to look at the role of the new health authorities, which I believe is managerial and includes an assessment of the health needs of the district, the making of purchasing contracts, specifications of standards of care and auditing of the care given. To carry out those functions, the authorities will need a membership which includes certain managerial skills and, as the schedule provides, access to a wide range of appropriate professional advice.
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para10"></a>The Government have given an undertaking that the membership of the new authorities will include a chairman, a chief executive, a director of finance and a <P>


<a name="column_1736"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1736</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>director of public health. The arguments for a chairman, chief executive and director of finance are self-evident. Indeed, there is an argument for the inclusion of people from outside the health service. Having worked on a health authority, I appreciate the financial and business skills of some of the other members.
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para11"></a>The inclusion of a director of public health can be made only on the basis of the expertise which he brings to the authority&#151;the epidemiological knowledge that he has in assessing the healthcare needs of the area and his expertise in medical service planning. It is my conviction that the case for the inclusion of a member on the authority who has expertise in the planning and purchasing of nursing care and the specification of standards of care is equally important if the authority is function with any degree of efficiency.
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para12"></a>My conviction stems from the facts which were rehearsed on Second Reading and again on the first day of Committee: namely, that 80 per cent. of patient contact in the health service is given by nurses; and they are the largest professional group in the National Health Service, accounting for 50 per cent. of the workforce and 40 per cent. of current National Health Service spending.
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para13"></a>I am not making a case that their work is any more important than any other professional group. However, I am saying that the resource implications of that very large group of the workforce, that very complex service with many specialties, are very great in relation to the health authorities. The ability to make effective and knowledgeable purchasing contracts is crucial.
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para14"></a>I am convinced that access to advice on the management of nursing services and criteria for purchasing and standards of care is not sufficient. Expertise on such a large and complex component of the authorities' work needs to be dealt with at the point of decision-making.
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para15"></a>I have taken the opportunity to speak to the director of consumer and corporate affairs and nurse adviser on a purchasing authority&#151;the Camden and Islington Health Authority. She described her work in respect of the health needs of the local population, the co-ordination of nursing advice to the authority, which is a very complex task, her role in clinical audit and the establishment of healthcare standards. I have no doubt that the health authority needs to have as a member a director of that calibre.
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para16"></a>I have taken the opportunity also to talk to Dame Audrey Emerton, who is the chairman of the Brighton Health Trust&#151;a provider authority. She wrote to me subsequently confirming the points made in our conversation. The letter stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The inclusion of a nurse as an Executive Director on a Health Authority is of vital importance in the contribution that can be made in relation to the compiling of contracts between purchasers and providers which will include quality specifications. Community Care is expanding and there is a growth of private nursing homes for which there is a legal requirement for inspection to ensure standards are maintained. The contribution of an Executive Director Nurse comes from an in depth knowledge of the care components of a contract which (apart from the clinical intervention of a doctor) are paramount both in terms of quality and cost effectiveness".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>

<a name="50330-10_para17"></a>An executive director nurse on the purchasing authority complements the role of the executive director nurse on the provider authority, which is prescribed. It seems illogical not to have such a complementary role.
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para18"></a>I trust that in replying to the amendment, the noble Baroness will give it favourable consideration. I ask her to take it that it is not a plea on this occasion for representation; it is a plea for expertise in one of largest and most fundamental components of a health authority's work. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-10_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Robson of Kiddington: </B>   I support the amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady McFarlane. I have supported her often in the past on the question of nurses. I agree with her 100 per cent. that we want nurse directors because of their expertise and care involvement both in the community and hospitals; and because they are likely to have a much closer and deeper knowledge of what the patients want and need.
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para19"></a>Also, patients find it much easier to talk to nurses than they do to talk to doctors. They become rather nervous about addressing that high and mighty consultant or even GP. But they talk quite easily to nurses. Therefore, nurses are likely to have a much more intimate knowledge of what the patients are looking for.
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para20"></a>The provider units, the trusts, must have a nurse executive member. It is important to have a nurse on the purchasing authority who is able to negotiate with the trust nurse on matters such as staffing levels and meeting quality standards before placing contracts with a trust. Only a member with experience in providing nursing care can adequately assess the details relating to nursing in any contract.
<P>

<a name="50330-10_para21"></a>I know that the Minister said on Second Reading that it would be almost inconceivable that any health authority would not, just by the very nature of things, accidentally&#151;or in whatever way one likes to put it&#151;appoint a nurse as one of the non-executive directors. I am afraid that I do not find that satisfactory: I want an assurance that one of the non-executive directors will be a nurse. As I said, I support the amendment.

<A NAME="50330-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   I should like to express my support for the amendment for all the reasons put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady McFarlane and by the noble Baroness, Lady Robson of Kiddington. Many of the arguments put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, as regards Amendment No. 20 also apply. Nurses bring with them an unparalleled, intermittent and practical knowledge of the working of the NHS, learnt at the bedside, in patients' homes, in clinics, in operating theatres and in almost any other location. When nurses are members of a health authority, that knowledge held by experienced members of the nursing profession is enormously helpful to the deliberations of the authority. It helps to prevent, for example, purchasing decisions being taken which may prove to be unworkable or, possibly, against the best interests of patients. I hope that the Minister will rethink her general strictures about <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I could not think more highly of nurses; indeed, I believe that they make the most marvellous contribution to the work of the health service in the community, in the hospitals and throughout the whole of the NHS. However, I believe that the proposed amendment limits the scope of the provision to one place for one nurse. I prefer to have a place for a nurse as suggested in Amendment No. 20, which certainly would have been possible. I should have preferred the wider spread whereby any "health professional" could be appointed. If there are only five places available, I do not quite see how we will be able to fit everyone into them. I also hope that many nurses will serve in an executive role on the health authority and that they will be in close touch with nurses working in general practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   We considered the question of professional membership of health authorities in earlier debates. I made clear then the Government's general approach to membership. We do not think that it is helpful to reserve places for individuals from particular professional or other interest groups. As my noble friend Lady Eccles said in our debate on Tuesday, it is important that health authorities are made up of people from as wide a range of experience as possible and that they are tailored to suit the needs of the particular area.
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para0"></a>It was also clear from our earlier debate that there are many groups with claims to be included on health authorities. My noble friend Lady Gardner has made the case for the range of primary care professionals, including pharmacists and dentists. However, I believe that I have made clear to my noble friend that the Government very much welcome applications from suitably qualified members of those professions, but do not see the necessity to reserve a place for them.
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para1"></a>I recognise that the nursing profession are particularly concerned that they should be at the centre of decision making in the new authorities. The noble Baroness, Lady McFarlane, has very fairly set out the contribution that nurses can make. I know that the noble Baroness speaks from considerable and distinguished experience and that she is one of the most respected leaders of the nursing profession. I also agree with the attributes and skills of nurses as outlined by the noble Baroness, Lady Robson. However, I believe that I have explained why the Government cannot accept the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para2"></a>Perhaps I may just add something that I said in an earlier debate concerning not only nurses but also midwives and health visitors. In this Chamber only recently I illustrated how we had shown our trust in nurses' skills by introducing nurse prescribing. It has been recognised for a number of years that nurse prescribing in the community could bring genuine benefits both to patients and staff. Nurses themselves believe that they can do the job and do it well. The eight demonstration schemes&#151;some of which I have myself visited&#151;provide us with an opportunity to put that to the test.

<P>

<a name="50330-11_para3"></a>Moreover, when speaking to Amendment No. 11, I mentioned the high priority that we have placed on nurse education and training. We made substantial funds available to support the introduction of Project 2000. As a result, the new form of pre-registration education has been introduced throughout England in only five years. It is the envy of other countries.
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para4"></a>The "Changing Childbirth" policy gives midwives the scope to strengthen their professional skills, and the care that they give, alongside other health professionals. We have set out 10 key indicators of success and asked all purchasers to draw up plans for implementing Changing Childbirth within five years. I should say that midwives are, with enormous courage, commitment and energy, rising to that challenge.
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para5"></a>Finally, we recognise that effective purchasing is a complex task which makes new calls on the skills of health professionals. We have invested in nurses by developing those particular skills. I am now delighted to see nurses playing a significant role in general management, as well as providing expert advice from their nursing experience. Nurses are helping health authorities to define their real purpose. They are contributing to health needs assessment, defining the need for services, including health promotion and developing plans with providers. They are ensuring value for money, challenging prices and examining alternatives for services which better match people's needs. Best practice, in relation to the nursing contribution to purchasing, is set out in the report Building a Stronger Team.
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para6"></a>I have mentioned all the foregoing because it is very easy just to praise nurses. We have tried to give them more responsibility and extend the scope of their professional activities. I believe that we have illustrated the way that we value their profession and have put our trust in it. We do not believe that the proposed amendment is the best way to achieve what the noble Baroness seeks to achieve. Therefore, I hope that she will feel able to withdraw it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-11_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness McFarlane of Llandaff: </B>   I thank the Minister for her detailed reply and for her own considerable contribution to the welfare of nurses and nursing. Of course, I am disappointed that the strength of the case has not been taken on board. However, I shall read the Minister's response and reconsider the matter. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="50330-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   I understand that we are discussing a technical amendment. However, I am experiencing some difficulty in following the explanation. I have with me the Local Government Finance Act 1982 and am just looking at Chapter 32. I presume that I have the right document, but the sections in the Act that I have before me do not tie up with the Section 28A mentioned in the Bill and that suggested in the amendment. For example, there is no Section 28A in Chapter 32 of the 1982 Act; indeed, there is only Section 28 with subsections (1), (2) and (3). None of them says anything about the functions of the Audit Commission in relation to the National Health Service. It could be that I have got it wrong. I tried to check the position with the officials and they believe that they have an answer. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-11_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Carter, for having made contact with the officials. As I understand it, the answer lies in paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 4 to the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990. I am not sure whether that makes the matter clear to the noble Lord. Perhaps we can discuss it before the Report stage so that I can reassure him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   I have a suspicion that it is not very clear to the Minister either. It is confusing for those of us who do not have the resources of the department. I am holding the document which corresponds with the marginal note "1982 c. 32.". I have checked with the Printed Paper Office. That is the only document of its kind. I accept that it is a technical point, but it would be helpful if we knew the route by which the Government arrived at the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50330-11_para17"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 33 deals with a subject that we have dealt with on a number of occasions in various Bills and orders relating to the health service; namely, what are known as gagging clauses. The amendment is intended to put the matter right at least in the case of this Bill.
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para18"></a>I should like to give a few examples to show why we feel this whole business of the gagging clause is a grave weakness in the operation of the health service. With this amendment we try to put the matter right at least in respect of the new organisation that is proposed.
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para19"></a>After the Bill becomes an Act, on 1st April next year what have been described as the last vestiges of the public health advocacy in Britain on behalf of the public will be abolished when the eight regional health authorities are replaced by eight NHS Executive regional offices. The point has already been made in relation to a number of amendments that the regional directors of public health and their staff will become civil servants and hence will be constrained, like all civil servants, in the way in which they speak out on public matters. I am advised&#151;and it will be interesting to know whether the Minister can confirm this&#151;that one consequence will be that the directors of public health, who are the leaders of public health medicine, will not be allowed to become office holders in the Faculty of Public Health Medicine.
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para20"></a>It is interesting that in 1988 the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Future Development of the Public Health Function, chaired by the then Chief Medical Officer, Sir Donald Acheson, concluded:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We therefore reject the view expressed in some of the evidence submitted to us that public health doctors, employed in the public sector, have a duty or a right to advocate or pursue policies which they judge to be in the public interest independently of any line of accountability. In the extreme this would place them in a position above Parliament".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para21"></a>I shall be interested to know whether that is still the view of the Government and whether the Minister agrees with the view expressed by Sir Donald Acheson.
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para22"></a>I turn now to the general subject of the gagging of employees. I do not believe that it is an exaggeration to say that a large number of NHS employees feel that restrictions on freedom of speech have become much more severe since the health service has become more commercial. We feel that efficient organisations encourage internal debate and dissent. Obviously the NHS Executive wants NHS employees to talk to their managers about any problems they find in the service. Unfortunately, employees are rather sceptical about that approach because of all that has happened.
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para23"></a>We know that so-called gagging clauses have been written into the contracts of NHS consultants and other employees. There have been several high-profile cases of whistle-blowers being persecuted. We know that the Government have produced what is known in the jargon as a whistle-blowers charter, but some people feel that the charter has made life easier for those who want to suppress information rather than for those who want to blow the whistle.
<P>


<a name="column_1742"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1742</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para24"></a>I should like to give some examples of where that has happened. The manager of the Cardiff Royal Infirmary group and a surgeon in that group made critical comments, one to the local press and the other to the health authority itself, about certain practices. They were both suspended. They responded by taking their cases to an industrial tribunal. The day before the tribunal was to sit they were paid a sum of money, not only as recompense for the damage to their careers but as a form of gag because they could no longer refer to the circumstances under which they had been suspended. That is now done almost as a matter of course to quash any dissenting opinions about the state of the health service.
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para25"></a>There was the case of staff of the Raigmore hospital trust. Dr. Anita Reddy, a senior registrar, complained about low staff morale in the hospital. The trust managers seriously contemplated taking disciplinary action. They were only dissuaded from doing so by senior consultants who talked to them about the case. At the same Raigmore trust a letter to the board chairman, Dr. James Kyle, was leaked to the press. That letter was from five senior consultants expressing their surprise and annoyance at the callousness of managers. All five consultants were dragged before the director to account for themselves and to explain the leak. Such people should not be disciplined for bringing those matters to light: they should be congratulated.
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para26"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to give a clear right to employees of the National Health Service and professional staff to speak up professionally on matters that concern the health of the public. We feel that the right should be enshrined in this primary legislation and override the "gagging clauses" that are increasingly being inserted into trust contracts.
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para27"></a>The terms and conditions of service of hospital, medical and dental staff used to contain a clause in paragraph 330 which stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A practitioner shall be free, without prior consent of the employing authority, to publish books, articles, etc. and to deliver any lecture or speak, whether on matters arising out of his or her hospital services or not".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para28"></a>That is an absolute freedom. It is a safeguard for the public health, for the public good and for the professionalism of medical staff which is the cornerstone of the National Health Service.
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para29"></a>A further matter which is causing concern is the additional financial incentive for trusts, as employers, to keep quiet matters which might have a negative impact on the marketing (these are customers, not patients) of hospitals to purchasers such as GP fundholders, health authorities and those who make extra-contractual referrals from other health authorities. Trusts have every incentive to enforce the gagging clauses on their staff in case their speaking out has an adverse impact on the trusts' ability to trade under the new contract system.
<P>

<a name="50330-11_para30"></a>The amendment is intended, at least in this Bill, to deal with this pernicious aspect of the health service, which is causing great anxiety. The issue has not arisen from stories in the tabloid press but from conversations with doctors, nurses and consultants. One knows that it is causing increasing concern. I hope that the Minister <P>


<a name="column_1743"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1743</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will be able to show that the Government recognise the genuine public concern that exists on this matter and will accept the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-12_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   I find this a strange amendment. For 20 years I have sat on an industrial tribunal. If one has rights, under employment legislation those rights continue. Therefore, in that respect the amendment should not be necessary.
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para0"></a>As regards the aspect of confidentiality, to which the noble Lord, Lord Carter, referred, I understand that this relates to people transferring from one employment to another. It is possible that one might negotiate terms which include a confidentiality clause. That is not an unusual clause. It occurs frequently in ordinary business.
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para1"></a>I agree with the noble Lord that people should not feel inhibited about whistle blowing. It is right that people should draw attention to problems. I recall a case many years ago of an elderly patient being brutalised by one nurse in the hospital. It was extremely important that someone drew that fact at the time to the attention of the health authority, otherwise we would not have known about it. The person using that brutality said, "No, this old lady fell". Therefore I appreciate that such cases exist. However, I am not sure how I regard the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, implied that there was something sinister or mysterious in a sum of money being paid over the day before the industrial tribunal hearing. In the employment field that is common. Indeed, papers are no longer sent out in advance of a hearing. The tribunal members pick them up on the morning of the hearing because a large number of cases are settled. It would waste members' time to read those cases because they never come before the tribunal. I do not believe that there is anything sinister in that point.
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para3"></a>The loss of Crown immunity means that all bodies in the health service now have to be very careful. Although litigation is necessary, unfortunately, that awareness has crept into all areas of the health service and in general. Everyone is aware of litigation. They have to be very careful. No one wishes something said that would bring a legal case against him which was not justified. He would wish to have the opportunity for the whistle blowers (to use the noble Lord's expression) to bring the case forward to be investigated thoroughly rather than to have a sensational piece in the press which might or might not be accurate and might lead to a major legal case. I find the amendment unusual, but I believe unnecessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-12_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend for putting the position on record with such clarity and accuracy. She is quite correct that staff who are transferred to a special health authority or NHS trust will retain exactly the same rights to speak openly as they enjoyed previously. There will be no reduction in the right of health authorities to represent publicly the needs of their population.
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para4"></a>The regional offices will have a different role from that of RHAs. The new health authorities will be the operators in the new system. They will be taking the decisions which will directly affect local people.
<P>


<a name="column_1744"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1744</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para5"></a>The regional offices will contribute to the development of central policies for the NHS, monitor the health authorities and trusts in their areas and intervene managerially where necessary. These are responsibilities appropriate to the Civil Service and it is therefore right that regional office staff should be civil servants. Clearly this change of status reduces the rights of regional office staff to "speak out", but it gives them more effective influence on central policies. As civil servants, they will have enhanced opportunities to shape central policy making by offering advice to Ministers.
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para6"></a>The Government issued to NHS employers in June 1993 guidance for staff on relations with the public and the media. That document sets out the rights and responsibilities of all staff when raising issues of concern about healthcare matters. NHS staff have a right and duty to raise with their employer concerns about health service issues. In no circumstances are employees who express their concerns in accordance with the guidance to be penalised. I am concerned by some of the examples that the noble Lord raised.
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para7"></a>NHS employers are required to introduce procedures for handling of staff concerns after consultation with local staff and should promote a climate of openness and dialogue within the NHS so that staff concerns can be dealt with properly and effectively. I believe that the situation is quite clear. We tackled the issue in June 1993. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   I am not surprised by the response from the Minister. The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, gave the game away when she referred to the industrial tribunal. Those tribunals deal with employment rights. The amendment deals with what I have described as the "gagging" clauses. The noble Baroness referred to "ordinary business" and business confidentiality. We are not referring to factories or shops. We refer to hospitals, clinics, doctors and nurses. It is interesting that the Minister did not deal with any of the examples I gave regarding public health directors and trust hospitals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-12_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   Perhaps the noble Lord will give way. I dealt with that point. It is the regional directors of public health who will join the regional offices. As I said, quite rightly they become civil servants. The directors of public health at health authority level will have the opportunity to join the faculty, to speak out and to do things that they have done in the past, subject to their contract.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   That is the whole point. The regional directors have to advise the Executive; they will not be able to become office holders in the faculty of public health medicine. That is the point I make.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-12_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   Does the noble Lord agree that one would not expect civil servants to speak out?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-12_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   We shall not agree; we are not talking the same language. That is why there is a difference between the two sides of the Committee. Civil servants give advice to Ministers. That advice is never published. We never know whether Ministers take it. We do not know the quality of that advice. We do not know whether Ministers are warned of the problems.
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para8"></a>I gave a few examples of various cases&#151;the Minister did not deal with them in her reply&#151;which we know exist. This is a taxpayer's service. It is paid for by the taxpayer. The information should be made available. It should be a duty on employers in the health service to bring these matters to the attention of the public and to give their professional opinion about their concerns regarding the health of the public. The Government see the health service as a business. We heard such words as "customers" rather than patients. There was reference to "ordinary business", "commercial confidentiality". That is what is happening to the health service. That is why the gagging clauses have been introduced. We know that they exist. When we form the Government we shall end them. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50330-12_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: I have a feeling that I may receive the same answer to this amendment as to Amendment No. 33. The amendment proposes,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"including full recognition of the appropriate trade unions".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para11"></a>We know that the Government feel the same way about trade unions as they do about the health service.
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para12"></a>The amendment provides for the continuation of full recognition of appropriate trade unions for staff transferred to National Health Service Executive offices. I expect the Minister to say that those members of staff will be able to retain their personal membership of trade unions. Even under this Government that is possible. We welcome that.
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para13"></a>I understand that in another place the Minister and the Under-Secretary have talked separately about accepting the TUPE regulations about pensions. It has been pointed out that the functions of the regional organisations are different from those of the regional health authorities. That point was made on the previous amendment by the Minister. We believe that there is good reason to ensure that the trade unions, UNISON, the RCN and the BMA, all of which have members at regional health authority level, should be fully recognised when the staff transfer to new NHSE offices. We shall deal with the TUPE provisions later. They are meant to protect union recognition. I hope that the Minister will confirm that the recognition will be protected and that she will accept the amendment.
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para14"></a>The RCN and the BMA are not affiliated to any political party. They are certainly not affiliated to the Labour Party. Of course, we know that UNISON is. This <P>


<a name="column_1746"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1746</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is not a Labour Party amendment; it is an attempt to ensure that the proper rights of members of trade unions are protected when the changes envisaged under the Bill take place. The amendment asks for the full recognition of appropriate trade unions. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-12_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   I support the amendment. I declare an interest as a consultant to UNISON.
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para15"></a>I shall be brief because my noble friend has put the relevant points. However, I wish to emphasise that trade unions are, I think rightly, suspicious of government intentions towards them. We have seen many instances where trade unions have been pushed aside, not consulted when they should be, and given the impression by government that they have no real part in the industries or services in which they are employed. Where such a reorganisation comes about, it is bound to engender in the breasts of trade unionists that it may be another opportunity for the Government to remove some of the rights which they have hitherto enjoyed.
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para16"></a>The noble Baroness may tell me and members of trade unions that their fears are quite unwarranted. I hope that she will. If so, I feel quite sure that the Government will not mind strengthening their assurances by agreeing to the amendment. I hope that they will do so.

<A NAME="50330-12_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I must tell the noble Lord, Lord Carter, that the Government have the highest regard for the National Health Service and we have the greatest respect for the trade union movement. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, is pleased to hear that.
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para17"></a>I understand the anxieties of both noble Lords, but the amendment is not consistent with general employment legislation, which does not impose a statutory obligation on employers to recognise unions. More important, it is also unnecessary. Where transfers of staff take place from the district health authority, family health service authority and regional health authority to a new health authority, the same unions will be involved on either side of the transfer.
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para18"></a>The amendment is clearly aimed at the transfer of staff from the National Health Service to the Department of Health. The noble Lord, Lord Carter, may be worried about staff moving into the Civil Service, but I can assure him that the department is committed to consulting the recognised Civil Service trade unions. There is a well-established consultation machinery in place which is capable of representing the transferring staff. In addition, certain National Health Service unions are affiliated to political parties, and by convention government departments may not recognise such affiliated organisations.
<P>

<a name="50330-12_para19"></a>The transferring employees will have the opportunity to transfer to Civil Service unions when they become civil servants and to have their views represented through the existing consultative arrangements. I hope <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   I must read Hansard with care because that is a connoisseur's distinction between "respect" and "regard". I understand the points that the Minister made but I thought it was important for us to make some from this side. The RCN and the BMA, of course, are not affiliated to the Labour Party, as I made clear. I hope that those who transfer to the Civil Service unions, with the encouragement now of the Government, fare a little better than the members of the Civil Service unions at GCHQ. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Carter </B>   moved Amendment No. 35:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 Page 44, line 21, leave out sub-paragraph (8).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50330-13_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: Perhaps with this amendment we shall have a little more light and a little less heat than with the last two. It is a probing amendment to establish why occupational pensions are not included, as we understand it&#151;I shall be glad to be proved wrong&#151;in the transfer of employment rights.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para2"></a>Paragraph 9 of Schedule 2 is concerned with the transfer of contracts of employment and the protection of the rights of transferred employees. I am advised that it is not clear why sub-paragraph (8) is necessary, given that, where there is a transfer of undertakings, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981&#151;the TUPE regulations&#151;provide for the transfer of conditions of service, with the exclusion of occupational pensions.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para3"></a>I am advised by the RCN that female nurses have special status under the NHS occupational pension scheme and are able to retire at the age of 55. I am not sure what the position is regarding male nursing officers. It would be interesting to know and perhaps the Minister could advise on it.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para4"></a>The RCN seeks an assurance that those nurses affected by transfer arrangements under the Bill will not lose the special status to which they are currently entitled. It will be helpful if the Minister can give an assurance that the provisions of the NHS occupational scheme will be extended to those staff transferring under the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para5"></a>As I said, this is a probing amendment on an important matter. I hope that the Minister can throw some light on it. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-13_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations provide generally for the transfer of contractual terms and acquired rights to a new employer. Most employees <P>


<a name="column_1748"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1748</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>transferring under the Bill will be covered by the provisions of TUPE. However, to make sure that all staff will be protected, we asked for provisions in Schedule 2 which parallel TUPE.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para6"></a>However, under the TUPE regulations, pension rights are not transferred to the new employment. Regulation 7 of TUPE specifically excludes those provisions of an occupational pension scheme which relate to benefits for old age, invalidity or survivors from the general transfer requirement. The sub-paragraph which the amendment seeks to delete does no more than reflect the TUPE provisions.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para7"></a>The Government believe that Regulation 7 of TUPE fully accords with our obligations in relation to pensions under the acquired rights directive. That does not mean that we are not bothered about pensions. Far from it. Our view is that the new employer should provide broadly comparable pension arrangements or make a compensating adjustment within the overall remuneration package.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para8"></a>We are committed to ensuring that staff transferred under the Bill enjoy similar pension rights in their new employment. We are taking steps to ensure that they do.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para9"></a>For the vast majority of NHS staff covered by the Bill&#151;that is, those transferring from district health authorities and family health service authorities to the new health authorities&#151;there will be no impact at all on current pension arrangements. They will remain National Health Service employees and continue to have access to the National Health Service pension scheme.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para10"></a>The position is different for regional health authority employees who transfer to the employment of the Department of Health. That is because, on transfer to the regional offices, they will become civil servants. They will not be able to remain in the National Health Service pension scheme. A basic pensions principle is that pension cover should follow from employment. It would be inappropriate for former regional health authority staff, as civil servants, to belong to the National Health Service scheme, which is the occupational pension scheme for National Health Service employees.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para11"></a>Regional health authority staff who transfer to the National Health Service Executive will be able to join the principal Civil Service scheme, which is an excellent non-contributory pension scheme. But we have proposed special arrangements to protect National Health Service pension benefits which are not offered by the Civil Service scheme. That will ensure that all regional health authority staff who become civil servants will have access to pension rights in their new employment which will be broadly equivalent to those which they enjoyed in the National Health Service.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para12"></a>The detailed proposals have been put to the staff and their representatives for consultation until the end of April. It will be for regional health authority staff to decide whether to transfer their accrued National Health Service pension rights to the Civil Service scheme. If they choose to leave them in the National Health Service scheme, their NHS pension rights will be preserved, index-linked and fully protected for payment at normal <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>retirement age. If they choose to transfer their National Health Service pension rights, they will be offered a year-for-year service credit in the Civil Service scheme.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para13"></a>Paragraph 9(8) simply parallels the provisions of the TUPE regulations. Satisfactory arrangements will be put in place to protect staff's pension positions. On that basis, we do not feel that the amendment is appropriate. I hope that I have said enough to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Carter, and that he will be able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. I believe that I am reassured but I shall have to read what he has said and take advice on it. It seems that the Government have tried to meet the anxieties expressed; and in the meantime I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50330-13_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: We have already debated this amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   To clear up any confusion, we had a highly technical discussion on Amendment No. 29 about the Local Government Finance Act. I believe that the Minister said "Not moved" in relation to Amendment No. 30, when I believe she should have said that she wished to accept the amendment; Amendments Nos. 29, 30 and 36 are grouped. I am happy to accept that if it is what the Minister intended.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-13_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   I am clearly at fault here. I had presumed, because we had discussed the amendments, that I did not have to move them again&#151;that is, as they were grouped together they were all moved.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para19"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

 Page 4, line 9, leave out ("annulment") and insert ("approval").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50330-13_para22"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendments Nos. 37 and 38 deal with a matter that we have often dealt with before in discussing Bills; namely, the question of affirmative or negative resolution. These two amendments give the Government the chance to make the case as to why in Clause 6(3) all the statutory instruments to be used under the Bill are negative resolutions, with the curious exception of the order to be made under Clause 9(3), which deals with the Scilly Isles. I am interested to know from the Minister why the Scilly Isles needs an affirmative resolution and everybody else needs a negative resolution. That is a serious question. I am indeed puzzled as to why that should be the case.
<P>


<a name="column_1750"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1750</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para23"></a>This debate always takes place. I sometimes have the feeling that there are in the offices of the parliamentary draftsman a little book of rules headed, "Saving the Government Time and Bother, Parliamentary Draftsman, Rules for the Use of". Whenever we have this debate, the Government try very hard to put everything into the negative form. We feel that there are aspects of this Bill which should come to Parliament and be dealt with through the affirmative route.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para24"></a>Perhaps I may give just one example. New Section 8(4) in Clause 1 states that the Secretary of State:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may by order...vary a Health Authority's area...abolish a Health Authority; or...establish a new Health Authority".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para25"></a>I entirely understand paragraph (a) in relation to such technical matters as the variation of the boundaries. The negative procedure would be entirely right in that respect. But if the Government intend to abolish a health authority or establish a new one, they should be required to bring the necessary order to Parliament and seek the approval of both Houses through the affirmative route.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para26"></a>The amendment as drafted would reverse the Government's approach and require them to make all orders affirmative. I am entirely happy to discuss with the Minister outside the Chamber which type should be affirmative and which should be negative. It is in a sense a probing amendment to give the Government, as I say, a chance to say why they decided, as they usually do, that all the orders that are required under this Bill should use the negative route.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para27"></a>I believe that the Government have said that the boundaries and functions of the new health authorities will be dealt with, obviously, by order. I shall be interested to hear how they propose to deal with them. With the negative route, there is a problem over time limits, the praying against, the resolutions, and so on. We do not suggest otherwise, in spite of the wording of the amendment; we phrased it this way merely to have the matter debated. After I have heard the Minister I shall withdraw it and perhaps return to the matter on Report to try to tease out then which areas of the Bill should be subject to the affirmative resolution route and which to the negative. The purpose of this amendment is to give the Government the chance to state on the record the reason why, with the curious exception of the Scilly Isles, they believe that this Bill requires the negative route for every order. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-13_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   I presume that these amendments were tabled in the belief that the Secretary of State is seeking unduly wide powers to make orders and regulations in the Bill. That is perhaps what the noble Lord, Lord Carter, is trying to say. Of course we do not agree with that. In fact, the Government plan to include only four new permanent regulation and order-making powers in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para28"></a>First, it will enable regulations to be made allowing consortia of health authorities, special heath authorities and NHS trusts to work on and contract for education and training. The second new power in the Bill will enable regulations to be made setting out requirements for consultation on the establishment of NHS trusts. <P>


<a name="column_1751"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1751</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>This is hardly a sweeping new power. It simply adds flexibility to the arrangements following the abolition of regional health authorities. The third new power will allow the regions of mental health review tribunals to be varied by order. Again, this is not a controversial power. Finally, we shall debate on Report the fourth new power to be introduced by Amendments Nos. 27 and 28.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para29"></a>All the other powers that are taken in the Bill, except those that will have effect only until 1st April 1996, replicate existing powers in relation to district health authorities or family health services authorities. Statutory instruments made under similar powers in the National Health Service Act 1977 and the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 are subject to the negative resolution procedure.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para30"></a>The power in relation to the Isles of Scilly needs no parliamentary procedures. This power enables the Health Authorities Act to be amended in its application to the Isles of Scilly. The National Health Service Act 1977, the Mental Health Act 1983 and the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 have all been applied to the Isles of Scilly by order. Modification was needed to ensure that any reference to a local authority or local social services authority was construed to be a reference to the council of the Isles of Scilly. That council fulfils the role of a local authority in the islands. Any order under this Bill will contain a similar modification. I hope that that is very clear to the noble Lord and that I have dealt with his problem in the necessary detail.
<P>

<a name="50330-13_para31"></a>I see no need to take a different approach in this Bill. If the amendment were passed, a disproportionate amount of parliamentary time would have to be taken up with statutory instruments under this Bill. Therefore I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   I am extremely glad that the Minister has been able to explain so clearly the particular problems in relation to the Isles of Scilly. I shall read what she said in Hansard. It is the answer that I expected. It appears that the orders are not so wide as we thought they were, but I shall need to read her response.
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para0"></a>I still do not entirely understand the Government's response to a point that I made earlier. I do not believe that the Minister dealt with it. I referred to the power to abolish or establish a new health authority, which seems to me to be a substantial power to be made by order. The best thing for me to do is to read what the Minister said and to take advice. In the meantime&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-14_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   Perhaps I can help the noble Lord. It concerns consultation; it does not concern the power to abolish.

<a name="50330-14_para1"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para2"></a>[Amendment No. 38 not moved.]
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para3"></a>Clause 6 agreed to.
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para4"></a>Clause 7 [Financial provisions]:
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para5"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 7 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-14_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   I beg leave to oppose the Question that Clause 7 stand part of the Bill. I do so because of the considerable confusion and concern which still remains&#151;at least on these Benches&#151;about the short and long-term impact of the Bill on the public purse. The arguments that have been put forward throughout the debates, both in this Chamber and in another place, to suggest that this Bill is a very important and necessary measure have largely concerned savings in public expenditure that will result from it.
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para6"></a>In the initial Financial Memorandum to the Bill when it was published, the figure of &#163;150 million was mentioned as a saving in public expenditure. As I understand it, that was later informally amended in Committee and on Report in another place to &#163;60 million, and then subsequently to &#163;50 million. The figure for savings of &#163;3 million for Wales has seemed to be reasonably consistent. At the same time, there is concern about the transitional costs, which were mentioned and allowed for in Clause 7 of the Bill: why they are necessary; what is their sum; and precisely how they will be expended. There has been difficulty in establishing the overall size of the potential savings which will arise from the enactment of the Bill and the precise size of the interim expenditure.
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para7"></a>It is not surprising that there is concern about the transitional costs and the size of any expenditure that the Secretary of State, under this Act, may provide to cover that period. As the Committee will remember, very substantial costs indeed accrued to the public purse the last time that there was any reorganisation of the health service. I am sure that the Committee will recall the very large sums of money which were spent in establishing the internal market. I have today received a rather glossy version of the Health Director which talks about a "managed metamorphosis" into the new health service authorities. It is published with the touching and seasonal picture of a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis. It speaks in considerable length and glowing terms about the transitional arrangements which will be needed between now and next April to establish the new health authorities. But it does not mention any costs.
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para8"></a>There has been an equal lack of clarity in the Bill and the speeches, both from the Minister in this Chamber and her honourable and right honourable friends in another place, about how those long-term savings are to be made. We have heard and been told again this afternoon that all the important functions of the regional health authorities will not be lost. They will simply be transferred either to local health authorities and trusts or to the regional outposts of the Department of Health. If those functions are to be satisfactorily maintained and just simply relocated, how can very substantial savings be made?
<P>


<a name="column_1753"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1753</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para9"></a>One of the suggestions has been that salaries and allowances to health authority members will be reduced by the abolition of the regional health authorities and the merger of the district health authorities and family health service authorities. We on these Benches have sometimes queried the size of the salaries bill and the expenses for members of those authorities, but savings in that area cannot possibly add up to some of the sums that have been mentioned.
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para10"></a>It was also suggested in Committee in another place that savings would be made because the regional function of compiling reports and statistical work would no longer be necessary. That brings forward another worry about the reduction in public accountability through the reduction of information. But again, if that is to be a source of major savings, it does not seem to be a very important one.
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para11"></a>Overall, as we know, regional staff have already been reduced. It is not in the areas of the regional health authorities that the enormous explosion in managerial costs has occurred in the past few years. It has been further down the line at the trusts and health authority level. What assurances do we have that there will not be a similar enlargement of management costs which will eat very substantially into those savings&#151;savings which, as I said, have not been accounted for very much?
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para12"></a>The other financial information mentioned in the guidance to the Bill is that the money that is saved&#151;the very large sum of &#163;150 million which was originally mentioned&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"will be reinvested in patient care".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para13"></a>That is what the financial memorandum says. How is that to be monitored and reported on? How are we to know exactly how the money will be redirected from those savings? It is unclear where those savings will be made at such a substantial level. How will they be transferred?
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para14"></a>I should like to ask the Minister about several matters before the Question is put to the Committee. Can she tell us the precise size of the savings, where they will come from and how the money from those savings will be deployed? I should also like some reassurance that a great part of those savings will not be swallowed up by extravagant expenditure on the transitional costs or legitimate expenditure on maintaining functions which were previously carried out by the regional health authorities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Boyd-Carpenter: </B>   It would be helpful if my noble friend the Minister could possibly tell us what now are thought to be the likely financial consequences of this measure. As the noble Baroness opposite said, it is perfectly true that on occasion changes of this kind involve transitional expenditure which exceeds what was hoped would be the outcome of those changes. I do not know whether that is likely in this case but I suppose that it is possible. In any event, in view of the fact that rather different figures, both plus and minus, have been given of the effect of this Bill on public expenditure, it <P>


<a name="column_1754"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1754</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would be very helpful if my noble friend would spend a few minutes bringing the Committee up to date on the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon </B>   I should like to ask the noble Baroness to do just that. I am thoroughly confused now. My noble friend mentioned that there had been a revision of the figures, first down to &#163;60 million and then to &#163;50 million. I took a small part in Tuesday's Committee stage, when the noble Baroness reiterated (recorded in Hansard at col. 1519) that there would be savings of around &#163;150 million. Indeed, I asked her a question about that. I asked where the &#163;150 million was going to and would Parliament be informed about where it was going. I am now thoroughly confused. Is the figure &#163;150 million, &#163;50 million or &#163;60 million that will be saved?
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para15"></a>I feel that we are entitled to know&#151;if &#163;150 million is still a relevant figure&#151;when that amount will be saved and how Parliament will be told when that amount has been saved and where it has gone to within the National Health Service, as my noble friend requested.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-14_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   Perhaps I could deal first with the principle and then go on to the savings in particular. The Committee has now agreed all the issues of principle in the Bill and there can be no reason not to agree to the financial provisions.
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para16"></a>When fully implemented, the Bill will not lead to additional costs. In fact it will result in substantial savings. But this clause is needed to give legislative cover for spending in the transitional stages and for technical changes to the basis of NHS funding. Savings after 1st April 1996, when the transitional stages are completed, will continue to be realised year after year.
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para17"></a>The effect of the clause is as follows. It permits money to be paid by Parliament to cover expenditure under the Act. Any expenditure incurred by the Secretaries of State during the transition stage will be paid under this provision&#151;for example, expenditure arising our of liabilities inherited from abolished authorities or out of additional staff costs while transferred staff are still employed by them.
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para18"></a>It also permits money to be paid to cover any increases in spending under any other Act. This is essentially a technical point. The new system will be cheaper to run than the old; nevertheless new sorts of payments may be needed under existing Acts. For example, it is obvious that payments are not currently made to health authorities under the 1977 Act because these new health authorities do not yet exist. So from 1st April 1996 this will be a new sort of expenditure under Section 97 of the 1977 Act, which this clause needs to cover.
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para19"></a>It provides for sums received by the Secretary of State to be paid into the Consolidated Fund. There will be cases where the Department of Health receives sums relating to transfer to the Secretary of State of some of the rights of the regional health authorities. For example, regional health authorities may have rights to sue for sums due on a contract. When the rights transfer to the Secretary of State on the abolition of the regional health authorities, provision is needed for such sums to be received.
<P>


<a name="column_1755"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1755</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para20"></a>In regard to the individual savings&#151;an item raised by some Members of the Committee&#151;we estimated that the abolition of regional health authorities and the merger of district health authorities and family health service authorities would result in savings approaching &#163;60 million in 1995-96. By 1997-98, when the new structure is fully implemented, those savings will rise to approaching &#163;150 million a year. Over &#163;100 million of the total savings figure results from the abolition of regional health authorities and the consequent reduction in overlap of work between the central department and the regions. The remainder is due to the replacement of district health authorities and family health services authorities with the new authorities. In addition, savings from the elimination of overlapping functions between regional health authorities and the NHS Executive will contribute to the savings of &#163;50 million to be made in the running costs of the Department of Health by 1997-98. The total figure is &#163;150 million made up of the two sums of &#163;100 million and &#163;50 million.
<P>

<a name="50330-14_para21"></a>My noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter asked about transitional costs. Whenever one brings about a change there are always costs. Of course, we shall try to keep these costs to a minimum. But the key point about the reorganisation is that it will enable substantial benefits to be made year in year out in the long term. As regards the money that is to be saved, an undertaking has been given that it will be reinvested in patient care. There will be close monitoring of that. When we set priorities, go into the PES round and draw up budgets for the year, those items will be closely monitored.

<A NAME="50330-14_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   Perhaps I may ask the Minister to give some details of the monitoring and how it will be reported to Parliament. I think that noble Lords have demonstrated this afternoon the concern that if that money is saved&#151;the Minister has clearly explained the difference between short and long-term savings&#151;it should be reinvested in patient care. How will we know that that money is being spent?

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move that the draft Social Security (Incapacity for Work) Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 1995, which were laid before the House on 2nd March, be approved.
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para4"></a>These regulations introduce a number of minor changes to the regulations which the House debated and approved on 9th February: the Social Security (Incapacity Benefit) Transitional Regulations 1995 and the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995. They also introduce a minor amendment to the 1976 Social Security (Medical Evidence) Regulations.
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para5"></a>The new system of benefits for incapacity comes into force on 13th April. These regulations complete the detailed provisions which will govern the operation of the new system. When introducing major structural reforms, such as this clearly is, there is always likely to be the need for some clarifying amendments. That is the sole purpose of the regulations before us today. Indeed, I foreshadowed them when I spoke in the debate on 9th February. The regulations before us today introduce no change in the Government's stated policy.
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para6"></a>Today's debate reflects the unusual procedures for parliamentary scrutiny which are laid down in the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) Act. Any regulations introduced under certain powers in that Act within four years of Royal Assent must be passed by an affirmative resolution of each House. This novel approach, proposed by my department, meets concerns raised directly by the Select Committee on the Scrutiny of Delegated Powers during the passage of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) Bill. It ensures parliamentary debate of any changes, however minor, which are introduced during the infancy of the new arrangements.
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para7"></a>A number of these amendments are beneficial in nature, and some follow enquiries from organisations representing disabled people. For example, following concerns raised by the Terrence Higgins Trust, we are making a slight change to the wording of the regulation which will exempt people suffering from immune deficiency states from the all-work test. This is a complex provision, and we want to be absolutely sure that it covers all the people we wish to exempt from the test. We have also added to the list of exempt conditions people receiving certain categories of the constant attendance allowance which may be paid with war pensions or industrial injuries benefit. We have uprated the weekly earnings limit for therapeutic work to &#163;44.
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para8"></a>The minor amendment to the Social Security (Medical Evidence) Regulations 1976 is necessary to ensure that rules which govern the completion of medical certificates by GPs will apply also to the new certificate, the Med4, which will be issued when the all-work test is applied.
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para9"></a>We believe that the measures to be introduced this April will ensure proper provision for those people who are incapable of working because of their medical condition within a system which is also fair to the taxpayer. The regulations before us today complete the detailed provisions of the new arrangements, and I commend them to the House.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para10"></a>Moved, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 2nd March be approved [12th Report from the Joint Committee].&#151;(Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, the House will be grateful to the Minister for explaining the purpose of these amending regulations. I do not intend to repeat all of the arguments which were rehearsed at length when we debated the Bill last summer. We know that the Act is to take effect in April. The Act will eventually save the Treasury over &#163;2 billion per year by taking invalidity benefit away from many thousands of the chronically sick and disabled and reducing the benefit of the rest, that is, those who are so sick and disabled that they continue to receive the benefit. It is estimated that 220,000 people will lose their benefit over the next two years. It is also estimated that about a quarter of those required to take the test&#151;a further 70,000 a year&#151;who would in the past have been eligible for benefit, will no longer receive it. When one looks back at the shambles of the Child Support Act and the introduction of the disability living allowance, this Act bids fair to become a third member of that sorry troika.
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para11"></a>The Minister said that these were minor changes and that under the Act he was required to report them to the House. I believe that each time a minor change is reported it will lead to further questions. I have three questions that I wish to put to the Minister. Perhaps he will reply now or, if he wishes, in writing later. New Regulation 17A in 3(3) appears to offer the choice to disabled people whether to claim unemployment benefit or incapacity benefit. Can the Minister tell us what information and guidance will be given to claimants about which way to sign on? When it is wise for them to sign on, will they be eligible for contributory unemployment benefit? Affecting the whole of this matter will be the implications posed by the jobseeker's allowance.
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para12"></a>The second question concerns appeals. It would be helpful if the Minister could give the House some guidance about the role of the medical assessor. When we debated the Bill in this House the Minister said that the assessor would give advice openly, but would leave the room while the tribunal deliberated. Will the claimant or his representative be able to cross-question the medical assessor on the advice that he or she has given to the tribunal?
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para13"></a>I also understand that some confusion remains about whether someone who claims to be exempt from the all-work test, but has been refused exemption by the benefits agency and the medical service, has a right of appeal against that decision. If so, to whom? If not, what right of redress does that person have?
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para14"></a>The third question concerns the interlocking of these regulations with other benefits, such as housing benefit and child benefit. I believe that the Minister in another place confirmed that someone could have his disability premium on these benefits backdated as long as there was acceptable evidence. Can the Minister say what acceptable evidence is? For example, will it be certification by the GP, or will some other form of evidence be regarded as acceptable?
<P>


<a name="column_1758"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1758</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para15"></a>With those three questions, without welcoming the regulations we accept the need to have them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-15_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I do not think there is any need to go into past history at the moment. We have here a use of what the Minister described as the unusual procedures for the scrutiny of regulations under the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) Act. I welcomed those procedures at the time, and I continue to welcome them. But because we need to have scrutiny, it does not mean that we need to have a fuss every time. Like the noble Lord, Lord Carter, I have no intention of making a fuss about anything in these regulations. I agree with the Minister that many of them are beneficial and all of them are small. I am not making complaints about them.
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para16"></a>In that context, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the evidence of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, in the First Report of the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee. It is printed as an appendix. The noble Lord argued that there are many cases, of which I would argue this is one, where the House has need of the affirmative procedure because things might be done under regulations which might need really close attention. But the noble Lord argued&#151;and I agree with him&#151;that it does not follow that we need to use all this scrutiny on every occasion when those powers are used. What the noble Lord suggested is that even where the affirmative procedure is used, it ought to be possible, by agreement between the usual channels and if no noble Lord objects, for the House to choose not actually to have the regulations before it. This is a case &#151;I think the noble Lord, Lord Carter, may agree&#151;where if we had had that power, we might have chosen to use it. But, nevertheless, I am extremely grateful to the Minister for coming to the House and helping to explain the regulations which, as with most regulations, are not always of the easiest to understand.
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para17"></a>I welcome very warmly the concession and the change in the definition of HIV and the exemption from the test. I am glad to know that the Terrence Higgins Trust has seen this and agreed with it. That is thoroughly welcome. But it gives me occasion to say that there is a fairly strong case for giving schizophrenics exemption from that medical test. Since we are having continuing monitoring and continuing adaptation, I hope that that is a point to which the Minister may pay some attention.
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para18"></a>I also welcome the concession allowing those who are technically incapable of working to register for unemployment benefit and to work. There are many people who might be found to be incapable of work who nevertheless, as we all know, do work and to great effect. But I should like to second the request of the noble Lord, Lord Carter, for clarification of the circumstances in which that might happen: whether there are any qualifying conditions or snags, or any conditions about the rate of incapacity benefit being received beforehand, or whether it is just simply a blanket use of a local option&#151;that the claimant can choose what he likes best.
<P>

<a name="50330-15_para19"></a>I mention, because I think it may save us a little time on the Jobseekers Bill, one other point which has come before us before. That is the possibility that people who are found fit to work under the Social Security <P>


<a name="column_1759"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1759</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>(Incapacity for Work) Bill may go along to their employment office and try to register and be sent away being told that they are not fit to work or that they will not be accepted as fit to work pending their appeal. We had an assurance on that point at Second Reading from the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, whose helpfulness throughout was very great. We are still continuing, no doubt as a result of thoughtlessness at lower levels, to get cases coming through and being reported where that is not working. I should be grateful if the Minister would think a little further, before we come onto this point during proceedings on the Jobseekers Bill, about some way of trying to make sure that we do not have to make this point again. We are all agreed, after all, so we ought to be able to make the will of Parliament prevail.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Carter, and to the noble Earl, Lord Russell, for their appreciation of my explanation of the regulations. They are not nearly as complex or, indeed, I suppose, as important or far reaching as the regulations which we discussed on 9th February. But they are of importance and some of them are of considerable importance to certain groups. I am particularly grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Russell, for his mention of the point that we have taken up which was made to us by the Terrence Higgins Trust.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para0"></a>The noble Earl asked me about schizophrenia. I shall probably plead to taking that away and writing to him about it. I suspect that it will rather depend on the seriousness of the condition. But I shall certainly write and give him an explanation of how we see schizophrenics being treated.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para1"></a>On the question of the jobseeker's allowance and this benefit, someone who having had the medical test is found fit to work and not eligible for IB will not find himself refused access to the jobseeker's allowance because the jobseeker's allowance people think that he is unfit for work. He will not fall between two stools. I have little doubt that we shall return to this point on Monday, but I hope that that assurance will help the noble Earl.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, confused me a little because he said that he was going to ask me three questions but I think that he asked me four. Never mind, I intend to answer four, which perhaps means that it is bonus day for him. Both noble Lords asked me about Regulation 2(6), which allows disabled people to register as unemployed if they prefer. Some disabled people who may well want to register for work might be unable to do so because some people&#151;for example, those registered as blind&#151;will automatically be treated as incapable for work under the new system. The provision in Regulation 2(6) will allow them access to unemployment benefit, and from next year the jobseeker's allowance, and, of course, access to the Employment Service in their search for work. The provision will assist anyone who can show some connection with work or training while excluding only those people who quite plainly cannot work. It is to help someone who, although disabled, may still actually want and feel able to work to be able to say, "I don't want to take IB. I would prefer in the future to go on to JSA and to take advantage of the Employment Service". The <P>


<a name="column_1760"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1760</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>new rule will allow people a choice. Those who decide to take advantage of it will be able, if they feel that they want to do so, to stop signing on and reclaim incapacity benefit at any time.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para3"></a>I was asked about the role of the medical assessor in the appeal. The medical assessor will be present throughout the hearing to give advice to the social security appeal tribunal on the diagnosis, nature and effect of the medical condition. He will provide advice on the medical evidence before the tribunal and the possible application of the non-functional criteria. He can, through the chairman of the SSAT, put questions to and respond to questions from the appellant. That is what the noble Lord asked. Under the all-work test, neither the claimant's GP nor the BAMS doctor will give an opinion on capacity for work. The assessor will also not give an opinion on capacity for work. The medical assessor will leave the room with the other parties to the appeal while the SSAT deliberates on its decision.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para4"></a>I was also asked whether there were any provisions that will enable people to backdate their entitlement to disability premium when it is payable only on grounds of incapacity, which used to be possible by way of a backdated medical certificate. A doctor will still be able to issue a backdated statement&#151;form Med. 5. With this medical evidence, the all-work test may be treated as satisfied until it is applied. If the claimant is found incapable of work and is entitled to a disability premium, the premium will be backdated as under the current provisions.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para5"></a>It was also suggested that there is virtually no right of appeal regarding the exempt groups&#151;for example, for the claimant to produce new evidence at the appeal. A claimant cannot appeal against a Benefits Agency medical service doctor's decision not to provide a certificate of exemption from the all-work test if that is the only question at issue. But he can appeal against a subsequent decision by an adjudication officer that he is capable of work. He can then argue that he should have been treated as incapable under one of the exempt categories. In cases of doubt the appeal tribunal can refer the case back to BAMS for further consideration of the exempt question. They can then reconsider the question in the light of any new medical evidence which the claimant chooses to bring to the appeal hearing. I hope that I have answered the questions asked by noble Lords. I commend the regulations to the House.

<a name="50330-16_time0"></a><H5>6.21 p.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-16_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Kinnoull </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what are the consequences of the recent European decision on fishing in Irish Box waters for the British fishing industry and for conservation, particularly in the light of the recent dispute over Greenland halibut in North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) waters.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para10"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, I would like to thank in advance noble Lords and my noble friend Lady Elles, for indicating that they will be taking part and, I am sure, giving us the value and wisdom of their views on what I believe is a very important subject. Although the duration of the debate is limited&#151;I shall try to keep myself to far less than 10 minutes&#151;the timing of it is fortuitous.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para11"></a>The Newfoundland dispute, which has become such a high profile and acrimonious confrontation off the Canadian waters, has many similarities to fears for the future of the Irish Box waters. These fears not only focus on too much capacity chasing dwindling fish stocks but, more vital, on the present lack of faith and credibility of the present system of conservation and the effectiveness of enforcement procedures.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para12"></a>The desperate measures taken by the Canadian Government and their alleged evidence of the Spanish trawler "Estai", arrested with illegal nets and false holds stuffed with young fish and differing ship's logs of catches, confirms the worst fears of flagrant abuse and continuing damage of our fish stocks despite the bureaucratic assurances of conservation control to which everyone pays lip service.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para13"></a>It is not difficult to understand the frustration and patience snapping when the Canadians see 40 Spanish and Portuguese boats fishing in the straddling waters just outside their own waters, scooping up the fish that they seek to conserve, particularly the half-grown fish which, sadly, know nothing better about the boundaries of the sea and the safer Canadian waters. It is less difficult to understand why Commissioner Bonino does not advise the Spanish to back off and stop being provocative while she seeks to settle the dispute on quotas. After all, the Spanish are only one member of the group of 12 which she represents.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para14"></a>As I have said, the Irish Box waters face, I believe, some problems similar to the Newfoundland dispute after 1st January next year. I am sure that they face a similar determination by British fishermen.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para15"></a>I believe that the Government should act now to persuade European fisheries to delay the Irish Box decision until new conservation protection measures and effective enforcement procedures are adopted. I am not persuaded by the argument that because some <P>


<a name="column_1762"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1762</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>understanding was given some years ago over the fishing of these waters the Irish Box decision is cast in stone. Circumstances have changed: there is a lack of confidence in conservation measures and the Spanish have not exactly improved their case.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para16"></a>I am told that scientists have advised very recently on the Irish Box waters and have stated that these valuable waters need conserving and that to safeguard their future no extra fishing effort should be contemplated. So is it really in the long-term interest of these waters to introduce 30 Spanish boats at any one time, each capable of scooping up fish from the fish beds?
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para17"></a>What is the likely result of that policy? It will undoubtedly hit hard financially British fishermen in the south west. It is also likely that very soon, by increasing this fishing capacity, no one will have a viable operation in these waters as fish become scarce. Is it time that Brussels paid more attention to scientists than to try to politically accommodate members' fishing fleets?
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para18"></a>I turn briefly to the future measures for tightening up conservation and enforcement. Besides reducing the capacity of fleets, which I am sure my noble friend will be confirming as regards de-commissioning&#151;I am very pleased that the Government have supported that forcefully in the past few months&#151;I hope that my noble friend can say what extra measures Her Majesty's Government may be proposing at the next fishing conference beyond increasing the number of inspectors or fishery protection boats. For instance, should the larger boats have observers on board? What use could satellite surveillance be on the problem? Should certain fish nets, designed specifically to scoop up from the sea bed in an industrial manner, be banned?
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para19"></a>As regards enforcement, if we are serious about it&#151;one has to say that in the past British fishermen have been renegades, as have others&#151;should we not seek a penalty for flagrant violation that is really penal, coupled with a ban for a period of time?
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para20"></a>I recognise that the fishing industry is extraordinarily complex. Even in recent history, apart from the Newfoundland dispute, there has been a number of ugly incidents in other fishing grounds. Last weekend I re-read the Select Committee report of 1992 on the fishing industry and I found a mine of information with very sensible conclusions. I was glad to see that the noble Lord, Lord Carter, was a Member of that committee and that he is taking part in the debate tonight. I hope that in future some suitable committee of the House will continue to monitor the industry from time to time and the progress of conservation: it is a pretty important subject.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para21"></a>Finally, I hope that tonight my noble friend will be able to confirm Her Majesty's Government's commitment to the support of our hard-pressed fishing industry and support of the goal of better conservation measures which clearly the Canadian Government are still seeking.

<P>
<A NAME="50330-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for bringing this Question before the House. I feel quite sure that British fishermen and the fishing <P>


<a name="column_1763"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1763</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>industry will be most grateful to him for the way that he has expressed what in fact are their worries and their case. I shall take a slightly different line from the noble Earl, but nevertheless it will be in support of the British fishing industry.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para22"></a>I believe that the first thing we should note is that in 1971 landings by British fishing vessels were 913,000 tonnes. In 1990 that figure had fallen to 528,000 tonnes. As far as imports are concerned, in 1971 we imported 166,000 tonnes of fish and by 1990 that figure had risen to 405,500 tonnes. So it can be seen that there has been a great diminution in the British fishing effort.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para23"></a>I believe that British fishermen&#151;and certainly they believe&#151;have been very badly treated by the Government over a very long period and their interests subordinated to those of the European Community and the countries within it. In my view, the common fisheries policy was a huge mistake. It has led to the decimation of fish stocks around our shores and to the near demise of our fishing industry.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para24"></a>It is clearly the aim of the European Union, apparently supported by Her Majesty's Government&#151;I hope that that can be denied&#151;that there should not be a British fishing industry, only a European Union fishing industry. That appears to be confirmed by an answer that I have received to a Question about the number of British-owned fishing vessels. The answer that I received did not come from the Minister, but from Mr. Bradley, the chief executive of the Marine Safety Agency. It stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"With the introduction of the 1993 Act the only requirement for eligibility in respect of companies is that they be incorporated in a member State of the European Economic Area, and have a place of business in the United Kingdom".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para25"></a>In other words, so far as I can see we are being told that there is no longer any such thing as a "British fisherman".
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para26"></a>The problems of the common fisheries policy intensified with the accession of Spain and Portugal to the EU, and were further exacerbated by Spain's blackmailing tactics&#151;I use those words advisedly&#151;over the admission to the European Union of Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway when Spain threatened to blackball those new applicants. Of course, Norway sensibly decided that it did not want to come in after all. The failure of Mr. Waldegrave to vote against bringing forward the date of full accession to the CFP from 2002 to 1996 was a complete betrayal of British fishermen and their families. As we have heard, the advent of 40 additional Spanish trawlers into the Irish Box can only further decimate the British fishing industry and lead to an even more rapid depletion of the fish stocks around our shores.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para27"></a>I come now to the fish war with Canada. I believe that the British people were outraged that Britain allied itself with Spain and the EU and the strident militancy of Mrs. Bonino. Even before the full facts could possibly have been known, British support was apparently indicated by our permanent representatives. I want to know what right those civil servants have&#151;that is what they are; nobody elected them any more than anybody elected me&#151;to speak for the British people or for the Commonwealth. Did they first contact the British <P>


<a name="column_1764"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1764</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Foreign Secretary or any other Foreign Office Minister? I want answers to these questions. Was the Prime Minister informed of the crisis; and, if so, did he consent to taking sides with Spain and the EU against Canada? Did those representatives even contact our fisheries Minister; and, if so, what was his attitude?
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para28"></a>According to the latest reports, only today Britain has again been threatened by Spain if we fail to back the Spanish in their dispute with Canada. Of course, we are used to threats from that country. I have already mentioned Spain's threats with regard to the accession of Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway. There is also the question of Gibraltar. We are used to unfriendly acts by Spain in that regard. Indeed, Spain has shown herself to be a country that is neither friendly towards, nor a partner of, Britain in many respects. As was shown on that fateful weekend, Spain has failed to recognise our position as a member of the Commonwealth as well as of the European Union. Spain's policy is geared towards taking everything that it can get, even when that means piratically depredating fish stocks around our shores and everywhere it can in the world&#151;while giving nothing in return.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para29"></a>I sincerely hope that the Government's policy is now firmly aligned in support of Canada. That is certainly where the British people and Parliament want it to be. As my right honourable friend Mr. Peter Shore said in an excellent letter in today's Daily Telegraph:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This is a defining moment ... the real question is where Britain's loyalties lie: with the European Union or with Canada to whom we are bound by ties of history, language, people and common endeavour in both peace and war".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para30"></a>We should remember those things. I hope that we shall. I hope that the Government will remember them. The British people have certainly expressed their views in no uncertain terms. They are with Canada and they are appalled that there should have been any doubt of that in the official mind.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para31"></a>The time has come for Britain to assert itself, as the Prime Minister and, indeed, his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales seemed to be saying only yesterday. This is an issue upon which a start can be made in asserting ourselves by telling Spain and the European Union that we will not join in their bellicosity against Canada, and that we shall no longer allow the decimation of fish stocks by the Spanish and Portuguese. Towards that end, we should give notice that we intend to renounce the agreement on the CFP at an appropriate moment.

<A NAME="50330-16_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Elles: </B>   My Lords, I too should like to thank my noble friend Lord Kinnoull for this opportunity to speak about a matter which is very much of the moment, of both today and the past few days. However, we have to recognise that there is over-fishing worldwide. There is an urgent need for the conservation of stocks. Equally urgent is the strict enforcement, according to results, of negotiated agreements. The governments of the member states are faced now with the question of how to share declining resources.
<P>


<a name="column_1765"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1765</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para32"></a>There are many British and, indeed, Spanish fishermen who would like to see the end of the common fisheries policy. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, has implied that Britain should renounce the common fisheries policy agreement. But the fact of the matter is that if we were to do that, it would be a severe blow to British fishermen. I wonder whether the noble Lord realises that if we were to return to allocations based on traditional fishing performance, that would mean severe losses for British fishermen. At present, they can fish in foreign waters in the south west, in the British channel and in Irish waters. In effect, British fishing boats are no longer confined to our own waters thanks to the CFP, whether you like it or not. We also have to remember that our biggest export market for fish among other member states of the European Union happens to be Spain which imports several million pounds of fish from British fishermen's catches. Despite the limited access of the 40 Spanish boats to the Irish Box, it is worth recalling that our quota remains the same. The British quota for British fishermen has not decreased since it was first decided. Therefore, renouncing membership of the CFP would be to the detriment of our own fishermen. I am sure that no noble Lord intends that.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para33"></a>There are two points to be made about the dispute between Spain and Canada. First, I do not know whether this is correct, but the British press this morning carried reports that the "Estai", the Spanish boat involved in this adventure, was examined by senior inspectors. There was no false hold; the log books were in order and the nets were not illegal because, as I understand it, no limit has been imposed by NAFO on the minimum size of turbot which can be caught by that boat. I am sure that my noble friend the Minister will reply to those points and that he will be able to state whether that report is correct. That is what I read in the press today.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para34"></a>My second point on this issue is that the Canadians are understandably anxious to prevent Spanish fishing vessels or any other foreign fishing vessels fishing in their waters or near to the 200-mile limit, and would like to fish in as wide an area as possible themselves. That is a perfectly legitimate aspiration for the Canadian people, and I support it totally. It is to be hoped, however, that calmer views will prevail and that a negotiated settlement can be reached between the Canadians, who are our old friends and allies and who are part of the British ethos, culture and traditions, and other countries of the European Community, using the British as their mediator and helper in reaching such a settlement.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para35"></a>No one has yet said that the real enemy of British and other fishermen is not other fishermen and other boats but, regrettably, the seal. Seals may be attractive, especially to the thousands who lobbied the European Parliament in the 1980s, but the result of that lobby was that the culling of baby seals and the import to Europe of seal skin were stopped. Grey seals around the United Kingdom number anything from 100,000 to 150,000. The numbers are growing annually at the rate of from 5 <P>


<a name="column_1766"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1766</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>per cent. to 8 per cent.; and 40 per cent. of the British grey seal population is alleged to eat 76,000 tonnes of fish, including sand eel and cod, every year.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para36"></a>In a recent article in the Financial Times, British fishermen allege that seals consume about 240,000 tonnes of fish. That is more than the quota of catch under the CFP, which is 194,000 tonnes of fish a year. A similar story applies to Canada. The grey seal population is 144,000. It is growing fast at the rate of 13 per cent. a year. It is alleged that there are 4 million harp seals around the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Such is the danger they present that the decline in the number of cod has resulted in the virtual ending of commercial fishing off Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and areas along the Atlantic coast in that part of the world. It is no wonder that the Canadians are anxious about preserving their fish stocks. They have every right to be anxious. We in this part of the world are anxious to take the necessary measures.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para37"></a>The conservation of fish is urgent for fishermen everywhere to enable them to continue, rightly, to earn their living. If measures such as the rigorous enforcement of quotas are applied strictly, then governments must face the issue, be courageous, and take measures to apply scientific management to the seals which are the greatest consumers of fish that we have to face.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-16_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Clanwilliam: </B>   My Lords, this is an opportune moment to discuss the vital matter of finding effective means to preserve fish stocks. It is a truism to say that fish are a vital element of the food chain, the ecology of the sea and indeed of our own livelihoods. We take our fish stocks for granted at our peril. We have only to consider the condition of our east coast towns of Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft which used to house huge herring fishing fleets. They have gone.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para38"></a>The distant water fleets of Hull and Fleetwood have been practically decimated. The biggest fishing fleet today works out of Newlyn which in the old days was a relatively minor fishing port. It is the major port which will be involved in fishing the Irish Box. It is a relatively small fishing community.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para39"></a>The whole tale of commercial fishing is a sorry one of competition. There are ever more efficient means of detecting whole shoals of fish which can be effectively and totally harvested. I used to fish for pilchards off the west coast of Africa with a 100-foot boat and a perseine net. We used to have to wait for the moon to come up in order to be able to find the fish by their phosphorescence. When we did, we had to put a boat out and put the net around the fish. Today, no one does anything stupid like that. The fisherman have sonar and every kind of technical device which can detect whole shoals of fish and harvest them totally.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para40"></a>That is not all. Ships can be equipped with more powerful engines, unbeknown to anyone except Lloyd's A.1. They can tow their nets that much faster, and thus reduce the size of the nets and so gather more fish. We have reports of all those activities from our friends in Canada, who are rightly determined to protect their <P>


<a name="column_1767"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1767</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>traditional fishing grounds which do indeed extend beyond their 200-mile limit. But we are talking about the conservation of fish. The fish which breed are not necessarily interested in the 200-mile limit. They breed on the Banks. It is the Banks that need to be protected and that is what the Canadians are doing. That is why the Canadians' activities are justified. We should sympathise with them and reflect that only a few years ago we were involved in a cod war with Iceland. Iceland had the same problems as the Canadians are now facing.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para41"></a>We must also have great sympathy with the Canadians of Nova Scotia, especially those whose livelihoods are being put at peril by the piratical pillaging of their fish stocks by the marauding Spanish fishing fleet. At Question Time today I asked my noble friend by what authority the Commission, without the consent of the Council of Ministers, addressed itself in provocative terms to the sovereign nation of Canada. I was told that I would receive an answer to that question from my noble friend Lord Howe this evening. I look forward to hearing his remarks.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para42"></a>We must demand of the Spanish Government, and of the European Union, that those fishing methods be stopped and that proper controls be put in place by the fishery inspectors of Spain. Can my noble friend assure us not only that those inspectors are in place at the ports&#151;there are reports in the Daily Telegraph today which indicate clearly that they are not&#151;and not, as in the past, in the fishing ministry in Madrid, but also that they are fully equipped with the authority and the steely nerves necessary to enforce the rules.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para43"></a>Mr. Peter Derham, a former chief fisheries protection officer for England and Wales, a man of great authority, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We found no government fishery inspectors at La Coruna&#151;the main fishing port in Galicia. When we inquired, workers asked: 'Inspectors for what?' There were not even any weighing scales around in the port's vast fish market. Fishermen's leaders said inspectors did not make stringent checks because they did not agree with the Common Fisheries Policy".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para44"></a>I do not agree with the common fisheries policy nor do most of our fishermen. Unfortunately, our fishery inspectors do not pay any attention to their complaints. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said that we should disregard the common fisheries policy. I shall interject into my speech my special agreement with him in that respect.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para45"></a>But it is not only the Spaniards who are a problem; we must realise that this is a worldwide problem. Fish stocks through the North Atlantic are already in deep peril. They will be in far greater peril when the Irish Box is opened to the Spanish. To some extent the rules are self-destructive. There is a requirement that small fish be rejected and put back into the sea because they do not match the limit rule. That rule may be necessary to convince the Brussels regulators that their pet rules are not being contravened, but, frankly, I am not over-impressed by that argument. If fish are caught, they should be brought home and used. It is of course the net size that matters and not the size of the fish. Unless we can control the net sizes we shall not get anywhere.
<P>


<a name="column_1768"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1768</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para46"></a>What is perhaps more important is positive control of the remaining fishing grounds. Will my noble friend tell us what progress is being made under the IMO rules on installing transponders on all seagoing vessels? Will those transponders be reactive to aerial patrols rather than to the more expensive satellite system? That is all the more important, because while we are considering the Atlantic&#151;the North Atlantic at that&#151;there is also the world problem of the Pacific fishing grounds, the north-west Pacific in particular, which has been brought to light only recently. I understand that there are two vital grounds which are about to be decimated by the world's fishing industry.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para47"></a>National traditions in eating habits combined with modern technical and engineering capabilities make the international problems insoluble without the active co-operation of the fishermen. A more diverse and individualistic collection of human beings would be hard to find. They are fighting for their livelihoods. There needs to be sympathetic management of the people involved. It cannot be done by regulators regulating for regulation's sake from some Brussels office. It must be done by consent and co-operation between the fishermen.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para48"></a>My noble friend may tell me that that is easier said than done, and I readily agree. I congratulate him on the work that he has done as regards working with the fishermen. I see that I am being looked at from the Front Bench and so I conclude by saying that we should give as much support as possible to the Canadians in supporting their own fishermen and foster a bond between our two groups.

<A NAME="50330-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Willoughby de Broke: </B>   My Lords, I have sympathy with my noble friend Lord Howe in fielding this hot potato. However, I hope that he will not try to defend the indefensible. I hope that he will assure the House that Her Majesty's Government will climb down off the fence and ignore hollow threats from the Spanish Government, in particular from the European Union Fisheries Commissioner, Mrs. Bonino, and state that they will veto any attempt to impose sanctions on Canada. My noble friend was unable to give that assurance last week in answer to my Starred Question.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para49"></a>The dispute between Canada and Spain is a beacon as regards what lies ahead. From 1996 Spanish fishing boats will have access to the Irish Box. As was pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, they should not have had that access until 2002 and they gained it, in effect, by blackmail. To that sorry story we must add persistent, and proven, over-fishing worldwide and illegal fishing. During the Canadian fisheries dispute that was shown by the Canadian Minister for Fisheries, Mr. Brian Tobin. I believe that he demonstrated conclusively that the nets used by the Spanish fishing boat "Estai" were illegal and I hope that the Government will accept that. The Canadians demonstrated outside the United Nations building in New York and showed the nets that they had pulled up from the bottom of the sea. My noble friend Lady Elles quoted a newspaper report stating that the fishermen arrived in Spain without illegal nets. During their travel across the Atlantic the <P>


<a name="column_1769"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1769</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fishermen in question had ample time to get rid of any illegal nets and therefore there would be no incriminating evidence. If I were a Spanish fishermen I would have done exactly the same.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para50"></a>The Spanish fishing fleet is too large and cannot be sustained. How can anyone believe that the Spanish fleet, with its record for catching undersized fish for its home market, will reform overnight when it has access to the Irish Box and in 2002 will have full access to all our fishing waters? Of course it will not.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para51"></a>I wish to quote from a speech made in another place by my right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we do not believe that the Spanish play according to the rules. We are not alone in the world in believing that: the Canadians and the Norwegians tell the same story".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 18/1/95; col. 783.]</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para52"></a>Will my noble friend enlarge on the measures that will be effective in, first, stopping the Spanish exceeding the controlled number of fishing vessels, which I believe is 40, entering the Irish Box; secondly, in ensuring that their methods and gear are strictly legal; and thirdly, that they do not exceed their quota? My noble friend will agree that enforcement is problematical and does not offer a solution, as mentioned by my noble friend Lady Elles. Persistent over-fishing is the real threat. There does not appear to be an answer to that problem or the political will to redress it.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para53"></a>The best estimates are that most fleets, including our own, need to be substantially reduced over time, most by about 50 per cent. and the Spanish and Portuguese fleets by up to 80 per cent.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para54"></a>My noble friend the Minister will be aware of the report by Sir Crispin Tickell on sustainable development. I am afraid that there is little comfort for the current fisheries policy. He said that without further substantial decommissioning of fishing boats there will soon be few fish left to catch in any sea. In the light of that, will the Government consider an idea that I float lightly across to the Minister? It is that they use their veto at the Inter-governmental Conference in 1996 and propose radical reform&#151;not our withdrawal, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart&#151;of the common fisheries policy. I believe that without such reform we shall still be fiddling around with the problem at the edges. I hope that my noble friend will indicate whether that is possible or can be considered.

<A NAME="50330-16_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Mountgarret: </B>   My Lords, the Question posed by my noble friend Lord Kinnoull consists of 47 words. However, there is one important key word. It is "consequences". He asks:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"what are the consequences of the recent European decision".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para55"></a>I wait with interest to hear the reply of my noble friend Lord Howe. On 7th February I asked a supplementary question to the Question tabled by my noble friend Lord Caldecote regarding the fishery protection ships of the Royal Navy. I asked whether Her Majesty's <P>


<a name="column_1770"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1770</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government were worried about the prospect of the Royal Navy being ordered to turn on its countrymen in order to protect Spanish fleets from fishing our stocks.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para56"></a>I believe that that is a real possibility. My noble friend replied that he very much hoped that the situation would not arise. He went on to say that we have undertaken to ensure that enforcement is adequate. I subscribe to that hope. But hope is one thing and actuality is another. What are the adequate enforcements to which my noble friend referred if he does not mean physical enforcement? Surely that is why ships of the Royal Navy are to be present to protect ships of the Spanish fishing fleet. We are faced with the possibility of the Royal Navy turning on our Cornish fishermen, or any others, who try to prevent the Spanish from fishing around our shores.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para57"></a>There is a real possibility that that may occur. I do not know whether my noble friend knows much about the character and resilience of Cornishmen. I know that they are extremely patriotic, principally where Cornish matters are concerned. That being the case, I strongly suspect that the Cornish fishermen, and indeed others who have their interests at heart, will do everything in their power to try to stop the Spanish armada from cleaning out their remaining fishing stocks. If that were to happen the Royal Navy, which I understand will be entrusted with the task of defending the Spaniards, will be forced to turn on its own countrymen. That is not a fanciful or exaggerated idea; nor is it a situation that I should like to see. But the fact remains that unless those wretched European Union directives are withdrawn, that is what may happen. That is the specific point that I should like to make on this Question.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para58"></a>But the general point to be raised is that we shall be told that it would be illegal to withdraw from the directives which have been imposed on us in the context of the Treaty of Rome, Maastricht and so on. To that I should say that this is not the moment for a wide-ranging debate on the whole principle of the European Union. But the fact remains that any matter relating thereto must bring into question the desirability of our continued association with the bureaucrats in Brussels to whom the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, referred. They are not elected and they issue directives like confetti and expect us to go along with them. But that is the wider issue.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para59"></a>The Cornish fishermen are not interested in the general picture. They are interested in their fishing boats, their fish and their livelihood. I hope that my noble friend will assure us that their interests will be taken fully into account.

<P>

<a name="50330-16_para60"></a>At the outset perhaps I may pray in aid a maxim in equity which I hope will appeal to my noble friend Lady Elles, whose speech I greatly admired. The maxim is: he who comes to equity must come with clean hands. <P>


<a name="column_1771"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1771</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The hands of the Dons are some of the dirtiest around. Let us make no mistake about that. They have no right to plead equity on the issue.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para61"></a>The reasons are well known. Perhaps I may quote from an article in the Financial Times written by Mr. Brian Tobin who, as your Lordships well know, is the Canadian Minister of Fishing and Oceans. He stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Out of 44 Spanish vessels active on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland in eastern Canada, 36 have been issued with citations over the past four years".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para62"></a>Those are not citations for excellence. I presume that that is a Canadian legal term of art for documents which state that the authorities are well aware of what is going on. The article continues:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Their offences included misreporting catches, using illegal nets and net linings and retaining under-age fish.</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>One of the most destructive of these practices is the taking of juvenile fish before they reach sexual maturity and can help to ensure healthy stock levels are maintained".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para63"></a>All those findings were confirmed and proved after the inspection of the "Estai". That cannot be gainsaid. I cannot believe that the Canadian Minister of Fishing and Oceans is about lying in public.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para64"></a>Perhaps I may mention again the speech of my noble friend Lady Elles. She was absolutely right to refer to the dangers in relation to seals. The false representations made by the seal lobby are based on the thinnest of evidence. It is monstrous that seals should be allowed to cause so much destruction to the fish stocks of the world. They destroy fish stocks in all areas of the world and they should be culled. I agree entirely with that point. However, that is no excuse for the Government's stance with regard to the dispute.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para65"></a>I should like to ask my noble friend a very simple question. Will he tell the House the form of words which the Government used in their undoubted apology to the Canadian Government for their apparent, in the early days, support of the European Union's stance with regard to that matter? I hope sincerely that they have apologised to the Canadian Government, because it is monstrous that our name was attached to those appallingly provocative words which were used by the European Union. I echo what the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, has already stated, and he is quite right in that regard.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para66"></a>Modern technology makes possible the complete destruction of virtually every commercial fish stock. That has been stated over and over again, not least by the United Nation's Law of the Sea Conference in 1982. It made all the right noises with regard to the conservation of fish stocks; and yet there is a total absence of the political will to implement laws which are already extant.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para67"></a>I hope sincerely that my noble friend will make a statement giving the strongest possible support to the Canadians for their extraordinarily brave stance in this connection. As Mr. Brian Tobin rightly said at the end of his article:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The steps we have taken in the past week were not solely in the interests of Canada. We are concerned with the conservation of a resource for the sake and future of the world. The rectitude of our actions will be praised in generations to come".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="50330-16_para68"></a>How right he is. I hope that my noble friend feels the same shame as I do that the fishermen of Cornwall raised the Canadian flag and not the Union Jack. That is positively shaming. I hope that my noble friend will answer the questions that I have raised.

<P>
<A NAME="50330-16_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Beaumont of Whitley: </B>   My Lords, on these Benches, together with noble Lords throughout the House, we regard the maintenance of the world's capacity to feed its people as of the very highest importance. Indeed, it is extremely difficult to think of anything more important.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para69"></a>Until fairly recently&#151;certainly within our lifetime&#151;the oceans of the world were regarded as a seemingly inexhaustible supply of protein. Now we have had to learn that, owing to a combination of pollution and over-fishing, not only is the harvest of fish not increasing, it is decreasing, especially when we look at the matter in relation to per head of world population. Therefore, we have an even stronger duty to nurture very carefully the stocks.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para70"></a>Indeed, we are told that the stocks of cod, plaice and sole in western waters are already outside safe biological limits and that we shall soon be reduced to a situation where, like Marie Antoinette, we shall have to tell them to go and eat hake.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para71"></a>But the art of the international conservation of fish stocks is very much in its infancy. Therefore, we very much welcome the Question posed by the noble Earl, Lord Kinnoull, this evening. As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, told the House on 7th February, the Government already spend &#163;26 million per annum on fisheries enforcement, of which &#163;14 million is spent on surface surveillance and enforcement at sea. He told us also that the need for further resources was being assessed in the run-up to January 1996. It is surely now clear, not least from looking at this week's newspapers, that considerable further resources are needed and it will be helpful to hear the Government's thinking on that matter.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para72"></a>As always, we shall need more information than we have at present in order to solve some of the more difficult problems. In that context, I have given notice to the Minister to ask for information as to how many Spanish-owned fishing vessels are operating under British flags. I accept that there was a case for thinking that that information was not only superfluous but also vaguely insulting. But that situation no longer exists. It is clear that we need to know the answer to that question.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para73"></a>Finally, perhaps I may say that the present series of crises underline the need to make the present machinery work. That would be nice. We certainly will not do any good by merely demolishing such machinery that exists or by just attacking broadside-on the whole EC. We must make the machinery that we have work. Some of those situations and organisations that we have set up, like the common fisheries policy and the EC, are tools to be used&#151;not abused&#151;and must not be abolished.

<a name="50330-16_para74"></a>However, in addition to making the present machinery work, we must start a major rethink which will result in a long-term restocking programme. If that means that we must look again at the seal situation, as suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Elles, and the noble Lord, Lord Morris, well, then, that consideration will have to be borne in mind. We need to go back and rethink from the beginning how we are to save the fish stocks of the world.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para75"></a>We find ourselves in the situation where greed, competition and high technology have got the better of our ability to cope. Perhaps I may suggest that what we need is a worldwide husbandry of fish stocks and an encouragement of the kind of fishing that will maximise employment rather than either catch or cash. The people who need to be in control of fishing policy are not actually the economists; they are the ecologists. The people who need to be administering the policy are fishermen&#151;admittedly, the kind of fishermen who do not tell tall stories and whose words we can trust. Nevertheless, they are the people who need to be administering it. I hope that the Government will continue to do their very best to ensure that we move in that direction.

<A NAME="50330-16_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, the House will be most grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Kinnoull, for providing us with the opportunity for such a timely debate. It is quite clear from the events of recent months that the so-called common fisheries policy is beginning to make the common agricultural policy look like a beacon of common sense and sweet reason. We can all agree what the features of a successful policy should be. There is a need to reduce the fishing effort so that stocks will be conserved; there must be more effective enforcement in both national and international waters; there must be a greater range of technical conservation measures, which should be based on scientific advice; the decommissioning scheme has to be made much more effective and fairer as between member states of the European Union; and, finally, there must be some proper help for communities which are dependent on fishing.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para76"></a>The background involved has been covered by many speakers. We know that agreement was reached at the Council of Ministers last December for the new arrangements in the Irish Box. But we must remember that our own Minister of Agriculture abstained in that vote. I have never seen a satisfactory explanation for that action. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us one in his response.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para77"></a>It would also be helpful if the Minister could explain the mystery as regards the timetable. First, there was mention of the year 2002, then it was changed to 1996, and, indeed, other matters were reviewed in 1993. Therefore, it would be most helpful if the Minister could set out what has changed in the timetable, and if he could deny the remarks that have been made that the whole matter has been brought back to 1996 as one of the side deals in the Maastricht negotiations.
<P>

<P>

<a name="50330-16_para78"></a>The overriding objective of any fisheries policy for Britain, for the European Union, for Canada or for anywhere else must be to manage the fishing stocks so that they are conserved for the future. It is hard to see any area of the world seas, especially those which are controlled&#151;to use a term of art&#151;by the common fisheries policy, where that objective is being met.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para79"></a>What is the situation regarding the review of the common fisheries policy? I have already mentioned the confusion over the various dates. It would be most helpful if we knew exactly what opportunities still exist for reviewing the policy, which clearly is not working. Such matters as the standard of vessel measurement, vessel capacity, the use of those units for the measurements of fishing effort, the question of standard vessel days, the possibility of individual transferable quotas and improvements to the decommissioning scheme have all been suggested. Are such matters still negotiable, or is the CFP set in stone?
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para80"></a>The agreement reached at the Fisheries Council in December was that member states would play the major role in defining how their fleets' efforts would be controlled in the relevant areas, with safeguards to prevent abuse. How exactly is it proposed to monitor the enthusiasm with which the different member states set about controlling their fishing effort? For example, in the question of enforcement of the Irish Box, I am told that the largest responsibility for enforcement rests with the Irish Navy. Perhaps the Minister could tell us what proportions of the Irish Box are controlled by the Irish Navy and by the British Navy and what resources the Irish Navy has for the task.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para81"></a>In October 1993, the Minister of State in MAFF said that it was the Government's objective that Spanish and Portuguese fishing activities should be confined as closely as possible to their current pattern and that there should be no access to the Irish Box. We know that under the new arrangements, the Spanish&#151;and, indeed, the Portuguese&#151;vessels will have some form of access from the south-west of England right up to the north of Scotland; and in fact will be able to take in large parts of the Irish Box.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para82"></a>I return to the previous point about control and enforcement. What resources will be devoted to enforcement as the policy, as well as the fish, start to bite? Surely the crucial question is: how can a new fishing effort by the Spanish fleet be added to the already over-large fleet which is pressing on a shrinking stock without some consequent reduction in the British effort? Effective enforcement is central to the problem.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para83"></a>Perhaps the best description of the common fisheries policy was in Lloyd's List on 14th March:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The most cursory scrutiny of the European common fisheries agreements show a system that is chaotic, politically manipulated almost at will, and totally ineffective at properly managing the fish stocks contained within the European 'pond'.</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Quota cheating is routine, the manipulation of catching capacity through the use of flags of convenience cynical in the extreme. The European fisheries are, in short, facing a disaster, with many stocks on the point of collapse... European officials are in no position to lecture the Canadians about legal niceties and maritime law. When considering the moral high ground, Europe remains in the valley".<P>

<P>

<a name="50330-16_para84"></a>The Motion on the Order Paper also obviously deals with the Canadian dispute. Perhaps I may return to a point that I raised during Question Time recently. I asked the Minister whether it was correct that five years ago the European Union catch in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation area was 2,000 tonnes but that it is now 82,000 tonnes. If those figures are correct, one can see why the Canadians have taken the action that they have. It also explains why most of us were appalled&#151;as, indeed, was my noble friend Lord Stoddart and other speakers&#151;that the Government had apparently agreed to the statement by the ambassadors to the European Union (all, no doubt, expert in fishing) which said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The European Union and its member states are forced to reassess their relationship with Canada in the light of this deplorable situation and reserve their rights to take any action which they deem appropriate".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para85"></a>I shall be interested to know what input the British Government had in the drafting of that statement.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para86"></a>We know that Canada has experienced a virtual wipe-out of the Canadian Atlantic cod stock&#151;a wipe-out to which their own fishermen contributed. One can understand their concern. They have certainly learnt the hard way. It is clear that international arrangements to deal with fishing in international waters are even less effective than the European Union arrangements for dealing with the fishery control in European Union waters. The UN Standing Conference on the Law of the Sea is supposed to help, but it seems to have been singularly ineffective in the current dispute.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para87"></a>As I understand it, the basic dispute in the North Atlantic is not now about the total allowable catch, which has been agreed at 27,000 tonnes; it is about how much of the quota is for Canada and how much for the European Union&#151;which means Spain. If we can all agree that quiet diplomacy is to be the way forward, does the Minister not agree that that process is not helped by the intemperate comments of the European Commissioner whose Latin temperament seems to be more suited to the corrida than to the corridors of power?
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para88"></a>What proposals are there for policing and controlling the fishing effort in international waters? Is it practicable to set up an enforcement operation with observers on the boats? Who is investigating the allegations about mesh sizes, registered and declared engine sizes, hidden holds and all the rest of the stories that have appeared recently? Is it the responsibility of the European Union or of NAFO? How long will the investigations take, and who will report to whom?
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para89"></a>Before concluding I should like to draw the attention of the House to an article which appeared today in the New Statesman which includes some extremely interesting figures concerning the wider problem in international waters. There were facts of which I was not aware. The article states that it is a little-known fact that the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea puts about 90 per cent. of the world's fish stocks under the jurisdiction of developing countries. Here the fishing disputes go much further than flour thrown at Ministers or fines.

<P>

<a name="50330-16_para90"></a>Claiming that India's waters were under-exploited, the Indian Government hoped to earn more than &#163;300 million in foreign exchange by selling licences that could allow as many as 255 foreign fishing vessels to operate there. Boats from Denmark, Japan, South Korea and the US are among the foreign fleet. We can all imagine the effect on the small Indian fishing boats, which can catch only 1 tonne, of competition from trawlers catching 2,000 tonnes.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para91"></a>The European Union has 16 agreements with African countries. Senegal has signed a two-year fisheries agreement with the EU that comes to an end at the end of this year. Senegal is the largest of the ACP countries exporting to the EU and accounts for 80 per cent. of all ACP fish exports. Under the agreement, the quota set for EU vessels fishing for deep-water species was increased by 57 per cent. It appears that Senegal's 35,000 traditional fishermen now have to venture much further out to sea in boats which are not designed for it. There have been drownings. In addition, there have been accusations that large EU vessels, with the Spanish as the main transgressors, often run through the nets of the fragile boats, mainly at night, killing many Senegalese fishermen. Is that correct? The waters around Africa, in particular, swarm with European and Asian ships fishing illegally.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para92"></a>Those are just a few of the facts in that very interesting article.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para93"></a>In conclusion, I repeat our thanks to the noble Earl, Lord Kinnoull, for putting down the Question. It is clear that this whole problem of conserving fish stocks worldwide can only be resolved by international agreement about stocks, quotas and, above all, enforcement. I suspect that this is not the last time that we shall discuss this vital issue. It is a long, long way from being resolved.

<P>
<A NAME="50330-16_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Earl Howe): </B>  My Lords, this has been a very interesting, if somewhat impassioned debate, during which, despite the shortness of time available, many questions have been raised. I shall reply to as many as I can this evening; but if any remain, I shall follow them up in writing.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para94"></a>I begin by reminding the House of some history. The accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Union in 1985 was rightly welcomed by all political parties. The wider political and democratic merits of that enlargement were recognised. That was the right view then; it is still the right view now. The risks attendant on such enlargement were also clearly recognised. That is why the Government have been so concerned to ensure that the terms of any changes to the fishing arrangements under the Iberian Accession Treaty should contain genuine safeguards.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para95"></a>The main features of the accession treaty as they related to fishing were as follows. First, that Spanish access would be limited to western waters but that that should specifically exclude, until the end of 1995, the Irish Box. Secondly, there should be restrictions on the overall number of Spanish vessels (the so-called "basic" <P>


<a name="column_1777"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1777</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>list of 300 vessels) and periodic restrictions governing the number of vessels allowed to fish at any one time (the "periodic" list of 150 vessels). Thirdly, in the light of a Commission report on the operation of those arrangements, any review of the arrangements would apply from 1st January, 1996. Fourthly, that at 31st December, 1995, the Irish Box would come to an end. Additionally, Spain and Portugal of course have no rights within the UK six to 12 mile limit; nor will that be affected by the agreement reached last December.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para96"></a>Therefore, the first point that I shall make relates to the 10-year review. Since we effectively signed up for that review in 1985, we could not subsequently wish it away. It is however true that there was an option to do nothing, and simply to let the deadline of 1st January, 1996 pass. However, in that case, the Irish Box would have ceased to exist and over 200 Spaniards could have fished all round Ireland, up the Bristol Channel and in the Irish Sea from the beginning of next year. Our industry adamantly opposed such an outcome and was right to do so.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para97"></a>It was thus inevitable that there would be a negotiation within the Community and that we would have to negotiate if we wanted continued protection in the area of the Irish Box, and if we wanted to have any say in the outcome of the review. It was bound to be a difficult negotiation since apart from Spain itself only the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland were seriously affected. The negotiation was a continuous process over the past two years, during which my right honourable friend and my honourable friend in another place fought hard for British interests.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para98"></a>In the December agreement we achieved significant gains. The whole area of the Irish Box has been recognised as a sensitive zone, with access for Spain limited to 40 vessels at any one time. This, as I have said, needs to be compared with the unambiguous ending of the Box provided for in the treaty of accession, and with Spain's aspiration that more than 200 of her vessels would be allowed to fish up to our 12-mile limit.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para99"></a>We secured the complete exclusion of Spain from the Irish Sea and the Bristol Channel. It is no wonder that Spanish fishermen were angered by continued discrimination against them. There is no provision for the Spanish to fish in the North Sea. There will be a key role for Britain and Ireland in enforcing the rules in western waters. There is provision for no increase in effort as a result of the new arrangements.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para100"></a>We shall have a system that allows Britain to choose its own methods for managing fishing effort and which, so long as fishing effort does not increase, should impose no new constraints on where and when our fishermen can conduct their business. We shall have a system with minimum bureaucracy, which effectively applies only to vessels above 18 metres. All British boats over that limit will be listed as entitled to fish in western waters.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para101"></a>There will be no change to relative stability, and our right to fish our full entitlements of quota, as well as non-quota species, is explicitly protected in the agreement. We have not given up a single fish to Spain. <P>


<a name="column_1778"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1778</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>And there is provision for proposals to come forward to improve technical conservation measures in western waters, especially with regard to the selectivity of fishing gear.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para102"></a>Those who have taken the trouble to look at the issue carefully&#151;and I have to say that that does not include all noble Lords present this evening&#151;recognise that that was a considerable negotiating achievement.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para103"></a>Of course fishermen were disappointed. Their objectives were maximalist. They wanted continued exclusion of Spaniards from the Irish Box, tight controls on them everywhere else in western waters and no change in the provisions applying to British fishermen. We understood that. Any industry would have started from the same place. It is a fair starting point, but it was always going to be an unachievable end result.
<P>

<a name="50330-16_para104"></a>Given that, it is understandable that some reactions to the agreement have been emotional ones.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Morris: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend for giving way. His words sound so comforting, but why is it then that Spain still has the fourth largest fishing fleet in the world behind Japan, the USSR and the United States of America? I take those figures from the Lloyd's Register of December 1993.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-17_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, to answer that question would take a great deal more time than I have at my disposal. I shall be glad to write to my noble friend with a brief expos&#233; of the position.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para0"></a>It is important that all those involved move forward in as constructive an atmosphere as possible. That is what we have sought to do since the beginning of the year. We have been working closely with the industry over implementation and will continue to do so as the remaining details are put into place.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para1"></a>I should like now to turn briefly to the question of decommissioning. It is wholly wrong to suggest, as some have done, that the additional funds announced in January are to help make room for the Spanish. As I have already said, the Western Waters Agreement does not involve us giving up a single fish to Spain. The reason we need to remove capacity from our fleet is because of the general pressure on stocks and the need to meet targets which have been set for all member states under the so called multi-annual guidance programme.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para2"></a>The industry is also concerned about enforcement, a subject which has reared its head on several occasions this evening. The Government entirely agree that effective enforcement is a key issue in making the future arrangements work. Under the arrangement, there will be a requirement for vessels to hail in and out, both to flag state and to coastal state. This will mean that we have far better knowledge of where Spaniards are than we do now and we should be able to target our enforcement activities better and therefore more cost effectively. We already have good co-operation with other enforcement services, particularly with the Irish, and we have already started discussions with the Irish on the most effective ways to take advantage of the key enforcement role we both have as coastal states.
<P>


<a name="column_1779"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1779</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para3"></a>Just as important, the agreement reached in December provides that the Commission will make a report every year on enforcement activity by member states and by its own inspectorate. This report will be published. In this way illegal activities by any member state will be shown up in a way which they are not now. My right honourable friend has already given a clear assurance that we will do what is necessary to ensure that we have the men and equipment in place to enforce the new rules effectively.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, asked what steps the Government will take to ensure that we know how many Spanish-owned vessels are fishing under the UK flag. I am grateful to him for giving me prior notice of that question. From our monitoring of landings abroad by British registered fishing vessels, we estimate that around 100 UK vessels have a significant Spanish interest. Up-to-date information on ownership in terms of shareholdings is no longer available because with the introduction of the Merchant Shipping (Registration of Shipping) Regulations 1993, the Registrar General of Shipping and Seamen no longer collects details of shareholdings in UK companies owning British registered vessels.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para5"></a>My noble friend Lord Kinnoull asked whether we could delay Spanish entry into the Irish Box until the conservation measures are agreed. The Commission is required to bring forward proposals for enhanced conservation measures by June; and the Council is to reach decisions on them before the end of the year before new rules on the Irish Box apply from 1st January 1996.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para6"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Stoddart, and Lord Carter, asked why the UK abstained in December. As I have already explained, there was a legal commitment to integrate Spain and Portugal into the CFP. We fought hard for two years and secured major concessions to limit the extent of that integration. Beyond expectation, we secured continued measures to limit Spanish fishing in western waters and exclusion from the North Sea. As I indicated, the measure of our success is Spanish fishermen's fury at the deal.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para7"></a>However, what we need is an effective voice in 1995 while the implementing regulations are being discussed and finalised. A vote against the deal in 1994 would have been a silly tactic, satisfying perhaps emotionally in the short term, but disadvantageous in the long term if our aim is, as it is, to maximise the UK take. It is a practical matter. We abstained because we had not achieved 100 per cent. of the very ambitious negotiating objectives that we set ourselves.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para8"></a>My noble friends Lord Kinnoull and Lord Clanwilliam raised the subject of satellite monitoring. The UK fisheries departments are currently in the early stages of trials to test and evaluate the use of electronic systems for the continuous position monitoring of fishing vessel movements. Parallel trials are being undertaken by other member states. Those trials are due to be completed by 30th June of this year and will then be assessed by the Fisheries Council. If successful those systems undoubtedly have the potential to be an effective tool in the Community's enforcement effort.
<P>


<a name="column_1780"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1780</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, asked about the detailed implementation of the Irish Box agreement. As the noble Lord said, it is the responsibility of member states to draw up plans for implementation and control of effort. However, those plans have to be submitted to the Commission by 31st March. It will then make proposals to the Council for a decision in June. The measures will therefore be the subject of Council regulations, but the details remain to be settled.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para10"></a>The noble Lord also asked what proportion of the Irish Box was in Irish waters and what proportion in British waters. The larger part of the Irish Box falls in Irish waters. The Irish and British Governments are co-operating closely to ensure that they will be able effectively to enforce the limit on 40 Spanish vessels in the Irish Box.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para11"></a>My noble friend Lord Mountgarret posed, I hope, a hypothetical question as to what would happen if fishermen&#151;perhaps British fishermen&#151;attacked Spaniards in western waters after 1st January next year. During 1995 all the member states will be working with the Commission to set fair and clear rules for western waters from January of next year. There should therefore be no misunderstanding of the rules by any EU fishermen. It is for each member state to police the fisheries policy in its own waters against all the member states. I do not want to go down the road to which my noble friend points. I simply say that the Royal Navy fisheries protection squadron is tasked both to protect fishermen fishing lawfully and to enforce the rules even handedly&#151;and that is what it will do.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para12"></a>Let me turn to conservation. In the Irish Sea, we are particularly concerned about the state of the cod stocks. The annual setting of total allowable catches is of course informed by the advice from scientists on the state of the stocks. But more is needed than simply cutting permitted catch levels. Improvements in fishing technology rapidly catch up with attempts to control effort.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para13"></a>So the provision in the new rules for the Commission to bring forward, later on this year, proposals to improve technical conservation, is very welcome. As a first step, the Commission has already arranged a meeting of scientists to consider, in the light of the state of fish stocks in western waters, what measures might be appropriate. Clearly, we and the industry will be taking a close interest in these discussions and urging the Commission to take action where this seems appropriate in order to conserve fish stocks.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para14"></a>My noble friend Lady Elles referred to predation of fish by seals. The noble Baroness may be interested to know that a recent UK population estimate for grey seals is 102,700 with a year-on-year increase of about 10 per cent. The number of common seals is also rising. It is now estimated to be in the region of 26,000. MAFF is funding a research project with the sea mammal research unit to examine the impact of seal populations on commercial fisheries in the North Sea through a study of seal diet, numbers and foraging behaviour.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para15"></a>I turn briefly&#151;time is against me&#151;to the dispute between the European Union and Canada in the Greenland halibut fishery off Newfoundland. In substance, I can add little to the answers that I gave last <P>


<a name="column_1781"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column 1781</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>week in reply to my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke. However, I wish to say this, in particular to my noble friend Lord Morris. We have said that we have sympathy with Canada in its concern for conservation. We also have sympathy with Spain in its concern for NAFO rules and international law. The important factor is that something good should come out of this dispute. It is encouraging that Canada and the EU are now negotiating for better enforcement which everyone agrees is critical for effective conservation.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para16"></a>My noble friend Lord Morris said that Her Majesty's Government should apologise to Canada. The Canadian Government have made no criticism of the British Government. On the contrary, the Canadian Government have several times expressed their appreciation of the role Her Majesty's Government have played in seeking to keep the temperature down, to promote negotiation and to obtain a settlement to the dispute. That is what we continue to do.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para17"></a>The UK occupies a unique position in the affair. That has real advantages because it means that, as friends of Canada, we can interpret its position in the best possible light and seek to ensure that Spain's point of view is also fully understood. I believe that that is constructive and also, ultimately, in our own interests if it leads to better enforcement in fisheries closer to home.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para18"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, and my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke referred to the record of Spanish fishermen in terms of cheating. If one looks at enforcement within the CFP rather than NAFO, it is true that some Spanish vessels have been found guilty of cheating. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the Spanish commit a higher proportion of serious offences than other member states. In 1993 there were more inspections of Spanish vessels by the various enforcement bodies than of vessels from any other member state. Despite that, only a relatively small number of offences discovered were considered serious enough to take to court.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para19"></a>My noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke raised the question of sanctions. I do not believe that it is helpful to speak of economic sanctions. That kind of talk can only escalate the dispute with Canada. Sanctions would be an unconstructive way of proceeding and, in the view of the Government, totally disproportionate to the issues under discussion.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para20"></a>My noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke also asked what the Government would do to ensure that the Spanish ships allowed into our waters do not catch more than their allotted quota and that they use the correct nets. The Government have already committed &#163;26 million to ensure effective enforcement within British fishery limits. That includes &#163;19 million on enforcement at sea.
<P>

<a name="50330-17_para21"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, referred to the UK's action in Brussels in relation to the European Union's response to Canada. The initial note verbale, as it is called, was couched in general terms and reserved the Union's right to take any retaliatory action. When detailed proposals were discussed, we made it absolutely clear that we were completely opposed to economic sanctions or any other disproportionate action.

<a name="50330-17_para22"></a>My noble friend Lord Clanwilliam asked what locus the European Union Commission has in addressing itself to Canada. The European Union and Canada are both contracting parties of the regional fisheries organisation in whose waters the dispute occurred. They need to resolve the dispute through diplomacy. The EU's common fisheries policy involves all fisheries in which EU fishermen engage, both within and outside EU waters. So the Commission has a duty to represent the member states' interests in discussions and negotiations with other countries on fisheries matters.

<A NAME="50330-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Earl for allowing me to intervene. I appreciate what he says about the initial reaction to the taking into custody of the Spanish ship. However, was Britain associated with the intemperate remarks made by Mrs. Bonino? It seems that we were. And, if so, were those remarks supported by British Ministers? That is what we want to know.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330-18_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, my right honourable friend in another place has already indicated that he regards it as unfortunate that intemperate words were used. That is on the record.
<P>

<a name="50330-18_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, referred to enforcement and ways in which monitoring and control might be improved. Possible improvements to monitoring and control of fishing activity and the setting of quotas and fishing methods in international waters are governed by various regional fisheries management bodies throughout the world. In addition, those are among the important issues before the United Nations conference on straddling stocks and highly migratory species which meets for its third session in New York this week and up to 14th April.
<P>

<a name="50330-18_para1"></a>In international waters generally under the CFP, boarding, inspection and arrest of a fishing vessel can only be carried out by an inspection vessel from the member state concerned. In the NAFO regulatory area, boarding and inspection may be undertaken by inspection vessels from any NAFO contracting party, provided that the vessel acts under the scheme of joint international inspection and surveillance. But arrests and prosecution can only be carried out by the flag state. Within exclusive fishery limits, enforcement is for the coastal state. That is an area where we believe Canada has raised some valid concerns. There is much talking to do about how enforcement can be strengthened over future years.
<P>

<a name="50330-18_para2"></a>I hope that what I have said tonight will have served to illuminate the key issues raised by my noble friend's Question and also to dispel some misunderstandings. The negotiations in which the Government have been engaged with regard to the Irish Box have been both extremely difficult and unavoidable. We would have liked to secure more, but the outcome we achieved was considerably better than many had feared. What it gives us is a satisfactory basis for agreeing the detailed implementation rules which need to be put in place by next year. That is the process on which we are now engaged.

<A NAME="50330w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Chalker of Wallasey): </B>  UNOMIG reports incidents of this nature to the UN Secretariat in New York. We would not expect to see such internal UN reports. Periodically, the UN Secretariat then brief the Security Council. The most recent briefing took place on 24 March and mentioned UNOMIG reports concerning violent action in the Gali region. The Secretariat undertook to keep the situation under review and to keep the Security Council informed. The UN Secretary-General reports formally to the Security Council on UNOMIG's activities on a regular basis. He submitted a written report on 6 January and a further interim report on 6 March. Both reports give an account of violent incidents either side of the Inguri River. Copies are being placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

The Council also discussed the agri-monetary effects of the recent <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>turbulence on international currency markets, as a result of which certain green currencies may need to be revalued according to the Community rules. A further Council will be held on 10 April to take decisions on this aspect, but the Commission indicated they would use their powers to ensure that revaluations did not come into effect before 5 May.

<a name="50330w01_para0"></a>The 10 April Council meeting is also expected to take decisions on the reform of the Community sugar regime. At this meeting we again argued that any cuts in sugar quotas necessary for the Community to meet its GATT commitments should be targeted on those countries with the largest surpluses.The Council extended the marketing years for milk and beef since farm prices for 1995&#150;96 have not yet been set.In other discussions the United Kingdom strongly opposed any proposal to place limits on nitrates in lettuce which cannot be fully justified by the scientific evidence.

<P>
<UL>Whether the United Kingdom is the only country in the European Union that imposes restrictions on the free movement of dogs between member states.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330w01_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   No. The Republic of Ireland imposes very similar restrictions to our own. In Sweden pet dogs and cats can only enter under licence. To obtain such a licence dogs must have been vaccinated against rabies and a blood sample taken 120 days later must have shown a protective level of rabies antibodies. They must also be vaccinated against leptospira, and distemper and both dogs and cats must have been treated for echinococcus. In addition both dogs and cats need to be individually identified by implanted microchip or tattoo and certified within ten days of importation as clinically free from disease. European Council Directive 92/65 sets out the requirements for movements of commercially traded dogs and cats between EU Member States, including specific conditions for movement into UK or the Republic of Ireland.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50330w02_sbhd0"></a><H4><center>Draft Reserve Forces Bill</center></H4>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330w02_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Marlesford </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>When they plan to publish the draft Reserve Forces legislation.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Henley): </B>  We are today publishing the draft Reserve Forces Bill, with accompanying notes. Copies will be available from the Printed Paper Office. Outside the House, the document is also being distributed widely to reserve units, employers and others, and is available on request from the Ministry of Defence.
<P>

<a name="50330w02_para0"></a>The Bill is an important one. It brings the legislation on reserves up to date, to take account of changes in <P>


<a name="column_WA99"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column WA99</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>both the security environment and British society since the last substantial revision in 1966. The Bill principally provides:
(a) A new power of call-out for peacekeeping, humanitarian and disaster relief operations;
(b) Two new categories of reserve:
 &#151;the high readiness reserve: individuals with skills in short supply who, voluntarily and with the consent of their employer, accept a greater call out liability; and
 &#151;the sponsored reserve, which will permit us to let more support activities to contract knowing that the reserve element allows the task to be continued in an operational environment by uniformed personnel.
(c) A new opportunity to enable reservists to undertake tasks other than training in peacetime;
(d) Three new safeguards:
 &#151;for individuals, powers for my department to make payments to reservists in cases where their military pay when called-out is less than their civilian pay;
 &#151;for employers, powers for my department to make payments whenever a reservist who is also an employee is called-out;
 &#151;for both, new, formal rights to seek exemption from and deferral of call-out or recall, exercisable by employers or reservists themselves.
<P>

<a name="50330w02_para1"></a>All this is set within a comprehensive tri-service legal framework for the reserves, which will greatly simplify their use in the future.
<P>

<a name="50330w02_para2"></a>Particular attention has been given to the tripartite relationship between the Ministry of Defence, the reservist, and his or her employer. Full account has been taken of the comments received following the publication of a consultation document in October 1993, and I believe the Bill will meet with widespread acceptance from those affected by it.
<P>

<a name="50330w02_para3"></a>The Bill's publication in draft forms part of the Government's commitment to improving the quality of legislation brought before Parliament, and we look forward to receiving many constructive comments. The Consultation period lasts until 15 June.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330w02_wqn1"></A><B> Baroness Sharples </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they have decided on the location of the proposed Joint Service Command and Staff College, and what impact this will have on the sites of the existing single service staff colleges.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50330w02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   During the Front Line First consultation process on the establishment of a Joint Service Command and Staff College, my department received responses from a number of individuals and organisations to our proposals.
<P>


<a name="column_WA100"></a>

<B>30 Mar 1995 : Column WA100</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50330w02_para4"></a>All these responses have received the most careful and sympathetic scrutiny, and we have thoroughly reviewed the costings associated with our proposals. While there was general support for the proposal to establish a Joint Service Command and Staff College, there have been understandable local concerns, especially in Greenwich. No significant arguments have emerged, however, nor have any new suggestions been made which have caused us to alter our original proposals. The costings continue to demonstrate that Camberley is the most cost effective option.
<P>

<a name="50330w02_para5"></a>I can therefore confirm that we shall establish the Joint Service Command and Staff College at Camberley, and that we plan to open it and close the colleges at Bracknell and Greenwich in late 1997. We shall now develop our plans along the lines indicated in the consultative document. The Bracknell site will be considered for disposal.
<P>

<a name="50330w02_para6"></a>With regard to the future of Greenwich, I reaffirm the Government's commitment to finding suitable occupants for this most important historic site.
<P>

<a name="50330w02_para7"></a>Our work on this continues. In terms of defence candidates, we have concluded that a restructured Defence School of Languages would be one such suitable occupant. This would generate at least the same level of occupancy as the two staff colleges currently at Greenwich. The nature of this establishment is such that, unlike the Joint Services Command and Staff College, it would be able to move in with only very minor changes to the fabric of the buildings and at a capital cost of only some &#163;6 million.
<P>

<a name="50330w02_para8"></a>We have also concluded that we should not continue to pursue the Tri-Service Chaplaincy School as an option for Greenwich. Work on an appropriate location for this school will continue, and we hope shortly to make an announcement.
<P>

<a name="50330w02_para9"></a>In addition to potential defence candidates, interest in the Royal Naval College has been shown by organisations outside the Ministry of Defence, including the University of Greenwich and the National Maritime Museum. We do not intend to reach any firm conclusions on the future of the Royal Naval College Greenwich at this stage, but will shortly be seeking expressions of interest in the site from organisations able to propose uses sympathetic to the character of the buildings.
<P>

<a name="50330w02_para10"></a>In considering the options, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence will have very much in mind his role as sole trustee of Greenwich Hospital, and also the imaginative proposals for Greenwich Park, including the Royal Naval College, by Dame Jennifer Jenkins in her report to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for National Heritage. We hope to be in a position to announce firm proposals to the House for the future of the Royal Naval College by the end of the year.
