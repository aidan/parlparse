<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Rendell of Babergh </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What proportion of the population of the United Kingdom is illiterate.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills   (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </B>  My Lords, last October, the department published the Skills for Life survey, which includes a survey of literacy skills. It shows that 5.2 million adults in England&#151;16 per cent&#151;have literacy skills below level 1; that is, lower than grade D to G at GCSE. The Government's Skills for Life strategy has already helped around 500,000 people to improve their literacy, numeracy or language skills and is working to improve the skills of 1.5 million adults by 2007.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Rendell of Babergh: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for her reply. Is she aware that, in one area of the United Kingdom, jobseeker's allowance may be withheld from unemployed people who refuse to take courses in literacy and numeracy and that, in another, those who take such courses are to be offered a monetary reward? Does my noble friend agree that it is essential that 14 year-olds taking two days off from school each week to take up apprenticeships should first be literate and numerate?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I agree with my noble friend that it is important for all our <P>


<a name="column_2"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 2</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>14 year-olds to be literate and numerate. It is also important that we continue with a strategy to allow people to gain those skills at any point in life.
<P>

<a name="40223-01_para0"></a>My noble friend is also right to say that the Department for Work and Pensions has a scheme that allows for individuals to be given an extra £10, in addition to their training allowance, to take up basic skills training and a £100 incentive payment, if they gain qualifications. There are also 12 pilot schemes examining the impact that the threat of benefit sanctions could have in ensuring that people take up the opportunity to get basic skills.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, what proportion of the unfortunately large total of illiterate people are immigrants or the offspring of immigrants?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I cannot give the noble Lord that specific figure. However, in considering the issue of those who are most in need of basic literacy and numeracy skills, we have targeted particular groups of people. Among those are people who do not have English as a first language and those who have other issues relating to their ability to speak English.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that one of the key issues is that children leaving primary school should have a sufficiently high level of literacy and numeracy to cope with the secondary curriculum? What percentage of children have that standard at that stage of their education? Given the failure to improve literacy standards at key stage 2 over the past two years, how confident is the Minister that further improvement will be achieved?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the latest figures are that 73 per cent of 11 year-olds achieved what we call level 4 at key stage 2 in mathematics and 75 per cent in English. That answers the noble Baroness's point about those able to access the secondary curriculum.
<P>


<a name="column_3"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 3</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-01_para1"></a>It is important that we do all that we can to continue to increase those figures. In part, it is about addressing the needs of children who have some form of special educational need and working closely with them. There is a large group of children at level 3, just below level 4. If we focus on them and do additional work with them&#151;there is a great deal in the primary strategy on that&#151;I am sure that we can help to ensure that they get an enriched secondary curriculum by being able to get access to it through literacy and numeracy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, has the Minister any figures for the percentage of looked-after children who are illiterate, given that only 1 per cent, I believe, leave care with any qualifications? Might not that be a sensible area for urgent attention?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness rightly says, the educational achievement of looked-after children is an area that there is a great need to improve. In Every Child Matters, we specifically identified the need to ensure that our looked-after children had a good education and good opportunities. The noble Baroness is right: it should be a focal point of our work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Acton: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that there are 30,000 illiterate prisoners in England and Wales? The Shannon Trust has a successful scheme in which literate prisoners sponsor illiterate prisoners and teach them to read. Will the Government adopt that most imaginative idea and put it into practice throughout the prison system?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I wholeheartedly agree with my noble friend: it is an important issue. About 50 per cent of offenders have low reading skills; 65 per cent have poor numeracy skills; and 80 per cent have poor writing skills. The Shannon Trust is a good example of peer mentoring, enabling those in prison who have a good education to pass on their skills to those who would benefit from literacy and numeracy. Such peer work is important, and I support it wholeheartedly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Perry of Southwark: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it is important that schools go beyond the technical skills of reading, which have been rather over-emphasised in the literacy hour in primary schools? Schools should work to instil an enjoyment of reading that will ensure that children go on reading throughout their schooling and continue to do so in their adult life.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I agree wholeheartedly. It is very important to instil the love of learning and the love of reading in every child. However, without the technical skills, it is not possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, I am aware that the subject of education is devolved, but is there any reason why the Minister cannot answer the Question <P>


<a name="column_4"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 4</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and tell us what the percentage of illiteracy is in Scotland? I do not think the Scottish Parliament would mind, particularly if the figure were better.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I asked the question myself and the answer is that as it is a devolved matter, it is inappropriate for me to answer it. I am very happy, of course, to ask colleagues if they will provide the figures for the noble Lord, and put a copy in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew14"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Blaker: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew16"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   I am sorry, my Lords, but I think it is the turn of this side.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew17"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Cross Bench!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew18"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say what role increasing mainstream school inclusion has on improving literacy rates, particularly literacy rates for children in public care, to which my noble friend referred earlier? Is the Minister aware that 67 per cent of children from Shaftesbury Homes and Arethusa received five GCSEs last year and that in 2001 only 7 per cent of children in residential care gained five GCSEs? That is an outstanding performance by Shaftesbury Homes and Arethusa. However, it had to start legal proceedings in seven cases against schools in order to achieve that very welcome outcome.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I pay tribute to Shaftesbury Homes, although I do not know about the individual cases. It is very important to ensure that looked-after children have continuity of education, high-quality corporate parenting and real opportunity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Massey of Darwen: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Blaker: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spmin1"></A><B> The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos):</B>  My Lords, can we take a very quick question from the noble Lord, Lord Blaker?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Blaker: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Baroness say how many people in this country are innumerate and whether they include the staff of the Department of Health? That department appears to have briefed a government spokesman last week to the effect that there are 900,000 obese people in this country receiving benefits and that the benefits amount to £70 million a week, whereas a subsequent statement said that the true figure is 900 people and that the benefits amount to £70,000 a week.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-01_spnew23"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the number of adults who have numeracy skills below level 1&#151;below the level I described in my Answer&#151;is 15 million.

<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. In doing so, I declare an interest in the small-scale generation of electricity.
<P>

<a name="40223-02_para0"></a>The Question was as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="40223-02_para1"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government what are the prospects of achieving 10  gigawatts of combined heat and power by 2010.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="40223-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  My Lords, before I answer this Question, I am reliably informed that today is the birthday of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. I am sure he will ask this Question on subsequent birthdays up to 2010.
<P>

<a name="40223-02_para2"></a>Although this is a challenging target, 10 gigawatts remains achievable, and we will set out our full range of measures in the Government's strategy for CHP to 2010, which we intend to publish after the Easter Recess.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his kind remarks about my birthday. I shall certainly continue to ask Questions about CHP until the year 2010 and well beyond.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew2"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Hear, hear!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, coming back to the present, is it not regrettable that in spite of the obvious benefits of combined heat and power in greater efficiency and reduced emissions compared with normal generation, the target set for the year 2000 of 5,000 megawatts, or 5 gigawatts, has still not yet been achieved? Is it not a fact that three or four reports prepared by well known economic establishments have estimated that there will be a shortfall by 2010 of some 2 to 3 gigawatts? In those circumstances, should the noble Lord not indicate to us in advance of what the Government may or may not say in due course what measures they intend to take to put this matter right, bearing in mind that at the recent discussions on the subject at the Committee stage of the Energy Bill, a number of proposals put forward by these Benches and the Conservative Benches were all turned down by the noble Lord? Is it not time that the Government came forward with their own proposals?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I accept that the achievement on CHP has not been as rapid as originally hoped, although the latest estimates for 2010 indicate a central achievement of 8.1 gigawatts. Further measures, including those which were announced in the White Paper, in particular the emissions trading scheme, will raise that level further and make it closer to the 10 gigawatts target. It is still a difficult target and the Government may need to introduce further measures, some of which may well be referred to in the statement after Easter that I mentioned.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, how many national health hospitals have introduced CHP? When asking the Minister a question on this subject on a previous occasion, I mentioned that some have. Has there been an increase in the number of hospitals introducing CHP, given the great financial saving that will result for the National Health Service as well as the provision of extra power?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I regret that I cannot answer that question in numerical terms. I am aware that at least two hospital complexes in the past few years have introduced CHP. There is general encouragement of the National Health Service, as in other parts of government, to look positively at CHP installations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Woolmer of Leeds: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as the chair of the energy forum of the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Development Agency. Will my noble friend confirm that a major combined heat and power scheme is due to come onstream on Humberside next year? Further to the previous question, what is the Government's view on micro combined heat and power schemes, not only in hospitals but in commercial, industrial and, indeed, domestic, use?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, micro CHP is an exciting new technology that the Government wish to encourage. Field trials and tests are being carried out and we believe that micro CHP could, towards the end of the decade, make a significant contribution to the achievement of the target. On the major CHP installation coming on stream in the course of the coming year, the Conoco complex at Immingham will greatly raise these figures, which will therefore look better this time next year. However, there is still a challenging target to be met.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Tanlaw: </B>   My Lords, what is the present output of CHP to the grid? In Energy 68, it is estimated that, in 2010, 20 gigawatts will be required and 6.5 gigawatts will be required for wind energy. Only 0.6 gigawatts of wind energy is available now, so it must be increased by the power of 10. What is the ratio for CHP? Is the Minister sure us that planning permission will be granted, even for the schemes that are the basis of Energy 68 programmes?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the wind energy ratio of current generation compared with where we expect it to be in 2010 is somewhat higher than that for CHP&#151;roughly a trebling of CHP generation by 2010. The noble Lord referred to planning permission. Although there have been some minor hiccups on CHP, planning permission for CHP installations has not generally been a problem. However, it is a live issue in some parts of the country in relation to wind farms.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may press the Minister on the Government's targets for their own estate. He will remember that, during the passage of <P>


<a name="column_7"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 7</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Sustainable Energy Bill, the Government set targets for their own estate&#151;the only target in the Bill. Why, since that time, has all the National Health Service estate been taken out of the government estate for the purposes of that Bill? How big is that proportion of the total that the Government promised in the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the references in the energy White Paper and in the discussions on the Sustainable Energy Bill were to the central government estate. As the noble Baroness will know, the National Health Service is, by and large, an NHS trust rather than part of the central government estate. In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, I indicated that the NHS itself wishes to encourage the use of CHP, but that does not alter the commitment that we made in relation to the central government estate during deliberations on the Sustainable Energy Bill. The target has been announced and will no doubt be mentioned in the statement to which I referred in answer to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Platt of Writtle: </B>   My Lords, what arrangements are the Government making to allow for the CHP installations, which are small and will probably connect to the distribution system rather than the transmission system, sometimes to put power in and sometimes to take power out? That has not been the case in the distribution system in the past.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I agree that it is important that CHP installations, which are primarily for local use, also have additional power to feed into the grid either through transmission or distribution. It is true that, at one point, the regulations were hostile and charges were a disincentive to CHP. The subsequent modifications that Ofgem has made in the regulations make them more neutral and therefore more favourable to CHP than was the case a couple of years ago. We need to see the full effect of those changes in encouraging such use of CHP.

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 8</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>accordance with convention, I do not feel that it would be proper to respond to the Question put by the noble Lord. Of course, I will be happy to answer any questions raised by your Lordships when I repeat the Statement for the benefit of this House later this afternoon.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I appreciate that&#151;by coincidence, I am sure&#151;there is a sudden Statement from the Government on this issue this afternoon. However, will the Minister explain before we hear the Statement why there has been this abrupt change of policy? Is it because all the other EU member states except Ireland have now introduced sensible transitional restrictions to manage this issue in a careful and sensitive way, as they are allowed to do under the EU accession treaty? Perhaps the Government somehow forgot to join in this initiative and have got left behind. Is that the problem?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   No, my Lords.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that, when Portugal, France and Greece joined the European Community, there was no mass movement of people from those countries to the United Kingdom? Will she also confirm that migrants take less out of social security and contribute more&#151;to the tune of about £2.4 billion&#151;to the British economy? Therefore, there is no need for a knee-jerk reaction of introducing legislation to prohibit the entry of people.

<A NAME="40223-03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to confirm those two statements. I will amplify any further answer when I have the pleasure of delighting your Lordships in about half an hour's time on this self-same issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lamont of Lerwick: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recall that, when I raised this issue a year ago, she said that there was no problem? Will she also confirm that, on behalf of the Home Office, an agency has been placing advertisements in Slovak newspapers telling people that benefits here are not so wonderful and that life is not paved with gold?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, that is all true.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister also recall that, in 1990, scare stories appeared in the British press and other newspapers predicting that somewhere between 5 million and 25 million people would flood from eastern Europe into western Europe? That did not happen either. We are conscious that some aspects of the British press have been running scare stories about this issue. Can we be assured that her Majesty's Government will stand up to inaccuracies reported in the tabloid press with the same vigour with which they stand up to the BBC?

<A NAME="40223-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Tebbit: </B>   My Lords, since the Government say that they do not know how many migrants there are in this country&#151;which appears to be the case&#151;how can the Minister be so sure about the economic contribution that they make and the economic costs that are incurred?

<A NAME="40223-03_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the Government have been saying in the press that they intend to rely on the habitual residence test. Does the Minister appreciate that a key principle of European law is that one cannot discriminate between the nationals of one European country and another? Between now and half-past three, will she investigate how the Government can use the habitual residence test in this inherently discriminatory way? In particular, will she consult the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, on the implications of the Swaddling case in the European Court of Justice and tell us at half-past three what she will do about it?

The Prime Minister has made clear, in a joint letter sent to Commission President, Mr Prodi, on 15 December 2003, along with the heads of government of Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, that average expenditure during the next financial perspective should be stabilised at around current expenditure levels and should not exceed 1 per cent of EU gross national income.

<A NAME="40223-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that response, which was encouraging. I have one specific question for him. Will he confirm that the Government will not allow the UK's rebate, which was so heroically negotiated by my noble friend Lady Thatcher some 20 years ago, to be reduced or limited, in the next EU budget round?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I can confirm that position. As the noble Baroness knows, the UK gets the rebate because of its disproportionately low share in the receipts&#151;about half the EU average&#151;and above average contributions. We intend to defend that position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Tomlinson: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that, if the common agricultural policy was reformed&#151;which so many of us have asked for, including noble Lords opposite&#151;the rebate itself would disappear? It is as a consequence of that that we have a rebate.
<P>

<a name="40223-03_para0"></a>In relation to the Question, does my noble friend also agree that in the Convention on the Future of Europe, the working group on future financing of the European Union specifically rejected the proposal to increase the budget, having noted that the present budget is substantially below the present budget ceiling?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for both his helpful contributions. He is of course right that a principle area for reform is certainly the common agricultural policy, and he is also right in saying that it helps to create the situation in which we disproportionately contribute more and receive less. He is also right in saying that there is widespread anxiety throughout Europe, as reflected by the letter from the heads of government, that the Commission is proposing too large an increase in its future budget.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, when can we expect for debate the Government's response to the Commission paper, which is after all the first shot in negotiations on the next budgetary package from 2007&#150;13? Does the Minister accept that some of the proposals in the Commission's paper&#151;for example, that a larger share of the budget must go on external relations and that a great deal more should be spent on innovation and less on agriculture&#151;are precisely the sort of thing that British governments should be in favour of?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is right in saying that this is very much the opening skirmish in a protracted debate. The decisions do not have to be taken until the middle of next year. He is right that there are some sensible proposals from the Commission, but what stands out is a very substantial demand for an increase in budget, which we do not support while other crucial features of the EU budget remain unreformed.

<A NAME="40223-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, the assurance has been given that the Government would not agree to an increase in the 1 per cent ceiling and that they will resist&#151;to the last, I hope&#151;any suggestion that we should lose our rebate, which amounts to £3,600 million a year. Those assurances are welcome. However, can I have the further assurance that the Government will not yield to the blandishments or coercion of other member states, as they apparently have done over the European constitution?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, true to form, the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, adds a further demand to his approval of the position that the Government have already taken up in two instances. However, he will recognise that when a letter is sent on behalf of the Prime Minister and other heads of state of significant countries in Europe, one can scarcely look on such a body of people, who represent such a substantial interest in Europe, as being subject to coercion by anyone.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the Government are never agnostic, as they always think deeply about their position, on the basis of known facts. However, it is clearly important that crucial issues with regard to constitutional change are clarified. When they are, the Government will announce their position.

<a name="40223-04_para4"></a>Clause 1 [Piloting conduct at European and local elections]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-04_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 19, leave out subsection (5) and insert&#151;
<P>

<a name="40223-04_para5"></a><P>

"(5) An order under this section may only specify&#151;
<br>
(a) the North East;
<br>
(b) the East Midlands; and
<br>
(c) any local authorities within those electoral regions which are due to hold elections on the same date."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40223-04_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I shall also speak to Amendment No. 3. Those amendments are included in a very large group of amendments that are being introduced by the Government. We have been backwards and forwards over this issue in Committee. Subsequently, I had a meeting with the Minister and I thank him for giving us the opportunity for further discussion. However, I do not think it will come as any great surprise to him that we are not convinced by the arguments that he has advocated for piloting in four regions.
<P>

<a name="40223-04_para7"></a>We believe that there are fundamental reasons why we should stand firm on this point. First, we think that it is irresponsible to hold a pilot scheme in nearly half of all the regions that will be holding combined European parliamentary and local elections in June. They form a substantial part of the electorate of England and therefore it can only tendentiously be described as a "pilot". Pilot schemes are designed to generate evidence on a system of voting that is new and that is by no means guaranteed as secure. We have conceded that there may be merit in trialling all-postal voting on a regional basis in the combined regions. It has already been trialled on a local basis in other schemes. However, we draw the line at a trial in four regions.
<P>


<a name="column_14"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 14</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-04_para8"></a>Secondly, the Government are disregarding the evidence contained in the Electoral Commission's report. Its conclusion was that only two regions&#151;the north-east and the east Midlands&#151;could be recommended as ready and able to undertake these schemes. I asked why the Government intend to ignore the advice of the Electoral Commission and have received no satisfactory answer from the Minister. Extensive research has been carried out. The Electoral Commission is impartial. It is an independent body set up by the Government to advise them and it is now deemed to be expert in electoral matters. I am sure that other noble Lords will have received a letter from the Electoral Commission from which it is interesting to note that it says that it has been involved in no further discussions with the two extra regions proposed by the Government:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Commission was unable to make a positive recommendation in respect of those regions having assessed their suitability against the criteria we applied . . .  We have not ourselves been involved in further discussions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-04_para9"></a>
Then how have the Government assessed the suitability of the two extra regions?
<P>

<a name="40223-04_para10"></a>Does the Minister, or his Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, believe that they know better than the commission? I think that the answer must be that they clearly do. In Committee, in relation to the Electoral Commission's advice, the Minister said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It has given us advice. We have not asked it to make the decision but to investigate the issues and give its analysis and reasons, and what underpinned its reasons. We have asked it to investigate, appraise and advise, not to decide".&#151;[Official Report, 26/01/04; col. GC 18.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-04_para11"></a><P>

<a name="40223-04_para12"></a>I find this baffling. We have moved from a situation where the Government asked the Electoral Commission to put forward up to three best regions for piloting. The Electoral Commission said that it could only positively recommend two regions. Now there are four regions. The two additional regions are Yorkshire and the Humber and the north-west where there were issues with the unwillingness of the returning officers and the complex nature of some of the elections. They still remain. I know that from information that I have received since Committee. The strongest possible objections remain to all-postal pilots in these regions. That view has been made extremely clear to the Government, including by a motion passed by Bradford City Council in October of last year saying that it was opposed to the idea of piloting in these combined elections.
<P>

<a name="40223-04_para13"></a>There is deep concern about fraud and security issues. In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, drew our attention to the problems experienced in previous piloting. It is against this background that the Government are proposing to bludgeon two unwilling regions, and many unwilling local authority chief executives, into running a pilot vote.
<P>

<a name="40223-04_para14"></a>The Minister made it clear that he does not believe that the lack of enthusiasm of returning officers, or the possibility of malpractice, should be impediments to piloting the all-postal scheme. The Electoral Commission clearly thought that they should. Our faith rests in the experts and we remain adamant that only the two original regions should pilot the election: the north-east and the east Midlands.
<P>


<a name="column_15"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 15</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-04_para15"></a>In response to our intention to limit the pilot to only these two regions, the Minister commented:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Otherwise we are saying that we shall never have postal voting on a wider scale than in those areas where people are interested".&#151;[Official Report, 26/1/04; col. GC 20.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-04_para16"></a>
We do not believe this to be the case. These are pilot elections, trial schemes and experimentation. It seems sensible to have them in regions that are confident about using the all-postal system and that want to give it a try. If these prove successful, as I hope that they will, next time round it is likely that there will be more enthusiasm and confidence from other returning officers and the all-postal system can be widened to include more regions. Of course, that is unless the Government are going to try to bounce all-postal elections on other elections.
<P>

<a name="40223-04_para17"></a>Despite what the Minister may feel about this, we are not trying to cause trouble. We feel that the Government are taking a big risk that is not justifiable in terms of a possible increase in turnout. We need to balance innovation against security and the safety of our democratic process.
<P>

<a name="40223-04_para18"></a>Finally, I shall say a brief word about the detail of the two amendments that we have tabled. After our welcome meeting with the Minister, we thought that it was important to signal immediately our continued opposition to any more than two regions being on the face of the Bill and to do so by tabling the old amendment that we put down to Clause 1 in Committee. This is Amendment No. 1. However, we are willing to accept the Minister's argument that, if we decide to move on Amendment No. 1, it would mean that it would fall outside the scope of the restructuring of the Bill that the Minister is trying to do, which is to enable just one order to be laid, rather than two. Therefore, we have now put forward Amendment No. 3. If, having heard what the Minister has to say, I believe it to be necessary, that will be the amendment that we shall pursue. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rennard: </B>   My Lords, I rise in support of Amendment No. 3. A number of your Lordships have expressed considerable reservations about all-postal voting&#151;or compulsory voting by post, as I prefer to call it. I shall not dwell in detail on all those reservations but they fall into three broad areas. First, there are concerns about lack of secrecy and privacy in voting, which some people believe undermine the basic principles of the Secret Ballot Act of 1872. Secondly, there are considerable concerns about potential fraud with all-postal voting, particularly in relation to homes in multi-occupation where people are not at all sure who will receive the ballot papers that are put through the letter box and who will return them.
<P>

<a name="40223-04_para19"></a>There are also concerns about the timing of all-postal voting mechanisms. We now understand that in these all-postal voting pilots in June, the ballot papers will be delivered between 25 and 29 May, some two weeks before the official polling day and two weeks before many people have made up their minds, <P>


<a name="column_16"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 16</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>considered the arguments put by the parties, seen the television news, and so on. I am concerned about people voting so far ahead of proper examination of the issues.
<P>

<a name="40223-04_para20"></a>Notwithstanding all those reservations about some of the problems associated with postal voting, it seems to me right to consider that there should be an element of pilot experiments to see whether the concerns are valid. So perhaps the idea of having the two pilots in the north-east region and the east Midlands should be supported. However, I believe that no case whatever has been made for having more than two experiments. If there is a case for experimentation, why should it occur in more than two regions?
<P>

<a name="40223-04_para21"></a>The Government have given us no explanation for their fundamental change of heart on the issue. Only a few months ago, their view was that there should be no all-postal pilot experiments and that the only experiment this June should be the combining of the local and the European elections. The Government's position then changed from no all-postal pilots to three all-postal pilots. They had to ask the independent Electoral Commission, given its expertise and various criteria, to recommend three regions for such experimentation. The Electoral Commission said that it could positively support only a proposal for two regions and that only that would be suitable. We therefore assumed that only two pilots would go forward. Now, however, the Government seem to be opting for four pilots. I believe that operating four pilots&#151;effectively four of the eight regions in England, and almost half the local authorities that will vote in June&#151;amounts to rolling out all-postal voting rather than "experimenting" with it. It is a fundamental change to voting mechanisms.
<P>

<a name="40223-04_para22"></a>Of course, there is time for progress in deciding how voting mechanisms should be changed. However, if changes are to be made, they should not be made unilaterally by one party which imposes change on all the other parties without the support of the independent Electoral Commission&#151;which itself was established to avoid accusations that parties were changing voting systems for purely partisan advantage.
<P>

<a name="40223-04_para23"></a>The idea of four pilot regions plainly does not have the support of the Electoral Commission. I believe that the problems are such that it would be wrong to subject half of England and nearly half of local authorities to all-postal voting methods. A few hundred votes may not seem terribly important in European elections in which millions of votes are cast. However, a few hundred votes may make a great difference in many local authorities and in many wards. The problems associated with all-postal voting often occur in inner-city areas and houses in multiple occupation. I believe that a too widespread use of all-postal voting could cause a false result and make the difference in many areas.
<P>

<a name="40223-04_para24"></a>There is a strong feeling that this is not just about legitimate experimentation; two pilots would have been sufficient to accomplish that. There is a strong suspicion that such widespread all-postal voting has been proposed to ensure that the overall national result is more palatable to the Government. The <P>

They seem to be interfering in the mechanism as they should not be doing, in a way which the Electoral Commission was set up to avoid.

<A NAME="40223-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendments in the names of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and the noble Lord, Lord Rennard. In their speeches at earlier stages of the Bill, they trenchantly set out&#151;as they have done again today&#151;the arguments why we should be cautious in proceeding to "roll out"&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, described it&#151;these arrangements in many parts of the country.
<P>

<a name="40223-05_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rennard, was given his first political appointment in 1983 when he acted as my agent in the general election of that year. Since then I have watched with considerable pleasure as he has honed his formidable skills and won just acclaim as one of the country's most knowledgeable commentators on electoral practice. I think that the House would do well to listen to the caution he urged in his remarks today. Those remarks are based on real practical experience of how elections are run.
<P>

<a name="40223-05_para1"></a>Over the 25 years that I represented people in Liverpool both as a city councillor and as a Member of Parliament&#151;and it is a city that the Minister knows very well&#151;the election statistic that always interested me most after the size of the majority was the election turnout. In often keenly fought contests, the turnout in that constituency was always the highest in Liverpool and among the highest on Merseyside. Over the past decade, however, it has depressed and disturbed me to see declining turnouts and large-scale absenteeism at the polls. In one ward by-election in Liverpool, turnout was a paltry 6 per cent. When 94 per cent of the electorate decide to absent themselves from voting, grave doubt is cast on the legitimacy of the election and on our institutions as well. Where here is an electoral mandate? Where here is a commitment to civil society?
<P>

<a name="40223-05_para2"></a>Nor was that an aberration. City-wide turnout in local elections in recent years has rarely seen more than one in five voting, and in the most recent general election the Liverpool Riverside constituency achieved one of the lowest turnouts in the UK, with a turnout of just 34.8 per cent. Voter alienation manifests itself in other ways as well&#151;through, for instance, support for groups such as the British Movement in the Lancashire town of Burnley.
<P>

<a name="40223-05_para3"></a>The answer to this alienation is to re-engage with the voters. The absence of direct political contact on a regular face-to-face, person-to-person basis is one of the reasons why voters have switched off. Instead of re-engagement, however, we tend to try to dream up ever more novel ways to enable a shrinking group of people to cast their votes. While I am not intrinsically opposed to the extension of postal voting, I am seriously concerned that this debate is simply a distraction from the more fundamental question of why people are disengaging from politics and from <P>


<a name="column_18"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 18</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>their civic duty to vote. I am also extremely worried that the way in which this measure has been promoted will create more cynicism, rather than abate it.
<P>

<a name="40223-05_para4"></a>I shall divide my remaining remarks into two questions on the principles and the practicalities.
<P>

<a name="40223-05_para5"></a>The Electoral Commission has been right to argue for a guarded and cautious approach to postal voting. As we have heard, the commission recommended a pilot scheme to be conducted in areas geared up to dealing with potential abuse and fraud and then for an assessment and evaluation to be carried out before deciding whether to extend the scope of postal voting. The commission says that that could be a useful contribution in increasing participation, and certainly evidence from boroughs such as St Helens, where postal votes were used last year, would tend to bear that out. However, from an empirical point of view, what would be really useful is to know whether that is just a passing fancy&#151;an aberration&#151;or a long-term, solid achievement. Clearly such an evaluation would need to take place over several elections for that to become clear.
<P>

<a name="40223-05_para6"></a>What we lose by the extension of that principle is the physical presence that voting at a polling station requires of each citizen. It takes only a few minutes each year to vote at a polling station. Noble Lords who have served in local authorities or in both Houses may not think it an enormous burden to give up a few minutes each year in order to be personally present to vote. It is part of living in a country with the privileges of freedom and liberty that we enjoy.
<P>

<a name="40223-05_para10"></a>If the voters are not to be seen asserting their rights and liberties through the ballot box, we will lose something special from our democracy, and perhaps the politicians will be more inclined to forget. It was Gladstone's first administration who provided for the secret ballot so that landowners could no longer evict their tenants and employers could no longer discriminate against their workers when voters exercised their franchise against their master's wishes. The safeguards in postal voting are nowhere near as great as those offered by being physically present to vote.
<P>

<a name="40223-05_para11"></a>Another principle at stake is the contamination of the impartial process of elections themselves. When the two major opposition parties object to the arbitrary overturning of the Electoral Commission's recommendations, it breaks the consensus that should always be at the heart of how we organise elections. Charges of manipulation, partisan advantage, gerrymandering and the rest, damage the whole process and can be completely avoided by proceeding only when there is inter-party agreement. It is a very bad principle to ride roughshod over the safeguards. It casts a shadow over the process and risks undermining the legitimacy of the process itself.

<P>

<a name="40223-05_para12"></a>So much for the principles, but what about the practicalities? The Electoral Commission said that it was not able to make a positive recommendation that the north-west region was suitable to undertake a pilot scheme in 2004. If the commission cannot offer such a recommendation, how can the Government be in a position to do so?
<P>

<a name="40223-05_para13"></a>I was looking at a table of comparative experience in organising postal voting. The number of authorities in the north-west is 43, and only 14 per cent&#151;six of them&#151;have any experience of all-postal pilots. By comparison, in the north-east, 65.2 per cent of authorities have that experience. Clearly, the north-east region is in a much better position to carry it out, which is why the Electoral Commission said what it did.
<P>

<a name="40223-05_para14"></a>I have also been in correspondence with the leader of Liverpool City Council&#151;Councillor Mike Storey. I put to him several questions about electoral fraud and multi-occupancy of properties, and his remarks bear out the need to proceed with caution. His letter referred to comments made by the Electoral Commission, which stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There have been several allegations of electoral fraud in the North West in recent years. These have centred around interference with postal votes, or intimidatory procurement of proxy votes in conventional elections. Some of these investigations could proceed to court in early 2004. This would be likely to produce unfavourable publicity about the security of postal voting".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-05_para15"></a><P>

<a name="40223-05_para16"></a>Again that will lead to the contamination and the undermining of the process. I also asked about the complexity of running such an election, and he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An all out council election for the whole city, on new ward boundaries, which do not fit existing constituency boundaries, plus the Euro election at the same time, fills me with great concern about the effective organisation of such an exercise. This is especially so as time is short, and planning started later because the North West was specifically recommended not to be included in the pilot in the Commission's report of 8th December.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-05_para17"></a><P>

<a name="40223-05_para18"></a>He continued:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Given the Freepost for the Euro, as well as an all postal, I estimate that we are looking at 40&#150;50 million additional items for the Post Office to deliver. I suspect it will be chaotic if this pilot goes ahead".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-05_para19"></a><P>

<a name="40223-05_para20"></a>In cities such as Liverpool and Manchester there is the other issue of multi-occupancy. I well recall from my days as a Member of Parliament that multi-occupancy and vacant properties were frequently where fraudulent votes came from. I remember vividly a group of members of the Militant Tendency who had written on the back of their hands the names of voters whom they had come to the polling station to personate. I saw that with my own eyes and complained about it at the time, and the police were called. How much easier it will be to carry out such abuses using this measure.
<P>

<a name="40223-05_para21"></a>There are principled and practical reasons why we should proceed with great caution before messing around with the electoral process. I commend the amendments to the House.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, referred to some of the information that I provided in the Grand Committee about the allegation of widespread fraud involving postal voting in towns in the north of England. I shall not repeat it today as it is set out in Hansard and is available for people to read, but towns such as Bradford, Oldham, Bolton, Bury, Rochdale, Blackburn, Burnley and my own district of Pendle have all been involved.
<P>

<a name="40223-05_para22"></a>Although there have been only a few prosecutions, some police investigations are still going on, and it is widely accepted among politicians of all parties that fraud has taken place, and that it is likely to happen if there is all-postal voting. I chaired a meeting last week, which was attended by many members of the Asian communities from the towns throughout the north-west. They expressed great concern that all-postal voting will lead to fraudulent activity and put a great deal of pressure on the Asian communities. It will be difficult for the political parties to stamp out fraud completely, although we shall do our best.
<P>

<a name="40223-05_para23"></a>Secondly, I agree almost entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Alton, who made an excellent speech. Unlike the noble Lord, I am still active in party politics in the region. Since the Grand Committee, I have talked to election staff in the different authorities who have expressed great concern. I am referring not only to those authorities which will have all-out elections in new boundaries, where the whole process itself will be difficult, but to authorities such as Pendle, where we shall have ordinary local elections using the old boundaries. There is great concern that the region as a whole is not ready for such an experiment either administratively or in a practical way.
<P>

<a name="40223-05_para24"></a>Thirdly, I reinforce what my noble friend Lord Rennard said. In the past fortnight, I have talked to people in the north-west from across the parties. They believe that the change is being made for two reasons: first, because it will improve the prospects of the Labour Party in these elections. I think that they are wrong and that the Government are wrong if that is their motivation behind it, but there is no doubt that that is widely believed within the Labour Party in the region. Secondly, it is believed that the measure will help to stop the BNP winning seats. As I said in the Grand Committee, I believe that they are wrong about that too. If it is possible to rig elections, there is no doubt that all-postal voting will make it much easier for unscrupulous people to rig elections. I would not put the BNP at the top of the list of the most scrupulous political parties in the country.

<A NAME="40223-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, I have taken part in more elections either as a candidate or an election agent than I care to remember. I am concerned that the Government and many others are blaming the electorate for apathy and alienation, whereas the fault lies with the political practitioners.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para0"></a>The fault does not lie with those who vote. If we want people to vote, we must give them something to vote on and enthuse and encourage them to do so. If people do not turn out to vote, it is the fault of political <P>


<a name="column_21"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 21</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>parties and governments. The quarrel that I have with the proposition to have all-postal voting is that the electorate will lose touch with those who govern.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para1"></a>Going to the polling station, particularly for parliamentary elections, used to be a great occasion. People would get together; they discussed the issues; they voted at the polling station and felt that they had done their duty. They had done their duty collectively and felt good about it. I felt good the first time I voted. I do not know whether first-time voters feel as good as I did then. There is something about going to the polling station to take part in a collective act of duty to elect your government whom you will hold eventually to account.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para2"></a>Further, any candidate worth his salt will first of all want to identify his supporters. If he is to identify his supporters, he will have to go out and find them. He must talk to them on the doorstep, convince them that he is the man they should support and that he has the policies with which they agree that will make their life better. Door-to-door canvassing is one of the essences of real democracy&#151;to meet the people who will be governed, to see how they want to be governed and to persuade them that you are the chap or the lady to do just that.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para3"></a>Having identified the relevant people, you get them to the polling station. But there is one problem with postal voting&#151;this has already been identified&#151;because the postal vote is sent out 10 days or a fortnight before the election. Anyone who has done any canvassing knows that, when well done, canvassing continues until midnight of the day of the election. What happens in that interregnum? Even if you canvass people on the postal voting system, you go to the door and they say, "We have voted. We have already done it a fortnight beforehand". Therefore, political parties have no chance to convince those people between the time that they receive their postal vote and the election. Elections are often won or lost in the last few days. I remember that well in 1970 when I was first elected to the House of Commons. It was expected then that the Wilson government would survive but there was a turning point on the Monday before the election and they lost. Big issues are involved here.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para4"></a>Moreover, having identified your voters, you then get them to the poll. There is great excitement. Many people are working together&#151;the parties are also working together&#151;to get the highest possible turnout. There is contact with the people to persuade them that it is not only their duty but also a pleasure to vote at the polling station. So far as I can see, that will all be completely sacrificed. The measure will make political parties become lazy. Indeed, having four-year elections instead of annual elections has already proved the point that in the interregnum period political parties become lazy and therefore lose contact with the people they are supposed to represent.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para5"></a>Enlarging the pilot scheme at this stage to cover nearly half the country seems to me completely absurd because the issue is not proven. I believe that it will be bad for our democratic system and bad for government as a whole.

<P>
<A NAME="40223-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, I hope that I may add one very brief point to the admirable speech of the noble Lord, Lord Alton. I feel very strongly that this measure threatens the secret ballot. Secrecy seems to me to be a most valuable and important thing that must be preserved. We know, alas, from Northern Ireland that there are infinite ways of rigging a postal ballot. The IRA was found to have a printing press in a cellar on which it turned out papers. That can happen. In many communities people will be required to vote in a certain way by certain people. We must preserve the secrecy of the ballot.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Beaumont of Whitley: </B>   My Lords, I do not apologise for intervening in this Bill at this late stage. Until the Government see fit to give me a colleague, I am not necessarily able to take part in the earlier stages of every Bill. However, I have been lobbied fairly heavily both by members of the Green Party and by my old friends in the Liberal Party to support this amendment. They all say that, so far as they are concerned, the measure is not only open to abuse but also almost impossible to organise in one or two of the areas which are now thought likely to be included.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para6"></a>I believe that we should stick to the original recommendations. I take very strong account of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart. As someone who was responsible for the organisation of the Liberal effort in two by-elections, both of which returned Liberal Members of Parliament to the House of Commons, I remember distinctly that about five days before polling day you suddenly felt that you had won. Others who have taken part in by-elections will have felt exactly the same. You suddenly know that there is a feeling in the air and your canvassing suddenly surges way ahead. People should be given the opportunity to register their votes right up to polling day. It is not a good thing to expand the postal votes. I sincerely hope that this amendment will be passed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-06_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs   (Lord Filkin): </B>  My Lords, I wish to speak to the Government's Amendment No. 2 and to respond to the discussion on Amendment No. 1, and, by association, Amendment No. 3. I agreed strongly with one point that the noble Lord, Lord Alton, made; namely, that no mechanism for voting will by itself solve the problem of disengagement from politics and one's concern about that issue. The noble Lord is right in that respect.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para7"></a>Without maintaining the tradition of making this a Second Reading debate, it is right that I mark why we are where we are. We are where we are because there has been such a reduction in turnout in local, European and national elections that any neutral political commentator has to be concerned about that issue. The noble Lord was right to say that postal voting by itself cannot constitute a total answer. However, turnout in elections where postal voting has been piloted has increased by some 15 per cent on average. When that 15 per cent is added to a turnout of some 30 per cent, many local authorities have found <P>


<a name="column_23"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 23</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the number of the electorate who have voted has increased by 50 per cent. We would be foolish not to consider in a proportionate and thoughtful manner whether the sensible development of postal voting led to a permanent increase in engagement by our electorate, without pretending that it was a total or sufficient measure by itself.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para8"></a>I turn to the amendments before us today. As is apparent, the Government's amendment names our choice of regions on the face of the Bill and by so doing seeks to negate the need for a main order. I very much appreciate the discussion that I have had with both Opposition Front Benches in that respect. I also appreciate the recognition that although we are not at one regarding the relevant regions, there is a sensible and, I think, healthy consensus that in terms of efficient electoral administration the fact that Parliament itself designates the relevant regions in primary legislation provides certainty and allows the maximum time for preparation on the part of returning officers. I believe that we all consider that that is to the good. I thank noble Lords warmly for that.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para9"></a>Why four pilot regions? Piloting is about learning lessons. Within reason, the more data that we have, the more accurate the conclusions that we shall be able derive. So far, pilots have been small scale&#151;we have always said that the Bill is about scaling up. The combined electorate of the four regions is more than 14 million people. The evidence that we shall gain from making pilots available on that scale will enormously help the Government and all parties that have a legitimate interest in the issues, including the Electoral Commission, in informing future decisions about whether to go further with postal voting.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para10"></a>In Committee I explained how we took the Electoral Commission's recommendations which were split broadly into three categories. I believe that in the debate there has been selective quoting from the Electoral Commission report. The Electoral Commission made three points. It had a first category of two regions which were definitely suitable for postal ballots; another four regions which the commission thought were clearly not suitable for a variety of reasons; and a middle category which was marked "potentially suitable", about which the commission was aware there were concerns.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para11"></a>In December the Government accepted those regions described as suitable and said so. We then worked through those described as "potentially suitable", in the order of ranking as set out by the commission. We considered Scotland, but we decided that Scotland was not a practical possibility because the returning officers in Scotland did not believe that they could deliver a safe election. Therefore, we would have been foolish to have gone ahead in that situation.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para12"></a>We took operational capability as our key criterion. As a consequence, we had discussions. My noble and learned friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton and Chris Leslie in another place met the regional returning officers from both the north-west and Yorkshire and Humberside and discussed with them their perspective on whether they could deliver successful pilots in their situations. To cut short the matter&#151;I shall perhaps refer <P>


<a name="column_24"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 24</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to it later&#151;both said that if they were chosen they could deliver successful pilots. It is true to say that the degree of enthusiasm differed between the north-west, which was very keen, and Yorkshire and Humberside, which was much less keen. Nevertheless, a key test from Yorkshire and Humberside's point of view was whether a successful pilot could be delivered.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para13"></a>As part of the process of testing we also discussed the issues of security and safety, which are proper issues of concern in this debate. I shall make it absolutely clear that in doing so, we have been operating completely within the terms of the Electoral Commission. It did not say that the four middle category of potentially suitable regions could not go ahead. It said that there were issues. To put that beyond doubt, the commission said, in the letter that it has distributed to the House for consideration on these amendments, that four regions were unsuitable, but named four regions as potentially suitable for an all-postal pilot. The commission believed that it was open to the Government to have further discussions with these four regions if they were minded to designate additional pilots. We had those discussions, which led us to believe that it was safe and sound for there to be a wider scale of piloting, which we believed to be desirable. To add emphasis to that, Sir Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester City Council and regional returning officer for the north-west, a region that was quite rightly the focus of much of our discussions in Committee, said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we convened a meeting of all LROs towards the end of last year to discuss the principle of a pilot, and everyone present (42 and 43 local authority areas) committed themselves to work to ensure a successful outcome".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-06_para14"></a>
That was not the Government bludgeoning local authorities into the situation. Similarly those in Yorkshire and Humberside made it clear that while it was not their preference, if they were asked to do it, they believed that they could deliver a successful pilot.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para15"></a>One further reason for having four rather than two pilot regions is the diversity in those areas. If one pilots the willing, one will always receive a slightly biased result, but life is not made up totally of the willing. Therefore, a significant advantage could be obtained in having pilots that are carried out in areas where people are not necessarily massively enthusiastic about them, or massively experienced in undertaking them. That would be real life. Diversity will help to maximise our experience.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para16"></a>Why the pilots should take place only in the north was touched on. Clearly London and the south-west were excluded. Additionally Wales, the eastern region and the south-east were all deemed not suitable by the commission and we did not feel that it was appropriate to go against its clear, direct advice nor did we wish to do so.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para17"></a>On the 50 per cent figure, a more accurate figure is that the pilot regions would see a turnout of about 31 per cent of the electorate. In 2003 the pilot regions saw a 22 per cent turnout of the local electorate; so, as a consequence, we are not talking about such a large scale increase.
<P>


<a name="column_25"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 25</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para18"></a>Agreeing to the four pilot regions will give the matter certainty and will be enormously helpful to regional returning officers and to local authorities which, as a consequence, will be able to plan forward. This year marks the last chance for pilots on this scale until 2009. Therefore, I believe that we would be wise to learn from the ability to have a wider-scale pilot by having four rather than two.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para19"></a>I shall briefly refer to one or two points raised in the debate. I have signalled why this is not the arbitrary overturning of the Electoral Commission's report. I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, said about staff concerns. I would always expect that there would be staff concerns on something of this kind. I have also noted the many important points that he made in Committee on that point.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para20"></a>On the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, clearly the problem is that the electorate is already partly out of touch with politics, which is one reason for trying to increase turn-out. Door-to-door canvassing will continue but in a different form, as we have seen.
<P>

<a name="40223-06_para21"></a>I shall not weary the House longer, as we shall shortly have a Statement to deal with. We believe that there are good reasons for conducting four pilots. We believe that we shall learn more by having four pilot regions; that four pilots can be carried out successfully; and that the House should allow for four pilots to proceed on this basis so that, as a consequence, we can have early certainty and closure. I hope that the government amendments will be supported and that the opposition amendments will not be.

<P>
<A NAME="40223-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ampthill: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, he said that he was speaking only to Amendment No. 2. However, there are 47 amendments in this group, of which 42 are government amendments. Perhaps he could clarify that for the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, that is kind. A large number of consequential amendments follow on from the main government amendment, Amendment No. 2. I apologise. In an attempt to keep short what I said, I abbreviated my notes, which is always a mistake. All the other amendments are consequential amendments on Amendment No. 2, which enables one to remove the need for a general order so that there is only one order subsequent to Royal Assent rather than two.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-07_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. I also thank very much those who took part in the debate&#151;in particular, the noble Lords, Lord Alton and Lord Greaves, and my noble friend Lady Park. Their contributions underlined the concerns that we have had since the Bill began its passage. We made those concerns abundantly clear during the Committee stage but I am afraid that the Minister will probably know that they have not been allayed, even by what he said this afternoon.
<P>

<a name="40223-07_para0"></a>It is true that piloting is all about learning lessons, but sometimes it is easier to learn lessons in small doses than in great swadges. While I accept the Minister's assertion that the electorate in the four pilot regions would account for 31 per cent of the total electorate, <P>


<a name="column_26"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 26</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that is still a very high proportion when one is working on a regional basis. Therefore, I believe that it would be better to carry out the test on a smaller scale. We know that regions, even if they are European electoral regions, have a habit of transmogrifying themselves into regions in general. Therefore, it would be better to carry out the pilot in a selected, small number of regions.
<P>

<a name="40223-07_para1"></a>I believe that the Minister accused me of quoting selectively from the Electoral Commission. Perhaps I may return the compliment. It is true that, when I put forward my view, I cut out a little of what was said here and there. However, I did not cut out the part at the end, which I do not believe the Minister referred to, where the commission states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We have not ourselves been involved in further discussions";
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-07_para2"></a>
namely, the discussions with the two additional regions, which the commission had already said it did not believe were ready or willing to take part in the pilot. Therefore, I do not accept that I misled the House. I believe that I was fairly clear and it is set out in the letter if anyone wants to check it.
<P>

<a name="40223-07_para3"></a>I heard what the Minister said. I do not consider that we have discussed the government amendments in any depth. We shall deal with one or two of them later because other amendments relate to them. However, I may need to put on the record that I expect, or hope, that the order relating to the pilot will be an order of this House and that it will be debated in this House as well as in the other place so that, ultimately, we can see what it says. We carried out an enormous amount of work on this matter in Committee in order to put the practical aspects of the elections into place. We want to ensure that they are all in place before we go forward because, apart from nuances, there has been a little disagreement about them. However, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="40223-08_para0"></a>"With permission, I wish to make a Statement on the Government's approach to the accession of 10 countries into the European Union from 1 May.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para1"></a>"EU enlargement is extremely welcome and important for our country. It is something to celebrate. All parties in this House are in favour of enlargement. John Major played an important role in launching the process. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister was instrumental in calling for early accession of the 10 countries.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para2"></a>"After 1 May, citizens of the accession states will be free to travel across all EU borders. Our position has always been clear&#151;that the United Kingdom would benefit from all new EU citizens working legally, paying taxes and national insurance. This is an alternative to illegal working, which would fuel the sub-economy and undermine existing conditions of work. But we will take every step to ensure that our benefit system is not open to abuse.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para3"></a>"We have already tackled benefit tourism by tightening the habitual residence test. Today we are building on that by announcing measures which will <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_30"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 30</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>ensure that those who come here from the accession countries but do not work will not be able to claim benefits.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para4"></a>"It is important to remember the positive aspects of migration. The United Kingdom is already benefiting from more than 20,000 accession nationals who have been granted work permits in the past two years. From 1 May this requirement will be replaced by a workers registration scheme.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para5"></a>"The United Kingdom has one of the most dynamic and successful economies in the world. Since 1997 our economy has experienced growth and prosperity greater than any other large state. Growth has been higher, we have created more sustainable jobs, we have a lower level of unemployment&#151;almost half the level of France and Germany&#151;which is a tribute to my right honourable friend the Chancellor, and to the creativity and flexibility of the British labour market.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para6"></a>"We currently have more than half a million vacancies and will benefit from the skills, flexibility and willingness to work of these new migrant workers as we have in the past.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para7"></a>"To say that we welcome legal migration is not new. We set out our policy in our White Paper two years ago, Secure Borders, Safe Haven. We have consistently developed legitimate and legal routes for managed migration, including issuing 175,000 work permits this year, compared to 40,000 in 1997.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para8"></a>"At the same time we have balanced this by taking tough measures to clamp down on illegal working, abuse of the asylum system and clandestine entry into our economy.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para9"></a>"We have radically overhauled the asylum system. More than 80 per cent of asylum claims are now processed in under eight weeks. We now have the lowest asylum backlog for a decade&#151;half the level we inherited in 1997. We have halved the number of asylum claims from its peak in October 2002. We are removing record numbers of failed asylum seekers and illegal migrants.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para10"></a>"This balanced approach enables us to make the positive case for legal, managed migration.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para11"></a>"The accession of countries into the EU opens up new opportunities for trade and for labour market flexibility. That is why all European Union countries and all political parties in this House welcomed this expansion.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para12"></a>"That is why I am confirming today our decision to allow workers from the accession states access to our labour market subject to certain sensible conditions.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para13"></a>"When we first set out our position, only those countries with high levels of unemployment were planning to introduce restrictions on work for accession nationals. Since then other countries have changed their stance.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para14"></a>"Clearly, it makes sense for us to ensure that our approach does not leave us exposed. We will therefore introduce a new workers' registration <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_31"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 31</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>scheme to replace work permits for accession nationals. This will place an obligation on all accession nationals to register where and for whom they are working. Their right to work in the UK will depend on their being issued with a registration certificate.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para15"></a>"It will be incumbent on the employer to check that the employee has registered. This will provide a platform for a national ID scheme under which, in time, all non-UK nationals will be required to register. This will help us accurately to determine how many new workers are in Britain, in which sectors and types of employment. It will also assist with enforcement and inspection and will enable us to react immediately if, against all the odds, there are destabilising effects on the labour market.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para16"></a>"It is important to emphasise that the Government retain full discretion to remove all or part of the concessions at any time. We will not hesitate to do so if necessary. We will in any case be tightening controls and dealing with those who evade their responsibility by the employment of clandestine workers. I know that all decent employers will want to join with us in co-operating and in rooting out those who exploit.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para17"></a>"We will be putting before Parliament a set of affirmative regulations which will allow access to the labour market while ensuring our benefits system is not open to abuse.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para18"></a>"This is a coherent and sensible package of measures, which builds on the principles and policies laid out by the Government over the past three years.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para19"></a>"We believe that proper, legal, managed migration is good for Britain and fair to genuine workers from the accession countries. Whether they are plumbers or paediatricians they are welcome if they come here openly to work and contribute. At the same time it is clearly not right that people should be able to come here, fail to get a job, and enjoy access to the full range of public services and social security benefits.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para20"></a>"Therefore, this is the second element of the package we are announcing today. Those wrongly believing that they can move here in order to claim benefits without working should be in no doubt that they cannot. They cannot draw down on benefits without contributing themselves to the rights and entitlements which should go hand in hand with the responsibilities and duties.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para21"></a>"For two years, and possibly longer, we will require accession nationals to be able to support themselves. If they are unable to do so, they will lose any right of residence and will have to return to their own country.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para22"></a>"My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions will bring forward regulations to prevent access to benefits for those not working. My right honourable friend the Paymaster General will bring forward regulations to <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_32"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 32</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>prevent them from claiming child benefit. We will also restrict access to other benefits such as social housing.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para23"></a>"This package reinforces the balanced approach to migration that I have spoken about, within a clear set of rules.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para24"></a>"I reiterate: we welcome people, as we have throughout the centuries, to come to our country to work, to contribute and to be part of our society. We reject those, from wherever they come, who exploit our generosity.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para25"></a>"This approach takes account of the simple reality that under the treaty of accession, no EU member state has the right to interfere with freedom of movement. The issue therefore, is on what basis people come to our country.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para26"></a>"By taking these measures we will ensure that those arriving in Britain are able to work for their living, openly and honestly, not drawn into the sub-economy. Those who wish to find a job will be free to do so. Those who come for short periods of time will have the means to do so.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para27"></a>"In this way we avoid expensive bureaucracy and at the same time protect ourselves from clandestine work and the exploitation of the sub-economy. This is the right approach for Britain in the 21st century: fair on ourselves; fair to our new partners; and tough on those who would abuse the system. I commend this solution to the House."
<P>
</UL>
<a name="40223-08_para28"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_time1"></a><H5>4.24 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   My Lords, as this is the first occasion on which I have faced the Minister across the Dispatch Box since a recent television programme on Channel 4, perhaps I may offer her my warm congratulations on being elected by Channel 4 and the Hansard Society as Peer of the Year.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para29"></a>I turn to the Statement. I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement made by her right honourable friend in another place a short while ago. Earlier today the Minister was fastidious in not giving any teasing snippets of information to my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford in answer to his Question on related issues which might properly have been answered without encroaching on the Statement. I make no criticism; the Minister was most careful, and properly so, in the Answer she gave. However, her right honourable friend the Prime Minister was not quite so fastidious, in that he pre-empted some of the core information in the Statement by answers that he gave earlier today in a BBC radio phone-in programme. That, of course, just whetted our appetite.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para30"></a>The enlargement of the European Union is, indeed, not a concept that suddenly emerged over the past six weeks. As the noble Baroness said, it has been on the agenda for years. Britain's strategy for the free movement of labour, which impacts on British jobs and our public services, should have been clear, consistent and planned in advance. The Government have failed to address that imperative until recently.
<P>


<a name="column_33"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 33</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para31"></a>Today we learnt that the Government have finally agreed to adopt a policy of registration for work for migrants from the new accession countries. I give a general welcome to that announcement. However, as always we shall have to look very closely at the orders that come before the House, especially those that restrict benefits and social housing to ensure that the Government's policy does not have unintended consequences, especially for those migrants who have families living here with them.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para32"></a>I have always recognised that there are serious labour shortages in some sectors of the UK economy and that when they are filled by legal migrant workers there is a benefit to the economy from tax and national insurance that they pay, apart from the part they also play, quite rightly, in society in general.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para33"></a>The Minister used alliterative examples of plumbers and paediatricians. In practice, it is the agriculture and hospitality sectors that probably benefit most from migrant employees. However, I have some questions for the Minister about how the measures she has announced will be implemented.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para34"></a>The Statement refers consistently to new countries. Are all accession countries thereby covered within these measures, including both Malta and Cyprus, which I had thought would be exempt?
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para35"></a>What about those from the new accession countries who are already working here legally on work permits? Does the time they have spent here count towards the qualifying period before they can claim benefits or do they start from point zero when they register under the new system?
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para36"></a>Referring briefly again to registration, I note that the Statement says that it will be incumbent on the employer to check that the employee has registered. The Minister is right to point out that employers will be very keen to co-operate with the Government to ensure that the system is properly managed. What will be the penalty for an employer who fails to carry out that proper check? What will a proper check be defined as? What consultation has there been over the past week or so with the CBI on these matters? It will ensure that its members are disciplined properly but the CBI has great expertise which could have been fed into the Government in determining which systems can properly carry out such measures.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para37"></a>I am puzzled by the vagueness of the Government's policy, even at this stage, after the flurry of ministerial discussions last week. We are told in the Statement that for two years and possibly longer the Government will require accession nationals to be able to support themselves and not be eligible for social security benefits, child benefit and social housing. Why have the Government not yet determined the length of that period? What will influence their decision when they do let us know how long it will be?
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para38"></a>The Prime Minister said this morning on the radio&#151;and I quote the BBC quoting him:

What is the legal basis for that compulsory expulsion? Who will pay for their expulsion&#151;central or local government or the previous employer? Since the migrant is presumably destitute, one wonders how he or she might be expected to pay for it.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para40"></a>Finally, I notice that the Government bring ID cards into the equation. They say that the information given to employers will provide a platform for a national ID cards scheme. For my last two questions I ask the final and very obvious ones: how; and, when?

<P>
<A NAME="40223-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, I suppose I should declare an interest as someone who was employed as a part-time university teacher in the Czech Republic and Hungary between 1993 and 1996. I am happy to say that they did not impose an ID card on me or any of the other things that are proposed for the other way around.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para41"></a>We on these Benches give a half welcome to this Statement. It is a useful defence of legal migration, but it slides down towards accepting tabloid press campaigns against the Roma and others. We would like to have seen some reference in a Statement of this kind to the contribution which Poles, Czechs and Slovaks have made to Britain over the past three generations. Those of us who have spent a lot of our time in the north of England know very well that those who were forced to come here after the War&#151;being caught on the wrong side&#151;had often fought for us in the Second World War and their grandchildren continue to make a major contribution to the British economy.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para42"></a>It worries us that the press campaign against the Roma has produced such a response from the Government; and, as I suggested during Question Time earlier this afternoon, it continues to puzzle us that the Government are so robust in standing up to the BBC but so remarkably unrobust in their response to the Daily Mail, the Sun and others. I have noted the number of occasions in the past few weeks that the Daily Mail has picked out asylum seekers and others as being sources of social turmoil in Britain. That seems to be the kind of press campaign to which any Labour Government should be standing up, and I regret that the Prime Minister has failed to do so.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para43"></a>Do the Government have evidence on the scale of benefit abuse and benefit tourism, or is this an imagined problem&#151;a small problem that has been blown up by the press into a large issue when the issue really is not there? Certainly, we may regret that many other European Union states have retreated from the principles of freedom of labour. We welcome the Government's reiteration that they are in favour of freedom of movement within the EU and the enlarged EU and that as these states join the EU, which we welcome, they should be entitled to freedom of movement as rapidly as possible.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para44"></a>I would love to ask the Government how they assess the net movement. We know very well of the large number of Poles, Czechs, Hungarians and others who come into Britain every year, work for short periods <P>


<a name="column_35"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 35</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and go home again. That is not gross movement, it is net movement. Since we do not have very clear exit controls of people moving across the Channel, I am not clear how the Government will collect the figures.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para45"></a>However, what is new in the Statement is the workers registration scheme&#151;a national identity card scheme for all non-UK nationals. Have the Government consulted about that? Will it apply to company directors, people working in banks or to university teachers? There are French, German and Greek nationals in my department at the London School of Economics where I teach. Will they need to have ID cards? Is this seen as the beginning of an extension of an ID card system to all people in employment in Britain? That seems to be the most significant part of the Statement; and it is that which we need to know most about.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I very warmly thank the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, for her kind words. I should like to remind the House that two other noble Baronesses were nominated&#151;the noble Baroness being one and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, the other. I certainly celebrated that this House for the first time nominated three women on merit and not gender. So I very much congratulate the noble Baroness on being among that band.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para46"></a>Perhaps I may now turn to the questions asked by the noble Baroness. I thank her for the warmth of her welcome in relation to the Statement. The issue of genuine workers being able to take advantage of work here is very important. In the few weeks before we broke for the break, it was clear just how bad some of the consequences can be where illegal workers are exploited in a quite improper way.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para47"></a>I can reassure the noble Baroness that Malta and Cyprus are not included in the list. They have been exempt. None of the 15 EU members states is imposing restrictions on free movement of workers from Malta and Cyprus. That is because of their wealth&#151;they are the two richest members of the 10 accession states, with approximately 70 to 75 per cent of the EU GDP average&#151;their small size, and their historical links with some existing EU member states. Malta and Cyprus are both Commonwealth members, as the noble Baroness knows.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para48"></a>The United Kingdom, by opening up its labour market to registered workers from the A8&#151;unlike other EU member states&#151;is ensuring that those who come here to work will do so legally rather than illegally, paying taxes and national insurance rather than working in the black economy. That is a matter about which I know the noble Baroness has spoken in the past and it is something that we are absolutely determined to eradicate. We also expect reciprocal rights for British workers to work in the new member states.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para49"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned the shortages and the availability of workers in the agricultural and hospitality sectors. That is why our approach is to <P>


<a name="column_36"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 36</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>allow workers from the EU accession countries to work in any sector they choose. We have consulted very widely. The noble Baroness may know that both the CBI and the TUC are very much in favour and support the decision to open the UK labour market. The British Chamber of Commerce did so also. They made it clear to us that they would not support an arrangement which would either put on a quota or would mean that people would have to apply before they arrived here. We listened very carefully to that advice. We were very grateful that both the CBI and the TUC gave their whole-hearted support.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para50"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the two years or longer mentioned in the Statement. She will know that the arrangements as a result of the accession treaty mean that in the first two years we will be able to make regulations under the national law. Those could be extended for another three years to make it five years and/or could be extended further&#151;if there were specific specialised causes of concern&#151;into the seven-year period. It is those two years to which we refer in that part of the system.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para51"></a>Those people who come here legitimately and work well will be in a position to take the benefits that accrue to them. That will be made clear. I absolutely understand that the noble Baroness will want to look very carefully at the regulations to make sure that they accord with what is right and proper.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para52"></a>On the issue of identity cards, the noble Baroness and the House will recall that the Government have made clear our approach in relation to the introduction of ID cards. This will be incremental and is part of the work that we have already indicated that we wish to see.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para53"></a>Perhaps I may turn now to the questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire. I take great pleasure in agreeing with him about the real contribution that has been made by migrant workers in the past but particularly the Poles, the Czechs and those who have come over the years from the eastern European bloc. The noble Lord will remember that we were at the forefront in welcoming enlargement as being of a positive benefit.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para54"></a>I also take pleasure in confirming many of the points that were alluded to at Question Time earlier this afternoon. Britain has benefited hugely from migration. UK employment is at a record high. It is up by 1.7 million since the spring of 1997; the UK ILO unemployment is down by 0.6 million since the spring of 1997; our long-term unemployment is down by more than three-quarters since April 1997; and we have the lowest ILO unemployment rate among the G7 countries. It is one of the lowest ILO unemployment rates in the EU, being almost half that of France and Germany. Approximately 15 per cent of the UK trend economic growth depends on migration. Migrants make up 8 per cent of the population but generate 10 per cent of our total wealth. Migrants are substantial net contributors to the Exchequer. Studies show that, in 1999&#150;2000, they paid £2.5 billion more in taxes than they consumed in benefits and services. We are in no doubt that they are a positive benefit. The noble Lords opposite should be in no doubt that the children of migrants are of benefit because their <P>


<a name="column_37"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 37</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>leader is one such person. If we look around this House&#151;I do not include myself as I was born British&#151;we know that we have all benefited from the richness that comes from migration to this country.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para55"></a>I would like to reassure the noble Lord that the difficulty that we have experienced concerning this matter is not a change. We have had to be absolutely practical in the way in which we deal with it. For the first time our system could potentially be abused: benefits could become a draw. We have no legitimate way of identifying benefit abuse in the past, and we are simply making sure that that will not occur in the future. We are using the registration system as a means of identifying how many people come here, where they go to and what the migration flows are. There is no indication that that will cause a difficulty.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para56"></a>Earlier this afternoon, the noble Lord said that similar stories and concerns about accession have been bandied about. He was right. We do not believe that this will be a problem; we have taken the course that was necessary in order to make sure that we do not experience the adverse consequences that others have feared. I hope that the noble Lord will be reassured. We take delight in promoting the benefits that we have seen. The Government are unable to dictate what the tabloid press prints in response to what they say. If only it were otherwise. That is the position that we are in.
<P>

<a name="40223-08_para57"></a>This is a rational and appropriate response to the problems that we now face, and I hope the noble Lord will feel that he is able to be wholly congratulatory now instead of only partially so.

<A NAME="40223-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, what discussions have taken place with the Refugee Council and like organisations? What proposals do the Government have? If a persuasive case is advanced by any of them, will the Government consider what they have to say positively? Will they make appropriate changes to the proposals that she has outlined today, if necessary?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040223/text/40223-09.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, of course we honour what the Refugee Council has said in the past. We take its recommendations and statements very seriously. On this occasion we are concentrating not on refugees but on legal migrants who are members of the eight accession countries. They have the right to come to this country and visit without restriction. I remind the House that migrant workers are able to come to all EU countries if they are self-employed. There is no restriction on any EU national travelling to any EU country and working there on a self-employed basis. That is good for industry and good for the economy. It will be welcomed by all EU countries.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ludford: </B>   My Lords, are the proposed measures based on an evidence-based forecast, as opposed to reaction to press coverage?
<P>

<a name="40223-09_para0"></a>Last year all parties were happy that this country would not take advantage of transitional measures. Is it not likely that the public will be confused by this <P>


<a name="column_38"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 38</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>schizophrenic reaction? On one hand, the Government speak about the welcome statistics of the benefits of migration, and employ lofty rhetoric to explain how enlargement would be welcomed; and yet the reality is that we are imposing restrictions and treating nationals of the new member states as second-class people. That was not what we promised them 15 years ago when we talked about accession to the EU.
<P>

<a name="40223-09_para1"></a>The Government have mentioned the problem of hysteria. Are they aware that on the "Today" programme this morning there was an item on the rate of HIV infection in the new accession countries being the highest in the world? It turned out to be about Russia and the Ukraine, which are not accession countries.
<P>

<a name="40223-09_para2"></a>The Minister talked openly about the worker registration scheme being part of the move towards a national ID scheme. Will that apply to all British nationals as well as foreigners? Does she think that the British public would welcome the worker registration scheme if they knew that it was a move towards a national ID scheme?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I shall deal with the last point first. Noble Lords will remember that, when we set out our incremental proposals for ID registration, we made it clear that there would be an opportunity to consider whether they should be implemented more broadly. We discussed the biometric information that will go into a number of materials&#151;passports, driving licences and so on. We have been absolutely open on where those issues are going. The report is not confused. We are not retracting or retrenching from what we said at the beginning.
<P>

<a name="40223-09_para3"></a>My right honourable friend the Prime Minister was at the forefront of those who proposed enlargement. That was backed up by the statements made very openly and cogently by my right honourable friend Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, on 10 December 2002. Nothing has changed. We are not making the nationals from the new accession countries second-class citizens. We are opening our markets in a bold and proper way so that we can reap the benefits that we said would come from accession.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, did the noble Baroness say that those who come here and are unable to support themselves will lose their right to remain? If that is the case, what powers will the Government have to remove them in those circumstances? What reason is there to think that, in practice, they would be removed, given the Government's signal failure to remove immigrants at the present time?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-09_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I must take issue with the noble Lord. Our level of removal has never been higher. We are getting better and better at removals.
<P>

<a name="40223-09_para4"></a>Those who come to this country and work will be able to stay. Those who do not work will not be able to claim benefits. They may either be self-employed or support themselves. If they try to claim benefits improperly, that will be dealt with. It will be possible to remove those who behave improperly and seek to do that. However, those <P>


<a name="column_39"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 39</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>who come here and work and behave in a way that is conducive to increasing wealth for both themselves and ourselves will be able to continue to work here openly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that the noble Baroness answered my specific question. What powers will be used by the Government to remove those who come here and are unable to support themselves?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-09_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, they will not be entitled to any benefit. If they infringe the new rules that we are about to bring in, we will be able to remove them. Your Lordships will know that in the case of EEA nationals who are no longer trying to get work, or no longer able to get work, we have appropriate rules that will make it possible for us to remove them. There will be similar rules in relation to this category.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-09_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, I welcome what the Minister said about legal, managed migration. However, will she confirm that registered migrant workers will be entitled to minimum wages without illegal deductions? That will be particularly important in catering, horticulture, cockle picking and other miscellaneous employment.
<P>

<a name="40223-09_para5"></a>The noble Baroness went on to say that such registered workers would have to support themselves for two years. Is that not far too long? Would not six months be more appropriate? Hard cases are almost certain to emerge, involving, for example, people who suffer industrial accidents or people whose employers suddenly go bankrupt and lay them off. Will there be some kind of compassionate arrangement for dealing with such situations, given what the noble Baroness said about the tax surplus arising from migrant workers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-09_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord's concerns about the minimum wage are already covered. In order for a worker to show that he is entitled to be registered, he must have evidence of a job, such as a letter from an employer or a contract of employment including details of the work. There must be evidence that he is being paid the minimum wage or more, along with a photograph, passport or ID card.
<P>

<a name="40223-09_para6"></a>The two-year period to which I referred is the period from accession. The individual worker will have to demonstrate that he is in continuous employment for one year. If he loses his job during that year, he will not be entitled to benefit. However, he can apply for new registration when he gets another job. The important thing is that such people must work continuously for a year, before they would be entitled to claim any benefit. Work-related benefits may be available to them, but not if they are not working. Everything flows from work. Someone who is in work will get certain benefits; someone who is not in work is not entitled to claim any benefit at all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-09_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Tomlinson: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for repeating the Statement made in another place by the Home Secretary. In particular, I am grateful for the economic and social context in which she valued enlargement.
<P>


<a name="column_40"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 40</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-09_para7"></a>There are two specific details of the Statement that I want to raise. I notice that there is no reference in the Statement to access to National Health Service treatment. Will my noble friend give me an indication of what is intended?
<P>

<a name="40223-09_para8"></a>I hope that my noble friend can also reassure me on my doubts about access to social housing. On the basis of what she said, is it not a fact that an EU citizen in these circumstances could be in a worse relative position with regard to access to social housing than a non-EU migrant&#151;legal or illegal&#151;who presents himself or herself to the local authority for housing? Such a disparity between the EU migrant and the non-EU migrant, particularly if the non-EU migrant were illegal, would be hard to justify in equity or logic.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-09_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I reassure my noble friend that workers from the accession countries will, if they are in work and paying tax and national insurance, be entitled to derive benefits from the National Health Service. We have tried to differentiate between those who are working and those who are not here for work. Either the individual can support himself without access to benefit or he is here working properly and openly and is able to get access to some assistance. That is the distinction that we have made, and we believe that it is a proper one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-09_spnew11"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, we have read a good deal recently about benefit tourism. Can the Minister quote to us any year in the past 10 for which the Eurostat figures put our benefit levels above the third quartile? Until she can, will she agree that the phrase "benefit tourism" is grossly mistaken?
<P>

<a name="40223-09_para9"></a>Am I right in believing that the central basis of EU law on migrant workers is that the right to benefits depends on someone actively seeking work, a principle well known to British law? The Minister now proposes to base it on success in obtaining work, which is not under the applicant's control. What thought has she given to the consequences for the applicant of that loss of entitlement to benefits? Will her department, in particular, examine the report published on 5 February by the Department for Work and Pensions on loss of benefit for breach of a community service order? It shows that, in return for a measly 1.8 per cent increase in compliance, there has been an increase in severe hardship and an increase in crime. Is not the attempt to ask people to live without benefit for two years likely to benefit no one but the gang masters of Morecambe Bay?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-10_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, several things have been conflated, if I may respectfully say so. First, noble Lords will know that the DWP report on loss of benefit for breach of a community service order relates to young people who have not addressed the orders appropriately. It cannot properly be relied on in this context. The noble Earl asked about years when we were above the third quarter. I do not know the answer to that, and I will have to write to the noble Earl. To be frank, I must say that I am not sure that I understood what the noble Earl was saying.
<P>


<a name="column_41"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 41</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-10_para0"></a>We are making a distinction between the position of EEA members and the accession countries as regards rights under the actively seeking work principle. The derogation is in the accession treaty, and we are seeking to allow those who come here to work in a way that is open and fair.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </B>   My Lords, I have a practical question for the Minister. What happens, if someone who comes from one of the accession countries&#151;where, after all, the average wage is less than half our minimum wage, making the attraction of coming here clear&#151;has an accident at work or loses his job after, say, a couple of months? He may have brought his family and may have three or four children. Is the Minister really saying that that family will be left destitute and that there will be some procedure by which they will be returned to their country? What happens while that procedure is going on? What view will the courts take of that? Will not the Government find that the courts have ruled that their policy is unacceptable?
<P>

<a name="40223-10_para1"></a>I worry about the practicalities. I understand why the Minister is giving her response, but she should give some comfort to those of us who find it difficult to see how the system will work in practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-10_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord appreciates, the way in which the scheme is to work will enable those from the A8 countries, which are accession countries, to come here and take advantage of the opportunities to work. The whole purpose is that they are able to do that; we are making no restrictions on them bringing their families. They will be able to take advantage of a number of the facilities available here in the UK which may not be available as easily in their host countries. But the hard fact is that if they are not, within that first 12 months, able to maintain themselves and their family, they will not be entitled to claim state benefit. They may be able to obtain assistance from the local authority in relation to going home again or some short-term respite, but they will not be entitled to state benefit as of right. I am sorry if that does not give the noble Lord the comfort he seeks, but that will be the position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister remember that on 12 February she gave the Government's estimate that there are between 5 million and 7 million Roma people in the accession countries? Does she agree that the majority of these live in very miserable and often deprived conditions and that many of them are persecuted? Does she recognise that if only 5 per cent of those were to come here and have difficulty fitting in and getting jobs, at an average cost of benefit and services of some £10,000 a head&#151;the sort of figure generally mentioned nationally&#151;it would cost £2.5 billion to £3 billion a year, which is the entire GDP growth forecast for next year?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-10_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I know that the main concentration of the debate seems, <P>


<a name="column_42"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 42</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>unfortunately, to have hinged on the Roma. We do not think that that is an appropriate way to look at these issues. We are making it absolutely clear to all those who wish to come to this country that if they come here and do not get work they will not be entitled to state benefits. We are saying very clearly that if it is their purpose to come to this country and not work, it will not work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, the Minister has already confirmed that more than 175,000 work permits were issued for the purpose of managed migration and, of those, about 20,000 were issued to EU nationals. Will she confirm that the people who come here from EU accession countries would have no consequential effect on the work permits issued to people from Commonwealth countries such as Australia and New Zealand in particular, and other parts of the world? Will she also confirm that at the end of the residential qualification period, both EU nationals and others would be entitled to British nationality?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-10_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I can certainly confirm that they would be entitled to apply for British nationality. Whether they would be entitled to be granted it is, of course, another issue.
<P>

<a name="40223-10_para2"></a>Let me make it absolutely clear that we see this as an opportunity for progressive change. Many people who come to this country are, regrettably, abused and taken advantage of because they cannot work legitimately. We are providing a clear way in which any of these individuals can come to this country and apply for work at the minimum wage or above, so that they will not be exploited and employers who seek to take advantage by oppressing or subjugating them will not have the opportunity to do so.
<P>

<a name="40223-10_para3"></a>This is the best way of giving individuals a legitimate route to be here, to work hard and to contribute. If that succeeds, we will all be able to reap the benefit.

<P>

<a name="40223-10_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I should like to give a word of explanation. This amendment, along with a number of others that we will come to during the course of our discussions this afternoon, is consequential on the amendment to Clause 1 that was made by the Government in their Amendment No. 2, as amended by the Opposition's Amendment No. 3. They simply make it clear that there will not be a need for a general order for the reasons that we gave in the earlier discussion. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-10_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Speaker   (Baroness Turner of Camden): </B>  My Lords, I should tell your Lordships that if this amendment is agreed, I cannot call Amendment No. 6 because of pre-emption.
<P>

<a name="40223-10_para8"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-10_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rennard </B>   moved Amendment No. 5:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 2, line 6, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-10_para9"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"( ) The pilot order must provide that&#151;
<br>
(a) all postal ballot papers must be accompanied by a declaration of identity, signed by the elector and by a witness, and containing in legible form the name and address of the witness;
<br>
(b) each elector who has returned a postal ballot paper is sent an acknowledgment by the returning officer."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40223-10_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, our earlier debate featured a number of serious concerns about voting by post. This amendment is about minimising those concerns where all postal vote pilots will still take place. I would be rather less concerned if they took place in two regions rather than four, but there are still important concerns about the possibilities of personation.
<P>

<a name="40223-10_para11"></a>Postal vote fraud is a serious risk. Requiring a witness signature to accompany the vote could make a considerable difference in reducing problems, particularly in areas of multiple occupation homes and in inner cities.
<P>

<a name="40223-10_para12"></a>Some people say that fraud in postal voting is very rare, but I do not believe we should open up the system to abuse. I can see how, with all-postal voting pilots in a number of areas, there could be extensive abuse.
<P>

<a name="40223-10_para13"></a>On the whole, the Electoral Commission is of the view that so far there is not widespread abuse. It points to the fact that, generally, abuse in our political system is pretty rare. However, as a number of noble Lords have pointed out, there are abuses and examples of fraudulence in a number of places. The noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, referred to our experience in Liverpool in the 1980s. The noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton, was mindful of some of the tactics employed by the Militant Tendency in the 1980s regarding personation at the polling stations.
<P>

<a name="40223-10_para14"></a>It is rather difficult in some places to go to the polling station and impersonate someone else; I suggest that it is very much easier if you simply collect in the postal votes. You could collect 10 postal votes put through one letterbox in a house and sign to the effect that you were those 10 people. If you had to require a witness signature to say that you were such and such a person, that would <P>


<a name="column_44"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 44</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be a significant deterrent to abuse. People at the Electoral Commission, with whom I have discussed this in some detail, say that checks are not often made on these anyway. My point is that a check can be made, and it is a deterrent to someone claiming another's vote.
<P>

<a name="40223-10_para15"></a>I know also that there may be some problems for deaf-blind people or other disabled people, but I suggest that postal voting with a witness signature is still easier for many than going to a polling station. If you apply to vote by post in the London elections in June and receive a postal vote, you will have to obtain a witness signature to say that you are the person voting in that way. I see no reason for suggesting that if an all-postal pilot takes place, in the east Midlands or the northern region, for example, that requirement should be abandoned.
<P>

<a name="40223-10_para16"></a>I would say by way of comfort to people who are concerned that the witness signature requirement may reduce turnout slightly or make it slightly harder for some disabled people to vote that the solution will come in a few years, I hope, when there is individual registration of voters on the electoral register. At present, one person tends to fill in the form for everyone who lives in the household. That means that only one signature is kept by the returning officer, and it is impossible for other people on the electoral register in that household who return postal votes to have their self-certification signature checked because there is no other record of their signature.
<P>

<a name="40223-10_para17"></a>Within a few years we will have a new system, I hope, whereby every individual will go on the electoral register, with a copy of their own signature. When we reach that point, there will be no need for a witness signature, but until then, I suggest this amendment is very necessary. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Rennard. There was a good deal of discussion in Grand Committee about the best way to ensure the validation of postal votes and how to ensure that there is no personation. We discussed several methods. Like the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, I believe that the best possible way is by witnessing postal ballots. Therefore, I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   My Lords, this is one issue that we discussed in great detail in Grand Committee. While we were discussing these matters, we were told by the Minister&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, and, on the second day, the noble Lord, Lord Evans of Temple Guiting&#151;that we would be sent a draft policy paper or something of that kind. I understand that a 70-page document has been sent out, but I am afraid that I have not received it. I am not sure whether it is the draft pilot order&#151;no, it is the policy paper. Hansard could provide many instances of when I was personally told that I would receive the information, but I have not. I should be grateful if I could have the information as quickly as possible, not least to dissuade me from tabling lots of amendments for Third Reading.
<P>

<a name="40223-11_para0"></a>I strongly support the amendment moved by my noble friend. There is a real fear that widespread postal voting means the end of the secret ballot. That is the <P>


<a name="column_45"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 45</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fundamental point of principle behind the concern about and opposition to postal voting. The Electoral Commission and the Government have examined ways of addressing the problem. I remain to be convinced that they have found a satisfactory solution. However, some of the measures in the policy paper&#151;which I look forward to reading&#151;will, we are told, seek to address this vital fundamental problem. We could have all the postal voting in the world, but if the fundamental principle of the secret ballot goes out of the window, that is the end of democracy as we know it. This is a crucial issue. As my noble friend said, the Electoral Commission suggests that individual registration is, in the long run, the best way to tackle the problem, but that cannot be included in the pilots this year.
<P>

<a name="40223-11_para1"></a>I believe that it is wrong to do away with one of the safeguards that currently exist. There is no point in introducing new safeguards if, at the same time, we do away with the only one that ensures that the person filling in the ballot paper and sending it back is the person to whom it has been sent. That is the fundamental problem. Requiring a witness provides a safeguard. I have personal experience of looking into irregularities in a particular local election two years ago. It is possible for members of the public or representatives of the candidates to inspect the declaration of identity&#151;as it is called at the moment&#151;after the event. Inspecting declarations does not prove anything in a hard and fast way, but it gives one a very good idea of what has happened when people have gone out to rig an election. We found that several individuals had witnessed more than 100 postal votes each. That sets one on the trail of working out how that particular election may have been rigged&#151;as there is no doubt that it was in Pendle two years ago. It is a crucial safeguard and a pointer to what happens.
<P>

<a name="40223-11_para2"></a>Secondly, because witnesses use their own signatures, it is relatively easy to examine the signatures of the electors concerned and assess whether they have been forged by the person who witnessed the signature. Indeed, I have no doubt that that happened in Pendle two years ago. Therefore, this is almost the only safeguard that people have if they are examining allegations that a particular election has been rigged. Under the pilots, when the Government are looking for other safeguards to introduce to protect the secrecy of the postal vote, it would be wrong to remove the one safeguard that we have at the moment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-11_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as President of the Electoral Reform Society. It will not surprise the House to find that I am in entire agreement with my noble friend Lord Rennard, who is a member of the council of that society. However, I feel that I owe it to the House to report some misgivings from well informed people, which I do not share, but on which the Minister should have a chance to comment. They come from among others the campaign manager of Scope, and from my son, who is parliamentary officer of the Royal National Institute for the Blind. They are concerned about the witness requirement. They fear that it may <P>


<a name="column_46"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 46</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>infringe the secrecy of the ballot, discourage disabled turnout and create alarm and despondency. They fear that the requirement for a legible signature may have an adverse effect on disabled people. It is true that blind people have difficulty in producing a legible signature on occasion, but I hope that the Minister will confirm that the signature is that of the witness and not the voter.
<P>

<a name="40223-11_para3"></a>This issue is one of the possibility of fraud. There is a real fear of fraud in the case of proxy voting. I know of several cases in which there has been a vehement suspicion of fraud in proxy votes, but it has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt&#151;a point of some importance. Does the danger of fraud justify the need for a witness, and, if so, why? That answer would be worth having on the record before the Bill leaves this House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, in rising to respond to these issues, I again put on record that, although we do not necessarily think that concerns about fraud are of the level signalled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, in Grand Committee, there is regrettably some fraud in our electoral practices. Neither of those statements implies that the Government are quiescent or passive about the importance of investigating and appraising whether, through further use of postal ballots, fraud increases or can be removed or reduced to the minimum possible level. I want to make that absolutely clear before I respond specifically to these issues.
<P>

<a name="40223-11_para4"></a>Although we may not agree about the mechanisms or the quantum we certainly do agree about the importance of ensuring that, if postal balloting is taken further, we find effective ways of resisting, rebutting, and deterring fraudulent practices. For good reasons that I am sure will be shared throughout the House, that will be an essential component of such ballots having credibility in the future and therefore having the confidence of all electors and political parties.
<P>

<a name="40223-11_para5"></a>We discussed this specific issue in Grand Committee and I made clear our intention to mandate within the pilot order that a ballot paper must be validated with a security statement signed by the elector. We do not intend, as this amendment suggests we should, additionally to require electors to obtain the signature of a witness. I will try to explain why. We have taken our lead on this issue from the Electoral Commission. In its report, The Shape of Elections to Come, the commission identifies a number of reasons for utilising the security statement in place of the declaration of identity.
<P>

<a name="40223-11_para6"></a>Those reasons are reiterated in a briefing the commission has produced specifically on the amendments under discussion today. They were; first, that the requirement to complete a declaration discourages some electors from voting as it could be difficult to find a witness. Secondly, the necessity of a witness could increase the risk of a breach of secrecy as the witness may see the elector's vote. Thirdly, the Electoral Commission said that involving another person in the voting process would create the potential for a breach of security, mitigating that as a safeguard against fraud. Fourthly, it said that there was a significant issue of a risk of disenfranchisement being increased. The commission was strongly concerned that paragraph (a) of the amendment would introduce a <P>


<a name="column_47"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 47</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>feature that its previous evaluation of pilot schemes had indicated served little purpose in terms of fraud prevention and created real risks.
<P>

<a name="40223-11_para7"></a>The commission recommended to the Government in September 2003 that in future all postal ballots should not require a witnessed declaration, for the reasons that I have given. Instanced in that was evidence from opinion polling and other sources, which showed that some potential voters in all-postal pilot schemes had been deterred from voting because of the difficulty or inconvenience of finding a suitable witness. The commission also said that a witness statement offered no guarantee of security, as there was no register of signatures. Therefore, it was perfectly possible for witness signatures also to be forged.
<P>

<a name="40223-11_para8"></a>I shall give a further example from the piloting experience that the commission reported on in 2003. It noted that in Trafford, only 414 ballot papers were rejected out of a total return of about 84,000. In the previous year, with a declaration of identity, 2,164 ballot papers had to be rejected. The commission pointed out that that equated to 2.5 per cent of the total turnout. In other words, there is a much higher rate of invalid ballot papers as a consequence of the requirement. If we were to extrapolate those figures across the four pilot regions and assume, optimistically perhaps, that there was a 50 per cent turnout at those elections, the consequence would be that 175,000 people could be disenfranchised because invalid papers had been submitted.
<P>

<a name="40223-11_para9"></a>In essence, we are taking the Electoral Commission's view and advice on the matter. That does not mean that we do not believe there to be an issue about fraud, but on the advice of the commission and in our own opinion, we do not believe that the proposal suggested by the amendment is the way to deal with it.
<P>

<a name="40223-11_para10"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Russell, said, there is considerable concern that such a measure might discriminate against those with disabilities. Officials in the department met representatives from Scope and RNIB last week, and a strong view was expressed that a witness requirement only added another obstacle barring many disabled people from voting in secret and at their convenience. Scope feels so strongly about the issue that it has written to two noble Lords expressing its views, saying:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We are clear that requiring voters to have their ballot witnessed by another person not only increases the likelihood of people spoiling their ballot or returning them uncompleted but also puts many disabled and older voters, who are more likely to be more isolated or live alone, at a substantial disadvantage".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-11_para11"></a>
As I have said, the forgery of one signature does not preclude the forgery of a second signature.
<P>

<a name="40223-11_para12"></a>Furthermore, it has been suggested that voters must be sent acknowledgement. I understand why that is suggested, but both our and the Electoral Commission's view is that that should not be done because it would substantially increase cost and bureaucracy. More importantly, it is not an effective anti-fraud measure. It is also doubtful whether it would really work. We have taken steps to reduce the risk in <P>


<a name="column_48"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 48</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>situations such as houses in multiple occupation. An individual who is willing to accept the potential consequence of fraudulently taking an elector's vote is likely to put in place contingencies to accept any acknowledgement. Electors can ask whether a vote has been received, and returning officers will be able to give them that information.
<P>

<a name="40223-11_para13"></a>Without more ado or delaying the House further, I reiterate that we agree on the importance of using the pilots as ways in which to identify whether fraud is taking place and effective ways in which to resist, rebut and deter it. However, we do not believe that the amendment is a good way in which to do that. For those reasons, I hope that the noble Lord will be minded to withdraw it.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rennard: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. I understand the sincerity of his argument about various measures to overcome fraud with postal voting. However, I still believe that the witness signature on the declaration of identity is a necessary weapon in the armoury against fraud at this stage, until such time as there is individual voter registration.
<P>

<a name="40223-12_para0"></a>I understand that there may be concerns about the secrecy of the ballot. However, as the ballot paper is inserted into one envelope and can be sealed and seen by nobody else and the declaration of identity then accompanies it, there should be no problem with secrecy. I accept that there may be some problems for some people in acquiring a witness to sign that they are who they say they are. However, we are now at a point at which the all-postal pilot votes may not require that, while in any other region in England, Scotland and Wales, if one votes by post on 10 June, one will require a declaration of identity. I do not see why there should be that difference. On that basis&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I should like to make one response, which I omitted earlier, to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, about the policy paper.

<FONT SIZE=3>draw to the attention of those of your Lordships who did not notice the fact that the Division Bells failed to function in the last Division. The Division was therefore extended to 10 minutes from the conventional eight minutes. If the Division Bells cannot be repaired, we may need to give further thought to how we proceed in future Divisions. Obviously, in this particular case we were caught short, as it were, by the failure of the equipment. Let us hope that it can be repaired.

"( ) The pilot order must make provision for including in the count of votes any postal ballot paper received by the returning officer through the post on the day following the day appointed for the poll (or, where more than one day has been appointed, the last of such days)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40223-12_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, as one of the tellers for the "Not-Contents" in the first Division this afternoon, I feel a certain sense of guilt about the correction that has just been made.
<P>

<a name="40223-12_para8"></a>I tabled this amendment because I think it is essential to allow postal voters to vote on polling day, which would be the effect of this amendment. It is wrong in principle to say that postal voters in pilot regions must vote a day earlier than voters in the regions that have conventional polling. It is true, of course, that most recipients of postal ballots are likely to vote quite shortly after receipt of a ballot. That is not necessarily a good thing, but that is what seems to happen in practice. Surely, however, they should have the right to delay their vote until polling day. As has been said, people change their minds as a result of events which may happen at a very late stage during the poll. So it seems right that it should be possible to vote by post on the polling day itself.
<P>

<a name="40223-12_para9"></a>When I originally tabled the amendment I had assumed that postal votes cast on a Thursday would be delivered to the returning officer on Friday morning and that postal votes cast on Friday would be delivered until Saturday, with the result that votes received on the Friday would be votes cast on the Thursday&#151;assuming that to have been the polling day&#151;and that they should therefore be counted. I recognise that it is possible under the Government's proposal for people to go to a supported delivery point, but that is likely to be inconvenient in a great majority of the cases and impracticable in a substantial number of them. If there are one, two or, at most, three supported delivery points in each constituency, a journey of many miles may be required to reach them in rural areas. Even in urban areas, supported delivery points may be located in places where parking is difficult or impossible. They may be beyond easy walking distance and involve the voter having to use and pay for public transport.
<P>

<a name="40223-12_para10"></a>It now appears from the policy paper published by the Government&#151;I am very grateful for having been sent a copy of it&#151;that I may have been wrong to assume that ballots posted on polling day will not be collected and delivered on that day. Section 6 of the paper states:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Royal Mail will be offering a specialised service for these elections which will provide for all electoral mail collected on the day of poll, up to the last collection from post boxes within the local authority area, to be sorted out and made available to electoral administrators at a time that ensures the ballots are available for the close of poll . . .  It will ensure that ballots put into post boxes within the local authority area up until the time of last collection (usually between 4.00 pm and 6.00 pm) on the day of the poll are collected and made available for the count.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-12_para12"></a><P>

<a name="40223-12_para13"></a>So far, so good; that means that postal voters will be able to vote by post on Thursday. At the same time, however, it appears that voters will be told not that they can vote on the Thursday, but that they must vote by Wednesday, even though they will in fact have been able to vote by post on the Thursday. If that is the position, then that seems very unsatisfactory. Surely the official election literature must accurately tell the voters the true position. It is entirely legitimate for them to be encouraged to post not later than the day before polling day. However, surely they must be told that ballots posted before the last collection on polling day will in fact be delivered and counted. Can the Minister confirm that that will be the case? I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40223-12_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, as I think the Liberal Democrats appreciate, although we exactly understand the situation, we are not totally in support of the amendment, mainly because we think that without a poll closing time it will be very difficult to decide the time by which a ballot has to be received in order for it to be counted. What will the election literature specify as the time by which a ballot must be posted to ensure that it is counted? To some extent it will depend on the Royal Mail. However, we need to know a little more clearly what the Royal Mail is intending to do. We shall come to that point in a later amendment.
<P>

<a name="40223-12_para14"></a>When we spoke to the Minister in a meeting a week or so ago, there was some confusion between the time at which the Royal Mail would make the final collection of ballot papers&#151;between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. on the day of the poll&#151;and the time by which it would be advisable to post the completed ballot as stated in the election literature. The point may have been covered in the policy paper, but the policy paper will have to be turned into something else, which I presume will be the pilot order. The point will have to be covered in that.
<P>

<a name="40223-12_para15"></a>I was pleased to see included in the policy paper a commitment that the number of votes received after the close of poll will be counted to inform an evaluation by the Electoral Commission on the reliability of the system.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, we explored this issue in Committee and in a meeting between Committee and Report stages. I should set down a number of <P>


<a name="column_53"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 53</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>foundation principles. It is absolutely critical that there should clearly be a time when polling ceases. That time is, and it will be, 10 o'clock on the day itself. Both we and the Electoral Commission think that it would be quite wrong to have any confusion about that at all.
<P>

<a name="40223-13_para0"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, indicated, we are minded to include in the advice that electoral officers should provide the advice that, if people in the polling areas are intending to post their vote rather than go to an SDP, they should post it by 12 o'clock on the day before. I think that that is sound and good advice because doing that will minimise the risk that one's vote does not arrive in time. In practice, the elector will have had not only the previous day but the previous two weeks to decide whether to vote by post and to post their ballot. The evidence from many places is that, for fairly obvious reasons, people tend to do it fairly early; if they are going to vote they tend to get on with it and do so. So the position is that most people will vote well before the final day. The advice will be that, if they are going to post their ballot, they should do so no later than 12 o'clock on the day before. If they wish to vote on the day itself, they can always go to a supported delivery point to vote in person.
<P>

<a name="40223-13_para1"></a>That brings us to the final question about what the Royal Mail will seek to do. The Royal Mail has said that it will seek to scour the post boxes and sorting offices within the pilot regions between four o'clock and six o'clock on the day of posting. It seems perfectly sensible for the Royal Mail to do that&#151;to try to maximise the likelihood that votes will count in cases where there has been a failure to collect a vote from a box if someone has voted the day before, or where someone has inadvertently and unadvisedly voted on the day itself. However, that will not change the clear advice that one should vote on the day before or, preferably, several weeks before. That is an opportunity that the postal voting system seeks to allow.
<P>

<a name="40223-13_para2"></a>That is the Government's position and I hope that the House will agree that it is reasonable. We have seen an impressive commitment by the Royal Mail to the process of trying to ensure that we reduce the risk of not admitting votes that have been cast.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister say whether the election literature will refer to the fact that a sweep will be made between 4 o'clock and 6 o'clock on polling day? It is surely essential that potential voters should be told the position. If, for example, someone wakes up and realises on polling day that he has not put his ballot into the postbox, he should know of the option of posting it that morning rather than having to go to what may be a highly inconvenient supported delivery point, which he may decide not to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I do not wish to be abrupt, but that information would cloud and confuse the issue in a way that would increase risk. The best advice is to vote early if not often. Clearly, the advice is to get the vote in at the earliest possible opportunity. One may want to leave it until the last minute, and vote the <P>


<a name="column_54"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 54</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>day before, but why so? I do not wish to be pig headed about it, but while the Royal Mail will seek to reduce the risk of lost votes, one cannot be confident that it will always in all circumstances be able to sweep every post-box in such a limited time on the day. That may be difficult in some rural areas, for example, although it intends to try to do so.
<P>

<a name="40223-13_para3"></a>The policy guidance made it clear that we were talking about post-boxes within the regions themselves. If someone puts a vote in a postbox outside the region on the day before, it should be included and counted. But there is no possibility that the Post Office could scan all the post-boxes in London on the day of polling. Therefore, to put out advice that voters might get away with it if they vote on the day and if they make sure that they do so in a certain region would lead to a risky situation and confuse the public.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-13_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I wish to clarify my remark about votes following polling day. I understand from the policy paper&#151;and welcome the fact&#151;that the Electoral Commission will be asked to do a random selection test of the voting papers following the election to test for personation and fraud. Is that what page 15 of the policy paper means when it states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Electoral Commission will look at the number of votes received after close of poll so it will be important for electoral administrators to keep records"?

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="40223-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, with great sorrow, I regret that we may be taking a compliment that we do not deserve. I shall have to get a copy of the policy paper, but my recollection on this issue is that we shall want to track the number of ballot papers that did not count because they came after the time of closing. That is the point to which we are referring now. It is for a good reason; we want to see who did not get their votes in on time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Norton of Louth: </B>   My Lords, if I may assist the Minister, I presume that that refers to Amendment No. 34.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that the noble Lord is right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, in the circumstances it is apparent that my Amendment No. 7 is based on the false assumption that the delivery of votes posted on Thursday would be handled by the normal postal delivery system and would therefore not arrive until Friday morning. As that assumption now appears to be false, I do not intend to press the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40223-13_para4"></a>I accept that this does not apply to ballots posted outside the pilot regions, but it is deeply unsatisfactory that people will not be told that a ballot posted within a pilot region before last post&#151;before 4 o'clock in the afternoon&#151;on polling day is likely to be delivered through the post on the day, and therefore will be included in the count. We do not seem to be giving <P>


<a name="column_55"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 55</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>voters full information that they can use to make up their minds about deferring posting their ballot paper until polling day.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-13_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for allowing me to intervene. It is not about being unreasonable to the public, but about avoiding taking them into risk. The likelihood of a ballot failing to arrive on time would be substantially greater if we were to put out such advice. Therefore, we would be irresponsible to do so. At the same time, we need to try to ensure that if someone is misguided, mistaken or confused, his ballot will still count, if possible. There is nothing contradictory in those two positions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-13_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, I still think that that does not solve the problem. Of course it is right that people should be told that there is a risk and that their vote may not be delivered if they leave it until polling day. But someone may have been away from home; he may arrive back late on Wednesday evening, having missed the last collection on Wednesday, and would be prepared to take that risk. He may not be prepared to go to a supported delivery point.
<P>

<a name="40223-13_para5"></a>Having said that, there is nothing further that I can do. However, I regard it as highly undesirable that people should not be given the whole picture, including the risk of non-delivery if they leave it until the last possible day. As I said, it is clear from the policy paper that the amendment is based on a false assumption, so I beg leave to withdraw it.
<P>

<a name="40223-13_para6"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br>
(a) that all information provided is in a simple form, easily accessible to the elderly and disabled, and
<br>
(b) that those with disabilities are able to exercise their vote independently and in secret."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40223-13_para8"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving Amendment No. 8, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 32. Both amendments focus on ensuring that provisions are in place to allow disabled people to participate easily in an all-postal election.
<P>

<a name="40223-13_para9"></a>First, we still think it imperative to have an assurance on the face of the Bill that the details of the pilot order will state that information on voting will be in simple form and easily accessible to those with disabilities. The pilot order should also make it clear that those with disabilities can exercise their vote independently and in secret.
<P>

<a name="40223-13_para10"></a>Secondly, it is equally important that in Clause 4, which covers the report produced by the Electoral Commission, there is a specific duty on the commission to assess the extent to which the manner of elections facilitated voting for those with disabilities, having consulted such organisations or individuals representing disabled people as the commission considers appropriate.
<P>


<a name="column_56"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 56</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-13_para11"></a>There was much discussion on those issues in Committee, and I was encouraged by the Minister's commitment to ensure that all necessary provisions would be made to allow those with disabilities to vote in an all-postal ballot. It is clear that there has been extensive consultation between the Government, the Disability Rights Commission and the RNIB. Both organisations set out a detailed briefing specifying their minimum requirements for providing for those with disabilities.
<P>

<a name="40223-13_para12"></a>They proposed that all electoral information must comply with RNIB's clear print guidelines. Information and instructions should be in a minimum of 14 point in plain English with clear information about access arrangements. Returning officers must be in a position to provide formats in large print, tape, Easy Read, Braille, disc and e-mail. The ballot paper must be compatible with the tactile voting device. Home visits or one-to-one assistance must be provided to disabled voters on request. Signature guides and other aids are to be provided to assist voters to sign the declaration of identity, and staffed delivery points must be accessible to disabled voters.
<P>

<a name="40223-13_para13"></a>There are many detailed requirements, and I thank the Minister for his letter of 6 February giving some commitment to meet the majority of those specifications. I thought that it might, however, be of benefit if the Minister could let us know whether there has been any further progress in facilitating voting for those with disabilities. For instance, there are several provisions mentioned in the policy paper&#151;notably on page 18&#151;which it would be helpful to have on record.
<P>

<a name="40223-13_para14"></a>We know that all-postal voting is an evolutionary process. It is designed to generate evidence and to test the waters to see if the method works. We therefore fully believe that our amendment, which specifies that the Electoral Commission must have regard to the accessibility of the election for those with disabilities, is vital in promoting best practice and gathering feedback from groups who represent disabled voters. I am sure that the Minister will assure us that this will go without saying. However, I prefer that it should be specified on the face of the Bill. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40223-13_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Rennard and I have added our names to Amendments Nos. 8 and 32 which we fully support.
<P>

<a name="40223-13_para15"></a>We welcome the fact that the Government have gone some considerable way to meeting the requirements of the Disability Rights Commission and the RNIB. However, a number of outstanding questions remain. Certainly, the Disability Rights Commission considers that it is necessary to have clarity regarding the requirements for accessible information. It is imperative to get effective publicity arrangements in place.
<P>

<a name="40223-13_para16"></a>I refer to a number of specific points. The Disability Rights Commission is very concerned about the minimum of one supported delivery point per local authority area. That is not good enough given the mobility and transport barriers for many disabled <P>


<a name="column_57"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 57</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people. It is good that SDP staff will be trained, but will they be adequately trained in disability access? Will there be a single helpline number with text phone and e-mail options? There is concern about the colour of the ballot forms. The Disability Rights Commission contends that the ballot forms should not only be coloured but should have the words, "white, lilac, grey" printed on them. It is also very concerned that one of the colours involved is grey, which as I understand it is a particularly difficult colour for people with some degree of visual impairment.
<P>

<a name="40223-13_para17"></a>The Government have said that election information will be made available in alternative formats which will definitely include tape and e-mail, and Braille on request. The Disability Rights Commission says that large print must also be available, that the expense of providing information in Braille on request is not great and should not be subject to an expense limit, and that clarification is needed on whether ballot papers will be available in anything other than large print. As I understand it, a number of unanswered questions still remain. I hope that the Minister will be able to deal with some of them, if not today at any rate before Third Reading.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I shall do my best but I suspect that I shall need to take advantage of the latter suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. I thank both Front Benches for acknowledging that we have worked with disability groups representing the interests of the disabled.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para0"></a>Clearly, ensuring that an all-postal ballot is accessible to those with disabilities is of real importance to the Government and to the House. There is reasonable evidence that many if not all disabled people find postal balloting advantageous. I shall not discuss that point at length but the Polls Apart survey showed that 96 per cent thought that postal balloting was either convenient or very convenient&#151;however, the survey covered a relatively small number of people&#151;that some 91 per cent thought that it was either easy or very easy to use, that 75 per cent thought that it was a better system and that 82 per cent, given a choice, would prefer to vote by that method in the future.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para1"></a>However, the fact that postal balloting appeals to many disabled people does not detract from the fact that one must work hard to make it as right as one can. The information has to be in a simple format. We spoke about that at some length in Committee. The pilots are concerned with making voting easier and therefore the information must be comprehensible to disabled people. Where we differ concerns the degree to which we specify exactly how to fulfil that objective. We believe that we must look to returning officers to follow good principles and good advice on how they do that. The Electoral Commission recently produced guidance on that issue entitled Equal access to electoral procedures. We believe that electoral administrators will utilise that guidance and we shall re-emphasise the importance of their doing so.

<a name="40223-14_para2"></a>As has been signalled, we distributed our policy paper, if not universally, which referred to disability issues. I wish to read into the record some of the relevant points in the policy paper which set out our position. Supported delivery points must be accessible for the disabled. It would be a nonsense for a building with the traditional 15 flights of town hall steps to be used as a supported delivery point. That would clearly discriminate against disabled people. Therefore, I want to put it beyond doubt that such buildings must meet adequately and fully the requirements of legislation on access for the disabled, or they should not be used.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para3"></a>Electors will be able to request assistance with voting at an agreed place. For example, if a disabled person wants assistance, he or she can set up an appointment for that. Electoral administrators will make arrangements to deliver a tactile voting device to a blind or partially sighted elector to enable them to vote in private. Electoral administrators may, if requested, provide assistance, including marking ballot papers, for a disabled person at a supported delivery point. I shall consider whether the word "may" should be slightly stronger as it seems to me that it should be possible to assist disabled people in that way at an SDP. However, I make no commitment in that regard without reflecting on the matter. SDPs must have a large-scale version of the ballot paper available for voters to refer to.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para4"></a>We are working hard to try to ensure that these measures are accessible for disabled people. We met representatives of SCOPE and the RNIB last week and we are certainly happy to continue an active discussion with disability groups. I shall write to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, on the points that I have not covered.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para5"></a>Amendment No. 32 would require the Electoral Commission to report on the extent to which pilots facilitated voting for those with disabilities. I totally agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, that that should be done. However, both we and the Electoral Commission believe that that is already captured by Clause 4(6)(a) of the Bill which requires the commission to report on the extent to which the pilots facilitated voting at elections. The Electoral Commission has made it clear that it interprets that provision as it should do; namely, that it includes reporting on accessibility and convenience for those with disabilities, and that it will so report. Therefore, it is already charged with a statutory duty that addresses this issue and it has furthermore confirmed that it understands and interprets the measure as it should do.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para6"></a>Although we do not agree with the letter of the amendment moved by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, we totally agree with the spirit of it and we believe that we shall give effect to it through the means that I specified. For those reasons I hope that the noble Earl will feel minded to withdraw the amendment.

"( ) The pilot order must make provision for postal ballot papers relating to houses of multiple occupation (as defined in section 345 of the Housing Act 1985 (c. 68) (meaning of "multiple occupation")) to be hand-delivered by an officer of the local authority who must make reasonable efforts to ensure that those to whom the votes are delivered are still in occupation on the premises."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40223-14_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 9 focuses on the problem of delivering ballot papers to houses in multiple occupation (HIMO), a matter on which we dwelt at length in Committee and which has already been touched on today. Several examples have been given, especially by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, of abusers of votes that have been delivered to houses in multiple occupation. Since Committee stage I have had a number of representations made to me on the same basis, that it is an easy, open door to fraud.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para11"></a>I emphasise that when we talk about houses in multiple occupation, we use the description defined in Section 345 of the Housing Act 1985 which covers a large range of communal living establishments: homes, residential homes, student halls and so on. We are very concerned about the possibility in such places of a number of ballot papers being posted through the door, collected up by one person and filled out, either without the knowledge of those to whom the postal ballot was sent, or for people who no longer reside in the house in multiple occupation. If there is one place where the population turns over quickly, it is in a house in multiple occupation. There are many examples of a 50 per cent change over between the electoral register being created and the election taking place. It is not a simple problem but a significant one.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para12"></a>In care homes for the sick or elderly or in student accommodation, people may be completely unaware that any elections are taking place in which they have a right to vote. If their voting papers vanish in the interim, they will be more unaware and the papers will be of no use to them. I was pleased to hear the Minister say in Committee that he would consider the matter further before Report and that he understood the concern surrounding it. However, the noble Lord said that our approach was too much of a burden administratively, it gave no assurance that fraud would not take place and it was too prescriptive. Instead, he advocated leaving the issue up to the discretion of the local regional returning officers.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para13"></a>Nevertheless, despite such caveats, on page 17 of the policy paper some encouraging comments appear. Having said that, as I mentioned when speaking to the <P>


<a name="column_60"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 60</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Liberal Democrat amendment, we are grateful to the Government for picking up some of our suggestions and putting them in the policy paper. However, here the matter is to be left to the discretion of the regional returning officers and it will not be a mandatory provision that they provide a hand-delivered service.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para14"></a>The Government have clearly conceded in principle that hand delivery would be one way of tightening up the procedures. We would like that to be compulsory for all the reasons that I have given. If left to the discretion of the regional returning officers, the worry is that they will try to justify the risk as not very great, and therefore not put in place provisions to implement the suggestion. The timescale is short and we know that the returning officers will be rushed to put in place all the necessary provisions for the election, but one or two examples of voting going wrong in HIMOs will be enough to put a question mark over the whole postal voting system. Therefore, I believe that it would be appropriate for there to be a mandatory requirement that the papers had to be hand-delivered to the premises and at least some check made that they were delivered to people who still lived there. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment moved by the noble Baroness and corroborate what she said about the practicalities of houses in multiple occupation. Unlike a house with one family in residence, if 10 or 15 people live in a house in multiple occupation, the turnover is very great. Electoral registers are regularly out of date before they have even been printed because people move on. Many itinerants and drifters tend to migrate in and out of houses in multiple occupation.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para15"></a>The danger of the theft of mail in such properties is one that was regularly drawn to my attention when I represented an inner-city area. Theft of mail was a regular occurrence. Mail would just be pushed through the door of a house in multiple occupation or there could be lots of pigeon holes and boxes inside where letters could be left so that anyone would be free to walk into those properties and simply take away all the correspondence that had been placed there. Sometimes if money were sent through the post, that could lead to people being financially much worse off.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para16"></a>I believe that there is a real danger that the situation could be open to abuse by those who want to manipulate or to distort the outcome of an election. They could simply raid the communal boxes or take the mail that may be strewn across the doorstep, which is regularly the case when one walks into a house in multiple occupation, walk off with the ballot papers and commit the kind of fraud to which the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has referred.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para17"></a>The amendment is very reasonable and I wish that it went slightly further. The noble Baroness has framed it in a moderate way. She is asking for the ballot papers to be hand delivered and the amendment refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"reasonable efforts to ensure that those to whom the votes are delivered",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-14_para18"></a>
actually receive them. One could go further than that. I believe that there should be a way of verifying, such as signing a form, that people have received the ballot, <P>


<a name="column_61"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 61</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>so that it is known that ballot papers have arrived in the hands of those for whom they are intended. I hope that between now and Third Reading the Minister will reflect on the matter. It is a very proper concern and one that the Government should take seriously.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I agree that, like previous issues with which we have dealt today, this is important. It goes to the heart of ensuring that there is confidence in the postal balloting system on which we are conducting the pilots. Before noble Lords get too excited that I am about to make some major concession, I shall explain why we think that what the Electoral Commission has advised, with which we agree, is right.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para19"></a>Essentially the commission has advised that the returning officers should be charged, in their local situations, with the responsibility of seeing how best to manage the potential for risk in houses in multiple occupation. That is for a good reason rather than being just a "they say it's all right, leave it to them" type of approach. Two sets of issues intersect at the same time on this matter. We are talking about situations in which common mail is delivered through a front door and it sits in a common place until people pick it up. I was reflecting that my London residence has just such a system. That may or may not be a HIMO. There can be some HIMOs&#151;if I can use that slang&#151;as defined in the Act mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. In some situations, flats are in HIMOs and yet the postal delivery is secure.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para20"></a>A further point is that not all houses in multiple occupation automatically have high turnovers, but many do, such as the kind about which we are talking, the classic lodging house situations mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, or where there is a large churning of people and therefore the risk of a large amount of voting literature being around. In other HIMOs there can be a stable population; for example, long-term homes for the elderly where facilities are shared.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para21"></a>There are a number of different situations. As I do not believe that it makes sense for the Government or even the Electoral Commission to specify a rule that would apply across those different situations, the proper approach is to look clearly at the guidance that we and the Electoral Commission are putting out, make clear the potential of risk, and make clear the responsibility to try to manage risk by thinking about the issue. If anything, I shall look at the guidance to see whether that is clear or not in what it says about the management of risk in local situations. I believe that is what we are talking about.
<P>

<a name="40223-14_para22"></a>Further, as we signalled previously, this will highlight what the post-election research must consider and whether there are problems of abuse that have not been trapped. I suggest, with respect, that that is the proper way to try to manage the risks, without in any sense implying that we are not treating the issue seriously.

<FONT SIZE=3>shall not take the matter any further at this stage. However, because the Electoral Commission is beginning to develop its guidance, it would be helpful to see at least some of it before we progress to a later stage.

<P>

<a name="40223-15_para0"></a>Both now and in Committee we have raised real and practical concerns, based on other peoples'&#151;and partly our own&#151;knowledge of what can cause an election to be flawed. I would be grateful to see what is proposed and to have an opportunity to comment. I accept that making a returning officer deliver ballot papers by hand may be too onerous, but I shall look at the matter again before the next stage. For now, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"( ) The pilot order must make provision for the electors in each relevant European electoral region and associate local government regions to have easy access to supported delivery points."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40223-15_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the amendment is about how many supported delivery points there are in a region holding a pilot election. The Government will be pleased to see that we have dropped our original amendment incorporated in our new clause in Committee on the administration of the pilot election. There we endeavoured to specify that there should be an obligation on local authorities and returning officers to ensure that any elector who wished to do so could vote in the traditional way in a ballot box at a polling station on 10 June. We have listened to the Government's detailed description on the proposed supported delivery points and we thank the Minister for the extra detail spelt out in the policy paper on pages 12 and 13.
<P>

<a name="40223-15_para4"></a>We are happy in principle with the current proposals. We have been told by the Government that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"at a supported delivery point it will be possible to return a completed ballot paper; complete a ballot paper in a private area&#151;with some form of assistance if required; and view the explanatory literature about the elections".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-15_para5"></a>
Our concerns focus on how many SDPs will be provided. In Committee we specified in an amendment that every local government ward in each region piloting the elections should have a facility for posting a ballot form in person on the main day of polling. We have had a rethink after reading the Minister's response to that amendment and the subsequent comments of other noble Lords during the debate. Somehow we wish to channel the discretion of the electoral administrators in the number of delivery points that there should be in each local government area.
<P>

<a name="40223-15_para6"></a>We know that at least one SDP will be provided in each principal local government area, but with the ability for electoral administrators to provide more at their discretion. That is intended to cover those local government areas where transport links are poor <P>


<a name="column_63"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 63</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>or the area is particularly large. As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, pointed out perceptively in Committee,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it is not very likely that local authorities will incur the expense of doing that".&#151;[Official Report, 26/1/04; col. GC46.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-15_para7"></a>
It is further emphasised by the comments in the policy paper on page 13:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In considering the number and opening hours of delivery points, electoral administrators will need to take into account that delivery points in the local government all-postal pilots were only used by a very small minority of the electorate . . .  and that a strong case will need to be made before the costs of additional delivery points are paid".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-15_para8"></a>
I fear that it is unlikely that such a "strong case" will be made and that there may be failure by local authorities to exercise that discretion to provide extra delivery points.
<P>

<a name="40223-15_para9"></a>Will the Minister comment on that discretion? Is there any recourse to demand more than one delivery point in particular local government areas? Can the Minister clarify the idea behind the comment in the policy paper that, at least,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"one SDP will be open in each local authority area on the day of the poll"?
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-15_para10"></a>
If a number of SDPs were made available after ballot papers were sent out, would not confusion be caused if only one was available on polling day?
<P>

<a name="40223-15_para11"></a>The amendment would place an obligation on electoral administrators to make sure that all voters in the pilot elections had "easy access" to a delivery point. That may be a subjective turn of phrase, but it makes the point that electoral administrators have a responsibility to ensure that there are sufficient points. It would then be possible under Clause 4 for the Electoral Commission to examine whether that was the case and if not, why not. That would focus the efforts of the electoral administrators in each local government area to examine properly the convenience of the location of the delivery points&#151;and thereby the convenience for the electorate. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rennard: </B>   My Lords, the supported delivery points are important and will be of assistance to a number of voters. Lack of privacy is among the concerns that we have had about people voting by post. In some cases people might prefer to enjoy the spirit of going along to the polling station and perhaps feeling that they can vote in privacy without other members of the household seeing how they are casting their vote. The problem with the amendment is over how one defines "easy access".
<P>

<a name="40223-15_para12"></a>I have already made my own representations about the order, with some suggestions that may be helpful. Providing one supported delivery point in each council area may not be nearly sufficient. For example, that would mean that if there was a pilot in Manchester there would be only one supported delivery point in the whole city. Perhaps in Newcastle, where we now think that the proposals will happen, the appropriate number of SDPs may be one per local government ward. In a principal local authority the order could say that there should be one special delivery point per local <P>


<a name="column_64"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 64</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>government ward. Beyond that we might leave the decision to the returning officer's discretion, but at least it would provide more guidance on the number of points that would be appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, this is again one of those classic debates that we have, whichever party is in government, about the degree to which one specifies the means as well as the ends. The House will be aware of our broad position on the matter&#151;that a balance has to be struck between ensuring that at least one supported delivery point is provided in each principal local government area and giving discretion to electoral administrators to provide more when they believe that that is sensible and desirable.
<P>

<a name="40223-15_para13"></a>Clearly we are talking about all-postal ballots, not dual running. We are not talking about having both, but at what level we need to have a facility for those who wish physically to cast a vote in person, for any reason, or to vote late on the last day&#151;or for any other reason. It is germane that extremely limited use has been made of supported delivery points in previous pilots. Our evidence from the survey has been that the average was that about 2 per cent of electors used a supported delivery point. The highest case was in Darlington, where 3.7 per cent of electors chose to use the SDP. It is particularly interesting that there has been no correlation between the number of SDPs provided and the number of people who used them, which is slightly counter-intuitive.
<P>

<a name="40223-15_para14"></a>In Guildford, four delivery points were provided in a previous local government pilot postal election and 2.2 per cent of electors chose to use them. By comparison, in Gateshead 16 delivery points were provided, yet the number of electors who chose to use them remained at just 2.2 per cent. In Doncaster, 21 delivery points were used by only 1.93 per cent. That is a variation which shows that while we are right to say that such a facilities must be provided, it is hardly the most persuasive case for the Government to prescribe how many should be set up.
<P>

<a name="40223-15_para15"></a>I shall take on board the issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, concerning point 10.4 of the guidance. I believe that we need to reflect on whether confusion arises as a result of some SDPs being open on the day and some not. I do not wish to raise excitement on that point but, if a local authority has more than one SDP, we may need to reflect on the level of burden involved in keeping it open on the day rather than shutting it beforehand. However, perhaps I may reflect on that matter without giving a commitment.
<P>

<a name="40223-15_para16"></a>At heart, we feel that responsibility for deciding on the level of additional SDPs to be provided should be placed on returning officers. I do not believe that we can easily specify that with a rule from government. Certainly, as I believe I signalled at earlier stages to the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, it would be very burdensome to specify that there should be one for every electoral ward. For those reasons, I hope that, at least for now, the noble Baroness will be minded to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness's hearing was as acute as ever. I referred to the electorate entitled to vote. Therefore, the proportion of those who voted would obviously be higher.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-16_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I believe that that is slightly more significant. If there is a 30 per cent turnout and one or two in 30 voters use the delivery point, that amounts to many more people than I believe was being suggested or than the figure which was sliding under the radar as the Minister was talking.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness is right that it makes a difference but it is not a massive difference. We are talking about 2 per cent of the electorate who use the SDPs and about 4 per cent of those casting votes. Therefore, it makes a difference but we are still talking about very small proportions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-16_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I shall not trade mathematics with the Minister across the Table. However, I calculate that, with a turnout of 30 per cent, about 6 per cent of voters would use the SDPs. I believe that shows that there is probably sufficient demand to ensure more than one SDP in any given local government area.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para0"></a>I also believe that one should be careful about where the supported delivery points are placed. In some areas, people will have to travel a long way to use them. They need to be as local as they can be to a substantial part of the electorate&#151;I say "electorate" and not necessarily those voting.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para1"></a>I shall not push this matter further but I believe that the point must be understood. We must stop using the word "electorate" in terms of these percentages and revert to talking about the percentage of those who vote because that presents an entirely different picture.

<P>

<a name="40223-16_para5"></a>The Minister will be aware that the Electoral Commission sought counsel's opinion on the provision to the parties of a marked register. The advice was that disclosing information in the way intended altered the balance between the party and the elector to the extent that it might constitute an invasion of privacy. The provision may thus amount to a disproportionate infringement of Article 8 and/or Article 3 of Protocol I of the convention.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para6"></a>I appreciate that the Government have taken advice. The noble Lord, Lord Filkin, included some details in his letter to my noble friend Lady Hanham on 6 February. That advice is that postal voting is compatible with the convention. I have no difficulty with that. The issue here is not postal voting but the provision to political parties of a marked register. The issue is specific and independent of the method of voting. Indeed, the opinion provided to the Electoral Commission raises a question about the post-election accessibility of a marked register under the existing arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para7"></a>The nub of the problem can be put very briefly. Under the traditional method of voting&#151;voting in person at a polling booth&#151;a voter can refuse to disclose his or her identity to party tellers standing outside the polling booth. Under the provisions of this clause, the voters have no right to withhold their identity. The information is disclosed by virtue of subsection (4). Electors could, of course, opt to cast a ballot in person at an SDP on polling day, but that does not solve the problem: it will already have been disclosed to the parties that they have not voted.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para8"></a>At Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, suggested that voting is a public act. I appreciate that point. However, as I pointed out in Committee, if postal voting is a public act, then so, too, is voting in person at a polling booth. The rights exercised by voters must be the same in both situations.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para9"></a>There is therefore a problem. I fully appreciate why this provision was introduced. I recognise the convenience to political parties of acquiring such information in fulfilling their vital role in the electoral process. We should be doing what we can to assist political parties as essential actors in the political process. However, doing so in this way may fall foul of the provisions of the convention.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para10"></a>The solution, as the advice given to the Electoral Commission indicates, is either to prohibit access to the marked register before the close of poll or to introduce safeguards. In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, wondered why the register was marked in advance of polling day. I think it would be helpful to know why this practice has been introduced. Prohibiting access would be one solution; not recording who has voted prior to polling day would, of course, ensure that such access was impossible. In terms of safeguards, one option is to provide for an opt-out for those who do not wish to be solicited by political parties.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para11"></a>I tend to go for the clean option, as I did when we discussed the sale of the electoral register to commercial concerns. The noble Lord, Lord Bassam <P>


<a name="column_67"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 67</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of Brighton, may have many recollections of our debates on that topic. I favoured banning its sale. Instead, we ended up with the somewhat messy option of an opt-out. If we are to go down the route of providing polling progress information, I fear we shall end up with another opt-out provision.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para12"></a>However, providing for such an opt-out will be difficult in relation to the June elections. It is too late for electors to indicate an opt-out preference on the electoral registration form. I suppose that it might just be possible to have an opt-out provision for those elections by giving electors the right to inform the electoral registration officer that their names are to be annotated in the register to show that whether or not they have voted is not to be disclosed to the parties, although the annotation would be. That might just meet the point but it would require amendments to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para13"></a>In short, the provision for providing polling progress information is potentially flawed. I believe that the safest course of action, which would not undermine the purpose of the Bill, would be to remove this particular provision. As I say, I appreciate why it was introduced but I think that, having been put in, the wisest course may be to take it out. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rennard: </B>   My Lords, a number of our debates have dwelt on the issue of turnout and have brought up the controversy about whether or not to have more postal voting in order to improve turnout. Here, we are dealing with a measure which may or may not assist political parties in encouraging turnout in the elections. There is something of an irony in that. If we are trying to encourage participation in the democratic process, on balance I feel that the parties must have that information if they are to encourage people to participate and send back their votes.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para14"></a>I note the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, in relation to privacy. However, it seems to me that many people are unaware that the list of those who have voted in a normal public election at a polling station is made available to the parties afterwards. That may not be commonly known, but if that list is available to the parties some time after the election, I do not see why there should be a problem in making available to the parties, before postal voting takes place in a pilot, the list of the people who have voted thus far so that they can chase up those who have not voted.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para15"></a>Compared with information on polling day, the noble Lord, Lord Norton, refers to how people may not choose to give to a party teller at the polling station their voting number or their address. But short of wearing a disguise, many people are actually recognised at the polling station when they go to vote. If they walk into a polling station in the normal election it is known whether they have voted and therefore someone has noted that they have not been so far in the day and they may get a call from the party at a later stage on polling day asking them to vote.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para16"></a>A number of safeguards may be necessary. I am concerned about how we might protect privacy. It seems very important that the parties provided with this information treat it with the same degree of confidentiality as they do the electoral register. Three or four years ago we added safeguards to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act to prevent commercial organisations acquiring the electoral register. A coach and horses would be driven through those provisions if anybody was able to get hold of a list of who has voted by post so far, who has not, and make use of those lists. Safeguards must be built in. It is generally assumed that the parties will not pass this information on: that is a safeguard that voters probably generally need to have.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   My Lords, I should like to add a point to what my noble friend has just said. The marked register in a normal polling station election is not available to political parties. It is available to anybody who wants to avail themselves of that facility. They may be representing political parties on 99 per cent of occasions, but anybody can inspect the marked register and obtain copies of it; not all candidates belong to political parties.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para17"></a>There is a crucial issue of principle here as to whether the act of voting is and should be a private act. I argue that it is not a private act; it should not be a private act, and if it ever became a private act that would be another blow to the integrity of the ballot.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para18"></a>Before the Ballot Act 1872, you had to turn up in person to vote and declare how you were voting. Either you declared it on the hustings or it was written in a register, which was then published. The ballot was not secret. But the second part of the integrity of the ballot, in addition to secrecy, is that the person voting is the person to whom the vote is allocated, who appears on the electoral register and who is entitled to cast that vote. Unless a list is available, at least after the election, of who actually voted, it is impossible to check whether fraud or personation took place, whether somebody tried to rig the election, or whether an individual tried to cast a vote, for whatever reason, which he was not entitled to cast.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para19"></a>All the talk of the Human Rights Act and so on interfering with the process is potentially disastrous. It is absolutely essential once the election has taken place that we can find out who purported to vote. If you cannot do that there is no way you can start making complaints and no way that you can really investigate close elections that might have been rigged in some way.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para20"></a>The issue here is that on a normal polling day, at a polling station, a political party is perfectly entitled to appoint polling agents who are entitled to keep their own marked register while they sit inside the polling station. So the political party itself, or rather the representative of a candidate at the election, is entitled at the close of poll at 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. to walk out with a marked register. What they are not entitled to do&#151;and what is an election offence&#151;is to tell people who has and has not voted during the hours of poll. That is why I am concerned that what is proposed for postal <P>


<a name="column_69"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 69</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>elections and what has happened in some of the postal elections so far is different from the practice in a polling station.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para21"></a>I am not saying which is right or wrong, although we have to think what we will all be doing during those two weeks after the postal votes are posted out and received by people. When I say "what we are all doing", perhaps I am not speaking for everybody in your Lordships' House, but I am certainly speaking for myself and I am sure for some of my noble friends. We will be chasing up those electors whom we believe were voting for us, and whom we believe have not returned their ballot papers. That is what we will spend a fortnight doing. It may be a foolish way to spend a fortnight but the Government want the polling day to be a fortnight and not a day, so what we do normally during the hours of polling on polling day we will do over two weeks&#151;if we get all-postal elections in our areas. It is in that context that this issue has to be looked at.
<P>

<a name="40223-16_para22"></a>On balance the Government are probably right to want to issue a list of who has voted at a particular stage, simply because if they do not a lot of people will be bothered by frantic politicians, not just for two or three hours in the evening of polling day, but for a fortnight, which is not good. There is a real problem here. The Government in the longer term&#151;if all-postal ballots become more frequent and the marked register during the campaign becomes an accepted fact&#151;must look at polling day legislation and see whether the rules on polling day ought to be changed and whether there is any good reason why who has voted during the day on polling day should continue to remain secret.

<P>
<A NAME="40223-17_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I was not going to intervene but this has stirred up my recollection of what the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said earlier. He gave a very graphic description of what would happen if all-postal votes became a generality. He said that there would be a disconnection between the candidates and the electorate. It is one of the reasons why, although we see some of the difficulties, we do think that it is important to have access to the list of people who have voted. It is absolutely clear that that does not mean a description of how they voted&#151;they may have spoilt their ballot paper within the envelope&#151;but the mere fact that they have voted means that candidates can concentrate on those who have not voted.
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para0"></a>It may be that all electors will be thrilled to bits that nobody calls on them ever again&#151;neither rings them up nor has a go at them, but it is not what our system allows for. As long as we have a party political system where candidates are trying to present their manifestos and themselves to the electorate then it seems perfectly proper that there is some way of knowing when and at what time people return their ballot papers, or whether they have returned them at a given stage. I see that the policy paper allows for that&#151;it suggests that the political parties within each area should come to a <P>


<a name="column_70"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 70</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>conclusion with the electoral officer as to how they want that information to be presented. That seems fair and reasonable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, there has been an extremely interesting debate on this amendment. We know why it is an issue. Strong representations were made by political parties in the other place that a marked register should be distributed during the period of the election campaign. That was in part for a party political reason but also for a good reason, that reason being that by so doing it was more likely that more people would be encouraged, assisted and persuaded to vote. The problem for the political parties is the fact that you can lobby and take someone to the polling station, but that does not necessarily mean that they will vote for you as a consequence. Nevertheless, there is a good intent which goes beyond party politics that sits beneath this and since this issue is above all about trying to increase the electorate's participation in elections it is in alignment with that central thrust.
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para1"></a>What is interesting in what the noble Lord, Lord Norton, advanced is the question of ECHR compliance. I want to reflect on that point; I do not want to busk at the Dispatch Box on it. But if it were thought that the right to privacy might be infringed, one could well see that what was given as the advice on all-postal balloting would apply also; in other words, that it was balanced by the wider benefit of increasing the electoral turnover. Perhaps I may reflect on that and send a letter to the noble Lord before Third Reading, with a copy, as usual, to the Opposition Front Benches. Clearly, if we think that it is compliant I shall just set out in the letter why we consider it to be so.
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para2"></a>The second issue raised by the noble Lord is whether, if there is a risk of infringement of privacy, there is a way around that which does not frustrate the legitimate ambition of the political parties to have a marked register. Essentially he asked whether it would be possible to have an opt-out at the time of the register which would replicate that which takes place outside a polling station; that is, when someone is asked "What is your name and have you voted?", for the person to be able to say, "No, I shan't tell you".
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para3"></a>The noble Lord is right that it would be impossible to do that in time for the June election. However, perhaps we should reflect on that without implying that we shall concede the point. I believe that was the nub of the point raised; namely, whether there is a way which does not frustrate the ability of political parties to affect turn-out but which allows an elector to have privacy.For the reasons I have given, apart from promising to send the noble Lord a letter before Third Reading, I do not believe that we should accept the amendment. As stated by the noble Lords, Lord Rennard and Lord Greaves, there is a good reason for the marked register being issued to political parties. I believe that that outweighs the other interests advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Norton. With that explanation, I hope that he will be minded to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Norton of Louth: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may begin by agreeing with the Minister that this has been <P>


<a name="column_71"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 71</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>an interesting albeit short debate which raised relevant points. I shall make three brief points in response. First, the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, is right; at the heart of this matter is the question of getting the balance right. The Minister recognised that in agreeing to reflect on this in the light of the convention. I very much welcome his comments in that regard.
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para4"></a>Secondly, the noble Lords, Lord Rennard and Lord Greaves, raised important issues concerning access to the marked register, including the present arrangements, which take us beyond what is at the heart of my amendment. There is a much wider issue on which we should reflect in respect of that which is independent of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para5"></a>Thirdly, nothing which was said undermines the provision of a safeguard, for example in the form of an opt-out. I appreciate that the Minister cannot make any commitment on that. As he said, in effect one is looking to the future, although I suspect very much that we shall end up at that point. However, I am grateful for what the Minister said and for what he has promised to do. In the light of that I have no hesitation in begging leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40223-17_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we return to the technicalities of postal voting in terms of the role of the Royal Mail. We tabled this amendment in Committee to try to provide an assurance from the Royal Mail that all necessary provisions had been undertaken in relation to all-postal ballots.
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para19"></a>At Second Reading a lot of scepticism was voiced by noble Lords from all sides of the House and in another place about the ability of the Royal Mail to handle an all-postal vote on such a large scale. Subsequently, we have seen the policy paper which I understand was the result of talks between the Royal Mail and the Electoral Commission. I was heartened initially by the amount of detail in the policy paper on the formatting of envelopes containing ballots and how the return process will work with special envelopes, barcodes and postcodes to assist the Royal Mail for easy identification during the sorting process. That helped to alleviate some of my concern over the possibility of ballot papers getting lost in the post.
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para20"></a>However, I still have considerable unease about the contingency plans were there to be a strike or some other disruption to the Royal Mail service. As I understand the policy paper, the process would be to find any electoral post within the system and return that to the electoral administrators and then to seal up post boxes and provide instead ordinary delivery points. It is that second stage on which I wish to probe the Minister. We hear that the returning officers may use their discretion to employ ordinary delivery points (ODPs); that such ODPs must provide a delivery/drop off/ballot box that is securely stored and monitored but without an area to complete ballot papers in private or staff to provide assistance. Moreover, the way in which these ODPs are to be publicised is unclear as are the staffing provisions. Can the Minister shed any more light on those provisions? I am concerned primarily about the vagueness of whether an ODP is to be a delivery or drop-off point or a ballot box. Which is it to be? Also, where will they be located? Will there be the same amount as conventional post-boxes? How will they be advertised?
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para21"></a>I am afraid to say that the contingency plans are not sufficient to assure me at present that the Royal Mail can guarantee delivery of votes in the case of a strike or other disruption. I have just seen the letter which was sent to the Minister by the Royal Mail and I am bound to say that it is about as woolly as I would not have wished. It is not at all clear. It simply states that the Post Office has contingency arrangements and that it will endeavour to try to deliver all the postal ballots to the returning officer.
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para22"></a>Trying and endeavouring to deliver ballot papers simply is not good enough. If people vote&#151;unless they vote late and that is their fault&#151;they expect their ballot papers to be with the returning officer. We all know that from time to time there are localised skirmish strikes. That happens in all kinds of industries. It is crucial that the Royal Mail has a robust provision for dealing with that. I can see that it may not want particularly to say what that is because that would give the hand away. However, we have to move the Royal Mail from a spirit of "endeavour" to a spirit of guarantee. The letter which I saw was completely insufficient in that regard. What is even more salient is that it was originally sent to the <P>


<a name="column_73"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 73</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government in December and could have been made available to us at a far earlier stage so that we could discuss it in detail.
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para23"></a>I remain extremely concerned about the contingency provisions of the Royal Mail to deliver in the face of a crisis. We have amended the Bill to cover two circumstances so we are probably reducing the area of concern and impact. However, this must not go wrong. If the Royal Mail is to do this job, it must be in a position to ensure that every ballot paper posted on time is returned to the returning officer. After all, that is what happens when people put their votes into a ballot box; they are guaranteed to arrive. We should not expect any less from a postal ballot. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to return to this issue which we discussed in Committee. First, one should mark that we are talking about low risk. That does not mean that there is no risk, but we are talking about a low-risk situation of industrial action either nationwide or in some of the returning areas concerned in the June pilot. Clearly, there is currently a risk&#151;it does not happen that often but it is perfectly conceivable&#151;that local authority staff could strike. That, in itself, could cause problems for an election. Such things have happened.
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para24"></a>We have sought to ensure that, for what are low risks, contingency plans are put in place which are as robust as possible. In Grand Committee we passed on a commitment by Adam Crozier, the chief executive of the Royal Mail, to write giving his assurance that robust contingency plans are being put in place for postal arrangements. That letter, as has been signalled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has now been copied, I trust, to the Front Benches.
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para25"></a>This issue is clearly one of credibility for the Royal Mail. One could not have an issue more damaging to its reputation if it fails to deliver the election in these regions. That consequence would be such a contradiction of our democratic process. The Royal Mail is well seized of the importance of fulfilling the expectations. We are confident that it has treated the issue with the level of management and chief executive and chairman attention that one would expect in the situation.
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para26"></a>Local plans will be drawn up for every local authority area. The plans will include the local returning officer, the local Royal Mail management and Royal Mail customer operations managers to address how they would deal with risk in those situations.
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para27"></a>All such plans, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, said, will not be publicised&#151;for reasons I think she respects&#151;but they will be quality assured by the central Royal Mail team to see whether they look robust. There will be a further oversight of the process by a project board, which includes senior DCA and ODPM officials and other senior stakeholders. So I believe that we, the Royal Mail and the returning officers are going a long way to try to ensure that there are very strong contingency plans in the event of industrial action.
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para28"></a>The noble Baroness raised a number of points about ordinary delivery points, on which I may have to write to her. But I would expect that the ordinary delivery points <P>


<a name="column_74"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 74</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would be mostly dropping-off points where one can post one's ballot paper rather than being like SDPs where, in the usual case, one could go and vote. I am sure that that would be the likelihood, but I should like to give the noble Baroness more information on that point and will do so via a letter.
<P>

<a name="40223-17_para29"></a>We have sought, both by the processes that we have put in place prior to Committee and the Bill and by giving a fairly public commitment from the chief executive of Royal Mail about how seriously this issue is being taken, to demonstrate that there is some very serious contingency planning, albeit for a small risk. While I may not have totally satisfied the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, on this issue, I hope that she recognises that it is treated extremely seriously by returning officers and the Royal Mail.

<P>

<a name="40223-18_para5"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"( ) For the purposes of subsection (1) the Electoral Commission must consult the council for every county and district in the region in which the pilot election was held."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40223-18_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: Government Amendment No. 22 is essentially an alternative drafting of Amendment No. 23, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, the noble Earl, Lord Attlee and the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth. It would ensure that, when producing its report, the Electoral Commission had a duty to consult all district or county councils in a pilot region. The discretion with regard to other tiers of local government would remain in place, although this will now be implicit rather than explicitly stated.
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para7"></a>An amendment was tabled in Grand Committee that would have compelled the Electoral Commission to consult all local authorities in a pilot region. That was resisted on the basis that in some areas it would involve consulting perhaps hundreds and hundreds of parish councils. I am sure that that was not the intent behind it. Therefore, we have tabled this amendment <P>

<P>
<A NAME="40223-18_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I merely thank the Minister for the amendment. It takes account almost entirely of the amendment that we moved in Grand Committee and, indeed, that which we have put down today as Amendment No. 23. It is a sensible outcome. Many of the other relevant authorities of course are within the local pilot areas, but I am satisfied that sufficient account will be taken of everyone who has taken part in the pilot to ensure that we get a report that matches up to what we would expect and that gives us an opportunity to see for the future how things have worked. Having said that, I clearly will not take Amendment No. 23 any further because I will not be allowed to.

"( ) making arrangements for the inspection of a sample of ballot papers to ascertain whether there is evidence (even where no allegation has been made to that effect) of personation or other electoral offences or malpractice"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40223-18_para13"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving Amendment No. 25, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 33. We decided to return to this amendment, which we debated during Grand Committee. At that stage we received some positive answers from the Minister, but nothing that we believed was sufficient to set our minds at ease concerning the issues of fraud and malpractice.
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para14"></a>The greater potential for electoral fraud and malpractice which all-postal voting creates is evident to noble Lords. We have conceded that, despite these potential abuses, it is worthwhile trying out a system of all-postal voting in European parliamentary and local government elections.
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para15"></a>However, it would be irresponsible to do so without trying to set out as many safeguards as possible on the face of the Bill and in the pilot order to try to minimise such abuses. That is one issue that the Government are indeed taking seriously. We can see from the policy paper that they have put forward a number of suggestions about how fraud can be countered. These include extending the penalties for personation, providing security at SDPs and in the processing of ballots and so on.
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para16"></a>Our question, however, is how we know whether this is successful in stopping electoral malpractice. What of the coercion, intimidation or selling of votes that we know occasionally happens? What of the shared households where ballot papers could simply <P>


<a name="column_76"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 76</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be scooped up and returned by one person? We need not only to guard against that sort of behaviour, but also to know how prevalent it was in the election.
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para17"></a>Our amendment picks up that point. It focuses on Clause 4&#151;the report that the Electoral Commission draws up on how the pilot went. There are a number of criteria, which explain who must be consulted and what kind of things should be contained in the report. Subsection (3) obliges the local authorities in the region to assist the commission in preparing its report. Subsection (4) explains that this assistance may include asking the electors their views on the administration of the elections. Paragraph (b) refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"reporting to the Commission allegations of personation and of other electoral offences or malpractice".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-18_para18"></a>
Our amendment would insert a further manner of assistance as paragraph (c):
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"making arrangements for the inspection of a sample of ballot papers to ascertain whether there is evidence (even where no allegation has been made to that effect) of personation or other electoral offences or malpractice".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-18_para19"></a><P>

<a name="40223-18_para20"></a>The basis for our amendment is straightforward. We do not think that the local authority should merely report allegations which it has received about personation, but it should be obliged to do spot checks to ascertain whether malpractice has taken place.
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para21"></a>The process should be proactive, not merely a case of reacting to allegations. That is clearly a vital part in collating evidence to see whether the all-postal voting system works on balance. It is designed to encourage voter participation. But if that is at the expense of a far greater increase in malpractice, either more protections need to be put in place or we need to think again about using it as a system for elections.
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para22"></a>Research has to be done into whether the type of electoral malpractice that I mentioned earlier&#151;the bullying, intimidation, vote buying or vote usurpation in houses in multiple occupation&#151;is taking place. Anyone who is a victim of such malpractice is probably unlikely to report it. We need a duty on the local electoral administrators to go out into the community and ask a random sample of those who have voted whether they were party to any malpractice.
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para23"></a>The policy paper which the Government have put out accepts the rationale behind our amendments. Paragraph 14.3 on page 16 mentions further provisions to tackle fraud which, we learn,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may be included within a pilot order or may be provided in the discretion of the RROs".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-18_para24"></a><P>

<a name="40223-18_para25"></a>One of those, paragraph 14.3.4, mentions,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"checks with a sample of people marked as having returned a ballot paper to check that they did send in the papers and were not coerced in the process of completing and returning them".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-18_para26"></a><P>

<a name="40223-18_para27"></a>It appears that the Government can see the sense in our proposed amendment. Many of our concerns are covered by their Amendment No. 34. Our only difference is that we make it an explicit duty of every local authority that co-operates with the Electoral Commission in gathering the evidence on the success or otherwise of the election.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para28"></a>Spot checks or random sampling is the only means by which it is possible to get any representative idea of how common electoral malpractice is, or is not.
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para29"></a>Amendment No. 33 deals with the issue of secrecy. We have had several discussions during the debate today and in Grand Committee on the problems of secrecy in all-postal voting. I will not rehearse them all again now, but will outline where our thinking has got to since our discussions in Grand Committee. As a newcomer to this area of policy, the contribution during Committee of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, was very helpful to me in understanding how important secrecy in the ballot is.
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para30"></a>We know that the Government are taking this issue very seriously. I was gladdened to see several references to secrecy in paragraph 14 of the policy paper. Paragraph 14.3.5 mentions the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"inclusion of secrecy warnings on voting and proxy voting literature".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-18_para31"></a><P>

<a name="40223-18_para32"></a>Paragraph 14.3.7 proposes,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"extending the scope of secrecy rules to cover all postal provisions to require those serving in a delivery place, and those providing assistance, and observers to abide by the secrecy rules".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-18_para33"></a>
We are pleased to see that these are both intended to be mandatory provisions.
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para34"></a>While these proposals on secrecy are a positive step forward, we still believe that there is a need for something more specific in the Bill. We are therefore grateful for the last line of government Amendment No. 34, which will require the Electoral Commission to include in its report an assessment of whether the piloted system undermined,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the secrecy of the ballot".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-18_para35"></a><P>

<a name="40223-18_para36"></a>Given the many ECHR concerns in relation to secrecy which were discussed in Committee and today, it is vital that secrecy is included as a separate point for consideration.
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para37"></a>Liberal Democrat Amendment No. 35 lies within this group. That would require the Electoral Commission to carry out something like a market research exercise after the elections to research whether personation or electoral offences had taken place. It may be necessary because some might feel that such research techniques might contravene the principle of secrecy without legislative authority.
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para38"></a>From the Minister's comments at cols. GC208&#150;09 of Hansard for 29 January, the Government may concede on this amendment now it has been revised since Committee stage.
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para39"></a>We support the amendment entirely. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, may I start by returning the compliment to the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, in saying that while he supports our Amendment No. 35, we equally support his Amendments Nos. 25 and 33.
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para40"></a>It is important that the Electoral Commission should look carefully&#151;and in as much detail as possible&#151;into the question of possible personation and electoral fraud in all-postal voting regions. As we have made clear&#151;particularly my noble friend Lord Greaves&#151;this is potentially a very serious problem indeed. So far, the Electoral Commission has relied to a large extent on the <P>


<a name="column_78"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 78</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>evidence of complaints about fraud in the course of postal voting which have been submitted to the authorities. The Electoral Commission should be more proactive than that, and not only ask electors about their attitudes to the use of postal voting&#151;which they have already done&#151;but ask questions designed to extract their views and knowledge about the incidence of fraud. They also need to take into account any complaints and investigations by the police. It is essential that the Electoral Commission should do that.
<P>

<a name="40223-18_para41"></a>I recognise that the second subsection that is to be introduced by Amendment No.34 goes a long way to meeting the issues raised by Amendment No. 35. I hope that the Government expect and will request the commission to use a sampling by polling a representative group of electors as one of the methods by which they will aim to achieve that objective. I appreciate that they cannot give orders to the Electoral Commission as it is an independent public body.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Norton of Louth: </B>   My Lords, I find merit in every amendment in the grouping.
<P>

<a name="40223-19_para0"></a>I suspect that the Minister will argue that Amendment No. 34 subsumes the other amendments that are being discussed. I see merit in it and welcome its provisions. There is a distinction to be drawn between the government amendment and Amendments Nos. 25 and 35. As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, was indicating, they impose a requirement on the Electoral Commission to be proactive. That was the point developed by the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, in Committee when he moved an amendment to that effect. Today, he has brought forward an amendment that meets points that were raised in Committee, both by myself and by the noble Lord, Lord Evans of Temple Guiting.
<P>

<a name="40223-19_para1"></a>The thrust of Amendment No. 35 is very important in requiring the commission to be proactive, and I welcome the changes that have been made to it. I support them. If the matter is left too much to discretion, there is a danger that not enough work will be undertaken to find out if there has been any fraud or any undermining the secrecy of the ballot. In the context of these pilots that is extraordinarily important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, that is an important issue that we have referred to a number of times, and have come back to several times during our consideration in Grand Committee.
<P>

<a name="40223-19_para2"></a>In Grand Committee I signalled that I was sympathetic to the view that as one moves from smaller-scale piloting to larger-scale&#151;if there were the potential for all other tests to be met&#151;then that issue is of considerable importance. I signalled my sympathy. It is not just a matter of looking at reports of malpractice, as that would, by definition, identify only what had been reported and would not identify malpractices that had taken place, but for whatever malign reason had not been reported because they were not known, or for any other reason.
<P>


<a name="column_79"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 79</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-19_para3"></a>I said that it was important that the Electoral Commission should find an appropriate mechanism for identifying what was happening, as well as what was reported. The Bill does that. It provides that the Electoral Commission must assess the extent to which the pilots affected personation and other offences and malpractices. In order to fulfil its duties without us telling it how to go about its job, the commission will have to collect information from returning officers, local authorities and electors. It will have to talk to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service, without in any way impinging on the responsibilities of the police to investigate malpractice under the Act.
<P>

<a name="40223-19_para4"></a>The issue of spot checks of ballot papers was raised. Such checks do not take place in traditional arrangements, for the important reason that the secrecy of the ballot must be maintained. It is right and proper that documents such as security statements may be inspected, but the ballot papers are sealed after an election and are inspected only on the order of a court, if the court has found that there is good reason to do so.
<P>

<a name="40223-19_para5"></a>As we said in Committee, the Electoral Commission can attend the verification of ballot papers, the counting of votes and proceedings on opening of postal ballot papers. Such provisions will remain in the pilots. In addition, the commission will report on specific issues of fraud, if it identifies causes to do so. The Bill obliges it to assess the extent to which postal voting affects the incidence of personation or other electoral offences. That is exactly what is being requested.
<P>

<a name="40223-19_para6"></a>The commission would not wish to be put in the position of looking at ballot papers after the close of the poll, and I do not think that local authorities would either. Currently, all such investigations are done under the supervision of the court. On a related issue, the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, asked in Grand Committee whether the time for which electoral materials were kept would be extended to match the extension of time for prosecutions under Clause 7. He was right to do so. I can confirm that that is the case and will be provided for in the pilot order.
<P>

<a name="40223-19_para7"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 34 and 38 are a response to Amendment No. 35, tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Rennard and Lord Goodhart, the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. They seek to address some of the concerns expressed during our discussion of Amendment No. 7. As part of a wider assessment of whether pilots increase fraud or other offences, the amendments will ensure that the commission assesses whether electors feel that the pilot was secure from fraud and offered proper security. In that sense, we are looking at the perception of fraud. The amendments specifically allow the commission some discretion about how it proceeds. In 2003, MORI was commissioned. The government amendments will allow that to happen again and allow electors to be asked about their experiences and perceptions of all-postal voting in the pilots.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-19_para8"></a>We tabled Amendment No. 34 after reflecting on what was said in Committee. It has been suggested that the commission should do more than simply consider complaints, and I have signalled my sympathy for that view. However, we should leave details of how it will go about it to the commission. The other part of the amendment is a response to Amendment No. 7. We do not accept the case for Amendment No. 7, but the first part of Amendment No. 34 is on a related issue, and I hope that that will be recognised. The amendment is intended to ensure that the Electoral Commission reports on the number of ballot envelopes received after the close of poll.
<P>

<a name="40223-19_para9"></a>Amendment No. 33, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, would require the commission to report on the extent to which the manner in which the elections were conducted undermined the secrecy of the ballot. As my noble friend Lord Evans of Temple Guiting said in Committee, the commission is already required by Clause 4(6)(c) to report on how the pilots affected the incidence of electoral offences or malpractices. That covers all electoral malpractices and offences. If there are breaches of secrecy even though no offence is committed or if there is no breach of secrecy but there is a perception that postal voting makes it more difficult to vote in privacy, it will be picked up by the opinion polling provided for by Amendments Nos. 34 and 38.
<P>

<a name="40223-19_para10"></a>We think that we have struck the right balance by setting out a clear expectation that not only should the commission investigate reported malpractice or the perception of malpractice but it should also identify the reality of malpractice that might not have come to the surface. We would not want to go any further in telling the commission how to do its job.
<P>

<a name="40223-19_para11"></a>The commission will set up a call centre to receive complaints and will refer to administrators any allegations of fraud. The CPS will provide channels for reporting matters of concern. The list of provisions and options open to administrators is included in the policy paper that was referred to earlier.

<P>
<A NAME="40223-20_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, Amendment No. 56 will withdraw Clause 10 in its entirety. Clause 10 gives details about the laying of the orders before both Houses of Parliament. Noble Lords will forgive me if I am wrong, but I have not noticed that commitment being maintained by any other amendment.
<P>

<a name="40223-20_para31"></a>I appreciate that we are now down to one order, but that order will contain the nuts and bolts of what is being proposed, and it seems inescapable that it must come for affirmative agreement by both Houses. The removal of Clause 10 will remove the possibility of an order coming to the House, or have I missed that somewhere?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-20_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness gave me a Gypsy's warning, if I can use that expression respectfully, that she wanted to make that point. I shall write to her and to the noble Lords, Lord Rennard and Lord Goodhart, but my recollection is that our position is that there is no need for the resolution process that she talks about. The order will be such an administrative and technical one that we cannot see that it will require parliamentary scrutiny. That is part of the reason why we were keen to share the policy paper with the Front Benches. It has helped to inform scrutiny of the Bill, and it gives a clear signal of the direction in which we are moving.
<P>

<a name="40223-20_para32"></a>The hour is late, however, so I shall write to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, setting out our argument. It will not give her an opportunity to come back on it, I realise, but I recollect that we felt that the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>second order had always been of such a technical nature that we could see no issues that required parliamentary scrutiny. I am busking on this, but I do not think that the statutory instrument committee marked it as requiring such scrutiny. That is correct.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-20_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   My Lords, is it not correct that the Delegated Powers Committee took the view that, in that case, it would not insist on a form of parliamentary procedure for the pilots order, not because it was unimportant but because it was assumed at that point that it applied only to two regions of the United Kingdom and only for one election? That order was to cease to have effect after 10 June. I think there is a strong case for using, at any rate, the negative procedure. I am not sure I would go quite as far as the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, in saying that it would be appropriate here to have the affirmative procedure, but perhaps that could be considered at Third Reading.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-20_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is correct that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not think there was a need for parliamentary scrutiny, partly, I think, because the Bill is a one-off event. That is the normal situation. This Bill, despite the effort we have put into it, ceases to have effect after the June elections. It falls away, so what happens subsequently is open.
<P>

<a name="40223-20_para33"></a>Given that point, buttressed by what the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee said, we do not think there is a need for parliamentary scrutiny of these issues. Whether anything like that should happen in the future&#151;whether there should be parliamentary scrutiny of future orders, were there to be further pilot orders&#151;is an issue that will come back to the House. Therefore, I do not think we are at risk in not having parliamentary scrutiny on this.
<P>

<a name="40223-20_para34"></a>I hope that we have demonstrated by the way in which we have taken the Bill forward that there has been a wish to try to share as much as we can with Opposition Front Benches. I will give a commitment that we will seek to continue to do that. Although there will not be a parliamentary process, I will seek to ensure that we try to share information with Opposition Front Benches so that they are aware of what is happening on these issues as we move forward on the electoral pilot. It is not simply an issue of the confidence of Parliament about the Bill; it is also important that political parties understand what is happening on the implementation of the pilots. Therefore, I give that commitment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-20_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hanham: </B>   My Lords, I have a vague recollection of the noble Lord, Lord Evans, waving a pile of papers at us in Committee and asking whether we really wanted to have all this for all the pilot areas. I am bound to say now that I do not, but an example of what the pilot order will look like would be extremely helpful.

<a name="40223-20_para44"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I will seek to keep this relatively succinct. Included in the schedule to the Bill is a provision preventing Westminster by-elections as well as other elections, by-elections and referendums taking place within a window of time around the European parliamentary election in pilot regions. The Bill states that no Westminster by-election is to take place either on the same day as the European parliamentary elections or at any time within three weeks before or after that date. The intention is that undue complexity and confusion is avoided for electoral administrators and the electorate.
<P>

<a name="40223-20_para45"></a>The provision was raised as a concern by the Select Committee on the Constitution in its consideration of the Bill. It stated that it was aware of no direct precedent for the imposition of such restriction which would cause the electorate in the affected constituency to be without a representative in Parliament for longer than would otherwise be the case. This may be perceived as setting a precedent, with constitutional implications.
<P>

<a name="40223-20_para46"></a>The Government tabled an identical amendment to Amendment No. 59 in Committee, but we could not reach unanimity, so it was withdrawn. This amendment would keep the current exclusion, but amend it, so that the excluded period is reduced to just the date of the European parliamentary election. We felt that that took on board the Constitution Committee's clear advice in this respect. The amendment, therefore, still prevents the by-election on the same day as the European parliamentary election and since elections are conventionally held on a Thursday, it would actually prevent by-elections during the entire week surrounding the European election. I hope that that is some, if not sufficient, comfort for the noble Lord, Lord Rennard.
<P>


<a name="column_85"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 85</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-20_para47"></a>The noble Lord argued forcefully in Committee that a longer period was necessary; Amendments Nos. 60 and 61 name a period of two weeks either side. I have set out why we think it is wise to keep the absolute prohibition at a minimum. However, at least for parliamentary by-elections, the relevant party Whip has the power, within limits, to determine when the election is called. One would expect all parties, without there being a statutory prohibition, apart from one day, to be aware of the issues around the election in June. I say no more than that, but what we have said gives a window that is wider than one day. No doubt any Chief Whip of a party so affected would think long and hard about whether it was wise to test the comprehension of electoral administrators and the electorate by bringing them too proximate together.
<P>

<a name="40223-20_para48"></a>I hope we have responded strongly and clearly to what the Select Committee on the Constitution said, while still making a nod in the direction of the proposals of the noble Lord, Lord Rennard. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rennard: </B>   My Lords, I shall also be very succinct, as I was rather less so in Committee. The Minister has been kind enough to reply to various points I made then. He has picked up the point that the timing of the parliamentary by-election lies, by convention, with the Chief Whip of the party whose member has died or resigned. I hope the noble Lord will take note of some of the points I made in Committee about whether a by-election should arise during that time.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para0"></a>I still foresee a degree of chaos in overlapping between a parliamentary by-election and a pilot with all-postal voting. The postal voting regulations will be so different between the two elections that people who might want to vote by post in a parliamentary by-election a week or two before or after the pilots for the European and local elections may be rather confused. I fear they may think they will be sent a postal vote automatically. I think it would be much more satisfactory to have a two-week gap on either side, rather than one week. It is only by convention that our elections are held on a Thursday&#151;elections are occasionally held on a Wednesday or Friday.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para1"></a>I note the Minister's remark that these points should be considered by Chief Whips at the appropriate time. At least we will not have the complete confusion of two elections under two systems on the same day.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Norton of Louth: </B>   My Lords, I rise to add my support, because I attached my name to government Amendment No. 59, and I welcome the fact that the Government have brought it forward. I support fully what the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, said.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para2"></a>As the noble Lord said, the Constitution Committee, in its report on the Bill, drew attention to this provision. The committee did not offer a judgment on the provision. The purpose of the report was to call it to the attention of the House because it raised an <P>


<a name="column_86"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 86</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>important issue of principle affecting a principal part of the constitution. We must be extremely wary about any provision that has the effect of limiting the rights of electors. There is the danger of a range of disparate provisions being introduced over time that have the effect of limiting the capacity of electors to choose a representative. I raised that matter recently in a different context&#151;that of the prohibition of the dual mandate for members of the European Parliament, which constitutes a limitation on the freedom of choice of electors. Any provision that affects the rights of electors must be subject to the most rigorous scrutiny and it must prove not simply desirable or convenient but essential. The case has to be compelling.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para3"></a>I do not think that the case for banning parliamentary by-elections for a number of weeks either side of the June elections is compelling. Holding a parliamentary by-election within a week or so of the elections held by postal ballot may prove, as the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, indicated, an administrative nightmare. It may induce voter fatigue. I appreciate that. That recognition was at the heart of what the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, said in Committee. However, in practice, as is generally recognised&#151;and the Minister has referred to it&#151;the situation is not likely to arise. It would not be the end of the world were it to happen, but the chances of a seat becoming vacant between now and June&#151;in a seat falling within the territory of the European Parliamentary constituencies chosen for postal elections&#151; and the party holding the seat opting for a Thursday just before or after the June elections are slim to say the least, as the Minister said.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para4"></a>However, I would rather run the risk of it happening than set a legislative precedent. I appreciate the point made in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, that there are problems with the existing provisions for holding by-elections. That, though, is an argument for addressing those problems. It is not an argument for retaining this particular provision.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para5"></a>The Government are absolutely right to move this amendment. The Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, put it forward in Grand Committee and I am very pleased that the Government are persisting with it today. It has my full support.

<P>

<a name="40223-21_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, disputes at work are expensive, stressful and disruptive for all parties involved. But everyone agrees that early, constructive discussion can produce solutions before problems escalate and working relationships break down. With that in mind, the Government introduced, in the Employment Act 2002, new measures to improve the handling of individual disciplinary and grievance issues in the workplace. The main aim of those provisions can be simply put. It is to encourage employers and employees to resolve disputes through workplace dialogue, rather than through litigation.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para16"></a>The new procedures are minimum standards. We are, of course, aware that many employers already operate more comprehensive procedures, and it is not our intention to undermine such existing good practice&#151;far from it. The Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service has for many years offered advice and guidance on this matter, in particular through its code of practice on discipline and grievance issues, and that will continue to be of great importance. It is widely respected and followed, but not by all employers. At present, around 800,000 firms have either inadequate procedures in place or no procedures at all, which means up to 7.2 million employees have no clear right to discuss any grievances in the workplace.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para17"></a>Research undertaken by the DTI in 1998 showed that, in more than a third of cases that went to an employment tribunal there had been absolutely no prior discussion of the dispute between the claimant and his or her manager. That is why the introduction of minimum standards is warranted. Employment tribunals should not be the first resort for resolving workplace problems. They should be the last resort, when attempts by the parties to resolve a problem together in the workplace have failed. This House debated the substance of the new procedures, and the principles underlying them, at considerable length during the passage of what is now the 2002 Act, and the Government are convinced that the principles are sound. The regulations before the House today set out the detail of when and how the procedures established in the Act should apply, and it is to those details that I now turn.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para18"></a>The regulations establish that the standard, three step dismissal and disciplinary procedure should be used when an employer contemplates dismissing or taking relevant disciplinary action against an employee. Relevant disciplinary action is defined as <P>


<a name="column_88"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 88</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>action, short of dismissal, which the employer says is based wholly or mainly on the employee's conduct or capability. Suspension on full pay and the giving of warnings&#151;both oral and written&#151;will not count as relevant disciplinary action for these purposes. That is because they are part and parcel of existing workplace procedures to address disciplinary and grievance issues, not the causes of such issues, and can rarely give rise to employment tribunal cases in themselves.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para19"></a>The circumstances in which the modified, two step, dismissal procedure will apply are very narrowly defined. They represent a small subset of gross misconduct dismissals. It is almost always unfair for an employer to dismiss an employee instantly, without first going through some form of procedure or carrying out some form of investigation, even in a case of apparently obvious gross misconduct. That will remain the position. However, tribunals have occasionally found such dismissals to be fair, when they have concluded that prior investigation could not have affected the decision to dismiss. Regulation 3(2) will avoid the new procedures cutting across that in existing case law. However, even in that very small subset of gross misconduct dismissals, the employer will in future have to go through the modified dismissal procedure after the event&#151;otherwise, the dismissal will be automatically unfair, and the employee will receive an enhanced award of compensation. This therefore represents a tightening of the law in relation to gross misconduct dismissals, not a relaxation of it as some might have feared.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para20"></a>The Government recognise that, in certain exceptional circumstances, it would be inappropriate for the parties to have to follow the statutory dismissal and disciplinary procedures. In those circumstances, set out in Regulation 4, the procedures will not apply. I will not go through them one by one, but, in summary, they cover cases when there already exists legal provision for collective dialogue about a particular issue; when the dispute or issue involved is a collective rather than individual one; or when, exceptionally, workplace dialogue may serve no useful purpose.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para21"></a>There are also certain circumstances, specified at Regulation 5, in which the parties will be treated as having complied with the statutory dismissal and disciplinary procedures, even if they have not. These are; first, trade union dismissal cases where the employee presents an interim relief application to an employment tribunal, within the very tight time limit for doing so, before the appeal stage of the applicable statutory procedure has been completed; and, secondly, where there exists a collectively agreed procedure for consideration of dismissal appeals at a level above that of the individual employer, and the employee has availed himself or herself of that procedure.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para22"></a>I turn now to the statutory grievance procedures. The standard three step grievance procedure will generally apply whenever an employee has a grievance about any action by the employer that could form the basis of a tribunal claim under a jurisdiction listed in Schedule 3 or Schedule 4 to the 2002 Act. Failure to initiate the procedure will normally mean that the employee is barred from making such a claim. The modified two step grievance procedure will be reserved <P>


<a name="column_89"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 89</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for a very limited set of circumstances, when the employee's employment has ended and the parties mutually agree that it should be followed, in preference to the standard procedure, in relation to a particular grievance.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para23"></a>There are, again, a number of exceptional circumstances in which the parties will be treated as having complied with the applicable statutory grievance procedure, even if they have not. These are set out at Regulations 7 to 10. Regulation 7 deals with what have been referred to as "overlapping" disputes. On occasion, separate disputes can become intertwined. The guiding principle we have followed is to avoid the parties having to go through unnecessary multiple procedures, or iterations of procedures, in relation to "overlapping" disputes. It may be helpful if I go into this in some depth, as it is a key feature of the regulations.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para24"></a>When the action taken by the employer is dismissal&#151;leaving aside constructive dismissal&#151;the onus will be on the employer to initiate workplace dialogue under the applicable dismissal and disciplinary procedure. The employee will not, in any circumstances, have to initiate separate discussion under a statutory grievance procedure, before he or she can complain about that dismissal to an employment tribunal. Employers should know that it is incumbent upon them to have a fair reason for dismissal, untainted by any unlawful discrimination, if they contemplate such a serious step. Thus only one statutory procedure will apply where the disputed action is dismissal.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para25"></a>If the employer takes action short of dismissal against the employee for reasons other than the employee's conduct or capability, then the employer will not need to follow any dismissal or disciplinary procedure. Such action would not normally be recognised as disciplinary action. The employee will instead have to initiate dialogue under the applicable grievance procedure, if he or she wishes to dispute the action and it could form the substance of an employment tribunal claim. Again, only one statutory procedure will apply.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para26"></a>If the employer takes action short of dismissal against the employee and asserts that it is on the basis of the employee's conduct or capability, the applicable dismissal and disciplinary procedure will have to be followed, as I have previously described. The grievance procedures will not normally apply in such cases. If, however, the employee either considers that the action is unlawfully discriminatory or disputes that it is on grounds of conduct or capability, we believe that it is right, and in line with the principles underlying this legislation, that the employer should be entitled to prior notice of that before the employee can make it the basis of an employment tribunal claim. Otherwise, the issue might not be aired and there might be no opportunity to resolve it through workplace dialogue.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para27"></a>In such circumstances, therefore, the employee will be required to put the grievance in writing to the employer. Provided that is done before the appeal meeting under the disciplinary and grievance <P>


<a name="column_90"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 90</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>procedure, it will be sufficient, as the matter can then be discussed at that meeting. If that meeting has already taken place, however, the full grievance procedure will have to be gone through in relation to the grievance. That is the only circumstance in which two separate statutory procedures will have to be followed, arising out of the same matter.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para28"></a>Regulation 8 allows for the standard grievance procedure not to be completed but to be treated as such in certain circumstances when the employment has ended and the employee has put the grievance in writing to the employer, but it has since become not reasonably practicable for either the employee or the employer to attend a meeting.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para29"></a>Regulation 9 provides for the applicable grievance procedure not to be completed, but to be treated as such, if the substance of the grievance has been raised collectively&#151;that is, by a trade union official or other employee representative acting on behalf of two or more employees. Furthermore, under Regulation 10, if a collectively agreed industry-level grievance procedure exists, there will be no requirement to go through the statutory procedures.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para30"></a>Regulation 11 provides for a number of general circumstances in which the procedures&#151;in this instance, both the dismissal and disciplinary procedures and the grievance procedures&#151;will either not apply at all or, when they have already been commenced, will be treated as having been completed. These are circumstances in which one of the parties reasonably believes that following the procedures would give rise to bullying, violence, harassment and other intimidation. Regulation 11 also covers cases in which it is not practicable for a party to commence a procedure or take a subsequent step within a reasonable period. That might arise, for instance, when one of the parties suffers a long-term illness or is out of the country for a prolonged time.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para31"></a>Regulation 12 makes clear which party is to be held at fault, and in what circumstances, when a statutory procedure is not completed. Regulation 13 makes allowance for the situation in which a meeting under one of the procedures is arranged, but it subsequently becomes not reasonably practicable for one or other of the parties&#151;or the employee's companion, if the right to be accompanied applies&#151;to attend. The employer will be obliged to rearrange a meeting in such circumstances, but only once. In order to allow time for the parties to go through the statutory procedures, without them being cut short by the employee making a tribunal claim simply in order to avoid being out of time, the normal time limits for making tribunal claims are to be extended by three months in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are specified in Regulation 15.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para32"></a>The remainder of the regulations deal with relatively minor and technical matters, and I will not go into them in detail. The regulations will apply to every employer in Great Britain. They are designed to be operable in all different types of organisation, from the largest to the smallest. Particular thought has been <P>


<a name="column_91"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 91</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>given to the special circumstances of small businesses. We know that the smallest firms are least likely to use proper procedures already.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para33"></a>In preparing the regulations, the DTI has carried out full and extensive public consultation. That process began with some six months of informal pre-consultation, including consultation with key organisations that represent employees and employers. A four-month formal public consultation took place between July and October 2003 on draft regulations. Before, during and after that consultation, discussions took place with an advisory group of 19 interested stakeholders established specifically for the purpose. There were also numerous bilateral discussions with stakeholders. In addition, a "roadshow" seminar event was held in various locations around the country to promote engagement in the consultation. Some focus groups were also held with representatives of small firms and others.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para34"></a>That was one of the most thorough and far-reaching consultations to have been conducted by the DTI, and we are satisfied that, having taken account of the many comments and representations received, we have here a set of regulations that will operate effectively. But that is only part of the picture. We recognise that employers and employees need to be aware of the new rights and responsibilities placed upon them. To ensure that they are, over the coming months, the DTI, along with ACAS, will carry out a well targeted publicity campaign aimed at all businesses and their employees, and in particular those in the small business sector.
<P>

<a name="40223-21_para35"></a>A critical element of the campaign will be the provision of user-friendly guidance both for employers and employees. To allow time for that, the Government has laid these regulations before Parliament well before their intended coming into effect date of 1 October 2004. Also coming into effect on that date, to form a coherent package of measures, will be the revised rules of procedure for employment tribunals, revised Employment Appeal Tribunal rules, and a revised ACAS code. Together, that package of measures will, we believe, bring about the biggest improvement in the handling of workplace disputes in decades. I commend the regulations to the House, and beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME="40223-22_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his clear explanation of very complex regulations and for his department's very detailed Explanatory Memorandum. The regulations that we are considering today cover 10 pages, while the Explanatory Memorandum issued by the DTI is 30 pages long. No wonder the DTI, in its paper entitled Dispute Resolution Regulations: Government Response to Public Consultation admitted that they were "not simple, but necessary".
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para0"></a>Indeed, that sentiment has been echoed by a senior partner in a leading firm of solicitors specialising in labour relations. She asked whether they were,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-22_para1"></a>
She went on to comment:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Only time will tell whether they will have any effect on reducing"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-22_para2"></a>
applications to tribunals.
A specialist partner in another firm wrote that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"employers would find the procedures very difficult to negotiate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-22_para3"></a><P>

<a name="40223-22_para4"></a>In the Explanatory Memorandum to which I have just referred, the Government report on the quantified and unquantified costs and benefits. They estimate the one-off implementation costs at between £37 million and £73 million. That gap of £36 million, just 100 per cent up on the lowest part of the range, is wide enough to suggest that they were not too sure and simply came up with a figure.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para5"></a>The annual recurring costs of using the statutory procedures are estimated by the department as being between £35 million and £48 million, without taking into account the time cost of what is described as a "companion" to accompany a claimant.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para6"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment Relations certified in the Explanatory Memorandum that he was satisfied that the benefits justified the costs. The claimed benefits range from "better employment relations" and "lower recruitment costs" on the employers' side to allegedly "improved employment prospects" and "reduced stress" on the employees' side. Let us hope that that is the effect of them.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para7"></a>Ephemeral as the claimed benefits are, the Government claim that they will range from £697 to £922 million a year over the first 10 years. Included in that figure is the number of tribunal applications, which they put at between 74,000 and 75,000 a year&#151;more than 1,400 a week. They arrive at those figures&#151;and I very much hope that your Lordships will be able to follow this&#151;by, in square brackets, multiplying 9.64 per cent by 76 per cent and then by 900,000, then adding 18.06 per cent multiplied by 5 per cent and again by 900,000. I invite those of your Lordships who are better at algebra than I am to review those footnotes on pages 22 and 23 of the Explanatory Memorandum. However, I am sure that someone was scraping the bottom of the barrel in dredging up those figures, because I found them very difficult to follow.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para8"></a>It will not surprise your Lordships to hear that, on the other hand, the costs estimated by the Government are more or less 45 per cent to 50 per cent of the benefits. I shall not comment any more on the figures relating to costs and benefits, except to invite your Lordships to draw on your own experience as to whether the Government's estimates of costs may be generally far too low. Their estimate of benefits may verge on the over-optimistic&#151;but I hope that I am not right.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para9"></a>A major defect in the Employment Act 2000 was the refusal of the Government to accept an amendment that I proposed that an application to an employment tribunal should be accompanied by a deposit against possible costs. In one stroke, this would have deterred <P>


<a name="column_93"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 93</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the launching of frivolous claims without merit or speculative claims in which the employee hopes that the employer will pay out rather than fight.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para10"></a>The Government's own consultation paper admits that the cost to employers of each claim is around £2,000&#151;I note that the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, is smiling as he recalls the debates we had upstairs in Committee. Many employers put the figure considerably higher and that is without taking into account the distraction to management in having to find time to deal with the claim.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para11"></a>Then there is the fact, which is admitted on all sides, including by the Government, that the procedures in these regulations are extremely complex. They contain a number of traps which will lay the unwary employer open to severe penalties by an arbitrary increase in any compensation that the tribunal thinks fit to award of between 10 and 50 per cent. Conversely, an employee would possibly lose the same percentage of compensation for failure to comply with disciplinary or grievance procedures. Problems of precise compliance with the very detailed timetables and procedures will undoubtedly fall heaviest on small businesses whose needs are often ignored.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para12"></a>I quote what the CBI said in its brief on these regulations:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The aim should not be to require all employers to achieve the highest 'best practice' for handling disputes which exist in the more advanced firms. Such standards will not be achievable for all companies, particularly those with minimum resources".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-22_para13"></a>
The regulations do not distinguish between the obligations they impose on a company in the FTSE 100 on the one hand and the corner shop where the employer and the employee work side by side. Employees who do not have the benefit of trade union representation will be disadvantaged in the same way. I can only hope that when deciding whether to inflict penalties for procedural failures on small employers and on unrepresented employees the tribunals will be merciful.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para14"></a>The Government have made an optimistic forecast that their proposals will cut applications by a quarter. This forecast is presumably arrived at by the convoluted calculation that I mentioned to your Lordships a little while ago. Significant costs will undoubtedly fall on small employers. This is acknowledged in the regulatory assessment made in connection with the Employment Act.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para15"></a>This Government have extended employment rights to whole new categories of workers, have shortened qualifying periods before cases can be taken to employment tribunals and have increased the ceiling on compensation payments. At the same time, the newspapers frequently report tribunal decisions that can only be described as bizarre and awards of compensation that are out of all relationship to what is awarded, for example, by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority to persons who have suffered serious physical traumas as distinct from merely injured feelings.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para16"></a>Therefore, it is right that employees will be required to use internal grievance to resolve disputes in the workplace before going to the tribunal. The <P>


<a name="column_94"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 94</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>requirements of the new regulations have been significantly watered down from what the unions and Government Back-Benchers in both Houses were advocating when the Bill was first published and found its way through Parliament. We welcome the fact that in these regulations the Government have decided not to implement Section 30 of the Act, which would have required employers&#151;large, medium and small&#151;to make the new procedures part of the specific contractual terms.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para17"></a>I shall take a moment or two to quote what the CBI said on that point:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"By deciding not to implement Section 30 ensures that businesses have flexibility to change elements of their procedures, for example to keep pace with changes in the business structure, without having to issue contracts of employment every time, a process which would be a huge bureaucratic burden . . .  and it prevents employees circumventing the one-year qualifying period for unfair dismissal claims by instead claiming 'breach of contract' for failure to follow one of these procedures. This would result in an increase in the number of employment tribunal claims, the exact opposite of the Government's intention".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-22_para18"></a><P>

<a name="40223-22_para19"></a>The implication that the laws of the United Kingdom apply to all contracts should be sufficient for anyone. We are also pleased to note that the definition of "relevant disciplinary action" excludes warnings and suspensions on full pay. Otherwise we would find employers dragged through this complicated procedure merely for a severe reprimand on the shop floor or in the office.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para20"></a>The Government have also sensibly, in our opinion, excluded, in Regulation 3, dismissals where collective consultation is already required by redundancy regulations.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para21"></a>Despite the complexity of the regulations, which the Government admit, and the cost to business, which perhaps they do not, in the interests of giving effect to the Employment Act, we shall not oppose the regulations. Indeed, we believe that any measures that help to resolve more disputes in the workplace without the need to go to litigation are truly to be welcomed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for giving a clear exposition of the background to these regulations. Listening to the noble Baroness, and seeing the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, in his place&#151;welcomed, I am sure, by all of us&#151;brought an awful sense of deja vu about the endless discussions we had on the Bill itself.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para22"></a>Before I make one or two comments, I wish to remind the Minister that, as he will remember, we on these Benches were fundamentally in support of the Government's proposals, which was not the case for the Conservative Opposition and not always the case for the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, who was normally coming from a slightly different perspective from that of the noble Baroness.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para23"></a>Having put in that slight admonition, on this occasion I agree with a good deal of what the noble Baroness has said, particularly with regard to the costs. Having studied the numbers in the regulatory assessment in some detail, I have doubts. It may significantly underestimate the costs to employers and significantly overestimate the savings to the taxpayer. As an aside, when we debated a <P>


<a name="column_95"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 95</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>number of these issues in Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, endeavoured to persuade us, and I listened with interest, that the major motivation for the Government with regard to this legislation was to reduce the number of cases going to tribunals and to bring a saving to the taxpayer by fewer tribunal claims. I have no knowledge whether that was the Government's objective; in debate, the Minister denied that it was. I share the noble Baroness's scepticism. I do not think that they will succeed. For reasons that the noble Baroness has indicated, I suspect that the figures on savings from fewer tribunal claims, given in Table 2, on page 19 of the regulatory assessment, are significantly overstated.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para24"></a>The most fundamental reason is set out in paragraph 50 on page 15 of the regulatory assessment&#151;which the Minister has touched on&#151;regarding the position of small businesses. A policy decision has been taken, which I support, that these regulations and the procedures they set out should apply to every company, from the Shell oil company down to the corner shop. I think that that is absolutely right. But I also think there is a danger that the Government will underestimate the impact that it will have on the myriad small businesses which, as indicated in paragraph 50, do not have a specialised personnel function. The type of situation covered by the regulations will often arise only when something peculiar arises in their business such as&#151;the example given in paragraph 50&#151;parental leave following an adoption.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para25"></a>Paragraph 51 states that the DTI,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"recognises the need for user-friendly guidance and standard forms to reduce the implementation costs, particularly for small firms".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-22_para26"></a>
I think the Government will find that although that is an easy sentence to write, it will be a very difficult sentence to implement. Although we listened with interest to the Minister's very clear exposition of the regulations' meaning and implications, I suspect that it will be very difficult and defy even the best brains in the DTI to reduce them to a form that is easily understandable by every small business.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para27"></a>That is going to be a significant challenge for the department. This is really the first time that anything like this has been attempted in this country. I applaud the intent to do so because there is no reason why an employee in a small business should be treated any differently in terms of employment rights from an employee of the Shell oil company. However, it will be a serious challenge to explain business obligations and employee rights to the corner shop owner&#151;I do not know why we are picking on the corner shop owner&#151;or to any other very small business in a way which achieves the effect that the Government seek.
<P>

<a name="40223-22_para28"></a>It may be difficult for the Minister to give a definitive answer to my final question. However, it would be useful if we could know what were the especially difficult areas on which there was significant disagreement among consultees in the consultation exercise. I absolutely accept that these regulations result form an extensive consultation exercise with employers' organisations, representatives of small business and so on. It would be helpful if the Government could indicate the difficult areas. On which issues was there no real agreement <P>


<a name="column_96"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 96</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>among consultees? The Government had to take key decisions on matters such as Section 30, to which the noble Baroness referred. Clearly the consultation exercise led the Government to decide that they were not going to implement Section 30. It would be useful if the Minister could indicate those areas. I am perfectly happy for him to write. It would help if we could have the background to these areas of controversy by the time we reach the implementation phase of the regulations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My Lords, I rise to welcome the regulations and to ask my noble friend the Minister three questions. I preface them by acknowledging that the regulations contain many directions of approach to the complexity and difficulty which arose on the way in which the Bill was drafted, by including improvements that go beyond some of the suggested answers to the difficulties made by Ministers in the rather long Grand Committee and on Report. They are certainly far better than any of the suggestions made by the official Opposition whose industrial relations policy, as we have heard again this evening, goes back to demands to keep workers away from employment tribunals by imposing deposits. That arises not from what they said on the Bill a year or two back, but from their demands of 1983. They do not make much progress, and I congratulate the Government on not listening to such industrial relations chatter.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para0"></a>I also congratulate the Government on insisting that the procedure demanded of employers and employees should apply across the board. They have not given way to pressure from some quarters to allow small employers to continue to be bad employers, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para1"></a>My first of three questions relates to the figures in Annex A on pages 21&#150;23. My question comes not from a failure to understand the algebra, as has been suggested, but it is about the figures themselves in their estimate of the number of employment tribunal applications.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para2"></a>The 2002 Act was predicated on the basis that there had been, and continued to be a dramatic rise in the number of tribunal applications. By the year before, the figure had reached 130,000. My noble friends and I tried to convince the Government that that year was a rather unusual one. It might be thought that there was some merit in that argument as, in the two subsequent years after the 130,000 figure, the number of tribunal applications fell by 25 per cent each year. By the time we reached 2003, employment tribunal applications were down to 98,600.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para3"></a>In that event, is the Minister entirely happy with the calculation that there will be roughly 110,000 employment tribunal applications per year, including 10,000 from new jurisdictions? That is based on the same research that the Government disclosed to us only two days before the Bill was debated on Report, and which they relied on before. Is it the case that the calculations of the number of tribunal applications that will be saved, which they say will be 35,000 to 36,000, is based on a very good assessment of the research, especially as they appear to quote the survey <P>


<a name="column_97"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 97</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on employment tribunal applications of 1998 and onwards, when everyone in their position said that the number of tribunal applications was rising and would rise?
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para4"></a>Leaving aside new jurisdictions, it has been shown that apart from the Act, which is not in force, the number of tribunal applications has fallen. How far have the Government taken account of that fact and the reasons for the fall? I shall not try to explain that now, but plenty of explanation in the debates in Committee and on Report of the Bill appear to have been justified.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para5"></a>My second point is to express surprise that Government statements and explanatory notes omit all reference to a series of issues of which the most important is Section 30 of the Act. The Bill proposed by the deliberate choice of the Government, which we asked about again and again, to make disciplinary and grievance procedures implied terms of every contract of employment in the land. The debate on the Bill took place on that desire&#151;to make the procedures part of the employment contract.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para6"></a>Yet the Government suddenly leapt backwards into the arms of the CBI when they saw the response to their consultative document, and they refused to bring Section 30 into effect at all. The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, perhaps was not wholly fair to the Government because they published in response to the consultation the reasons why they took their sudden new view.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para7"></a>I shall quote only a few words of paragraphs 121 to 123 of the response document in which the Government say that the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"CBI was concerned that making the procedures an implied term would open the door for a large number of breach of contract claims".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-23_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40223-23_para9"></a>We have heard the same argument from the official Opposition. The Government also say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Employment Lawyers Association commented that implementing the implied right would give rise to a number of complex legal issues".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-23_para10"></a>
We had much debate during the passage of the Bill on the complex legal issues that might arise, but the Government never told us that they would not implement Section 30.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para11"></a>The view of the CBI was,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"strongly opposed by the TUC and individual unions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-23_para12"></a>
That is all we are told in terms of the arguments. The Government's conclusion stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government does not intend to commence section 30 of the Employment Act 2002 at this time".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-23_para13"></a>
They go on to say that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Government believes it would be sensible to see how . . .  [the regulations] operate in practice".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-23_para14"></a>
But Section 30 will not operate in practice. Section 30 gave workers the right to say, "These procedures are obligatory and if you, the employer, do not implement them, you are in breach of contract". It gave the employer the right to say to employees, "If you do not implement the procedures, you are in breach of contract". The mere fact that it might give workers a right to sue in the tribunals as well as in the ordinary courts is no reason for completely emasculating and <P>


<a name="column_98"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 98</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>destroying those rights. At the very most the logic of the argument is that those rights should not exist in the tribunals where the one-year period applies. The one-year period does not apply to breach of contract actions in the courts. Why have the Government suddenly destroyed the rights of workers to enforce the obligation to have the procedures properly observed?
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para15"></a>Complex legal issues arise in all parts of the Bill. The only argument mentioned was that of the CBI, which was strongly opposed by the TUC. The Government have given no extra reason at all for not implementing Section 30. My second question is: do they have some new unstated and unknown mysterious reason whose objective is simply to deny the right of workers to enforce the employers' obligations in the courts?
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para16"></a>My third question is a very simple one: what is the meaning of Regulation 3, especially paragraph (2) of Regulation 3? Regulation 3(2) deals with the modified dismissal procedure. That is important for a worker. My noble friend the Minister said&#151;I think that I am right in summarising his words as follows&#151;that the modified procedure, which is scarcely a procedure at all, would apply where the employer could dismiss for misconduct. But with respect to him, Regulation 3 is a little more difficult than that and raises all sorts of issues which, like so many of the other problems, we were told would be clarified in the regulations when we raised them as problems during the passage of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para17"></a>For example, to take one of the many difficulties, the employer is permitted to use the modified procedure when,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the dismissal occurred at the time the employer became aware of the conduct or immediately thereafter".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-23_para18"></a>
We were told almost precisely that during debates on the Bill. The Government then said, "Oh, that will all be clarified in the regulations", like so many other issues. One could make a list of them, but I refer to this one because it is perhaps the most important to the workers concerned; namely, whether they can simply be shoved out on the spot with no procedure&#151;the modified procedure is scarcely worth anything&#151;when,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the dismissal occurred at the time the employer became aware of the conduct or immediately thereafter".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-23_para19"></a>
We do not have greater clarification than we had in the Bill; we do not have greater clarification than we had in the debates.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para20"></a>I give that one example, but in a more general sense is not Regulation 3(2) so uncertain in its terms that it will be very difficult for a worker to challenge the use of the modified procedure by the employer? It is no good saying, "Oh well, that can all go to the tribunal" because what the worker wants to know is whether he can challenge the use of an immediate dismissal or a summary dismissal at which he loses his job, which has not merely employment but also social security implications and results. If my noble friend could say a word about such problems, not forgetting that I <P>


<a name="column_99"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 99</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have paid tribute to some of the improvements that one finds in the regulations, my welcome for the regulations would be even greater than it is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I have listened with interest to all the points that have been made and I am grateful for them. I shall endeavour to respond to as many of them as I can. However, I make the point that these regulations offer a positive way of improving dispute resolution in our workforces. We can all agree that it makes sense to discuss problems at an early stage before they escalate out of control.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para21"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, referred to the complexity of the regulations. Of course, they will apply to all workplaces and to all situations that arise in workplaces. Inevitably, employment disputes can be highly complicated and dealing with them appropriately necessarily requires some complexity. However, the regulations were drafted with input and support from a wide range of stakeholders and the Government have tested them during a lengthy period of consultation to ensure that they meet the needs of a full spectrum of workplaces and employment disputes.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para22"></a>The noble Baroness raised the issue of deposits on costs. A better way to deal with the problem is to get people to talk, rather than to have a system of deposits. In 2001 we consulted on whether tribunals should charge users, and the strong response from the consultees was that charging would deter claims from applicants. The Government accept that position. In spite of what the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, said, in this case it is not our objective simply to reduce tribunal work. On the contrary, we want to improve industrial relations. We believe that an employment relations system is better if people talk early on. It is better for the employer in terms of keeping experienced workers if problems can be sorted out; it is also better for the employee in terms of keeping a job if problems can be sorted out.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para23"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, made the point that the regulations do not distinguish between small companies and large companies. The whole point of the regulations is that we have set a minimum standard, and we have applied them so that they bring in a large number of employees who are not currently protected by adequate dispute resolution procedures in their workplaces. We accept, right from the start, that many companies will quite rightly have more complex and more detailed arrangements. We have not applied those arrangements to all businesses because we believe that that would not be possible or right for small business. I believe that is the right way to approach the matter.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para24"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, challenged the DTI to produce simple material; it is a challenge that we accept and we shall seek to do that. He also asked what were the stakeholder responses to the regulations consultation process. As always, it uncovered a wide range of opinion from key stakeholders. This is an important and challenging area of law. Employer and employee organisations often take very different viewpoints. We have tried to take those on board; for example, the CBI <P>


<a name="column_100"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 100</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has broadly supported the aim behind employment dispute resolution reforms; it felt that the procedure was generally sensible; it thought that the exemptions were appropriate; and said that the changes were timely and broadly acceptable. The TUC welcomed the extension to time limits for grievance cases, as one would expect, and approved of the ability to resolve collective grievances. Small businesses councils generally endorsed the Government's approach in that area. The two major issues, particularly for the TUC, were, first, that we were not implementing the implied contractual right and, secondly, the definition of disciplinary action.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para25"></a>I turn to the three questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn. I thank him for his thanks&#151;they are much appreciated in the light of all the comments he made during the 40 hours of debate. He raised the interesting question of the movement of employment tribunal caseload figures. We always accepted that the figures were particularly high in 2000 and 2001 because of the raised level of cases caused by new European part-time pension rules. The noble Lord was right to say that in 2001&#150;02 the figure went from 130,000 to 112,000, and then down again in 2002&#150;03 to 98,000. But the latest figures look likely to be around 113,000 in 2003&#150;04, so they appear to be increasing again. The main reason that we were concerned was not the peak year of 130,000 cases, but that between 1990 and 2003 the caseload roughly trebled. I return to the point that I made to the noble Lord, Lord Razzall. This is not simply about keeping down tribunal costs but about improving the employment relations system.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para26"></a>The second question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, related to the implied contractual right and why we were not bringing that in. I shall try to make the Government's position clear. These statutory procedures will be a major change for many workplaces. So that their impact is controlled the Government do not at this time intend to commence the provision contained in the Employment Act 2002, which would make the statutory dispute resolution procedures an implied contractual term for all employees. There are those people, of whom I believe the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, is one, who fear that not commencing that provision will emasculate the procedures because there will be no sanction if the employers do not follow the dispute resolution process. Of course that is not the case.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para27"></a>If employers do not follow the procedures and the dispute subsequently escalates to employment tribunal proceedings, they will suffer the adverse consequences provided for in the 2002 Act. In dismissal cases they will face a finding of unfair dismissal. In all cases, if a failure to start or complete a statutory procedure was the employer's fault the tribunal will increase any award by up to 50 per cent if it finds in the employee's favour. It is important to recognise that these statutory procedures will be a major change for the 800,000 or more firms that have inadequate or non-existent procedures in place at the moment. Because of the burden of applying new operating procedures, the Government's view is that it is best to proceed in <P>


<a name="column_101"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 101</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>stages, starting with these regulations, which apply procedures to disputes that involve employment rights.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para28"></a>I should make clear that our approach is not set in stone. The Government are committed after two years to a review of how the procedures operate in practice. If there is evidence to suggest that the procedures have not been universally adopted, then it would be appropriate to consider introducing the implied term, so that the employees can make breach of contract claims if their employer fails to follow the procedures. The decision to proceed in such a way was strongly endorsed by a majority of the respondents during consultations.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para29"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, also had concerns about using the modified dismissal procedure. But, as I explained in my opening remarks, the modified dismissal procedure will apply only in a limited subset of gross misconduct dismissals. Extensive feedback during consultation has helped us to tighten up the drafting of the provision to ensure that we do not create a loophole to allow unscrupulous employers to sack instantaneously. Of course, for the most severe gross misconduct cases, it is surely right that employers retain the right to sack instantly, especially as tribunals can find that to be fair. In those cases, the shortened procedure must be followed after dismissal.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para30"></a>In conclusion, the draft regulations laid before the House today set out a sensible, and I believe valid, way of encouraging dialogue in workplace disputes. They are based on rational, reasonable principles. Employers and employees should discuss problems before acting hastily. I believe that this is an even-handed package which balances rights with responsibilities for both employers and employees. The regulations are practical and workable for even the smallest employers and, above all, they will ensure that up to 7.2 million employees are covered by basic dispute resolution procedures.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para31"></a>I should also say that the regulations have been tested in a very thorough consultation exercise supported by extensive discussions with key stakeholders and 16 weeks of public consultations. Implementation will be supported by an extensive guidance and awareness campaign. We are working with ACAS, the TUC, the CBI, small firm representatives and citizens advice bureaux to ensure that they meet the needs of all end-users.
<P>

<a name="40223-23_para32"></a>On Question, Motion agreed to.

<A NAME="40223-24_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Triesman </B>   rose to move, That the draft regulatory reform order laid before the House on 22 January be approved [6th Report from the Regulatory Reform Committee].
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move the Motion standing in my name on the Order Paper. This regulatory reform order is brought forward under the <P>


<a name="column_102"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 102</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Regulatory Reform Act 2001 jointly by the Department of Trade and Industry and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. It brings together two deregulatory measures, both of which impact on Sunday trading.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para1"></a>The first element of the order deals with amendments to the notification procedures currently required under the Sunday Trading Act 1994. These are matters which fall to the Department of Trade and Industry. By way of background, shop opening hours were regulated by the Shops Act 1950, which consolidated all previous legislation on Sunday trading. However, the law was considered contradictory and was widely ignored.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para2"></a>Following extensive consultation and input from a wide range of interested parties, those problems were addressed in the enactment of the Sunday Trading Act 1994. The result was that, under the provisions of that Act, the opening hours of large shops, defined as those with internal floor areas of more than 280 square metres&#151;for example, larger supermarkets and superstores&#151;are limited to a maximum of six hours' continuous trading on a Sunday within the hours of 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Large shops are also required to give advance notice to the relevant local authority of their planned Sunday opening hours, or any change in those hours, and local authorities are required to maintain a register of those notifications and make it available for inspection by members of the public.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para3"></a>It is worth mentioning that the impetus for this regulatory reform order came from the retail sector and was supported by local authorities. The retail sector suggested that the notification procedures were an unnecessary burden and should be removed by means of a regulatory reform order. Preliminary consultation with local authorities indicated that, in their view, maintaining registers of notification was an unnecessary burden and that they would prefer to focus their resources on other important issues, such as enforcement of the Act.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para4"></a>Subject to approval by Parliament, this order will therefore amend the Sunday Trading Act 1994 in order to remove the burden on large shops to give advance notice&#151;that is, 14 days' notice&#151;of their Sunday opening hours or any change in their opening hours. It will also remove the burden on local authorities to maintain a public register of notifications. The order applies to England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para5"></a>I want to emphasise that the order will not alter the permitted range of hours nor the current maximum of six continuous hours within which a large shop is permitted to open. In addition, large shops will still be required to display their Sunday opening hours conspicuously both within and outside the relevant premises thereby allowing the local authorities to continue to enforce compliance with the Act itself.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para6"></a>The second element of this RRO aims to remove the archaic and unnecessary restriction on the sale of methylated spirits on a Sunday. Noble Lords will wish to note that this matter falls within the responsibility of Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. In short, anyone who sells methylated spirits on a Sunday is currently breaking the law and could be prosecuted for doing so.
<P>


<a name="column_103"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 103</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para7"></a>For background, Section 26 of the Revenue Act 1889 formed part of the control system that applied to licensed retailers of methylated spirits. It was introduced to address a problem of people purchasing and drinking methylated spirits on a day when dutiable alcoholic liquors were not readily available. These days dutiable alcoholic liquor is widely available to purchase on a Sunday.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para8"></a>Subject to the approval of Parliament, this RRO will repeal Section 26 of the Revenue Act 1889 that prohibits the sale of methylated spirits on a Sunday. Section 26 applies throughout the United Kingdom. The order will repeal it for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland the repeal is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para9"></a>There has been extensive consultation on both proposals. On the opening hours proposal a large majority of respondents were in favour of the removal of notification procedures and removal of maintaining a register of notifications.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para10"></a>On the proposal to remove the restriction on the sale of methylated spirits, all respondents who gave a view were in favour of the repeal of Section 26 of the Revenue Act 1889. These proposals have been closely scrutinised by respective parliamentary scrutiny committees and their responses noted.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para11"></a>In your Lordships' House the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform concluded that the proposals remove burdens, within the meaning of the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, and do not create any new burdens. The department also demonstrated to the satisfaction of the committee that the proposals will neither confound any reasonable expectations nor reduce any necessary protection.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para12"></a>I thank members of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform for the time that they spent scrutinising the proposals and for recommending the proposals to the House.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para13"></a>The committee in the other place also concluded that the proposals removed a legal burden and would not remove any necessary protections or any rights or freedoms, which a person might reasonably expect to continue to exercise. The committee unanimously recommended that the order be approved. I commend the order to the House.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para14"></a>Moved, That the draft regulatory reform order laid before the House on 22 January be approved [6th Report from the Regulatory Reform Committee].&#151;(Lord Triesman.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his explanation of these new regulations and for the brief but clear statement by his department. This clarity is essential in view of the sensitivity of the issue of Sunday trading, and the many opponents to it.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para15"></a>Noble Lords will recall the objections that were raised when the Sunday trading laws were drastically revised by the former government, and the dire predictions about the break-up of family life if people were tempted to go shopping rather than to church or <P>


<a name="column_104"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 104</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to stay at home, mowing the lawn, or washing the car, or even watching the omnibus edition of "EastEnders" on the television. The trade union USDAW threatened grave industrial unrest on the part of oppressed shop workers who would be coerced into working on Sundays.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para16"></a>As we now know, Sunday trading has been welcomed, as the noble Lord said, by the vast numbers of the public who vote with their feet by going shopping, often en famille, on Sundays. It is also a help to those who, because of work or other personal commitments, have limited time in which to shop. Shop staff, in turn, are pleased, without coercion, to accept the overtime or time off in lieu that they get for working on Sunday. The fact is that those who object to going shopping on Sunday are not obliged to do so.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para17"></a>It is therefore only right, 10 years on from the passing of the original Act, for the Government to have reviewed how it has been working.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para18"></a>The reform contained in the first proposal of the order is to remove the requirement for the owners of larger shops, who are restricted to six hours of opening on Sundays, to make an announcement to the local authority of what their opening hours will be. In turn, the local authority is currently required solemnly to record those hours.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para19"></a>At present, if a store wants to change its opening hours from, say, 11 am to 5 pm to 10 am to 4 pm, it has to give 14 days' notice. The proposed alteration is to remove that registration requirement on the basis that, after 10 years, it has been found that the shops can be trusted not to cheat. The Government are removing an unnecessary&#151;perhaps "obsolete" or "redundant" would be better words&#151;piece of bureaucracy and the attendant costs on local councils.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para20"></a>The issue of Sunday or Christmas Day trading is, so far as the Conservative Party is concerned, a matter for the conscience and religious beliefs of individual Members of Parliament or Members of your Lordships' House. We shall therefore leave it to our colleagues on these Benches&#151;I am not sure where they are tonight&#151;to respond to this part of the draft order.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para21"></a>The second proposal is to remove the restriction on the sale of methylated spirits on a Sunday. As the noble Lord indicated&#151;he did not use quite these words&#151;this is a relic of the Victorian era when methylated spirits were a symbol of the demon drink. Meths was the crack cocaine of its day. It was cheaper than gin, which in all conscience was cheap enough then, but gin, rum or other spirits were not available on Sundays. Meths was deliberately coloured purple, as distinct from its natural clear colour, supposedly to make it less appetising. But the so-called meths drinkers who used to abound in seedier parts of towns now unfortunately can find the stimulant or oblivion that they seek by other means and elsewhere than in hardware or chemist shops.
<P>

<a name="40223-24_para22"></a>According to Customs & Excise, which was responsible for collecting the licence fee for selling methylated spirits, which has long since been abolished, and for enforcing the 1899 Act which rendered illegal its sale on Sundays, no one can recall <P>


<a name="column_105"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 105</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>when there was last a prosecution. The rule is frequently flouted by smaller shops, whose owners were possibly unaware&#151;I confess I was until I saw the present draft order&#151;that there was any such prohibition. Its continued existence cannot be justified on the grounds that it removed temptation from those who might want to drink it on Sundays. All it does is inconvenience those who want to polish their windows, light barbecues or, in my case, remove those infuriating sticky labels from glass or chinaware. It is one small step on the road to removing unnecessary, redundant and obsolete regulation. But again, as it relates to an aspect of Sunday trading, it is a matter for my noble friends to decide for themselves as individuals whether or not to support it.

<A NAME="40223-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for the way in which she approached this discussion. She is 100 per cent correct in everything she said about the freedoms that people have to shop or, indeed, to work in a shop on a Sunday. All shopworkers in England and Wales except those who are specifically employed to work on Sundays have the right to refuse to work on Sundays and to be <P>


<a name="column_106"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column 106</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>protected against dismissal or detriment. It is correct that those rights are contained in the Employment Rights Act 1996.
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para0"></a>I very much enjoyed the description by the noble Baroness of the great changes that have taken place over the years and the ways in which some things which were thought to be a very great risk have turned out not to be. As someone who does not watch the omnibus edition of "EastEnders" or even, indeed, listen to the omnibus edition of "The Archers" but certainly on occasions goes shopping on Sundays, I know the benefits.
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para1"></a>I share with the noble Baroness some interest in the revelation about methylated spirits and call to mind novels in which people seek out not only methylated spirits but even boot polish and other things which contain alcohol that could be extracted. I note only that progress now means that many drinks tinted purple are regarded as a fashion accoutrement. Methylated spirits plainly now only really panders to the needs of those with Primus stoves.
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para2"></a>I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for that. I am grateful for her contribution to this brief debate.

<a name="40223-25_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: My noble friend Lord Roberts of Conwy is unable to join us in the Grand Committee because of a family bereavement. I shall therefore be speaking to the amendments that stand in the joint names of myself and my noble friend. He hopes to join us later in the proceedings of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para8"></a>Amendment No. 1 is the first of a series of probing amendments intended to clarify various points. It seeks to amend new Section 146A of the Government of Wales Act as inserted by Clause 1 of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para9"></a>The amendment raises the question of the relationship between the Assembly and the Auditor General in the matter of his supervisory functions over public bodies and registered social landlords. The Bill proposes that the Assembly should seek the consent of the Auditor General, which implies a degree of superiority on his part and a power to refuse consent. Is this what is intended? What if the Auditor General were to refuse? The Assembly would at the very least be embarrassed.
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para10"></a>On the other hand, the Assembly could in theory transfer functions that might be inappropriate for the Auditor General to exercise, such as oversight of sponsored bodies. His independence and objectivity have to be safeguarded and so, I concede, there is much to be said for the wording of the Bill.

<a name="40223-25_para12"></a>As to the preparation of reports, the Assembly appears to have the whip hand because, under subsection (3), it may direct the Auditor General to prepare a report on his supervisory functions. That sits oddly with the need to seek his consent to exercise the function in the first place. We do not have a specific amendment on that point, but it illustrates the complexity of the relationship between the Auditor General and the Assembly and I hope that the Minister will be able to illuminate it. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   Given that the noble Baroness said that this is a probing amendment, perhaps I may ask the Minister what lies behind the use of the phrase "with the consent of".
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para13"></a>Before continuing, I should like to be associated with the sympathy expressed towards the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, in his bereavement. I have known the noble Lord for a very long time indeed. I am very sorry and I wish to pass my party's condolences to him and his family.
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para14"></a>I should like the Minister to assert exactly why the phrase "with the consent of" is used. "Consultation with" sounds better but I suspect that there is a reason behind the use of that phraseology.
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para15"></a>My noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford will be leading for my party on the Bill but, unfortunately, a train actually left on time and he is not able to be here at the moment. I am expecting him to be here in about an hour and a quarter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I complete the list of apologies to the Committee, as I am also a poor, sorry substitute for my noble friend Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, who has been struck down by an illness that will keep him away from the House for the next two or three days or so, for which he apologises.
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para16"></a>Obviously, we want to be associated with the condolences to be extended to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts. He is greatly respected in the House, and we all feel for him at this very difficult time and fully understand why he cannot be with us today, although we will miss his contributions.
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para17"></a>I was grateful for the way in which the noble Baroness moved the amendment. I find it extremely difficult to respond in a harsh manner to a proposal defined by her as both egalitarian and fair, so it is with some reluctance that I indicate that it does not quite meet my definition of what is going on in the clause.
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para18"></a>Amendment No. 1 would obviate the need for the National Assembly to seek the consent of the Auditor General before making an order to transfer to, or to make exercisable by, the Auditor General its supervisory functions in respect of a public body or a registered social landlord in Wales. The amendment provides for consultation, but his consent to any exercise would not be required.

<P>

<a name="40223-25_para19"></a>My answer to the noble Baroness and to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, is that the consent of the Auditor General to any exercise of the Assembly's functions is essential. The Office of the Auditor General is a Crown appointment. As the statutory auditor of the National Assembly, it is very important that his independence is not in any way called into question. The Auditor General must be satisfied that, in assuming any such functions, his independence is not compromised. The requirement for his consent in Clause 1 ensures that safeguard.
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para20"></a>What we are talking about is in no way a comment on the legitimate powers of the National Assembly, but recognises that the Auditor General has a separate, distinct and important function in parallel. The clause is phrased as it is, leading me to resist amendment to it, to safeguard that essential independence of the Auditor General.
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para21"></a>A further safeguard is that any order to be made under the clause, either transferring supervisory functions on a "once and for all" basis, or asking the Auditor General to exercise them on the Assembly's behalf, would be subject to scrutiny under the National Assembly's subordinate legislation procedures. The National Assembly would not witness change effected by only the Auditor General without having the capacity to scrutinise and examine it under those procedures. On that basis, I hope that I have assured the noble Baroness that we want the clause to stand as it is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-25_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank both noble Lords for their condolences to my noble friend Lord Roberts of Conwy. I am sure that he will be grateful when he reads that in Hansard. I also thank the Minister for his reply, which we shall need to think about carefully. He did not answer on what would happen if the Auditor General did not agree&#151;on whether the procedure was actually robust in the event of disagreement. I know that my noble friend will want to consider that carefully, but for today I am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40223-25_para24"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 2, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 27, which is grouped with it. The amendment seeks to leave out paragraph (a) of subsection (2) in new Section 146A of the Government of Wales Act 1998 to be inserted by Clause 1. Our amendment is inspired by the loose definition here of a "public body" as one,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"exercising functions of a public nature".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-25_para25"></a>
This could include a private sector company such as a bus or train operator or any number of other companies performing public works as contractors, such as house or road builders, consulting engineers and so forth. Is it intended that the Auditor General for Wales should be able to step in to their affairs? While that might be justifiable were such companies in <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>receipt of substantial public funds, those are caught by the second part of the definition in subsection (2)(b) as being bodies,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"substantially funded from public money".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-25_para26"></a>
We see the broad sense of that and so we have left that part of the subsection.
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para27"></a>However, the phrase "substantially funded" lends itself to a wide range of interpretation, which is the reason why we have tabled Amendment No. 27 to delete the words "or substantially" from the identical definition of public bodies set out in Clause 12. We might have tabled the same amendment for Clause 1, but I hope that the Minister will treat Amendment No. 27 as one also standing proxy for a probing amendment on Clause 1.
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para28"></a>Such wording is difficult to define. What I would call a "substantial contract" might be small fry for a major multinational concern, while a much smaller sum of public money may be the lifeblood of a minor company; that is, the main source of its finances. Can the Minister explain exactly what the Government mean by,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"substantially funded from public money",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-25_para29"></a>
as that definition can drag a private sector body within the public sector audit arrangements? It is important to clarify the point.
<P>

<a name="40223-25_para30"></a>I am aware that the definition of "public body" is consistent with the Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000. That is relatively new legislation and I wonder whether the Minister can say something about how that definition has been applied in practice. For example, what specific bodies have been classified as public bodies for the purposes of that Act and have any issues of definition arisen in practice? If so, how were they resolved? I beg to move.

The noble Baroness has made the point that a private company could be involved in works of a public nature. I am not absolutely certain that that would necessarily be the case and I wonder whether the Minister can give us a more precise definition of what is meant by,

If it will help the Committee, I may look at the possibility of producing a list, although I think that it would be rather extensive. I shall seek to explain why the definition has certain wide-ranging implications and why we think that it meets the requirements, thus satisfying the anxieties expressed by the noble Baroness in moving her amendment.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-26_para1"></a>It may be helpful if I deal first with Amendment No. 27, not least because the purpose of the definition in the context of Clause 12 is to maximise scrutiny and safeguards over the use of public money. I am sure, therefore, that both sides of the Committee are as one in terms of the broad objectives. However, Amendment No. 27 would undermine that intention. The amendment deals with the definition of "public body" in the context of enabling the National Assembly for Wales to amend by order the categories of bodies defined as local government bodies in Wales to take account of future circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40223-26_para2"></a>As the noble Baroness indicated, the definition in Clause 12 is consistent with that used in Clause 1 and with the Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000. In this case, the amendment to the definition would mean that a category of local government body wholly funded by public money could be added to Clause 12(1), but a category of a body with anything less than 100 per cent of its funding from the public purse would not. That cannot be the intention behind the amendment. It certainly is not one that we would be prepared to countenance. For example, a body that provides specialist services to local government in Wales for a fee would be in that category.
<P>

<a name="40223-26_para3"></a>We are anxious about the amendments as restricting the proper scrutiny of public money. Amendment No. 2 would limit the Assembly's ability to transfer supervisory functions to the Auditor General or to have him exercise such functions on the Assembly's behalf. The effect would be that the Assembly could not exercise the power in respect of a body that exercises functions of a public nature but is not entirely or substantially funded from public money. I am sure that all Members of the Committee recognise that the scope needs to extend wider than those bodies that receive 100 per cent of their funding from the public purse.
<P>

<a name="40223-26_para4"></a>A body exercising functions of a public nature may not be entirely funded from public money; nor need it necessarily be construed as being substantially funded from public money. It may earn income from fees and charges. If it is a regulatory body, it may derive a substantial proportion of its income from inspection or from registration fees. I cannot give a list, but I can give an example. The General Teaching Council for Wales potentially is an example of such a body that receives a great deal of resources. It is definitively a public body exercising functions on behalf of the public good, yet it does not earn its income directly from public money.
<P>

<a name="40223-26_para5"></a>The reasons for the Assembly wishing to transfer its supervisory functions may be valid irrespective of the level of public funding that a body receives. The definition of a "public body" in the clause&#151;on which I was questioned closely&#151;is consistent with the Government Resource and Accounts Act 2000. If there is any doubt whether such a body fell within the second part of the definition of "public body" in Clause 1(2) because of the level of public funding that it receives, it still would be covered by the first head of the definition.

<a name="40223-26_para6"></a>I am making the obvious presumption that we all seek proper public scrutiny of public resources, while recognising that the bodies that may fall within the remit could fall considerably short of 100 per cent public funding.

<A NAME="40223-26_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, for his contribution. I am particularly grateful for the explanation in relation to exercising functions of a public nature. That certainly explains why that should be included, despite not meeting the requirement set out in paragraph (b), which relates to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a body entirely or substantially funded from public money".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-26_para7"></a><P>

<a name="40223-26_para8"></a>I confess that I am still concerned about what private-sector bodies might be drawn into the net under paragraph (b) as being substantially funded from public money. Small organisations that contract with the public sector could be funded substantially through commercial contracts. There is no exemption for commercial contracts. If bodies are substantially funded, they could fall within those public audit arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40223-26_para9"></a>I share the noble Lord's desire to ensure that there is proper audit of public money. But there does not appear to be any concept that there could be a commercial relationship which could intervene. Most probably, small and medium sized enterprises&#151;the very bodies most burdened by regulation in our economy&#151;could be dragged within the provision. Has the Minister any thoughts on that aspect?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I have probably covered as much ground as I can at this stage. I understand the point that the noble Baroness makes. We shall look closely at all the points made today, against the background that this is a preliminary stage of the Bill. The important question is whether the National Assembly for Wales has supervisory functions in respect of such bodies. If it has not, the clause would not bite. Where the Assembly has a supervisory function, even if the body in question does not receive a massive percentage of its resources through public funding, the clause would be relevant. That is the basis of our provision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-26_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I shall not press the point much further as the Minister has said that he will think about it. The definition of "supervisory functions" in Clause 1 is very wide and includes,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"functions of examining, inspecting, reviewing or studying the financial or other management of the public body".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-26_para10"></a>
Under the wording, it is still possible that there would be some concerns.
<P>

<a name="40223-26_para11"></a>One of the questions that I put to the Minister&#151;I forgive him for not being able to answer it&#151;is whether there had been definitional difficulties or issues arising under the Government Resource and Accounts Act 2000. I would be interested to know whether the <P>

If we can throw light on the issue as being the result of an Act that, as she has identified, has been on the statute book for only four short years, we will write to her and to the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-26_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I am perfectly satisfied with the Minister's explanation of a supervisory function. I am obviously interested in knowing whether previous Acts of Parliament are complied with. We will be interested to hear the Minister's reply on that.

from subsection (1) of new Section 96B of the Government of Wales Act 1998, inserted by Clause 2.
<P>

<a name="40223-26_para18"></a>We are dealing here with the certifying of grant claims, accounts and returns either by bodies audited by the Auditor General for Wales or local authorities in Wales. Most of the time, those claims will result in money being paid by the Assembly to various bodies. The question is whether certification should in any sense be optional, as the current drafting implies. Certification is a very important process and should be an integral part of the Auditor General's duty. It should not be left to a relevant body to request the Auditor General to certify. He should have a positive and proactive role.
<P>

<a name="40223-26_para19"></a>If the Auditor General does not certify, who else will do it? Are bodies to be left to shop around for certification of their claims? That represents a lax approach and could easily lead to duplication of effort and perhaps anomalies.

The fact that he <P>


<a name="column_GC8"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC8</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would be required to perform the functions irrespective of his wider audit relationship with a body could result in him undertaking such work in a complete vacuum&#151;which, the noble Baroness will recognise, would be a most unfortunate circumstance&#151;without any background knowledge of what he is meant to certify, for whom and why.
<P>

<a name="40223-27_para0"></a>The intention of the provision in Clause 2, which inserts a new Section 96B into the Government of Wales Act, is to clarify the fact that the Auditor General is required, upon request, to make arrangements for the certification of claims, returns or accounts relating to public bodies for which he does have statutory responsibilities. These would of course include local government bodies. Claims in respect of European Community grant schemes would be an example of such certification work.
<P>

<a name="40223-27_para1"></a>Under the Audit Commission Act 1998 the bodies to which the noble Baroness referred have the ability to shop around and are not required to go to the Audit Commission.

<A NAME="40223-27_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. I am slightly puzzled in regard to claims being made by bodies for which the Auditor General is not responsible. The "relevant bodies" are those whose accounts he audits and local government bodies, for which he is responsible for appointing the auditor. So we are talking about claims made by bodies within the envelope, as I understand it, of the audit arrangements in Wales.
<P>

<a name="40223-27_para3"></a>I am not clear about the first point raised by the Minister. I find it rather mystifying and worrying that in England, and now in Wales, bodies can "shop around" for those who would give opinions on grant certificates; that they do not have to go to a person who knows about the body making the claim. Our fundamental approach to the clause is that the right person to "sign off" such claims, accounts, terms and so on should be someone who knows the bodies&#151;that is, either the Auditor General or, if the drafting is improved, auditors appointed by him in relation to local authorities. Shopping around is a most undesirable practice.

<P>

<a name="40223-27_para8"></a>Subsection (3) allows the Auditor General for Wales to make arrangements with the three kinds of organisations set out in the subsection&#151;namely, a "relevant authority", which is defined in subsection (5) as a government department, local authority or holder of a public office; a "qualified auditor", who is someone who can audit a local authority under the terms of Clause 14; or an "accountancy body", which is also defined and includes bodies such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, of which, I remind the Committee, I am a member and former president.
<P>

<a name="40223-27_para9"></a>The Explanatory Notes go some way to explaining this subsection as they give examples of how and why the Auditor General might want to make arrangements with, for example, the Assembly Social Services Inspectorate. The notes do not explain why specific legislative cover is required. I could not see similar provisions in the legislation covering the Audit Commission or the Comptroller and Auditor General. Why is the position in Wales different?
<P>

<a name="40223-27_para10"></a>The notes do not help at all with what kind of arrangements might be made with qualified auditors or accountancy bodies. What kinds of arrangements would be made and for what purpose? Will the Minister also say why the Auditor General needs to make arrangements with local authority auditors who are appointed by him under Clause 14? What are these arrangements? Will the Minister say what kinds of things they might be involved with? Are similar powers contained in legislation governing the Audit Commission or the Comptroller and Auditor General? I could not see from a brief scan that there were equivalent provisions.
<P>

<a name="40223-27_para11"></a>Will the Minister say which accountancy bodies the Assembly intends to approve under paragraph (b) of the definition of "accountancy body" in subsection (5)? This refers to European Union bodies of accountants and I would be fascinated to discover what kinds of European bodies might conceivably be relevant to the work of the Auditor General and his work in Wales, given the different context of public sector audit in Europe. I can just about understand the Auditor General needing to make arrangements with supreme audit institutions in Europe, but the clause does not seem to have a power to that effect. I am clearly nothing like imaginative enough to see what accountancy bodies in Europe would be relevant. I beg to move.

Obviously, one needs a bit of flexibility, but the issue of auditing of public funds is important as far as the administration of the dispersal of public funds is concerned. There should be no loophole in the Bill if at all possible&#151;not that I am saying that if there were that it would be improperly used. I would like an assurance from the Minister that subsection (3) is necessary, and if so, the reason why.

<A NAME="40223-27_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   Highly qualified noble Lords on the other side of the Committee have been discounting their accountancy qualifications. I am one of those few people who get into trouble with the tax authorities by overpaying them from year to year. My accountancy skills are clearly absolutely rudimentary, and it is not because of them that I am in my place at present.
<P>

<a name="40223-27_para16"></a>I assure noble Lords that we are concerned about Amendment No. 4. I will come on to the issue of detail in a moment. If the amendment were pressed, it could prevent or hinder the Auditor General from making arrangements with other regulatory and audit bodies for co-operation and mutual assistance that would be mutually beneficial to the exercise of their respective functions. It could also hamper his ability to participate in joint working and co-operation.
<P>

<a name="40223-27_para17"></a>The desirability of wide powers of co-operation was endorsed by the pre-legislative scrutiny committee during our consultation on this Bill, particularly by the Welsh Affairs Select Committee. A key principle of the Bill is to ensure that there is greater collaborative working through joint review work and strategic forward planning between audit and regulatory bodies, including bodies from elsewhere in the UK, such as Audit Scotland, and bodies from outside the UK.
<P>

<a name="40223-27_para18"></a>Increased collaborative working would also reduce the administrative burdens on client organisations. The Auditor General may well by virtue of his office have implied power to enter into arrangements, but without this specific provision, each of the categories of bodies referred to would have to consider whether its powers were sufficiently wide to enable it to enter <P>


<a name="column_GC11"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC11</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>into such an arrangement. That is the point of the inquiry by the noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth. The key objective of the clause is to make clear the powers of all prospective parties to enter such arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40223-27_para19"></a>The purpose of the proposed new Section 96C is to put beyond doubt that all prospective parties to the arrangement have the legal power to enter into the arrangement. Some bodies, for example statutory bodies, will have only expressed legislative powers, or those that can reasonably and properly be implied. We want to ensure that it is clear beyond all doubt that such persons or bodies will have the power to enter into such arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40223-27_para20"></a>The noble Baroness also asked what bodies the Assembly might approve under subsection (5)(b). The most major UK body of public accountants, CIPFA, would currently need such approval. Many local government auditors&#151;currently appointed by the Audit Commission&#151;are, as the noble Baroness will know, drawn from CIPFA. The kind of arrangements that the Auditor General for Wales might enter into with an EU accountancy body are joint organisation of conferences, or training or secondment of staff.
<P>

<a name="40223-27_para21"></a>There are reasons why we need the provisions in the clause for the supervision of public funds. I ask the noble Baroness to recognise that there would be a significant limitation on the Auditor General if the amendment were pressed.

<P>
<A NAME="40223-28_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth, for his contribution and the Minister for his reply, which in some measure explains what subsection (3) is about&#151;in particular, ensuring that all those mentioned can enter into such arrangements. It is curious that arrangements have been entered into for many years, certainly involving the Comptroller and Auditor General, about which I know a little, without any such formal power. I am fairly sure that the Audit Commission too has been entering such arrangements. We tabled the amendment because it looked like such an unusual provision to include in legislation.
<P>

<a name="40223-28_para0"></a>That also raises the question of what happens to the bodies that are not named here. The implication is that the Auditor General can enter into arrangements only under either subsection (1) or subsection (3). Many bodies are not covered by those subsections. I mentioned a supreme audit institution, the equivalent of the Comptroller and Auditor General or the National Audit Office, in France or Germany. That would not be covered, and therefore it would be improper for the Auditor General for Wales to enter into any such arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40223-28_para1"></a>One problem with trying to write things down is that one therefore ends up with the problem of what is not written down. I would like to think about the Minister's reply in a little more detail. At one level, it seemed to explain why the subsection is needed, but <P>


<a name="column_GC12"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>that raised a lot of other questions in my mind. I would like to think about it further. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40223-28_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes </B>   moved Amendment No. 5:
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-28_para3"></a><P>

"( ) Arrangements may not be made under subsection (1) or (3) unless the Auditor General for Wales has satisfied himself that the independence of any audits carried out by him or by a person appointed by him is not impaired by the arrangements."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40223-28_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: We stay with this clause and come to the issue of the independence of the Auditor General for Wales, to which the noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth, referred in his comments on the previous amendment. Amendment No. 5 inserts a new subsection into new Section 96C of the Government of Wales Act 1998 inserted by Clause 2. This new subsection states that arrangements that the Auditor General for Wales makes with the various bodies and for the various purposes in subsections (1) to (3) must not impair the independence of the Auditor General. At present, the Auditor General for Wales is prohibited by Section 92 of the Government of Wales Act 1998 from entering into any arrangements for the Assembly that involve the Auditor General or the Assembly carrying out each other's functions or providing each other with administrative or similar services.
<P>

<a name="40223-28_para5"></a>Clause 9 removes that prohibition, and instead creates the wide-ranging powers in new Section 96C, which will allow the Auditor General to work in and for any of the bodies for which he will have responsibility for auditing under the Bill. Without further restriction, that raises some issues regarding the independence of the Auditor General. We debated that at Second Reading, and I explained that auditor independence, whether of public or private sector auditors, can be impaired by the provision of non-audit services or by having to audit one's own work. That is allowed under new Section 96C. The Committee may well be aware that auditor independence is one of the hottest issues in the private sector. We must be sure that we achieve the highest standards in the public sector.
<P>

<a name="40223-28_para6"></a>At Second Reading, the Minister said that it will be for the Auditor General to ensure that no conflict of interest arises. The Minister then said,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is not necessary to limit Clause 2 to situations that would not give rise to conflicts of interest, as that may be too restrictive".&#151;[Official Report, 9/12/03; col. 729.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-28_para7"></a>
I profoundly disagree. We must preserve the integrity of public audit, and we must ensure that auditor independence is not impaired. I do not express this in terms of conflict of interest, because a genuine conflict is most unlikely. I use the more neutral term, "impairment of independence". That means not only actual impairment, but perceived impairment, because perception is just as important as fact when dealing with the independence of an auditor.
<P>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC13</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-28_para8"></a>I should be surprised if there was anything between me and the Auditor General for Wales on the issue of independence. I do not believe that he or any of his successors would voluntarily impair their independence. The Explanatory Notes to Clause 9 mention protocols to ensure that no conflict of interest arises. My solution is to place in the Bill a clear obligation on the Auditor General to satisfy himself that the arrangements entered into&#151;I am not trying to prohibit such arrangements&#151;do not impair independence. Protocols could then follow, and would be sensible, but they would be firmly rooted in a clear statutory requirement.
<P>

<a name="40223-28_para9"></a>The Bill marks a considerable shift from the Government of Wales Act 1998, with its blanket prohibition on working for the Assembly, and moves virtually to a free for all. We do not oppose the basic liberalisation implicit in new Section 96C, as that is likely to provide healthy flexibility for the Auditor General. We believe that it is unwise to move without a clear and explicit reference to the crucial issue of audit independence. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I have already made a point about independence. I am pleased that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said that there is a need for flexibility to be spelt out. Given that we are creating an Auditor General for Wales in one body, I wonder whether the need to specify in new Section 96C(3) various professionals who can assist&#151;such as a qualified auditor or an accountancy body&#151;is affected by possible restrictions of finance. I do not know, but I know that it is common practice in Wales for professionally qualified people to work together, often because of lack of resources. I would like the Minister to comment on that.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I am grateful to both noble Lords for their contributions to the amendment. I am grateful in particular to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, because he has expressed certain reservations which we share. We do not believe that a statutory duty is necessary to ensure that the Auditor General upholds the highest standards of independence. After all, the amendment would place the Auditor General under a statutory duty to satisfy himself that his independence in conducting audits is not impaired as a result of him entering into co-operative arrangements, including co-operative arrangements with the National Assembly provided for in the clause.
<P>

<a name="40223-28_para10"></a>The Auditor General of course abides by the Auditing Practices Board guidance on standards of independence. Objectivity and independence are two of the key ethical principles that govern auditors' professional responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="40223-28_para11"></a>My understanding is that the board is in discussion with the national audit agencies, which include the Auditor General for Wales and his staff, on the adoption of ethical standards that the board proposes to introduce later this year. The likelihood is that the standards will be adopted and will apply to all auditors practising in the public sector as well as the private <P>


<a name="column_GC14"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC14</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sector. Agreement is a matter for the audit agencies and the board, but we are of the view that it is wholly appropriate for common standards to apply across the audit profession and would welcome agreement on this. I am confident that agreement can be reached, particularly given the Auditor General's adherence to existing Auditing Practices Board guidance.
<P>

<a name="40223-28_para12"></a>The Auditor General also has in place local protocols that ensure independence and guard against conflict of interest. For instance, in the case of a secondment of National Audit Office staff at a client organisation, the member of staff will, upon return to the NAO, not perform any audit functions in respect of that body for a period of three years. It will be open to the Auditor General to consider existing arrangements and strengthen them if he considers it necessary.
<P>

<a name="40223-28_para13"></a>The noble Baroness argued persuasively that these protocols could be developed subsequent to the statutory provision and within that framework. However, we believe that all desirable public safeguards will be achieved through this process and we do not believe that this statutory duty is necessary. For that reason, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-28_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, for his support for the concept. I also thank the Minister for his reply, which was not a surprise. I reiterate that I tabled the amendment because of a change in the law. Having moved from a restrictive position to something which would have allowed activities that would open up the possibility of impaired independence, I considered that we needed something else.
<P>

<a name="40223-28_para14"></a>If it were beyond peradventure that the Auditor General for Wales was subject to a clearly defined body of ethical principles, the concerns might be allayed, but that is not the case. The Auditing Practices Board&#151;these bodies change their names over time&#151;does not automatically cover a body such as the Auditor General for Wales or the related audit office. The Auditing Practices Board applies to certain qualified accounting bodies and does not apply directly to national public audit bodies.
<P>

<a name="40223-28_para15"></a>I understand that the Government do not believe there should be a statutory duty, but as that duty would result only in what would be the outcome in any event, I cannot see what harm the amendment would do. Indeed, I believe that it would strengthen the hand of those who believe in high-quality public audit&#151;that includes the Auditor General for Wales&#151;to have firm protocols and guidelines linked to those which exist for private sector audit activities.
<P>

<a name="40223-28_para16"></a>I will leave the matter for the time being, saying that I was disappointed in the Minister's response. It is an area where it looks as though there is one rule for the private sector and one rule for the public sector. We should be proclaiming loudly and clearly that the core of our arrangements to public audit is that impaired independence is not acceptable. We should not leave the matter to arrangements which may or may not <P>

<A NAME="40223-29_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes </B>   moved Amendment No. 6:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 4, leave out lines 29 and 30.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-29_para0"></a><P>

<a name="40223-29_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 6, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 15, which is similar. Amendment No. 6 amends the new Section 145A of the Government of Wales Act inserted by Clause 3 of the Bill. It deletes subsection (3), which disbars the Auditor General from questioning the merits of the policy objectives of a body when he carries out a value-for-money study. Amendment No. 15 deals with similar value-for-money audits of registered social landlords in Clause 5.
<P>

<a name="40223-29_para2"></a>I may be mistaken, but I could find no similar reference in Clause 41 in relation to the Auditor General's value-for-money studies in local government. Perhaps the Minister could explain that when he replies.
<P>

<a name="40223-29_para3"></a>Let me be clear that, from a governmental standpoint, we understand why the Auditor General should not be entitled to question the merits of policy objectives. Nevertheless, in practice, it is difficult to see how he can avoid a comment, possibly oblique, if in the course of his study he discovers that a body's objectives are contributing to inefficiency or ineffectiveness. It is the ineffectiveness or inefficiency that he is reporting which he thinks should be removed.
<P>

<a name="40223-29_para4"></a>A good example, although perhaps controversial, is the way in which targets in the NHS have led to problems of effectiveness and probably also problems of efficiency and economy. Not questioning the targets policy would be inconceivable.
<P>

<a name="40223-29_para5"></a>The phrasing of subsection (3) discourages but does not totally prohibit the Auditor General from making such comments. That is my reading of it and I hope that the Minister will confirm that my understanding is correct. If not, the removal of the subsection would be desirable not only in Clause 3 but also in Clauses 4 and 5. I mention that as we have not tabled an amendment to Clause 4, but I hope that the Minister will take the amendment in spirit if not in fact.
<P>

<a name="40223-29_para6"></a>My noble friend Lord Roberts tells me that a number of service areas in Wales would benefit greatly from studies to improve their value for money. I am sorry he is not here to give us his private hit list. We are anxious that the Auditor General is not handicapped in doing his work and is not unduly constrained by policy considerations. Our view is that if the implementation of a policy leads to defects being <P>


<a name="column_GC16"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC16</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>picked up in a value-for-money audit, the policy may itself be faulty and if that is the case, the sooner it is realised the better. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   I shall comment briefly on the amendment. There is a clear balancing line between two separate objectives. Surely, one would not wish to see the Auditor General having an onslaught on policy objectives. His objectives must be those of financial propriety. That may impinge or not on the outcome of policy objectives. It is important that he is objective about that and he should look at the financial issues involved.
<P>

<a name="40223-29_para7"></a>Subsection (4) could be misinterpreted. However, if the Minister can convince me that there is a sharp differential between the two, and that there is no free-for-all in the policy objectives resulting in enormous financial liabilities, the consequences of which the Auditor General must pick up, that is an important distinction. It ought to be a situation in which the Auditor General acts from a financial objective in controlling the excesses of policy objectives. He does not have to question them outright, but nevertheless he picks up the bill at the end and perhaps charges a bill, too.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   I declare an interest as Presiding Officer of the National Assembly for Wales. I assure the Committee that I do not intend to intervene frequently in Committee; I apologise for not having been present for Second Reading. However, an aspect of the amendment concerns me. That is the relationship that has developed&#151;in my view, very successfully&#151;between the Office of the Auditor General for Wales and the Audit Committee of the National Assembly. The Audit Committee is itself precluded by standing order&#151;of course, we could amend our standing orders by two-thirds majority&#151;from scrutinising policy implications in its reports. That fits with the role of Auditor General.
<P>

<a name="40223-29_para8"></a>There have been several cases, into which I shall not go this afternoon, where various criticism of government or Assembly-sponsored public bodies has been made. I have been impressed by the way in which both the Audit Committee and the Auditor General and his staff in Wales in their reports and Ministers, their advisers and other political actors have been able to skate along that thin ice or thin line to which the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, referred. I would not want us to do anything at this stage of the transition of responsibilities to create any difficulty for the Audit Committee of the Assembly in its relationship with the Auditor General. I therefore wish the amendment to be withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   One thing that I shall not try to do is to skate along a thin line&#151;thin ice is difficult enough, but a thin line would be well beyond my capacity. However, I agree that the issue of where the line is drawn between issues of policy and proper supervisory control is crucial. Of course the Auditor General can question the effects of a policy objective&#151;I cannot see how he could carry out his job of scrutiny unless that did not occur from time to time. What he <P>


<a name="column_GC17"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC17</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cannot do is question the merits of the policy objective, because that would be to stray from his proper role into that which we would all jealously guard of those who are accountable in another sense to the public for the merits of policy as it is developed and designed.
<P>

<a name="40223-29_para9"></a>The amendment would delete the prohibition on being able to question the merits of the policy objectives of any relevant body through the course of undertaking or promoting comparative cross-sectoral studies on economy, efficiency and effectiveness. It is a long-standing principle that the Auditor General, and, similarly, the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of England, cannot question the policy objectives of a body for which he has audit responsibility. He may express a view on how a body sets about achieving its objectives and whether its approach represents value for money. He may also inform future strategic policy development, but he is not there to comment on the merits of policy&#151;the point zealously guarded by the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, from his entirely neutral position as Presiding Officer of the Assembly. To question the merits of policy could compromise his independence if, for instance, he were to undertake audit work relating to a policy area on the merits of which he had previously expressed a view. That would not be conducive to the exercise of his functions.
<P>

<a name="40223-29_para10"></a>The amendment would raise an inconsistency between the Auditor General's powers in respect of cross-sectoral studies provided for under the clause and studies in respect of the Assembly and Assembly-funded bodies undertaken under the Government of Wales Act 1998, where the prohibition on questioning policy merits would still apply. For those reasons, it would be inappropriate for the Auditor General to be put in the position of having the capacity&#151;perhaps, the obligation&#151;to question the merits of policy objectives while exercising his functions.
<P>

<a name="40223-29_para11"></a>The noble Baroness asked about audits of local authorities, where a similar inhibition apparently does not apply. The Auditor General would not be the statutory auditor of local government bodies; he would appoint auditors. Therefore, in respect of local government, he would not have the direct responsibility of being a statutory auditor, questioning the policy. That is the difference in the position for local government.
<P>

<a name="40223-29_para12"></a>On the noble Baroness's more general point, I recognise that we are debating an area where there is what is rightly defined as a narrow line. We can envisage where it would be entirely appropriate for the Auditor General to comment on policy to inform future strategic developments. However, we seek to protect the position that he does not cross the line to become a participant in the debate about the merits of policy. I fear that the amendment would open that possibility; that is why I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw it.

<a name="column_GC18"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC18</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the Minister for his reply. I put two specific questions to him. The first related to local authority value for money studies. In his response, he seemed to say that the Auditor General would not carry out such studies, although Clause 41 is drafted in terms to state:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Auditor General for Wales must for each financial year undertake or promote studies designed to enable him to make recommendations"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-29_para13"></a>
on value for money, to paraphrase. So there is similar provision there. Of course, there is reference to avoiding discussing the merits of policy, which continues to mystify me.
<P>

<a name="40223-29_para14"></a>The other thing that mystifies me is whether he is debarred from commenting on the merits of policy. Clause 3(3) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"do not entitle the Auditor General for Wales to question the merits",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-29_para15"></a>
which is rather curious drafting, when we think about it. If he was not to do so, it would state something like, "The Auditor General for Wales shall not question the merits". That is an interesting difference of drafting that implies that he may not be entitled to do so, but probably can, if he chooses to. That is the fine line that Auditors General have been carefully treading throughout their history: finding a way to comment on policy even when they do not comment on the merits of policy.
<P>

<a name="40223-29_para16"></a>I leave those two questions with the Minister. He may want his officials to consider them and write to me outwith the Committee, but they are puzzling aspects. I tabled the amendments so that we could have that debate on what is inevitably a difficult area, but those two points are worthy of consideration.

<P>

<a name="40223-30_para2"></a>We certainly welcome the Auditor General carrying out value for money studies in educational bodies, but they can be carried out only at the request of the educational body or of the body responsible for that educational body. The position of educational bodies under Clause 4 is thus totally different from that of the bodies within Clause 3. which the Auditor General can study at will. Consent is the keynote of Clause 4 and we are bound to press the Government on why there is that special treatment for educational institutions. Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 provide different ways of deleting that need for consent.

<a name="40223-30_para3"></a>The other bodies that are dependent on public funds are subject to value for money studies. Our question is: why is the clause drafted in that way? We wondered whether it had something to do with the clause needing to be consistent with other educational legislation as envisaged in subsection (7). That is why Amendment No 7 deletes that subsection on a probing basis. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain that subsection, because we have failed to understand it. We do not believe that studies should be left to the bodies themselves. After all, they are in receipt of significant amounts of public money and the value for money with which they use those funds is clearly important.
<P>

<a name="40223-30_para4"></a>Are the requesting bodies listed in the table likely to ask for studies or will they be reluctant to do so for fear of revealing their own past or continuing shortcomings? It is only human nature not to volunteer for challenge and scrutiny, especially if there is any doubt whether all is not well.
<P>

<a name="40223-30_para5"></a>My noble friend Lord Roberts spoke at Second Reading about a body called Education Learning Wales (ELWa), which was the subject of a hard-hitting report by the Auditor General. I understand that ELWa is formally known as the National Council for Education and Training for Wales, and appears in both columns of the table in new Section 145B. Do we think that ELWa would have volunteered itself for a value for money study? I think not.
<P>

<a name="40223-30_para6"></a>We believe that the Auditor General should have the same power to study educational institutions as he has to study relevant bodies in Clause 3 and that he should not be dependent on requests from bodies to initiate studies. Also, he should not need their consent to report to the Assembly, as is provided in subsection (3) of new Section 145B. Again, perhaps the Minister could treat that as an amendment in spirit, as we have not tabled it for consideration, but that forms part of the relation between the Auditor General and educational institutions.
<P>

<a name="40223-30_para7"></a>The entire approach to educational institutions in the clause seems to put them on a protective pedestal and provides an example of an area where the Bill could make better, stronger provision for public audit in Wales but fails to do so. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   This, again, is problematic as regards the Assembly. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, mentioned the activities of the Audit Committee of the National Assembly. Reference has been made to ELWa in that context. The Assembly's Audit Committee has discharged much good work in its critique of the operations of ELWa. Given that the committee is comprised of democratic representatives, some of the criticism has resulted in greater efficiency within ELWa.
<P>

<a name="40223-30_para8"></a>In principle, we agree with the concept of independence of the auditor in considering educational matters, but&#151;and it is a big but&#151;if we consider the activities of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, which is referred to in the <P>


<a name="column_GC20"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC20</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>clause, we must remember that the university colleges in Wales that form part of the federal University of Wales do not stand up well in competition for funding with their English counterparts. Unless they have a certain amount of flexibility to make up the gap without, shall we say, undue interference from the auditor, they may be placed at even greater disadvantage.
<P>

<a name="40223-30_para9"></a>So there is a need for ELWa, in particular, to be considered in its entirety, but if university colleges in the higher education system in Wales have their wings clipped, that may put them at even greater disadvantage. About five years ago, students in Wales were underfunded by about £300 per student. I do not know whether that still applies. However, we need to look at the situation carefully.
<P>

<a name="40223-30_para10"></a>We agree that the Auditor General should be able to look independently at a wide number of activities, but I counsel a little caution. If the powers are used excessively and in a non-objective manner, we could be in trouble. So I find the amendment rather difficult. While we want to see independence, we do not want to see innovation in the higher education sector stifled.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I am grateful to those noble Lords who have participated in our short debate on the amendment. I am not surprised that ELWa has emerged quite early in the Committee's deliberations. No doubt I shall be buffeted from time to time by critical remarks about that body. However, I am on secure ground here and I shall make the position clear as regards the amendment. While I hold a robust position I intend to make the most of it.
<P>

<a name="40223-30_para11"></a>The Auditor General is the statutory auditor of ELWa and has the power to undertake studies. The burden of our anxiety about the amendment is that Clause 4 will enable ELWa to request a study of an education body which it funds, but which is not within the remit of the Auditor General. So the problems with regard to ELWa are covered effectively and properly. The issue regarding the position of ELWa remains a bone of contention between us and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, in moving her amendment; that is, whether individual bodies should be subject to the Auditor General when they have not requested an investigation.
<P>

<a name="40223-30_para12"></a>The noble Baroness has indicated that people rarely volunteer for such action if they are in difficulty. Of course that is true in the generality of cases, but it is not true in all circumstances. I am very loath to bring to the Committee experience from the English dimension in education because I recognise the thorny path down which I would have to tread, but I can recall institutions in England which have been in that kind of trouble and where only the request for a proper investigation of what has gone wrong has set them back once again on the path of virtue. That was certainly my experience when I chaired a funding body for further education. We had no reservations about ensuring that audits were carried out. Furthermore, we would call in support at a national level when we <P>


<a name="column_GC21"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC21</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>thought that the circumstances were so grievous that we needed full scrutiny. I can confirm that that was done.
<P>

<a name="40223-30_para13"></a>However, I understand the argument of the noble Baroness. In general people tend to keep their failings and sins as quiet as possible. So the issue is whether it is right that the Auditor General for Wales should be entitled to engage in such studies on individual educational bodies.
<P>

<a name="40223-30_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, has already presented real reservations about why that should be so. With regard to higher education, it is certainly clear that universities&#151;the University of Wales is a particularly complex institution&#151;have a proper and jealously guarded level of independence. That is quite critical, as he indicated, to the development of much of their enterprising research work. One cannot push back the frontiers of knowledge if one is constrained by people with limited knowledge hindering and restricting certain areas of work. Such an institution must have proper freedoms. That is why we have careful relationships in higher education in terms of degrees of freedom.
<P>

<a name="40223-30_para15"></a>It is surely appropriate that such studies by the Auditor General should be undertaken only on request. He is not the statutory auditor of the individual educational institutions, and for very good reasons. They are responsible for the appointment of their own auditors. The combined effect of Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 would give the Auditor General complete discretion to undertake such studies, irrespective of whether they were requested and of the fact that he would have no wider statutory audit functions in respect of such bodies.
<P>

<a name="40223-30_para16"></a>The Auditor General already has the ability under Section 145 of the Government of Wales Act to undertake economy, efficiency and effectiveness studies in the higher and further education sectors, which can touch on and compare the practice of individual institutions in terms of how resources have been used. That is a very important part of his role in relation to funding organisations. However, that is different from his having the power to investigate and carry out a study of an individual educational institution. It would be incongruous and would lead to confusion over the respective roles of the Auditor General and an educational institution's own auditor if the Auditor General were able to undertake unsolicited economy, efficiency and effectiveness studies in respect of bodies for which he had no wider statutory audit functions.
<P>

<a name="40223-30_para17"></a>I shall move on to Amendment No. 11. Clause 14 relates specifically to the appointment of auditors by the Auditor General for local government bodies. Higher and further education simply does not fall within that category. The provision in Clause 4(5) to enable the Auditor General to arrange for one or more members of his staff to audit a corporation's accounts, subject to appointment by a corporation, is consistent with Clause 9 and others.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   Forgive me if I have moved on in error. The noble Baroness is quite right. The groupings changed not long before the Committee began, which has caused a little difficulty on this side, particularly as I am less familiar with the Bill than I would like to be.
<P>

<a name="40223-31_para0"></a>Amendment No. 11 would delete the reference to construing Clause 4 as one with other education legislation. The provision is essentially one of clarification and is common to education legislation. It enables definitions in other education legislation to be relied on to clarify meaning. For instance, were there to be uncertainty about whether an educational establishment was an HE institution for the purpose of a 3Es study under Clause 4, the definition of such an institution set out in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 and the way in which the courts have interpreted it would be relied on for clarification.
<P>

<a name="40223-31_para1"></a>We recognise the need for clarification. I seek to commend to the Committee the reasons why it is important that the bodies are subject to a different auditing regime from that that would be introduced by the amendment. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-31_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   Before I do so, I want to follow up on one or two points. I think that the Minister said that educational institutions already fell within Section 145 of the Government of Wales Act and Schedule 17. I have read the legislation very briefly but could not see that. Educational bodies did not seem to be covered, so the clause seems to create the ability to do value-for-money work within educational bodies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-31_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I hope that I presented the position accurately&#151;that the law is contained within the higher education Act for Wales. I think that I have given the correct definition of where HE institutions are located.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-31_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I will then of course read carefully in Hansard what the Minister said, as I clearly misunderstood when I listened to him.
<P>

<a name="40223-31_para2"></a>My second question goes back to ELWa, which the Minister said was already audited by the Auditor General, so that was all right. Why then is ELWa covered in proposed new Section 145B(1)? Why are we specifically referring to ELWa, and not simply its ability to ask for value-for-money studies of other institutions? It is specifically covered in both the "Subject of study" and the "Requesting body" columns of that proposed new section. If it is already within the ambit, why is it covered again? Is there any option for ELWa as to whether it has "value for money" studies or not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-31_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The answer to the question is no. Proposed new Section 145B is almost identical to Section 36 of the Audit Commission Act 1998. It <P>


<a name="column_GC23"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC23</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>simply attempts to transfer the functions in relation to Welsh education bodies to the Auditor General for Wales.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-31_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   In that case, ELWa is not within the requirement to have a value-for-money study unless it requests a value-for-money study. Is that correct?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-31_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The situation, as ever, is more complex than I would have wished. For backward-looking studies, we are talking about the Government of Wales Act. For forward-looking studies, we are talking about the Act to which I referred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-31_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   Again, I can see that I shall have to read the Minister's words with care and, if necessary, come back to him after the Grand Committee is completed.
<P>

<a name="40223-31_para3"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, for his contribution to the debate. He talked about the disadvantages of funding for educational bodies in Wales, on which I have no briefing. If funds were particularly scarce, it would seem even more important that those bodies used the money with the utmost economy, efficiency and effectiveness, and therefore a case should be made that they should be within the Auditor General's remit and not outside it.
<P>

<a name="40223-31_para4"></a>I thank the Minister in particular for his explanation of subsection (7), which will doubtless make complete sense on rereading. I am sorry that he was confused by late changes to amendments. We gave notification about those changes before 9.30 this morning; if it took a long time to reach him, that is nothing to do with us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-31_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I assume that to be the case. I was not in any way, shape or form being accusatory, merely apologetic.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-31_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   On that note, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40223-31_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall also speak to Amendment No. 10. Both the amendments concern Clause 4, which purports, according to its title, to deal with studies at the request of educational bodies, but in practice goes wider and deals with audits of those bodies. My amendments deal with the audit part of the clause.
<P>

<a name="40223-31_para9"></a>Proposed new Section 145B(5) deals with audits of higher and further education corporations. The Auditor General can advise the corporations on the appointment of auditors or arrange for a member of his staff to be appointed auditor, but the Auditor General himself cannot be appointed auditor. Amendment No. 9 seeks to rectify that omission. I am <P>


<a name="column_GC24"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC24</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sure that a higher or further education authority would much prefer to have the Auditor General's own name appearing on the audit report, rather than some much more anonymous, although doubtless worthy, member of his staff. I hope that the Government share that view.
<P>

<a name="40223-31_para10"></a>As I mentioned, proposed new subsection (5) allows the Auditor General to arrange for a member of his staff to be appointed auditor to a higher or further education establishment. Amendment No. 10 merely ensures that the member of staff is properly qualified by linking the qualification to that in Clause 14, under which the Auditor General's staff may be appointed to the audit of a local government body in Wales. I hope that that amendment is non-contentious and that the Minister will be prepared to accept it. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-31_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   Amendment No. 9 would have the effect of enabling the Auditor General to be appointed as the statutory auditor of an education corporation on a permanent basis. The intention of Clause 5 is to add a proposed new section to the Government of Wales Act. It would enable the Auditor General, at the request of a higher or further education corporation, to advise it in connection with the appointment of persons to audit its accounts, and to arrange for its accounts for a financial year to be audited by one or more members of his staff, appointed by the corporation. Those functions are currently undertaken in respect of England and Wales by the Audit Commission under the Audit Commission Act.
<P>

<a name="40223-31_para11"></a>On publication of the draft Bill for consultation in April 2003, the Assembly undertook that if at some point in future it were to propose to incorporate further or higher education corporations as a category within the Auditor General's remit, such a proposal would be subject to a separate consultation exercise. It would therefore be preferable to deal with such bodies as a class rather than on a piecemeal basis. Any future exercise could take account of arrangements for both financial audit and value for money audit through economy, efficiency and effectiveness studies. Nothing in the terms of Clause 4(5) prevents the Auditor General and an education body from renewing an audit arrangement for a further financial year.
<P>

<a name="40223-31_para12"></a>The problem with the amendment is that it would create a piecemeal approach to the financial audit of higher and further education corporations, and would run counter to the National Assembly's commitment to consult on any future proposed changes to the audit arrangement for such bodies. Clause 63, in conjunction with Section 144 of the Government of Wales Act, would enable further and higher education institutions to be added to the Auditor General's remit at some future time.
<P>

<a name="40223-31_para13"></a>As for Amendment No. 10, we have not sought to affect the way in which the Auditor General appoints his own staff or chooses to use them. The amendment would restrict his ability fully to deal with his own staff in that context.

<a name="40223-31_para14"></a>We have debated the question, which we recognised was important, of the accountability of HE and further education institutions. It is clear that the Assembly proposes to consider the issue further with regard to the appropriate audit arrangements. However, as it has made the commitment to further consultation on the issue&#151;we all recognise that it is interesting and has implications for significant institutions&#151;we want to preserve the Bill as it stands. I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-31_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for enlightening the Committee on the plans that the Assembly may have and on which it may consult, and the legislative provisions available should the Assembly decide to extend to further institutions. That is fine, but I do not think that my amendments had anything to do with that. They merely gave a further option to those higher education bodies that chose to become involved with the Auditor General. It is a pity that such an option is not available to them.
<P>

<a name="40223-31_para15"></a>Amendment No. 10 would have ensured that, if an auditor were appointed, he would be qualified. The Auditor General is restricted in whom he can appoint to audit a local authority under Clause 14, but what is good for local authorities is apparently not good for higher education authorities. I am sure that the Auditor General would not want to appoint anyone who was not properly qualified to either a higher education corporation or a local authority. It is curious that the Bill has different standards. The Minister has justified them under freedom, but that must be an illusory justification because it does not apply elsewhere in the Bill to local authority audit.
<P>

<a name="40223-31_para16"></a>We will return to the fact that the Bill is not a coherent whole. It is a patchwork of different provisions culled from here, there and everywhere. That results in different regimes applying to different sectors of body subject to audit under public audit arrangements in Wales. That is unsatisfactory and a missed opportunity. We would not want to die in a ditch on those points, but they underline the fact that the Bill is not one of which to be proud. It does not set a new future for public audit in Wales, but picks bits here and there and puts them together in a way that is not wholly coherent. That said, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 6, line 27, leave out from "The" to "one" and insert "Auditor General for Wales may carry out"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-32_para3"></a><P>

<a name="40223-32_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 13 and 14. The amendments concern Clause 5, which inserts proposed new Section 145C into the Government of Wales Act to deal with value for money studies in relation to registered social landlords.
<P>

<a name="40223-32_para5"></a>Under subsection (1) of new Section 145C, the Auditor General and the Assembly are to agree on a programme of studies. Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 would mean that the Auditor General could himself determine what value-for-money studies on registered social landlords were carried out. In addition, the Assembly and the Auditor General can agree on a programme of studies. So we move from agreeing to the Auditor General having independence to do what he thinks should be carried out.
<P>

<a name="40223-32_para6"></a>New Section 145C unnecessarily restricts the Auditor General to studying only in effect what the Assembly wants, thus turning him into a sort of hired hand. The Auditor General should be in the driving seat to determine what studies to carry out, although of course he should also carry out studies where the Assembly has a particular concern. As the Auditor General does not have freedom, we may find that the scope of his work will be settled to meet some political imperative of the Assembly, perhaps avoiding some political hot potato. That would be wholly inappropriate.
<P>

<a name="40223-32_para7"></a>Amendment No. 14, which is probing, is less weighty. Subsection (2) of new Section 145C talks about the Auditor General ensuring that studies are carried out by or on his behalf. My amendment simply knocks out "on his behalf" to find out who would be carrying out such studies and under what statutory power. I assume that the Auditor General will not be using his powers under new Section 96C to enter the arrangements that we discussed in the earlier group. Will the Minister say who could carry out the studies on the Auditor General's behalf, and under what power he would appoint them? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   Amendment No. 12 and, to a more minor extent, Amendment No. 13 involve discussion of an issue of principle. They would extend the Auditor General's powers, which would diminish the National Assembly's existing statutory powers in respect of registered social landlords. I hope that the Committee will agree that that would be inappropriate.
<P>

<a name="40223-32_para8"></a>As a matter of principle&#151;it is important that we have clear principles underpinning the legislation&#151;we seek to ensure that nothing in the Bill should restrict or take away an existing power of the Assembly. That is a very important point for the Government and is relevant to the two amendments and other amendments that will be discussed later.
<P>


<a name="column_GC27"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC27</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-32_para9"></a>Amendment No. 12 would enable the Auditor General to undertake programmes of study in respect of registered social landlords in Wales at his discretion, and independently of agreement with the Assembly. Amendment No. 13 would merely enable the Assembly to request that the Auditor General undertake such studies. The National Assembly already has the power to agree on a programme of economy, efficiency and effectiveness studies in respect of registered social landlords with the Audit Commission, by virtue of Section 40 of the Audit Commission Act 1998 and the National Assembly of Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999.
<P>

<a name="40223-32_para10"></a>Clause 5 would preserve that power on the basis of agreement between the Assembly and the Auditor General. The amendments would give the Auditor General complete discretion regarding the economy, efficiency and effectiveness studies in a sector for which he would not have statutory audit functions. RSLs are responsible for appointing their own auditors. As with the amendments on studies in respect of educational bodies under Clause 4, which we discussed earlier, that could lead to confusion over the respective audit roles. As with the related amendments on educational bodies, it would not be appropriate to give the Auditor General a free hand in undertaking studies related to bodies for which he does not have wider statutory audit functions.
<P>

<a name="40223-32_para11"></a>I reiterate that our major consideration is how the amendments would affect the existing powers of the Assembly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-32_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   I thank the Minister for giving way, and for the principle that he has stated. However, does he not agree that this is a further example of the complexity of the constitutional base with which we are dealing? In other words, we have the Government of Wales Act 1998 and occasional other pieces of legislation&#151;for example, the Education Act 1996, which refers to higher education&#151;and the transfer of functions orders. To understand this complex area, one must carry copies of all the transfer of functions orders along with one, unless one is very carefully advised as matters progress.
<P>

<a name="40223-32_para12"></a>Is the Minister not clearly making the case for a new devolutionary principle? Although that is beyond the scope of the Committee, it is worth remarking that that is yet another example of the complexity of legislating and maintaining principles that do not diminish the Assembly's powers, because the power base itself is so legislatively complex.

While he is perusing his papers on the matter, I should like to emphasise my point. Legislation that provides the constitutional base for the activity of the Assembly is very complicated. We have not only the Government of Wales Act and other relevant legislation, such as the Education Act 1996, but also transfer of functions <P>


<a name="column_GC28"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>orders, which can change the extent of powers and activities of the Assembly in specific areas. That makes it very difficult to legislate.
<P>

<a name="40223-32_para14"></a>Obviously, I approve the principle that nothing should lessen the powers of the Assembly or reduce its flexibility, particularly as regards the role of the Audit Committee in these circumstances. As the main democratic body, it currently works in partnership with the Auditor General and will work in partnership in a different way&#151;not involving local government so directly&#151;with the new body or the health services body, to which we will turn later.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-32_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   As ever, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, for his consideration in arranging for a Division to give me time to think about how I handle stage two of the devolution debate in Wales. I have confessed already that I am stretched on the crucial issue of accountancy, without getting myself deeply involved in constitutional issues. Therefore, if that is the examination that the noble Lord sets for me, I must confess that I have not really begun the first paragraph of the paper in response to him.
<P>

<a name="40223-32_para15"></a>I hear what the noble Lord says; he intervened most appropriately. I sought to identify that the amendments would detract from the powers of the Assembly, which is an effect that, on principle, we are set against. We intend to protect the powers of the Assembly, whether or not we intend in the very near future to go down the path of devolution, to which the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, invites me. As the noble Lord probably recalls, one or two other constitutional matters are in the offing in Parliament, and they will probably take priority. Nevertheless, the noble Lord is right to draw attention to the obvious implications for the Assembly with regard to the proposals contained in the measure.
<P>

<a name="40223-32_para16"></a>Amendment No. 14 would require the Auditor General to undertake programmes of studies in respect of registered landlords. The wording of the amendment makes it clear that the Auditor General would have the discretion to arrange for the work to be undertaken by a member of his staff or for it to be contracted out. The amendment would limit the Auditor General's operational flexibility and, potentially, the value for money obtained in undertaking the study programmes. If the programme of work were undertaken by a staff member or a private sector auditor approved by him for that purpose, he would still be responsible for the end result. Therefore, the amendment appears unnecessary. Where the clause states, "on his behalf", it would be either a member of the Auditor General's staff or a person providing services to him. Clause 9 makes that clear in relation to new subsection (8) of Section 90 of the Government of Wales Act.
<P>

<a name="40223-32_para17"></a>I hope that we have taken on board the salient points made by noble Lords. We are clear about the relationship between this Bill and the Government of Wales Act. I am eschewing the opportunity to push the boat any further down those waters. I hope that the <P>

<A NAME="40223-32_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   The answer that the Minister has given to the amendment is that it detracts from the powers of the Assembly under the Government of Wales Act. Why does it not detract from the Government of Wales Act that the Auditor General for Wales has the same discretion that is being criticised under Clauses 3 and 4? What is the difference?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   In that respect, I was seeking to identify that we have been discussing particular categories with regard to educational associations and the issues of registered social landlords. The National Assembly for Wales already has powers in respect of those categories. The amendment would empower the Auditor General in a way that would limit the existing powers of the Assembly. That is the point I was making in response to the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I am sorry, but I still do not follow. Under Clause 3, the Auditor General has the discretion to,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-33_para0"></a>
Under Clause 5, the Assembly have to agree to a similar function in relation to registered social landlords. Can the Minister explain why a registered social landlord is in a different position from all other relevant bodies?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The noble Lord will recognise that the powers of the Assembly in relation to these matters are derivative from the Government of Wales Act. The Auditor General for Wales has existing powers comparable to the Audit Commission, to which I referred in my original response to Amendment No. 12. There are specific areas with regard to particular groups&#151;we have referred to the educational institutions and the registered social landlords&#151;and, effectively, the amendments would give rise to an increase in the Auditor General's powers that would take some responsibility away from the National Assembly for Wales.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-33_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   With the greatest of respect, under the new clause, the only power that the Assembly would have would be to agree something with the Auditor General for Wales. I do not understand how that derogates from existing rights. I do not understand the distinction between registered social landlords or anyone else. I am sorry.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-33_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I am sorry if I am not being clear to the satisfaction of the noble Lord. As the noble Lord rightly said, under the amendments, the Auditor General would have the power to act; under the clause as it stands, he would work in consultation with. That <P>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC30</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is the power of the National Assembly to which I referred. Under the amendment, that would be deleted and the Auditor General would have the power to act. That is why we object to the amendments, however gracefully they are put before us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-33_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   As is often the case, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, has hit the nail on the head. This is an illogically constructed Bill, a point that I made earlier. We do not have, as the Minister tried to portray, a Bill built on real principles; we have a Bill built on borrowing a bit of legislation here and a bit of legislation there.
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para1"></a>Many other principles would be equally good in that context or, I would argue, better. For example, the Auditor General should have complete independence regarding what he examines. The principle should be that our approach to financial audit and value-for-money audit across all public money in Wales is consistent and coherent. That is not the case, as amply demonstrated by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford.
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para2"></a>I am sure that the devolution settlement is immensely complex; I do not pretend to be an expert on it. With all respect to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, I do not believe that that is the point at issue. The Bill would create new audit arrangements in Wales. In practice, we have a compromise from somewhere in the past, when the Audit Commission started to look at registered social landlords, picked up, lifted and given to us as complying with some grand principle in the context of Wales. It does not do that. That is another example of the illogicality of the Bill, to which I fear we shall return a number of times in Grand Committee.
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para3"></a>Clearly, we need to reflect on the debate. Today is not a day to make decisions. I hope that the Minister will look at what principles underline the Bill. Simply to stick on not taking away the power of the Assembly is quite possibly the least meritorious of any principle that could be put forward in the context of redesigning the whole scheme of public audit in Wales. It should rest on some grander principle of effective audit of public money in Wales. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40223-33_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40223-33_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: In speaking to Amendment No. 16, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 24, which are probing amendments designed to ensure that the new public audit arrangements in the Bill are consistent.
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para8"></a>Amendment No. 16 would remove subsections (6) and (7) from new Section 145C of the Government of Wales Act, inserted by Clause 5 of the Bill. Subsections (6) and (7) set up a criminal offence, punishable by a level 3 fine, of not complying with requirements concerning access to documents. As I understand it, that is consistent with the English provisions in the <P>


<a name="column_GC31"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC31</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Audit Commission Act 1998. There are similar, though not identical, provisions in Clauses 19 and 53. But that is not consistent with compliance with the Auditor General's rights of access under Clause 11, which broadly covers his audit and value for money work other than on local government. That is why we have tabled Amendment No. 24 on a probing basis to put criminal offences into the whole of Clause 11.
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para9"></a>Returning to the theme of the Bill as a patchwork, in this case it is a patchwork of criminality. It is a criminal offence if registered social landlords or local government are involved, but not otherwise. In striving for consistency with England, the Government have created an inconsistent regime for Wales. They are thus in danger of missing a golden opportunity to create something logical and defensible across the whole of Wales, which is the most important thing to get right. The Government should decide whether infringement of access rights is criminal and should make the Bill consistent throughout.
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para10"></a>The inconsistency does not end with the fact of criminality; it also goes to how the penalties are calculated, which is the reason for Amendments Nos. 17 and 18. They repeat for Clause 5 the extended fining provisions of Clauses 19 and 53. Our main concern is that the Welsh public audit regime has internal consistency. In practice, we doubt whether criminal sanctions are necessary. Could the Minister say how those sanctions have, in practice, been used by the Audit Commission in the past? Can he assure the Committee that they are necessary powers?
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para11"></a>If the Government believe that the powers are necessary, will they introduce amendments to ensure that the powers are consistent across the whole regime? But if the Minister cannot demonstrate that criminal sanctions are important, I invite him to look again and bring forward amendments to remove those in the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-33_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   It seems extraordinary to include a criminal offence in a clause headed simply "Studies relating to registered social landlords". If the Auditor General is to have access to papers and may require a person to produce documents and attend in person, surely there must be some sanction in that regard covering the whole field, not simply in relation to registered social landlords.
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para12"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, is right. A great deal of the Bill has been lifted from earlier legislation and inserted in a patchwork way without any overall view. A right to documents and for witnesses to attend requires sanctions; that is obvious. I await the Minister's explanation of why they should be different, depending on the nature of the study being undertaken by the Auditor General.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-33_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   Amendment No. 16 would eliminate the criminal sanctions that apply to any person who without reasonable excuse fails to provide the Auditor General with assistance, information and explanation in relation to certain of his rights of access <P>


<a name="column_GC32"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC32</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to documents and information for the purposes of undertaking studies under the provisions made in Clause 5.
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para13"></a>The amendment would create an inconsistency in sanctions relating to the conduct of study programmes in the registered social landlord sector between England and Wales. I am seeking to emphasise a principle. It is not quite the principle that the noble Baroness invited me to adumbrate, but the principle that the sanctions and laws should be similar for the same offence in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para14"></a>The primary purpose of the Bill is to enable the setting up of a single public audit body for Wales. In the Government's view, it would be entirely inappropriate for such a Bill to create inconsistencies in criminal law between England and Wales. The provisions in Clause 5 do not create any new criminal sanctions in respect of Wales. They merely preserve the existing position as it currently applies to England and Wales. Any future consideration of criminal penalties should be taken on an England and Wales basis. I make it clear that we do not regard that as a matter for this Bill.
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para15"></a>Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 would align the criminal sanctions available to the Auditor General for non-compliance with those available under Clauses 18 and 53 to an appointed auditor and the Auditor General in relation to non-compliance with their respective rights of access to the documentation of a local government body in Wales. The amendments would again result in an inconsistency in the application of the criminal law between registered social landlords in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para16"></a>The criminal sanctions provision incorporated in Clauses 5, 18 and 53 all set out to preserve existing arrangements that apply in both England and Wales. I understand that the noble Baroness is berating me for saying that the Bill lifts from other legislation. But perhaps I may say that in this area, it does so on the basis of guaranteeing consistency of the sanctions that would apply between England and Wales for what I think would be regarded throughout the Committee as very good reasons.
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para17"></a>I return to the point that in the Government's view criminal sanctions in primary legislation should be consistent across England and Wales. Their review or amendment is not a matter for the Bill. That is why I hope the noble Baroness will not press Amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 18.
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para18"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the Audit Commission. We are not aware that the Audit Commission has in practice used the criminal sanction power. The point we are making is not what has taken place in practice but that the law at present in England and in Wales is consistent on sanctions. The Bill seeks to ensure that that consistency continues.
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para19"></a>Amendment No. 24 would apply criminal sanctions provisions comparable to those that apply in respect of non-compliance without reasonable excuse to an appointed auditor's rights to documents and information in respect of a local government body in Wales. The Government take the view that it would <P>


<a name="column_GC33"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC33</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not be appropriate to apply criminal sanctions to bodies that are covered by accounting officer conventions. The extension of criminal sanctions in that respect would create an inconsistency in the criminal law between England and Wales. The criminal sanctions elsewhere in the Bill have been incorporated to avoid any such inconsistency.
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para20"></a>Any instance of non-compliance under the provisions of Clause 11 would first be notified to the accounting officer of the relevant body. If that did not produce a positive result, the Auditor General would have the option of reporting the matter to the National Assembly Audit Committee,- which could consider the issue. Ultimately, non-compliance could result in the withdrawal of accounting officer status. Where a person or body does not comply with the Auditor General's requirements for access, we are of the view that the Auditor General may apply for a judicial review of that decision where the person or body is amenable to challenge by way of judicial review. It is also possible for the Auditor General to apply for a mandatory injunction in the courts.
<P>

<a name="40223-33_para21"></a>On that basis, I invite the noble Baroness not to move Amendment No. 24.

<A NAME="40223-33_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   Is it the case that none of the regulations passed by the Welsh Assembly carry criminal sanctions? If they did, there would be obviously an inconsistency between the criminal law of England and the criminal law of Wales. I cannot imagine that there are regulations passed by the Assembly which do not carry criminal sanctions and that they must apply in different circumstances, but this business of refusing to accept amendments on the basis that they would produce an inconsistency with the criminal law in England is completely false. Can the Minister assure me that none of the regulations passed by the Assembly carry criminal sanctions that make the criminal law between England and Wales different at the moment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-34_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   It is certainly the case that Assembly provisions cover the issue of criminal sanctions, but we are not aware of any instance of inconsistency between what is provided for in Wales and what is provided for in England. That is the burden of our position with regard to the Bill. I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-34_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   Before we come to that, perhaps I may ask a question on a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, with regard to the apparent principle of not creating an inconsistency in criminal law.
<P>

<a name="40223-34_para0"></a>Clause 39 gives the Assembly the ability to make regulations under which criminal offences can be created. I shall probe that aspect in later amendments. So within the Bill, the Assembly has an ability to create a criminal offence. Therefore, the principle advanced by the Minister that there should be no inconsistency between England and Wales will break down as soon as the Assembly uses the power in the Bill under the <P>


<a name="column_GC34"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC34</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>account and audit regulations. There is nothing to say that the Assembly must pass those regulations in a form common with those relating to England. The principle advanced by the Minister is therefore suspect.
<P>

<a name="40223-34_para1"></a>When the Minister replied to the debate he, in effect, answered for himself. This is not logical for Wales. Under the guise of consistency with England&#151;but really under the guise of not changing what already exists&#151;we are creating layers of complexity for Wales which would not exist if the Government were to take the approach of ensuring that the Bill was itself consistent.
<P>

<a name="40223-34_para2"></a>The Minister may have gathered that I remain to be convinced that the so-called principles adopted by the Government are the right ones. Indeed, in relation to inconsistency in the criminal law, given Clause 39, I am not convinced that they are proper principles at all. I will withdraw the amendment but I promise the Minister that we will return to this subject on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-34_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40223-34_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 19, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 20. Both amendments relate to new Section 93A of the Government of Wales Act as inserted by Clause 7 of the Bill. Section 93A deals with the fees charged by the Auditor General.
<P>

<a name="40223-34_para10"></a>Amendment No. 19 is a probing amendment which deals with the small puzzle of to what bodies the Auditor General will be charging audit fees. Section 93A starts with a permissive power in subsection (1) which allows the Auditor General to charge fees. But subsection (2) "requires" the Auditor General to charge fees if a person is being audited by consent and "it appears to him"&#151;that is, the Auditor General&#151;that the audited person is "connected with" local government or the NHS in Wales. My probing amendment would delete the words "appears to him to be" and insert the more positive "is".
<P>

<a name="40223-34_para11"></a>As I said, it is a probing amendment. It seems to me curious that we cannot unambiguously state in statute the audited person who would be liable to pay fees. Indeed, there are bodies which are so ambiguous that their status has to be settled by their appearances to the Auditor General. Either a body is or is not connected with the NHS or local government. If it is ambiguous, I invite the Government to be more specific about what "connected with" means.
<P>

<a name="40223-34_para12"></a>I am mystified why, in the case of all audits by consent under Section 96(3)(a), there is not a provision for the Auditor General to charge fees. Why is it restricted to this category of body connected with, or appearing to be connected with, the NHS or local <P>


<a name="column_GC35"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC35</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>government? Can the Minister explain the rationale for some bodies being required to pay fees when they are audited by consent and others not?
<P>

<a name="40223-34_para13"></a>Amendment No. 20 probes the financial basis of the Auditor General's fees. The amendment seeks to insert "but does not exceed" into subsection (4) of new Section 93A in order that fees under that subsection must cover but not exceed the full cost. We could as easily have tabled this amendment in relation to subsection (2) or tabled a different amendment to probe whether the different formulation in subsection (3), which refers to not exceeding full cost, has a different meaning. I hope that the Minister will respond to the amendment with the different formulations within the section in mind.
<P>

<a name="40223-34_para14"></a>The amendment also gives us an opportunity to ask what is meant by "full cost" in these circumstances and to seek more information about the funding of the Auditor General and his organisation. Are some overheads included in "full cost"? If so, how are they apportioned between different types of work? Who will consider that? Will the Assembly or the Audit Committee examine the fee arrangements of the Auditor General, especially as the Assembly has to pick up the bill for the costs that the Auditor General does not recover by way of fees.
<P>

<a name="40223-34_para15"></a>I hope the Minister will take this opportunity to clarify the funding aspects of the Auditor General and his office. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-34_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for moving the amendment, although the further she went into her series of questions the less grateful I became. I am too ill-briefed to respond to a number of them but I shall do the best I can. Any deficiencies will be made up later. She was kind enough to state that these are probing amendments but I am afraid that some probes will receive an answer in the form of a written reply rather than anything I can say at this point.
<P>

<a name="40223-34_para16"></a>Amendment No. 19 would limit the Auditor General's discretion to make a reasonable judgment in deciding whether a person is or is not connected to local government or the NHS in Wales for the purpose of recovering the full cost of services provided.
<P>

<a name="40223-34_para17"></a>The clause adds a new Section 93A to the Government of Wales Act and makes new provision for fee charging and recovery of costs by the Auditor General. Section 93A(2) would require the Auditor General to recover the full cost of providing services in respect of the accounts of any person that appeared to him connected with local government and the health service in Wales, over and above his statutory responsibilities under the Bill. The Auditor General may provide those services where the person whose accounts are to be audited has agreed with the Assembly or a Minister of the Crown that the accounts should be audited by the Auditor General.
<P>

<a name="40223-34_para18"></a>The Auditor General would have to establish the relationship beyond doubt and that could hamper him in the performance of his duties. The employment <P>


<a name="column_GC36"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC36</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>terms and conditions of a person can, as the noble Baroness will recognise, be very complex&#151;for instance, in any "arm's length" arrangement&#151;and the Auditor General would have to make a judgment on such an issue. His judgment could be subject to judicial review. The clause gives the Auditor General a degree of protection in exercising that judgment and enables him to demonstrate, if challenged, that he had made a reasonable decision in all the circumstances when reaching the position that the person was so appropriately employed that he should pay the fee.
<P>

<a name="40223-34_para19"></a>Amendment No. 20 would have the effect of requiring the Auditor General to charge a fee that did not exceed the full cost of undertaking claims and returns certification work under the proposed Section 96B of the Government of Wales Act 1998 and for undertaking economy, efficiency and effectiveness studies at the request of educational bodies under Clause 4 and local government bodies under Clause 44.
<P>

<a name="40223-34_para20"></a>The amendment is unnecessary. Clause 7(4) is clear that the Auditor General must cover full cost but no more. The same provision is made in proposed Section 93A(2) of the Government of Wales Act and in Clause 7 in relation to services provided to any person connected with local government or the health service which are outside the Auditor General's statutory functions. So the point is covered.
<P>

<a name="40223-34_para21"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the definition of "full cost". If I produced a definition, I am not sure it would pass her critical examination. I am not in a position to define "full cost", except to say that the Auditor General's operations can clearly be costed. We are seeking to recoup the costs where he is carrying out particular services. We are not seeking to make a profit&#151;the office of the Auditor General is not a profit-making institution&#151;but neither will he provide a service free of charge. The charges involved will include all costs that can appropriately and accurately be identified as relating to a particular function carried out by him.
<P>

<a name="40223-34_para22"></a>I recognise that that explanation may be inadequate but it is the best I can give today. Incorporating Amendment No. 19 could result in operational difficulties for the Auditor General by restricting his discretion as to whether a person is connected to local government or the NHS in Wales for the purpose of charging. As I said, we believe that we have met the intention behind Amendment No. 20 in our existing drafting.

<A NAME="40223-34_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   Can the Minister elaborate on this point? I believe he said at one stage that the Auditor General should charge full cost but no more. Subsection (2) states that he must charge a person a fee which covers full cost. The same provision appears in subsection (4). But subsection (3) states that he may charge a fee not exceeding the full cost. That implies that "full cost" can mean something other than "not exceeding", given the way in which the Government <P>

<P>
<A NAME="40223-35_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I shall certainly reflect on that but I am afraid that I do not have the intellectual capacity or knowledge to deal with these issues at the level the noble Baroness rightly expects me to, given her own background with regard to these technical terms. I have made the best shot of it I can for today. I shall of course take steps to improve on my response in due course.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-35_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   Let me not torture the Minister further today and allow the committee to move on. As to Amendment No. 19, I was unmoved by the Minister's explanation. I always find that when Ministers resort to wheeling out the fact that judicial review can always be used to settle what something means, we can hear the sound of barrels being scraped. This happens where the Government cannot give a clear explanation for what has been drafted and it is all left to judgment followed by a remedy which we all know is of no real use to man or beast&#151;that is, judicial review.
<P>

<a name="40223-35_para0"></a>As to the basis on which fees are to be charged, I raised the substantive issue of the different ways in which the Bill has been drafted, which implies different fees for different things. I also asked&#151;I shall not press for an answer today&#151;about who will consider the matter to ensure that the provisions are complied with and whether the Assembly will have any role in that.
<P>

<a name="40223-35_para1"></a>I know that the Minister will ask his officials to consider those issues outside the Committee. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40223-35_para2"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-35_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Noakes </B>   moved Amendment No. 21:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 9, line 28, leave out "Audit Committee" and insert "Crown"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-35_para7"></a><P>

<a name="40223-35_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 22. Both amendments relate to Clause 10, which inserts new Section 94A into the Government of Wales Act and makes the Auditor General the accounting officer for the Wales Audit Office.
<P>

<a name="40223-35_para9"></a>Amendment No. 21 deals with a situation where the Auditor General is incapable of discharging his duties as accounting officer or the office is vacant. He is of course a Crown appointment and it seems odd that his replacement&#151;admittedly only wearing his accountant officer hat&#151;should in those circumstances be decided not by the Crown but by the Assembly's Audit Committee.
<P>

<a name="40223-35_para10"></a>That seems to beg the question of the relationship between the Auditor General and the Audit Committee. Subsections (3), (4) and (5) refer to his <P>


<a name="column_GC38"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC38</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>responsibilities as accounting officer for the Wales Audit Office to be specified by the committee from time to time. So the committee clearly has some supervisory power over the Auditor General, as accounting officer, who is charged by it for the propriety and so on of the Wales Audit Office. Be it noted that his responsibility as specified by the Audit Committee may also extend to the House of Commons and the Public Accounts Committee.
<P>

<a name="40223-35_para11"></a>That is a very tricky clause in which all concerned appear to be compromising their independence to some extent. That brings me to Amendment No. 22, which seeks to replace "shall" for "may" in subsection (6) so that if the Public Accounts Committee in another place requests the Assembly's Audit Committee to take evidence and report to it, the Audit Committee must do so.
<P>

<a name="40223-35_para12"></a>I am conscious that we are treading on thin ice here but it seems to me that, bearing in mind that the Assembly's power are subject to the will of Parliament, we should be clear that if Parliament requests, the body should oblige. If it did not, that would, to put it mildly, put the cat among the pigeons with regard to the devolution settlement. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-35_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   On Amendment No. 21, let us be clear that we are talking about a limited period and a temporary basis. I hear what the noble Baroness says about the inappropriateness of the provisions in the Bill and how her amendment would improve things. However, we are not talking about long-term permanent arrangements but simply what would happen in exceptional circumstances over a limited period of time. Nevertheless, issues of principle can be debated however short the time, and the noble Baroness has take this opportunity to identify an issue.
<P>

<a name="40223-35_para13"></a>Amendment No. 21 would require the Crown, rather than, as proposed in the Bill, the Audit Commission to designate an accounting officer for the Wales Audit Office on a temporary basis. Clause 10 adds a new Section 94A to the Government of Wales Act. It designates the Auditor General as the accounting officer for the Wales Audit Office. As accounting officer he would have responsibility for signing the accounts of the office, the regularity and propriety of its finances and the economic, efficient and effective management of its work.
<P>

<a name="40223-35_para14"></a>His responsibilities as accounting officer will also include any task specified from time to time by the Assembly's Audit Committee and can include responsibilities owed to the Assembly or its Committee, or to the House of Commons or its Public Accounts Committee. To prevent the Audit Committee from making a temporary&#151;I stress that word&#151;appointment would result in an unwieldy process for a limited measure. Giving the Assembly Audit Committee the power of temporary designation is consistent with the fact that the National Assembly part funds the Auditor General and that its Audit Committee has the power to examine and modify the Auditor General's annual estimate of income and expenditure.

<P>

<a name="40223-35_para15"></a>Amendment No. 22 would remove any discretion of the Assembly or its committee in dealing with a request to undertake work for the Committee of Public Accounts. It would make the former subservient to the latter. The noble Baroness said that she thought she was treading on thin ice. We both are when it comes to the question of the relative powers between Parliament and the devolved Assembly. But the Government's position is clear: to make the former subservient to the latter would diminish the existing status of the Assembly Audit Committee. As drafted, the clause mirrors the relationship of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Audit Committee set out in Section 102 of the Government of Wales Act. That Act states that, if requested, the Audit Committee "may"&#151;the noble Baroness seeks to insert "should" or "must" there&#151;undertake work on behalf of the Committee of Public Accounts.
<P>

<a name="40223-35_para16"></a>That arrangement has been put into effect satisfactorily on one occasion since the setting-up of the Assembly. The amendment would therefore create an inconsistency in the relationship between the Committee of Public Accounts and the Assembly Audit Committee in respect of taking evidence from the accounting officer of the Wales Audit Committee&#151;where the Audit Committee would have no discretion&#151;and other accounting officers in Wales, where discretion would remain.
<P>

<a name="40223-35_para17"></a>Given the existing functions of the Assembly Audit Committee and the existing relationship between the Committee of Public Accounts&#151;which we all hold in high regard as a most important committee in Parliament&#151;and the Assembly Audit Committee, I believe that, although they raise interesting issues, the amendments are unnecessary. I hope that the noble Lady will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-35_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. I accept that the part of the clause to which Amendment No. 21 is directed would involve only a temporary gap before a new Auditor General is appointed. But, of course, sometimes a temporary appointment can continue for rather a long time. That would be unfortunate if the Audit Committee was appointing its own man in that period.
<P>

<a name="40223-35_para18"></a>As to the relationship between the Public Accounts Committee and the Audit Committee, I was not aware&#151;although I am now&#151;of Section 102 of the Government of Wales Act. I can see drafting similarities in the Bill, but it is a rather curious drafting given that the Assembly's powers, and therefore those of the Audit Committee, are subject to the will of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40223-35_para19"></a>Doubtless the drafting satisfies people's sensibilities and probably means little in practice. On that basis I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40223-35_para23"></a>Clause 11 [Access to Information, etc by Auditor General]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-35_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Noakes </B>   moved Amendment No. 23:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 11, line 6, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-35_para24"></a><P>

"( ) require any other person who the Auditor General for Wales has reason to believe has information about any of the persons or documents mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subsection to provide any facility or information which he may reasonably require for any of the purposes mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (c) of subsection (1);"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40223-35_para25"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 23 seeks to introduce a new paragraph into subsection (3) of Clause 11. The clause is important because it is designed to ensure that the Auditor General has full access rights so that he can follow public money in his audits. It builds on the recommendations of the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, in his report, Holding to Account, some two years ago. We support the basic aim of the clause.
<P>

<a name="40223-35_para26"></a>The problem with the clause is that while its underlying aim is to ensure that the Auditor General has complete information about how public money has been used, it is drafted in a rather odd way. It does not focus on information but on documents. In particular the Auditor General can get information, assistance and so on from people who hold or control certain documents. I am sure that, in the majority of cases, following the paper trail of documents will give the Auditor General what he needs in terms of powers.
<P>

<a name="40223-35_para27"></a>However, let us suppose that the Auditor General has run out of steam as regards finding people with documents to interrogate. For example, the Auditor General might want to question the staff of a person whom he thinks might hold or control a relevant document, but either the person or the document has disappeared. The Auditor General might believe that a member of staff would be able to help with the inquiries even though that member of staff may not himself hold or control a document. My amendment would ensure that the Auditor General's inquiries would not dry up simply because he could not follow a document.
<P>

<a name="40223-35_para28"></a>I do not claim that the drafting of the amendment is perfect, but it is put forward as a genuine attempt to improve the implementation of the report of the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, so that public money is properly followed in the public audit process. If this finds favour with the Government, which I hope it does, they may also want to consider amending Clauses 18 and 52 since my amendment extends only to Clause 11 for the purposes of our debate in Committee. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-36_para2"></a><P>

<a name="40223-36_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: I suspect that my run of success will come to an abrupt end as I move Amendment No. 25 and speak at the same time to Amendment No. 26. These amendments tackle rather different issues in Clause 11.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para4"></a>Amendment No. 25 seeks to add,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"or by a person appointed by him",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-36_para5"></a>
to the definition of "auditable accounts" set out in subsection (5) so that the access rights conferred by the clause will extend not only to accounts examined by the Auditor General, but to accounts examined by a person whom he has appointed.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para6"></a>The Minister may well say that this is unnecessary because of Clause 18 in respect of local government accounts. However, my question on that score is why the Minister needs a whole new clause in Clause 18 if my additional seven words would do the trick. This is already an extraordinarily long Bill for a relatively straightforward subject, which itself derives from repetition&#151;usually rather inexact&#151;of the same concepts for local authority aspects of the Auditor General's work and his other work. My amendment offers a form of simplification and streamlining and I hope that the Government will accept it.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para7"></a>Amendment No. 26 is a probing amendment which seeks to knock out the ubiquitous Treasury from subsection (6), taking it out of the process of making an order specifying documents for the purposes of the access rights under the clause. I am puzzled as to why the Treasury should have any say in this. There is no equivalent power for the Treasury or any other government department to interfere in similar order-making powers under Clauses 18 or 52. Will the Minister explain why the Assembly, consulting the Auditor General for Wales, cannot be regarded as sufficiently competent to carry out this relatively minor function under Clause 11? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-36_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The noble Baroness presents her amendments so ably that she also anticipates my reply. That may make my presence in Committee relatively otiose because she is right: I am going to say that Clause 18 is the answer to Amendment No. 25. The noble Baroness says that she has produced a neater and shorter form of words for what she has described as a long Bill. However, I think that her experience in Parliament over the years will lead her to regard this legislation as rather average by <P>


<a name="column_GC42"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC42</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>comparison with many which we tackle. However, it is always a good thing to keep legislation as short, simple and straightforward as possible. We are one on that.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para8"></a>I do not think that the noble Baroness is right, but I have heard her argument. All that is said in Committee will be considered seriously and taken into account before we return to the Bill on Report. But we think that Clause 18 is essential to the Bill and I do not propose to accept the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para9"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 26. The noble Baroness indicated that it is unfortunate that the Treasury comes into the frame here. Under the Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000 the Treasury is responsible for making access orders for the Comptroller and Auditor General. We believe that the requirement to consult is constructive and should remain. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will not press the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-36_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. When I said that this is a long Bill, I did not mean in absolute terms, rather that it is long relative to the subject matter. I, too, have been involved with considerably longer pieces of legislation.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para10"></a>I thank the Minister for saying that the Government will look again at the relationship between Clauses 11 and 18 in the context of my proposed seven words. However, for the moment I shall not pursue the point. When we come to the Treasury and Amendment No. 26, we are up against our old friend&#151;consistency with England&#151;rather than consistency in Wales. I cited the equivalent order-making powers under Clauses 18 and 52 in which the Treasury has no interest whatsoever&#151;a good thing too, we might say.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para11"></a>I leave with the Minister that inconsistency among many inconsistencies in the Bill and I hope that, between Committee and Report, the Government will take the opportunity to reflect on whether more consistency for Wales would be a desirable principle on which to base the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40223-36_para20"></a><P>

<a name="40223-36_para21"></a>The noble Baroness said: We come now to the appointment of local authority auditors under Clause 14. I shall move Amendment No. 28 and speak at the same time to Amendment No. 33. The thrust of the amendments is to enable the Auditor General to deal with local authorities as he does with public bodies in Part 1. In other words, he should be able to audit local authorities himself and should certainly not be expressly prohibited from doing so as proposed in <P>


<a name="column_GC43"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC43</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>subsection (3). That is why Amendment No. 28 seeks to delete the subsection. The key question is why there is such special treatment for local authorities. After all, they are funded very substantially by central government through the Assembly.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para22"></a>The facile answer is that the Bill follows the pattern established by the Audit Commission Act, which still applies to local authorities in England. We have already debated the fact that that is a principle that appears to hold sway with the Government, but will not impress those on our Benches.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para23"></a>We assume that local authorities in Wales wish to continue with the current arrangements. Perhaps the Minister can say whether that is the case. But it would also be good to hear why advantage was not taken of the opportunity presented by the Bill to place all public sector bodies on the same footing so far as concerns the appointment of auditors. The opportunity has been taken to take NHS auditing out of the Audit Commission model and put it into a new model for Wales. It is not simply a question of consistency with England because after the Bill has been passed there will be a new inconsistency between England and Wales in relation to NHS audits. So I would suggest to the Minister that it is not such a strong principle after all.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para24"></a>Furthermore, under subsection (7), before appointing an external auditor, the Auditor General has to consult the local authority concerned. One wonders about the purpose of that, other than for courtesy. I do not believe that a local authority can refuse an auditor recommended by the Auditor General. If it were to object, what impact would that have? Amendment No. 33 seeks to delete subsection (7) in order to find out what is the purpose of the consultation and what would happen if the Auditor General and the local authority held different views.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para25"></a>There is a close relationship between local authorities and the Assembly; partnership between them is provided for in the Government of Wales Act. It could be argued that the unitary authorities in Wales&#151;they are all unitary authorities&#151;are in a very different position from their English counterparts and therefore the Government could easily justify treating them differently in the context of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para26"></a>It appears to us that a great opportunity related to local government audit has been missed. The Select Committee on Welsh Affairs in another place and the Assembly, which considered the Bill at the pre-legislative stage, felt the same way. We have not yet heard an argument of principle for the position taken in the Bill, although I shall listen carefully to the Minister's reply to see whether there is such an argument. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-36_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The effect of Amendment No. 28 would be to remove the prohibition on the Auditor General from appointing himself as the auditor to a local government body. The difference between local government and the National Health Service is obvious. The constitutional dependence of <P>


<a name="column_GC44"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC44</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>local government is different from that of the National Health Service and that is why we seek to tread with care in this area.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para27"></a>The Auditor General is the statutory auditor of the National Assembly and receives significant funding from the Assembly to enable him to undertake his work in the non-local government sector. The prohibition on him with regard to local government avoids any perception of a conflict of interest that could arise if the Auditor General were to be the statutory auditor of both the Assembly and a local government body.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para28"></a>There are additional practical difficulties as well as what I think is an issue of very considerable principle. If the Auditor General were able to be appointed as the auditor of a local government body in a personal capacity, it would open up the possibility of operational conflict of interest. For instance, under Clause 16, the Auditor General would have the authority to issue a code of audit practice for local government to which, in his capacity as an appointed auditor, he would have to adhere. Under Clause 20 he would be required to provide a scale or scales of fees from which he may personally benefit as an appointed auditor. Under Clause 37 he could theoretically require himself to undertake an extraordinary audit.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para29"></a>Those are important issues and present real and practical difficulties if the prohibition on the Auditor General acting in respect of local government bodies is removed, as sought in Amendment No. 28.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para30"></a>Amendment No. 33 would have the effect of absolving the Auditor General from consulting a local government body on the appointment of its auditor. It is accepted practice for local government to be consulted on the appointment of auditors and to end the practice would be detrimental. High standards of financial accountability are achieved to a great extent through a positive relationship between auditor and client&#151;withdrawing the right of local government to be consulted on audit appointments would risk alienating local government bodies and undermining the potential for a positive working relationship. It would also provide a stark contrast with the existing consultation arrangements for local government in England. On that basis, I ask the noble Baroness not to press the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40223-36_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for setting out the Government's views on and justification of the way the Bill has been constructed in relation to local authority audit. The Minister rested his case on the threat of conflicts of interest between auditing the Assembly and auditing local authority bodies. I have to say that I simply cannot see that, just as I cannot see any conflict of interest between auditing the Assembly and auditing NHS bodies, which is what will happen when the Bill is enacted. If there is a conflict of interest for local authorities, there is also one for the NHS.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para31"></a>The Minister went on to describe the problems with the Bill and at that point I believe he made the case for me. He demonstrated that the Bill is complex because <P>


<a name="column_GC45"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC45</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we have lifted the Audit Commission model. That model has a code of practice because particular named auditors are appointed and they must have something with which to comply. A scale of fees for all auditors is so drafted because of the way in which auditors are appointed. There is no fundamental difficulty in achieving all those aims for local authority audit&#151;as they have been attained, for example, for fees and audit for the other bodies dealt with in Part 1. Part 2 creates its own problems as a consequence of Amendment No. 28 simply because of the model that has been lifted here. With a different mindset about the model, Part 2 would become much simpler.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para32"></a>Although I thank the Minister for setting out the Government's rationale, I should report that thus far I am unmoved. However, I shall read his remarks carefully in Hansard.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para33"></a>Turning to Amendment No. 33, I thought that the Minister said that there is no real substance in subsection (7), but that it is like the point we discussed a moment ago&#151;the relationship between the Public Accounts Committee of another place and the Audit Committee for the Welsh Assembly. This drafting has been produced to satisfy sensibilities rather than to meet any other substance.
<P>

<a name="40223-36_para34"></a>I shall consider again the implications of Amendment No. 28. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40223-37_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes </B>   moved Amendment No. 29:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 12, line 37, leave out paragraph (b).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-37_para0"></a><P>

<a name="40223-37_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to the other amendments included in the group. We move on to other aspects of the appointment of auditors for local government bodies. These are all probing amendments. The Minister may think that I have put on my anorak in drafting and speaking to these amendments, because I recognise that they will not be proposals in which many people have an interest. Although they are only probing amendments, I hope that the Minister will be in a position to provide some answers.
<P>

<a name="40223-37_para2"></a>Amendment No. 29 seeks to delete paragraph (b) of Clause 14(4). Paragraph (a) is straightforward, stating that those eligible for appointment should be eligible for appointment as a company auditor, which has its own set of references. If a person is a member of one of the recognised accounting bodies, they may be an auditor. For example, if one is, as I am, a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, one must also be an approved auditor, which I am not. The Minister will be pleased to know that I could not be appointed as an auditor under the provision.
<P>

<a name="40223-37_para3"></a>However, paragraph (b), which my probing amendment deletes, allows the Assembly to approve many bodies of accountants whose members do not have demonstrated audit competence. It is quite unlike paragraph (a). It would allow the Assembly to approve members of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, for example, an excellent body which <P>


<a name="column_GC46"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC46</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has no pretensions whatever, to audit. It would allow the Assembly to approve a whole host of non-UK European accounting bodies. I would stretch the patience of the Committee if I explained why that is the minefield&#151;I invite the Committee to accept that it is.
<P>

<a name="40223-37_para4"></a>I am aware that, historically, local authority audits have been carried out by members of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. I will not argue any case against that, being a pragmatist. Accepting that, in practice, CIPFA accountants need to be capable of being appointed, I want to hear from the Minister why that extensive power of approval is necessary instead of simply naming CIPFA. I believe that that is the reason for the drafting.
<P>

<a name="40223-37_para5"></a>I invite the Minister to say how the Assembly intends to use the powers. The Minister may well be aware that approving an overseas accounting body as appropriate to carry out audit functions requires very extensive investigation. The Department of Trade and Industry has similar functions in relation to company audits in the UK. The DTI takes years over individual bodies&#151;and I do not exaggerate&#151;because of the nature of the inquiries that are conducted. Perhaps the Minister would comment on what, in practice, the Assembly might do to use its power to approve particular accounting bodies, in particular those outside the UK.
<P>

<a name="40223-37_para6"></a>Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 propose the deletion of paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (4). They allow a form of grandfathering to individuals whose qualifications do not pass muster under paragraphs (a) and (b). These provisions have been in existence in different legislation for quite some time. I am always mystified as to whether any specific individuals still need to be grandfathered under these provisions.
<P>

<a name="40223-37_para7"></a>I hope that the Minister will say how many people are expected to receive the protection of paragraphs (c) and (d) in terms of their appointment. I hope that the Government are not simply repeating legislation that has been used in the past without substantive reason. The circumstances which the provision seeks to address should, in my view, already have been time-expired. It will be interesting to know whether there are any particular instances. I accept that the Minister may not be able to answer that today.
<P>

<a name="40223-37_para8"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendment No. 32 which deletes, on a probing basis, the power of joint auditor appointment in subsection (6). I am sure the Minister will be aware that joint audits are not the norm in the private sector&#151;and for good reason. They nearly always involve duplication and therefore cost. They also run a risk of gaps&#151;things falling between auditors and escaping audit. I am aware that there is a similar provision in the Audit Commission Act, but I hope that the Minister will be able to explain how that power has been used in the past and for what purpose. A power to have joint audits ought to be justified on its own merit because one would not choose them as a matter of course.

<P>

<a name="40223-37_para9"></a>The Explanatory Notes on Clause 14 are, to be polite, sparse. I hope that the Committee will be enlightened by the Minister's comments. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-37_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The noble Baroness said that she would don an anorak for the purpose of these amendments. The problem is that anyone who wants to follow her to the same event that evening would be unsure of the appropriate dress code. Some of us would not qualify for an anorak in the same terms&#151;and from our earlier discussions, she is well aware that I would not do so.
<P>

<a name="40223-37_para10"></a>With regard to Amendments Nos. 29 to 31, I listened to her expositions most carefully. The practical effect of the amendments would be that members of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy&#151;a body which we all recognise is most relevant to local government audits&#151;would not be eligible for appointment. CIPFA is not a "recognised supervisory body" for the purposes of Section 25 of the Companies Act, yet we believe that CIPFA would be an obvious candidate for recognition by the National Assembly. That is our main anxiety about the implications of the amendments tabled&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-37_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   The Minister said that CIPFA would be covered and I conceded that. I was trying to establish whether anyone else was expected to be covered and, if so, why we have such convoluted drafting approving all kinds of accounting bodies when all we are trying to do is legitimise the status quo so that CIPFA accountants who are not subject to a recognised supervisory body can carry on audits in the public sector.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-37_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   Of course, the situation could be solved by naming CIPFA. The problem is that it is a non-governmental organisation and it has every right to change its name, as bodies do. However, the problem is that legislation referring to a particular body which may undergo change which none of us can foresee would present obvious problems. We seek to provide legislation that is expressed in more general rather than ad hoc terms because of such difficulties.
<P>

<a name="40223-37_para11"></a>We are not aware of the number of people covered by paragraphs (c) and (d), which I recognise the noble Baroness spoke about with greater insight and knowledge. We simply do not want to disqualify people without justification. I hope that she will forgive me for saying what a hullabaloo would be caused if, by some inadvertence, legislation were drafted in such a way as to disqualify those who we had no intention of disqualifying simply because we were unaware of the full range. Those are our reasons for keeping the clause as it stands and why I am anxious about the amendments.
<P>

<a name="40223-37_para12"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 32, the noble Baroness is right in saying that the Auditor General would be deprived of the discretion to make a joint audit appointment, but that is not likely to be used on many occasions. They are sometimes used when <P>


<a name="column_GC48"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC48</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>specific skills not held by the initially appointed auditor are needed for complex audits or for a peer review undertaken during an audit. But the fact that the power is not used frequently does not detract from its potential value. If we restricted the power with regard to the Auditor General for Wales, we would be removing a discretion which obtains for the Audit Commission in England. The noble Baroness may consider that a step forward, but, as she will have recognised, one of my abiding commitments with regard to the legislation is the degree of consistency between England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40223-37_para13"></a>I recognise that on both counts the noble Baroness has made an interesting case. We are not talking about a wide range of institutions or occasions, but it is right that we should frame legislation that is not restrictive and does not cause difficulties in future. In particular, it should not prove restrictive when comparable legislation elsewhere has it merits. On that basis, I ask her to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-37_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I understand from the Minister's response to the amendment to delete subsection (b) that he does not wish to be tied down to a particular body. That causes problems&#151;one thinks of the position of the Lord Chancellor, for example, and the problems the Government are facing in redefining his role and the powers of anyone replacing him.
<P>

<a name="40223-37_para14"></a>Surely, the Secretary of State has a list of individuals who have been approved under the Audit Commission Act 1998 and approved under the Local Government Finance Act 1982. If there is such a list, are they still in practice?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-37_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I cannot give a direct answer to the noble Lord. If I could, I would be in a different profession. Let me make the obvious point, which I believe he recognises. We are seeking to keep the situation as wide and as open as possible because the only conceivable criticism of a government operating in this area of professional expertise is where they were proven wrongly to have been restrictive; that in their legislation they had restricted that which they had no intention of restricting, but had done so through narrow drafting based upon a degree of ignorance of the situation.
<P>

<a name="40223-37_para15"></a>I hear what the noble Lord says about these categories and that the Government must have all these names somewhere. I cannot answer the question now, but I know the principle on which the clause is based. If he is saying, "If you were totally secure about the information which you have, you would not need that subsection", I would agree with him. I merely reflect the fact that where there are areas of uncertainty, it is only right that we should not be too restrictive.

<P>
<A NAME="40223-38_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that response. It is wrong in principle to legislate in an unnecessary way. The word used is "individuals". If the Secretary of State does not have <P>


<a name="column_GC49"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC49</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>access to a list of individuals and knows what they are currently doing under the 1998 and 1982 Finance Acts, that would suggest that perhaps there are people practising in this field who are not known to the Secretary of State. Surely, they must be known, there must be a list and their current status must also be known. One does not want unnecessary verbiage in what is already a complex enough Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-38_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I do not have a great deal to add. I assure the noble Lord that I have heard what he has said. It will be noted most carefully and we will look at the matter. We will reiterate our response to him more accurately on Report or we will produce a different solution.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-38_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for his explanation and I thank the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, for intervening in relation to these amendments. I, too, was going to challenge the Minister to produce a list because that is all that is required. It would encourage the Minister not to legislate unnecessarily. I do not believe that many people were ever involved under this section and I suspect that none is still practising. I may be wrong and there may be one or two, in which case paragraph (c) or (d) may need to remain. I will read carefully what the Minister said in respect of the other points I raised.
<P>

<a name="40223-38_para0"></a>On Amendment No. 32, relating to joint audits, the Minister will not be surprised to hear that I was not comforted by the model used for the Audit Commission as now applies to England. If his officials look at its history, they will see that it is something to do with large complex audits in London. It is also concerned with the opening up of the local authority audit market for private firms so that individuals could carry out audits on a low-risk basis while making the transition to the new audit players in the audit sphere as a consequence of the introduction of the Audit Commission in the early 1980s. That provision, too, has no real relevance in today's world, certainly not in the much less complex environment of Wales.
<P>

<a name="40223-38_para1"></a>With the same plea as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, not to legislate for things that are not necessary, I hope that the Minister's officials will look at these matters again before the Report stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40223-38_para2"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<a name="40223-38_para6"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 15 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-38_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   We have tabled our objection to Clause 15 standing part of the Bill in order to probe what the clause is all about. We have already remarked on the curious construction of the Bill, which has separate audit arrangements for local government audits. Clause 15 is another example of this.
<P>

<a name="40223-38_para7"></a>The clause is headed "Persons to assist auditors" and it goes on to empower the Auditor General to approve arrangements for non-appointed auditors to <P>


<a name="column_GC50"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC50</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>assist the appointed auditors in carrying out their functions. There is no similar provision in relation to the other audits that the Auditor General will be carrying out, so a number of questions arise in my mind which I hope the Minister will be able to answer.
<P>

<a name="40223-38_para8"></a>What are these arrangements? What do they mean in practice? What types of people will the auditors be making arrangements with? Why will the Auditor General be appointing auditors who are not competent to carry out the totality of their audit functions in the first place? What kind of controls will the Auditor General place on these arrangements? In what circumstances would the Auditor General approve arrangements as allowed under subsection (2) and when would he stick to individual appointment?
<P>

<a name="40223-38_para9"></a>They are not idle questions because subsection (3) states that, in effect, these persons are treated as auditors under the Bill. So, these non-auditor assistants can avail themselves of the access rights conferred by Clause 18, with the possible consequence that criminal offences for non-compliance could be triggered. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that that is the case.
<P>

<a name="40223-38_para10"></a>In the ordinary course of events, we would expect to turn to the Explanatory Notes for assistance. I have already alluded to the not-too-helpful quality of the Explanatory Notes. But they merely repeat the wording of Clause 15, adding an extra word. There is nothing by way of explanation or example.
<P>

<a name="40223-38_para11"></a>The Committee is entitled to understand the purpose and effect of Clause 15, which is why we tabled this objection.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   The basis of Clause 15 is that it would enable an appointed auditor to seek assistance in the exercise of his duties on matters which might be of significant complexity to require a specialist contribution; for example, on aspects of taxation or the interrogation of complex information data bases. The support of a person with expertise in such an area would be of potential assistance to the appointed auditor and the clause clearly indicates that the Auditor General could oversee such arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40223-38_para12"></a>A facility is already available to appointed auditors under the provisions of the Audit Commission Act 1998. The resource would remain available to appointed auditors in England, irrespective of whether Clause 15 was part of the Bill. I know that the noble Baroness and I are engaged in an elegant dance around whether consistency on my part between England and Wales is an important principle and on her part whether advances cannot be made within the framework of this legislation. I presume that if they were advantageous, at some stage they would be followed in England in due course. We will continue that dialogue for some time. I attest to the obvious fact that the removal of Clause 15 would inhibit the Auditor General in Wales while not having the same implications in England. It would place appointed auditors in Wales at a disadvantage in comparison to auditors appointed to a local government body in England. I cannot see how that could be construed as advantageous.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-38_para13"></a>If there is no need for the Auditor General in Wales to appoint someone to assist the auditor where he himself is the auditor, he can bring in such technical services as he needs. In making those arrangements, the Auditor General could take account of such issues as potential conflict of interests. It is to be recognised that the framework for that is supervised; it is to be carried out only where it is recognised that there is a particular difficulty.
<P>

<a name="40223-38_para14"></a>The noble Baroness asks how it is that the auditors appointed are not competent to deal with the problems in hand. I take second place to nobody in my admiration of auditors and their overall competence&#151;in the past I have been more than grateful for their expertise, as we all have in some general way&#151;but, nevertheless, the noble Baroness will recognise that there is some merit in having specialist expertise made available, subject to supervision. That is the concept in the Audit Commission Act. Apparently, the noble Baroness is of the view that it would be advantageous to Wales if no such comparable power existed for it. I am afraid that we will have to differ on that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-38_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   On behalf of my party, we support the Government in retaining Clause 15. However, the Minister should appreciate that it is quite right that Wales should have its own methods of innovation for building up new techniques and training and should lead the way for England to follow; it should not necessarily be the other way round. In the field of rugby football, England won the World Cup as a result.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-38_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, for that intervention. Rugby is a game that I will never understand. I cannot follow it. I thank the Minister for his response.
<P>

<a name="40223-38_para15"></a>I wish to ask two questions. If a private-sector auditor were appointed under the basic appointment provisions of Clause 14, would anyone who works on the audit&#151;from the most junior audit clerk to the most senior tax or IT partner&#151;have to be approved under those arrangements? My second question repeats what I asked in the introduction of the clause stand-part debate: does subsection (3) mean that all those people are treated as the auditor for the purpose of the access rights and therefore the ability to trigger a criminal sanction under Clause 18? I wish to be clear on those aspects.

<P>
<A NAME="40223-38_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   In response to the first question, provided that the firm was approved, each individual would not have to be approved. The answer to the second question is that each individual would be liable to be sanctioned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-38_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   Does the Minister mean that each individual would be able to trigger the sanction, rather than be liable to it?

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 14, line 6, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40223-38_para18"></a><P>

<a name="40223-38_para19"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving the amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 35 and 36. They are probing amendments concerning the code of audit practice, which is clearly an important part of the local government audit framework that we are borrowing from England.
<P>

<a name="40223-38_para20"></a>The point of Amendment No. 34, which would delete subsection (4) of Clause 16, is to question the precise role of the Assembly in relation to the code. I can understand the Assembly's interest in the code, because it is the paymaster of local authorities and will want to look at the code. But my question is whether the Assembly can amend the code before giving its approval. I would not have thought that the Assembly would basically wish to do so, on account of its professional character and because that would undermine the authority of the Auditor General. The question is: can it do so? I would be grateful for the Minister's view on that.
<P>

<a name="40223-38_para21"></a>Amendment No. 35 leaves out subsection (7) because that provision is a mystery to us. Subsection (7) says that the code, even after it has been issued by the Auditor General and approved by the Assembly, can be annulled by statutory instrument in either House of Parliament. Will the Minister say why that power has been taken and in what circumstances it might be used? It seems to go too far from designing a solution fit for Wales.
<P>

<a name="40223-38_para22"></a>Amendment No. 36 is probing; it is intended to ascertain the role of the Audit Commission's code of practice in relation to local government audits in Wales. Clause 16 provides that the Auditor General may issue a code of audit practice. Clause 17 says that the auditor must comply with it. But Clause 17(4) says that "code of audit practice" means not only a Clause 16 code but also the code issued by the Audit Commission. Amendment No. 36 would remove that paragraph.
<P>

<a name="40223-38_para23"></a>Again, the Explanatory Notes are unhelpful in that respect. I am sorry to keep repeating that point, but it can become frustrating when Explanatory Notes give no further information and simply repeat the draft of the Bill. My question is: what relevance has the Audit Commission's code of practice to Wales? If the Auditor General is to issue his own code, why should Welsh local government auditors also have to comply with the English code, and what is to happen if the codes do not coincide in all respects? I beg to move.

<A NAME="40223-39_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for the way in which she has moved the amendment. Amendment No. 34 would remove the Assembly's ability to approve a draft code of practice in respect of the audit of local government bodies in <P>


<a name="column_GC53"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC53</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Wales before its introduction by the Auditor General. The code would incorporate best professional practice with respect to standards, procedures and techniques to be adopted by auditors in the exercise of their functions.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para0"></a>The provision enabling the Assembly to approve the code has been incorporated in the Bill as a result of representations made during pre-legislative scrutiny and public consultation on the draft Bill. We believe, therefore, that we have been meeting representations voiced in earlier stages of the drafting of the Bill. The Assembly would not have the power to amend, but Parliament has an interest through providing taxpayers' money. Existing arrangements are that the code of practice requires the approval of Parliament by affirmative resolution. We have no brief in the framework of this legislation to seek to take away what pertains to the existing England and Wales code of practice, subject to affirmative resolution.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para1"></a>The provision is included in the Bill because consultation representations indicated that it should be the basis of scrutiny of the code. It is appropriate that a code of practice discrete to Wales should be approved by the National Assembly, and that Parliament, should it wish, also has the opportunity to scrutinise the code and comment on it.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para2"></a>I am used to the Government being berated for seeking to keep things away from Parliament and Assembly scrutiny&#151;that is not novel&#151;but it is a refreshing experience to be berated today for overdoing both the degree of prior consultation and for subsequently creating the framework for scrutiny. It is on that basis that the Bill is drafted. Fairly significant sums of taxpayers' money fund local government services, and it is right that there should be an opportunity for democratic scrutiny of the way in which local government bodies are audited. It is not as if from time to time this has not been a matter for considerable public controversy and concern.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para3"></a>Amendment No. 36 has the effect of disapplying the extant code of audit practice for local government made under Section 4 of the Audit Commission Act 1998. It would mean that the Auditor General for Wales would have to prepare a Wales-only code of practice, and have it in place by 1 April 2005, with no flexibility for carrying forward and applying the existing code for England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para4"></a>One of the duties imposed on an appointed auditor of a local government body is to ensure that he or she complies with any code of audit practice applicable to the accounts being audited. The clause makes it clear that such a code of practice could be a discrete Welsh code introduced under Section 16 of the Public Audit (Wales) Act&#151;should it be enacted. It could also be the existing code of audit practice for local government enforced in relation to both England and Wales under Section 4 of the Audit Commission Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para5"></a>It is unnecessary to disapply the existing code, as the amendment seeks to do. That could create real operational difficulties for the Auditor General, particularly in the early days of the new arrangements. If for whatever reason the Auditor General was unable <P>


<a name="column_GC54"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column GC54</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to prepare a discrete code under what would be Section 16 by the implementation date, it would leave appointed auditors with no framework or instructions. The Committee will recognise that that would be untenable.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para6"></a>I recognise what the noble Baroness seeks to achieve but, given the time scales involved, we are engaged in a belt-and-braces operation to make absolutely sure that the profession is properly regulated, irrespective of developments over the next nine months.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-39_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. I shall deal with his last point first in relation to the two potential codes. I understand the issue about the transitional arrangements, although I would have thought that a year was quite enough for the Auditor General to produce a Welsh code. However, let us assume that he cannot do that by next year and it takes, say, another year. From April 2005, the code of audit practice will mean only a code prepared under Section 4 because there is not one issued under Clause 16.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para7"></a>The way in which the Bill is drafted means, however, that when a code is issued under Clause 16, if there is still a code under Section 4 of the Audit Commission Act&#151;which there will be&#151;the poor old auditors in Wales will have to comply with both. I put it to the Minister that the Bill does not reflect the fact that it is intended that the Auditor General's code should take over. So there could be two codes running in perpetuity. That is not the right position. I hope that the Minister will think about that.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para8"></a>As to consistency with the code of practice in England and Wales and all the scrutiny that goes with it, I remark merely that NHS audits no longer have a code of practice. So, despite all the arguments about the Assembly needing to look at that code of practice, there is not one. However, under the existing arrangements there is reference to a code of practice that applies to NHS audits. So perhaps there has been a little too much stress on how important the code of practice is and how important the scrutiny arrangements are. But that matter need not detain us further, certainly not today. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223-39_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </B>  The 26th Report of the Review Body on Senior Salaries, which makes recommendations about the pay of the senior Civil Service, senior military personnel and the judiciary, is being published today. Copies are in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. The Prime Minister is grateful to the chairman and members of the review body for their work.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para16"></a>The main recommendations of the review body for the senior Civil Service are:
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para17"></a>an increase from 1 April 2004 of 2 per cent to the pay ranges for each of the senior Civil Service pay bands below Permanent Secretary;
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para18"></a>a range of base pay awards from 0 to 9 per cent depending on performance;
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para19"></a>a minimum unconsolidated bonus payment of 3 per cent or &#163;2,500, whichever is the higher, for those making the greatest contribution; and
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para20"></a>an uplift to the pay range for Permanent Secretaries resulting in a new range of &#163;121,100 to &#163;256,550; the uplift is broadly equivalent to the increase proposed to the pay ranges for the senior Civil Service pay bands below Permanent Secretary.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para21"></a>The main recommendation of the review body for the senior military is an increase from 1 April 2004 of 2.8 per cent in the value of all points on the incremental pay scales for senior military officers.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para22"></a>The main recommendation of the review body for the judiciary is an increase from 1 April 2004 of 2.5 per cent in judicial salaries.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para23"></a>The Government have decided to accept these recommendations. Their cost will be met within existing departmental expenditure limits.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para24"></a>The review body has also recommended that broad salary linkage between its remit groups should be achieved from now on by maintaining general equivalence in salary levels at the top of the structures only. The Government will be considering this.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para25"></a>Pay increases for Members of Parliament and Ministers are linked automatically to the increase in pay bands for the senior Civil Service. Their pay entitlement will therefore increase by 2 per cent from 1 April 2004.

<a name="column_WS2"></a>

<B>23 Feb 2004 : Column WS2</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para26"></a>I have placed in the Libraries of both Houses a copy of DfID's Interim Country Assistance Plan for Iraq. It sets out how DfID aims to contribute to the reconstruction of Iraq in the period up to March 2006. I have also decided to make an initial contribution of  &#163;65 million (120 million US dollars) to the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq, managed by the World Bank and United Nations, out of the resources pledged by the United Kingdom for the reconstruction of Iraq at the Madrid donors conference in October 2003 (see my Written Statement of 14 October 2003: Cols. 9&#150;10WS).
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para27"></a>Saddam Hussein's tyranny led to a significant increase in poverty and Iraq was isolated from the rest of the world, including its own region, for much of his rule. In many respects Iraq's social and economic indicators now resemble those of a low-income country rather than a major oil producer. But Iraq's abundant human and natural resources offer the potential for a rapid return to relative prosperity, if the right conditions are created in the short and medium term.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para28"></a>Against this background, DfID's objectives for the next two years are to support: rapid, sustainable and equitable economic growth; effective and accountable governance; and social and political cohesion and stability.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para29"></a>To work towards these goals DfID will focus on three levels:
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para30"></a>Internationally: by supporting the United Nations and World Bank International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI), assisting the Ministry of Planning and Development Co-operation, and continuing dialogue with other donors on the coordination and effectiveness of assistance to Iraq.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para31"></a>Nationally: by funding projects which benefit the poor, promote an inclusive political process and economic reform, and strengthen public administration. Examples include: helping the growth of small and medium-sized businesses; setting up a fund to support the participation of citizens, parties and interest groups in the political process; and technical assistance to Iraq's public administration system.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para32"></a>In southern Iraq: by funding projects to reduce poverty and helping to restore the area's administrative and political links with Baghdad so that it can benefit from Iraq's national development efforts.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para33"></a>At the Madrid donors conference, the United Kingdom pledged a total of &#163;544 million for the period from April 2003 to March 2006, a significant proportion of which would be channelled through the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI). The allocation of our initial contribution between the UN and the World Bank Trust Funds will be decided shortly. Any further DfID contributions to the funds will be considered in the light of the effectiveness of their operations and their need for additional funding.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para34"></a>A total of over 32 billion dollars was pledged to Iraq at the Madrid conference. These pledges, together with a substantial reduction in Iraq's debt which should be negotiated this year, will provide a sound basis for the country's initial reconstruction. If the right steps are taken now, and the political situation in the country is stabilised, much of Iraq's longer-term investment needs should be met by commercial loans, foreign direct investment and its own resources. Iraq's human capital, and its oil reserves of about 2,500 billion dollars at current prices, should enable it to meet its future needs without significant external grant assistance.
<P>

<a name="40223-39_para35"></a>The country assistance plan is also available on the DfID website: www.dfid.gov.uk.

<P>

<a name="40223-40_para0"></a>The 2004 report of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body has been published today. Copies of the report are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. I wish to express my thanks to the chairman and members of the review body for their clear and wide-ranging report.
<P>

<a name="40223-40_para1"></a>The AFPRB has recommended an increase in basic military salary of 2.8 per cent for the majority of personnel and 3.2 per cent for certain Privates and Lance Corporals (those on the lower pay range). The AFPRB has also recommended increases in the rates of specialist pay (for example, flying pay, submarine pay, diving pay and hydrographic pay), and in accommodation charges. The AFPRB has also recommended a 3.2 per cent increase to rates of longer separated service allowance and longer service at sea bonus which are designed to compensate for separation.
<P>

<a name="40223-40_para2"></a>The additional cost to the defence budget will be &#163;196 million. This will be met within existing departmental expenditure limits.

<P>
<UL>How much humanitarian and development aid to southern Sudan in 2004 has been earmarked for (a) United Nations programmes; (b) local and international non-governmental organisations; and (c) organisations taking part in the peace process.[HL965]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w01_spmin0"></A><B> Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos):</B>  As indicated in our Country Engagement Paper (CEP) we intend to work with a range of partners&#151;including the UN, Red Cross and international non-governmental organisations (INGOs). We will continue to support organisations involved in the peace process, such as the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) Secretariat; the Joint Military Commission (JMC); and the Verification and Monitoring Team (VMT), as long as is required.

<A NAME="40223w01_wqn1"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government: 
<P>
<UL>What will be the effect of the peace agreement on the existing United Kingdom budget for southern Sudan; and what funds are allocated to post-conflict reconstruction.[HL966]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Amos:  </B>  We intend to increase our programme in Sudan substantially if a peace agreement is reached and implemented. Initially, the majority of our resources will contine to go towards humanitarian needs, but with a greater emphasis towards longer-term development, post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction. Work on implementation of the peace agreement, for example local-level peace building and reintegration of ex-combatants, will require early funding.

<P>
<UL>Whether in the light of the statement by the Prime Minister of 29 January, a main objective of the appointment of the Hutton inquiry was to secure the withdrawal of an accusation against the Prime Minister.[HL1140]<P></UL>

<a name="40223w01_sbhd3"></a><H3><center>Iraq: Unemployment</center></H3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w01_wqn4"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How the current estimated rate of unemployment in Iraq compares with the rate one year previously.[HL1243]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   No official figures of the Iraqi labour force exist, so only broad estimates of unemployment are possible. Current estimates suggest neither a significant rise nor fall in unemployment over the last year. The United Nations and World Bank social and economic needs assessments on Iraq last year estimated that the unemployment rate before the 2003 war was around 30 per cent. Unofficial estimates of the current unemployment rate are in the range of 20 to 30 per cent.
<P>

<a name="40223w01_para1"></a>In addition to the numbers unemployed, a significant proportion of Iraq's workforce is underemployed. We estimate that the total of both unemployed and underemployed is currently in the region of 50 per cent. Figures for underemployment before the conflict do not exist.

<a name="40223w01_sbhd4"></a><H3><center>Iraq: Water Supply</center></H3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w01_wqn5"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is their current estimate of the percentage of Iraq's population which has access to drinking water; and what is their estimate of that statistic one year previously.[HL1244]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   Until the Gulf War in 1991 safe water was accessible by over 95 per cent of the urban and 75 per cent of the rural populations of Iraq. The last reliable pre-conflict figures are for the year 2000 and indicate that by that time coverage had dropped to 92 per cent and 46 per cent respectively. Deterioration of the system was particularly bad in the south, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>including Basrah, due to the policies of the former regime.
<P>

<a name="40223w01_para2"></a>As a consequence of the conflict and subsequent looting it was estimated that the water sub-sector coverage deteriorated by an additional 50 per cent in some governorates, leading to intermittent supply and further degraded water quality. Overall, approximate estimates indicate that the immediate post-conflict coverage had fallen to 60 per cent of the urban and 30 per cent of the rural populations.
<P>

<a name="40223w01_para3"></a>In Baghdad, compact water treatment units have now been rehabilitated. Measures to secure water treatment plants and prevent further looting have also been implemented. Hundreds of critical breaks in the water network have been repaired, increasing flow by 2 million litres per day. Additional new construction is ongoing at Baghdad's Sharkh Dijlah plant, which will add 40 per cent or 2.25 million litres per day to the water supply of eastern Baghdad by May 2004, benefiting 640,000 residents.
<P>

<a name="40223w01_para4"></a>In Basrah, rehabilitation work has restored the water supply to pre-conflict levels and by spring 2004 the quality and volume of fully treated water supplied to Basrah will surpass the pre-war conditions of 17,000 cubic metres per hour of partially treated water. By the summer of 2004 rehabilitation of the Sweet Water Canal, which supplies water to Basrah, will be completed. This will allow its design capacity to be achieved, further benefiting 1.75 million residents.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   In addition to the funding which I set out in my reply to my noble friend's previous question about support for extended schools, the Department for Education and Skills has made &#163;75 million available through the Standards Fund for study support (out of school hours) activities in 2003&#150;04. From 2004&#150;05 the funding has been amalgamated into the School Development Grant and schools should expect to receive the same amount for study support as they did last year plus 4 per cent inflation proofing. The New Opportunities Fund is also providing just over &#163;20 million to support out of school hour sports opportunities in schools within the school sport partnership programme&#151;a third of schools in England are already within a partnership.

<P>
<UL>Whether they are satisfied with the development to date of the Connexions Service; how many local authority areas are now covered by the service; and what services they are currently providing or procuring for young people.[HL1199]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland:  </B>  The Connexions Service has made excellent progress since its launch on a phased basis in 2001. The network of Connexions Partnerships was completed in April 2003 covering every local authority in England.
<P>

<a name="40223w01_para5"></a>The Connexions Service is on course to meet its main target of reducing the proportion of young people aged 16 to 18 who are not in education, employment or training by 10 per cent by November 2004. Research commissioned by the Department for Education and Skills has concluded that joint working between agencies providing services for young people has improved since Connexions was launched. In another departmental survey, young people rated the Connexions Service highly: over 90 per cent of those who had used Connexions were satisfied with the services provided.
<P>

<a name="40223w01_para6"></a>Connexions offers initial information and advice on the full range of learning options to 19 and beyond; in depth guidance and support, or access to specialist help, on anything that might prove a barrier to learning; and access to personal development opportunities to help a young person grow into a rounded independent citizen. In offering development opportunities and personal support, Connexions works with youth and social services, health services and a range of voluntary and community organisations. The service is available in Connexions one-stop shops and community access points; and in schools and colleges. Over 2 million visits were made by young people to Connexions front-line services in 2003. All young people will have access to advice and <P>

<A NAME="40223w02_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Northbourne </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What steps they are taking to provide activities such as sport and outdoor adventure pursuits so as to provide outlets for the aggression and energy which are normal characteristics of adolescent males.[HL1200]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   PE and school sport, including outdoor and adventurous activities, play an important role in school life. They help to raise standards, improve attendance, behaviour and health and help to develop social skills.
<P>

<a name="40223w02_para0"></a>The Government are committing over &#163;1 billion to implement a national PE, School Sport and Club Links strategy. We want all children to spend at least two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport and have set an ambitious joint DfES/DCMS to increase the percentage of 5&#150;16 year olds who receive this entitlement to 75 per cent by 2006.
<P>

<a name="40223w02_para1"></a>Outdoor and adventurous activities are one of six areas of activity for which programmes of study have been drawn up within the national curriculum for physical education.
<P>

<a name="40223w02_para2"></a>In addition, the Positive Activities for Young People programme is designed to divert and develop those young people aged eight to 19 most at risk of social exclusion and committing crime. It is being delivered across England from May 2003 to March 2006;
&#163;25 million is available for the first year of the programme. This will deliver a minimum 22,000 places from midday to 9.00 pm each day of the school holidays.
<P>

<a name="40223w02_para3"></a>Provision will take place in all of the school holiday periods. In addition to the activities themselves, one to one support is available for the young people most at risk. The activities cover sport, the arts, and education and personal development. The sport activities include, among others; canoeing; climbing; abseiling and sailing. A residential experience is used as a reward to encourage young people to participate in the programme or to modify their behaviour, for example, by improving their attendance at school.

A formal in-service date will be set at the main investment decision point due later this year but we plan to deliver capability from 2006. Operational requirements are regularly reviewed and decisions on equipment acquisition are made on the basis of what military capability we need and how best to provide it. If we decided there was a requirement to provide this capability before WATCHKEEPER comes into service, it would be normal practice to consider a range of solutions, of which equipment acquisition and, if appropriate, the acquisition of a UAV would be one possibility.

<A NAME="40223w02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   The Reserve Forces Act 1996 sets out specific time limits for mobilised service under different call out orders, which limits the length of deployment for Reservists, including those from the Defence Medical Services. In addition to these limits, the Surgeon General has directed that, as appropriate, we should aim to mobilise Reservists in critical specialities for no more than three months in any 12-month period in order to prevent skill fade.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   There are no plans to set up a joint Franco-British defence force. There have, however, been recent trilateral proposals to develop capabilities in support of the EU's ability to undertake rapid crisis response operations. These advance the declaration made on 24 November at the Anglo-French Summit, and the greater demand for rapid reaction peacekeeping forces from the UN. As part of the Helsinki Headline Goal, member states agreed to develop rapid response elements available and deployable at very high readiness. The British, French and German Governments are proposing that EU member states create battle group-sized forces (1,500 strong including combat support and combat service support), deployable within 15 days, and sustainable for 30 days (but extendable up to 120 days). These battle groups would be available by 2007, and designed for compatibility with typical UN Chapter VII mandates (to restore international peace and <P>

<P>
<UL>What estimate they have made of how much tax compliance cost British business in the past financial year.[HL1119]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   Reliably estimating the level of tax compliance costs is difficult, in part because it is often not possible to separate these from the costs that would be incurred anyway for financial management purposes.
<P>

<a name="40223w03_para0"></a>But the Government are committed to reducing tax compliance costs where this can be done consistently with their other objectives and are reducing such costs through means such as simplificiation and by providing better support or guidance and well targeted exemptions.
<P>

<a name="40223w03_para1"></a>Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise both have public service agreement targets to reduce compliance costs. They assess the impact of proposed changes to tax policy and its implementation that could impact on compliance costs. For major measures this is quantified using regulatory impact assessment methodology following Cabinet Office guidelines and the results are published.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham:  </B>  Payments to thalidomide victims are made from the Thalidomide Trust, which was set up in 1973 under the agreement with Distillers (the manufacturers of the drug). Income payments from this trust are taxable on the beneficiaries under the normal trust income tax rules.
<P>

<a name="40223w03_para2"></a>Payments following a settlement of a claim or action for damages for personal injury can be made in a number of ways, some where the payments are taxable in the hands of the recipient and some where they are not. For instance, it is possible for regular payments made under a structured settlement to be exempt from tax under legislation introduced in 1996, provided the settlement meets the conditions of that legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham:  </B>  No. While precise numbers are impossible to calculate we believe that the 210,000 estimate&#151;extrapolated from a telephone poll conducted on behalf of AXA in August&#150;September 2002&#151;overstates non-compliance.

<a name="40223w03_para12"></a>This equates to 0.5 per cent non-compliance or about 10,000 organisations out of about 1.2 million enterprises with employees in the UK. Further research conducted by the Small Business Service (SBS) while falling short of 99.5 per cent compliance also suggests a much higher level of compliance than the AXA estimate.

<A NAME="40223w04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   In order for the network of EIS facilities to be sustainable they have been underpinned by regional and community use when not being used by elite athletes. In general the usage split is 80 per cent community use and 20 per cent elite. This balance gives elite athletes the dedicated training time they need while ensuring that the centres are viable and are also a real community asset, motivating young athletes to aspire to high standards of performance. However, where EIS facilites are based at university sites, where there are relatively large numbers of elite athletes, then the split between elite and non-elite use is 40 per cent elite and 60 per cent student/community.

<P>

<a name="40223w04_para2"></a>The ONS Pensions Contributions Statistics Review (published in October 2002) identified a lack of clarity with how insurance companies record data on pensions contributions in the ONS survey of insurance companies and pension funds, and recommended a study into how insurance companies are completing the survey questionnaire. The results of this study confirm past expectations of double counting and extended the range of possible reasons. As a result, the Office for National Statistics has reviewed the questionnaires. The study provided no information about the total level of double counting, or any ways in which this might be offset by under-coverage. The revised questionnaires include more detailed guidance for insurance companies and ask for more detailed data. New questionnaires have been prepared for use from the first calendar quarter of 2004 and for the 2003 annual survey.
<P>

<a name="40223w04_para3"></a>The quarterly results will be reported on the new basis during 2004. The effect of any double counting will not be known precisely until early in 2005 when the annual survey for 2003, using the new questionnaire, can be compared with the original quarterly results for that year.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey:  </B>  The Government have received representations from various sporting bodies about the proposal to raise the minimum pension age to 55 by 2010. Having considered these, the Government propose to allow sports-people and others in pension schemes at 5 April 2005 (A Day) to keep any existing right to take benefits before the new minimum pension age. This is subject to those rights being tested against a reduced lifetime allowance and <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the full pension being vested at the early retirement age.
<P>

<a name="40223w04_para11"></a>However, the Government continue to believe that the new minimum pension age of 55 should apply to all pension schemes by 2010. So, sports-people and others not covered by above relaxation, and who believe their career is likely to end before they reach the new minimum pension age, will need to make financial provision in addition to their pension savings to cover the cost of retraining and other needs.

<P>
<A NAME="40223w04_wqn6"></A><B> Lord Moynihan  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What estimate has been made of the savings to Her Majesty's Treasury arising from any decision to remove the ability of professional sportsmen to draw their pensions at the age of 35.[HL1193]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey:  </B>  The proposal to raise the minimum pension age to 55 by 2010 is part of a package of proposals that will give the vast majority of people the opportunity to save more for their retirement. The Government already spends around &#163;13 billion (net) a year on pension tax relief and the additional cost of the simplification proposals will be around &#163;300 million a year within five years of implementation.

<P>

<a name="40223w04_para13"></a>The National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales has been asked to reply to your recent question asking what is the estimated number of Roma people who are United Kingdom citizens and are currently resident in this country. I am replying in his absence (HL1213).
<P>

<a name="40223w04_para14"></a>Information in relation to England and Wales has been compiled from the 2001 Census. The 2001 Census question on ethnic group did not include a tick box for 'Roma' but provided the opportunity for people to describe their ethnic group in any way they wished if they considered that none of the tick box categories was appropriate to them. There were 1,710 persons usually resident in England and Wales who wrote in descriptions of themselves as 'Gypsy' or 'Romany' in response to the question on ethnic group. There were a further 509 persons who described themselves as 'Traveller'. These figures have been taken from Commissioned Table M221. It is not possible to identify how many of these were United Kingdom citizens, since the Census did not ask a question on citizenship.
<P>

<a name="40223w04_para15"></a>Commissioned tables can be obtained from Census Customer Services at the Office for National Statistics (email: census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk).

Page 10 of Budget 1997, Equipping Britain for our long-term future, [HC85], sets out figures for the current budget as a ratio of GDP from 1985&#150;86 to 1996&#150;97. Page 47 of the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report 1998, Stability and investment for the long-term, [Cm 3978] outlines progress against the golden rule from 1997&#150;98 to 2003&#150;04.

<P>

<a name="40223w06_para1"></a>As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about whether the Office for National Statistics treats Ulster Scots as a separate ethnic group (HL1326).
<P>

<a name="40223w06_para2"></a>There is no single ethnic classification which is used throughout the UK. National Statistics guidance "A guide for the collection and classification of ethnicity data" has recently been published and this recommends ethnic group classifications based on those used in the 2001 Census. However, both Scotland and Northern Ireland used different ethnic group classifications on their censuses from that used in England and Wales and this is reflected in the guidance. This reply relates to the classification used in England and Wales only. The classifications used in Scotland and Northen Ireland are the responsibility of the Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency respectively.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40223w06_para3"></a>The guidance does not recommend the use of a separate "Ulster Scots" category when asking questions on either ethnicity or national identity in England and Wales. However, it does recommend that there is always an option for people to describe their ethnicity or national identity in their own words.
<P>

<a name="40223w06_para4"></a>A central principle of the National Statistics guidance on ethnicity and identity is that people should be able to choose a category that adequately describes them. However, it would be impossible to list every possible ethnic category in our classification, since the list would become too long and unwieldy. Moreover the data collected from any sample survey would not be useable in practice because each category would contain too few people for us to be able to carry out meaningful statistical analyses. Instead we have listed a limited number of categories which reflect and distinguish between the significant groups present in England and Wales today.
<P>

<a name="40223w06_para5"></a>The 2001 Census in England and Wales did not include a separate tick box for "Ulster Scots" at the ethnicity question. There was however the opportunity for people to write in their own answers if they felt none of the tick box options were suitable. Everyone who wrote in "Ulster Scots" was counted separately. In England and Wales a total of 56 people described their ethnicity in this way.

<P>
<UL>Further to the Written Answer by Lord McIntosh of Haringey on 5 February (WA 116) and the letter from the National Statistician, why the average annual percentage growth rate from 1997 to 2002 has dropped below trend at 1.6 per cent when the average annual percentage growth rate in the whole country output per job from 1961 to 2002 was 2.1 per cent.[HL1354]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey:  </B>  Productivity growth is subject to cyclical variation, and so comparisons of productivity performance over time are better made over complete economic cycles rather than arbitrary time periods. The 2003 Pre-Budget Report (Cm 6042, table A2) judged that trend growth in output per hour worked over the last economic cycle between 1997H1 and 2001Q3 was 2.44 per cent a year. This compares with a figure of 2.05 per cent over the previous cycle (1986Q2 to 1997H1).

<P>

<a name="40223w06_para6"></a>Fitness for Purpose promotes better inspection and regulation of tourist accommodation as a way of tackling poor safety and trading standards to ensure that minimum legal requirements are met. It is targeted at hotels (and the restaurants within them) guesthouses, pubs with accommodation and bed-and-breakfast establishments that are failing to meet minimum legal requirements, in order to help them to improve. It aims to take a lighter regulatory enforcement touch to well-run businesses that are already complying with the necessary regulations.
<P>

<a name="40223w06_para7"></a>Six local authorities piloted the scheme last year. These were: Blackpool, Bournemouth, LB Camden, Canterbury, LB Greenwich and West Sussex. Each pilot took a tailored approach to the needs of their area. All the authorities concentrated on better working between different parts of local authority enforcement activity and tourism officers and sharing of information. Canterbury's pilot resulted in the pooling of information held on eight different databases.
<P>

<a name="40223w06_para8"></a>Richard Caborn, Minister for Sport and Tourism, expects to receive the final evaluation report of the pilots shortly and will be considering how best to take the project forward, based on these results.

Negotiations between EP and Defence Estates (DE), the owners of the site, are continuing. The marketing of the site by DE pre-dated the introduction at the end of October 2003 of revised guidance on the disposal of surplus public sector land. The guidance has been issued to departments and sponsored bodies and will be formally included in Chapter 24 of Government Accounting soon. Now that the new procedures for handling surplus public sector land are in place, in future public sector bodies will have the opportunity to seek to acquire surplus land before it is offered to the open market.

Other public sector bodies then have a period of 40 working days to register an interest in acquiring the site. If an interest is registered, and the disposing body accepts the proposal, the site will not be offered for sale on the open market.

The Sexual Offences Act 2003, which we anticipate is coming into force in May 2004, includes offences covering trafficking into, within and out of the United Kingdom. A new offence covering trafficking for the purposes of forced labour and removal of organs, is included in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Bill, which is currently before Parliament. These legislative measures, once brought into force, will enable us to ratify the United Nations Trafficking Protocol, as well as fulfilling our obligations under the European Union Framework Decision on Trafficking for the Purposes of Sexual and Labour Exploitation.

Section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 makes it an offence simply to possess such a photograph. Downloading an image from the Internet constitutes an offence of "making", and having such an image even in the form of electronic data constitutes possession. Placing such an image on an Internet site would constitute distribution. There are statutory defences to these offences. Currently a photograph is covered by this legislation if the child depicted is under 16, but this age will be increased to under 18 by the Sexual Offences Act, 2003 when it comes into force later this year. The Sexual Offence Act 2003 also includes a new offence at Section 12, of causing a child to watch a sexual act, which would include showing a child an image of sexual activity, for the purpose of sexual gratification.
<P>

<a name="40223w07_para0"></a>The Obscene Publications Act 1959 makes it an offence to publish material that is likely to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely to see, hear or read it. Publishing can include showing such material on an Internet site. Possession of such material for gain was made an offence in the Obscene Publications Act 1964.

There is an ongoing exchange of information between the UK and other countries both formally, for example, under the auspices of the G8 strategy on "Protecting Children from Sexual Exploitation on the Internet" and informally between officials which continues to add to our knowledge of the legislative position in other countries and supports our co-operation with them.

<A NAME="40223w08_wqn0"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the United Kingdom is a party to any international treaties of legal obligations which seek to prohibit pornographic or paedophilic images on the Internet.[HL1227]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The United Kingdom is fully involved with international initiatives to combat the circulation of indecent images of children via the Internet. The Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention, signed in November 2001, aims to provide for common definitions and minimum standards for offences concerning child abuse images handled on computers. It also seeks to provide for investigative methods appropriate for the offences and for collecting evidence in an electronic form, and to define measures to ensure effective international co-operation. The UK is also signatory to a Council of the European Union Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, which is broader as it covers behaviour on or offline. In addition, the e-commerce directive, under Article 19, lays a general obligation on member states to co-operate with each other in dealing with cross-border complaints about online services.
<P>

<a name="40223w08_para0"></a>In the G8 group a strategy on "Protecting Children from Sexual Exploitation on the Internet" was adopted in October 2002. The strategy is designed to complement existing national and international initiatives, and has eight key objectives addressing: information and intelligence gathering, dissemination and sharing; victim identification; suspect location; legislation; law enforcement tools and training; industry and NGO co-operation; awareness building and prevention; and international co-operation. An important element of the strategy is an international child pornography image database. The database aims to act as a global respository of images with the capacity to carry out automated analysis. It would be a significant tool for law enforcement contributing to the identification of victims and offenders and analysis of images to establish locations and other linkages. An implementation study is currently being undertaken. The G8 has also established a network operating 24 hours a day for the exchange of information in investigations involving electronic evidence that require urgent assistance from foreign law enforcement, which now involves 33 countries.

<P>
<UL>Which Government department has responsibility for receiving or dealing with complaints about the showing of pornographic or paedophilic images on the Internet.[HL1228]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal:  </B>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department has responsibility for this area of the criminal law.
<P>

<a name="40223w08_para2"></a>Pornography is not defined in law, but the Obscene Publications Act 1959 covers material which is considered by the courts as tending to "deprave and corrupt" those who read, see or hear it. The Protection of Children Act 1978 (as amended) covers the taking, making, distribution or simple possession of indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children. This legislation applies equally to the Internet as to other media.
<P>

<a name="40223w08_para3"></a>Internet users can report potentially illegal material to the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) via their website (www.iwf.org.uk) or to the police.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w08_wqn2"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government: 
<P>
<UL>Whether they are satisfied that the present non-statutory Internet Watch arrangements are sufficient to deal with the trade in pornographic and paedophilic images; and, if not, what further action they intend to take.[HL1230]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40223w08_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal:  </B>  The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) is an industry-funded body which allows anyone to report the presence of images of child abuse anywhere in the world. The foundation determines whether the reported website carries potentially illegal material, and passes details of illegal material to the relevant law enforcement agencies to initiate action against the originators. Where the site is hosted within the UK, law enforcement will seek its removal with the relevant Internet service provider (ISP) and this procedure has been extremely successful in practice. The IWF is providing an invaluable service dealing with 21,341 reports in 2002, 9,602 of which contained potentially illegal content: it is significant that in 2002 only 2 per cent of sites reported to the IWF that contained indecent photographs of children were hosted within the UK, the bulk being hosted in the USA, Russia, and some other European states. In respect of adult pornography, we are confident in the ability of the IWF to identify material that is potentially in breach of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 in response to complaints, and to refer to the police any which is hosted within the UK.

<P>
<A NAME="40223w09_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Regulation (EC) No. 1760/2000, as regards the labelling of beef and beef products, is enforced in the UK under the Beef Labelling (Enforcement) Regulations 2000, which give powers to enforcement officers to undertake inspections. In England and Wales, where responsibility for the legislation lies with Defra and the Welsh Assembly Government, enforcement is undertaken by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) at slaughterhouses, cutting plants etc, and by Local Authorities at points of sale to the consumer. In Scotland, enforcement is by SEERAD and in Northern Ireland by DARDNI. The labelling requirements in Regulation (EC) No. 1760/2000 applies only to fresh and frozen beef and veal, and mince; labelling of other meats and meat products is the responsibility of the Food Standards Agency (FSA).
