As he knows, there has been great cross-party support for the Olympic project, but with the squabbles between the Mayor of London and the Secretary of State about who pays for any overruns, and whether there are any, and the allegations made by the former chairman of the ODA, there is a great risk that the public will lose confidence in the cost control of this project and be concerned about who will finally bear the cost of the Olympics. When will the Government demonstrate that they are clearly in control of the budget and that it is transparent? When will they start to sell the regeneration benefits of the Olympics?</p>

At no time did he say that he was worried about mushrooming costs. He chaired the committee meeting in September at which engineers said that there was nothing in the soil on the Olympic site that they had not anticipated. I believe that a lot of the press comment is centred on the interview that Mr Lemley gave in America. We are now ready to present to the world that the fact that we are having the Olympics here is one of the greatest achievements in recent sporting history.</p>

The London Organising Committee is registered for VAT in the normal way, so it may reclaim VAT. When the bid was submitted, the tax status of the proposed Olympic Delivery Authority was unknown and the necessary legislation was yet to be introduced in Parliament, so the cost estimates included in the file excluded VAT. The problem arises because the ODA is not a trading body, but the Government are currently considering tax costs as part of their wider consideration of the overall budget.</p>

Although we believe in the legacy, can he assure the House that expenditure on legacy and regeneration will not be at the expense of the facilities for the world&#146;s athletes?</p>

It would be pointless if the Government allowed the legacy of the Olympic Games to be imperilled by movement of money, one way or the other. The legacy has a separate heading; there are great, interesting and exciting plans to make that part of London absolutely terrific, including a park that will be the largest new park to have been built in Europe for 150 years. As I said, a great deal of work is being done on the final budget, which we hope will be ready for presentation to Parliament in the first part of next year.</p>

It may reassure those who are concerned about this venture that we now have a delivery partner. There are three companies in the consortium, all of which have worked on five previous Olympic Games, both summer and winter, and are working on two forthcoming Games. They have also played a key role in the huge construction programme for Terminal 5, which, as noble Lords may have read in the papers yesterday, will be delivered a year ahead of schedule.</p>

I hope he brings a bit of Christmas cheer to the people who have been awaiting their payment since 2005. By comparison, under the devolved Administration in Scotland, 70 per cent of farmers will receive their 2006 payment by Christmas this year. I am aware that the devolved Administrations have a different payment scheme; however, in Germany, which has a similar system to England&#146;s, farmers expect a full payment by the end of December this year. If Germany can do it, why can&#146;t we?</p>

The Statement was about how we would operate for 2006. We are actively working on it daily with the Rural Payments Agency and its staff, and we want to make a success of it so that the system is better in 2006 than in 2005. I am not prepared to go beyond that Statement at present.</p>

Of the 480 claims for which a full payment is due&#151;in other words, for which nothing has been paid&#151;the top 10 in terms of monetary value all relate to probate cases. I cannot go beyond that. That is no different from what would have happened under the old IACS payment system. The claims are incredibly complicated, but I cannot give a monetary value. The top-up claims would constitute approximately 20 per cent of the total claim, it being 80 per cent of the initial payment.</p>

Whereas 480 claimants were awaiting full payment on 14 December, a week before, on 6 December, the figure was 911. Similarly, the number awaiting top-up claims on 6 December was double the figure I gave for 14 December. The payments are going out. We want to complete the 2005 payments as soon as possible, but because of the complexities of claims, particularly involving business relationships and probate, it will take some time, as was the case under the previous system.</p>

The single payment was crucial. Of course, there is another consequence: the hill farmer allowance has also been delayed, although few now remain to be paid. Our priority has been to complete the single payments. There is a complication, although we do not want it to be so. We need to close down the 2005 year as quickly as we can because that has delayed the start of the 2006 payments. We do not want a crossover. That has been an overall priority. We need to do better next year than we did this year. If we did not prioritise resources the situation would not be very good, but I accept that it has had a consequence on other schemes.</p>

The situation was crazy. The farmer said, &#147;You can&#146;t do it&#148;. We cannot accept that.

We paid out the claims within 1 per cent of the legal limit by 30 June. We were required to pay out 96.15 per cent of the money; we have paid out around 94.9 per cent. Everybody knew that the window was from 1 December to 30 June. I agree that farmers were promised the money earlier, and we failed on that. However, we met our legal obligations, and we are paying interest on the claims not met by 30 June.</p>

<a name="61218-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="0612186000050"></a>The Question was as follows:</p>

The common fisheries policy provides a framework for co-operation at European Union level. The UK Government continue to play an active role in negotiating improvements to the policy designed to provide more sustainable long-term fisheries management. We are working to ensure that depleted stocks are recovered and subsequently conserved, while at the same time delivering, in so far as we can, a viable future for the fishing industry.</p>

What representations are the UK Government making to the European Council of Ministers for greater protection of our fish stocks? First, does that include the continuation of discards and the hoovering of sand eels, a practice that I believe has been banned? Secondly, have the UK Government looked into the effect of climate change on the marine environment? Does the Minister consider that the North Sea has become too warm for cod, or does he believe that the cause of the cod&#146;s demise is the success of other species&#146; revival?</p>

I understand that only a slight change in temperature&#151;maybe one degree or less&#151;is required, particularly in the North Sea and the Irish Sea, and, before we know it, the fish stocks that we are used to having will have disappeared. They may have gone elsewhere, but the fact is that there will be a massive change if sea temperatures change dramatically. Half a degree to one degree is a dramatic change in temperature. So there is certainly a climate change impact on this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="0612186000054"></a>On what we are trying to do with the European Union, the environment council and the fisheries council are meeting this week in Brussels, as the noble Baroness and the House will be aware. The fishing Minister is there. The European Commission recently published a proposal for the regulation that will set total allowable catches and quotas for 2007. Given the poor status of some of the key stocks, it is likely to be a significant challenge to deliver the necessary stock recovery while ensuring the viability of the UK fleet. As far as possible, we will be guided by scientific advice&#151;we have to be guided by it&#151;but we have to balance that with ensuring that we maintain a viable UK fishing fleet.</p>

Would it not have been better to have kept control of that great asset, to have nurtured our national fishing industry, and to have leased any surplus fish to other countries?</p>

I apologise for not referring to sand eels in the previous answer, because this is important. At the very most, the total allowable catch for 2007 could be 400,000 tonnes. The catch used to be 1 million tonnes and this year the fishery will close completely in August, so efforts are being made to protect sand eels. However, I understand that the system is a bit more complicated this year than the one prevailing last year.</p>

He also increased the mesh size, so that fewer juvenile fish were caught. Those were both sensible measures for preserving the stock. But does that rule, which applies to UK fishermen, apply to all nationalities fishing in UK waters? The commercial fishermen down in the south-west are concerned, because they believe that the rule does not apply to other people fishing in UK waters, who are able to land fish of the old size of 36 centimetres, thereby undermining the Minister&#146;s decision.</p>

However, I understand that those who are allowed to fish in UK waters&#151;for historical reasons, it is not a free-for-all among all European Union members within the six to 12-mile limit&#151;and land in the UK are fishing in competition with our own fishermen. To say that there should be a level playing field may not be quite right, but the mesh sizes ought to be the same.</p>

Having been to the fishing laboratory at Lowestoft, which is unquestionably a world leader in work on both climate and fishing, I know that the information that the scientists get from the sea and from catches is enormously beneficial. The fact is that the stocks are not there as they used to be; we ignore that at our peril. We want to balance and maintain a fishing industry but, if we overfish year after year, we should not be surprised if the stocks disappear. I can tell my noble friend that the science is world-class, but I cannot comment on the efforts or ranking of our economic science forecasts.</p>

I should stress that building regulations have already raised energy-efficiency standards by 40 per cent during the past five years and there are planning requirements for renewable energy in many areas. We see this as building on existing best practice, including, I should stress, that established by the Academy of St Francis of Assisi in Liverpool, which was pioneered by the right reverend Prelate and has been dubbed Britain's greenest school.

It can bring great expertise to bear and is helping local authorities, especially smaller ones, which may not have the expertise to develop their plans as effectively as they would like.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="0612186000069"></a>On sustainable design, a requirement is set by my department that, as a condition of funding for all new build and refurbishments costing more than &#163;500,000 for primary schools and &#163;2 million for secondary schools, those schools must achieve a standard of very good or excellent in the Building Research Establishment&#146;s environmental assessment method for schools, called the BREEAM schools standard.

This is a process of education, not merely setting high standards in public design and construction. The Academy of St Francis of Assisi in Liverpool and other schools which take their environmental duties seriously place great emphasis on the study of environmental sciences at GCSE and on integrating environmental studies into the curriculum of the whole school, not simply its design.</p>

That is generally welcomed in the area, but is the Minister aware that, at the same time, the budget for transport of pupils to schools set by Lancashire County Council is under severe pressure and is being cut year on year? Is it not ridiculous that children at those new schools will have to be taken there by their parents on the school run?

The resources available for education from central Government to the county council have been rising substantially in real terms, year on year. It is up to county councils, which are democratically accountable to their electors, what decisions they take about allocating resources to school transport as against other priorities within their revenue budgets. I stress that their revenue budget has been rising substantially, so that is an issue for them. I stress that no cuts are being forced on them by central Government.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="0612186000228"></a>Page 4, line 11, at end insert-</p>
</ul> &#147;(4) For the avoidance of doubt, should ownership of the London Stock Exchange or other principal financial exchange pass into the hands of a foreign entity, supervision and control of that exchange shall remain in the hands of the supervisory bodies already established for those purposes in the United Kingdom.&#148;
<a name="61218-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0612186000095"></a>The noble Lord said: I much regret that I was unable to be present when the Bill was given its Second Reading last week. The issues that need attention were addressed by Mr Balls, the Economic Secretary, in another place on 28 November and by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, in this House on 11 December. The Economic Secretary said very clearly that ownership of the Stock Exchange was not a cause for concern, but that a change of ownership should not affect the existing regulatory regime. I heartily agree with that view, but unfortunately it was not included in the text of the Bill as it now stands. Instead, the Bill confers powers on the regulator&#151;the FSA&#151;to disallow excessive regulatory provision. The sole purpose of my amendment is to remedy the omission&#151;namely, the reassurance regarding the change of ownership, which should, I think, be a feature of the Bill. I have no other significant objective in view.</p>

<a name="61218-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0612186000096"></a>The Bill focuses on the legal basis of the authority&#146;s power to disallow excessive regulation. The neutrality of the Government on the ownership issue is not referred to. That is unfortunate, as it describes the authority&#146;s existing powers to intervene and extends to five pages of complicated provisions on the way in which enforcement could be rendered more effective. How is that to be done if the owner of  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1830"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1830</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the exchange objects? Would the authority be obliged to bring proceedings in the English courts or in the European Court? The space devoted to the legal niceties in the Bill seems to be excessive and likely to provoke further anxious inquiries from the new owner. The key issue is the vexed question of international jurisdiction, which is always a difficult matter in our relations with the United States, as several noble Lords pointed out at Second Reading.</p>

<a name="61218-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0612186000097"></a>I should briefly explain my interest in this subject. For four years, from 1976 to 1979, I was the Minister (Commercial) at the Washington embassy. After retirement from the public service, I was a non-executive director of the then SFA&#151;an association at that time&#151;and a member of its disciplinary committee. The American attitude to jurisdiction is very different from our own. Noble Lords may know that the IRS, the American equivalent of the Inland Revenue, taxes the revenue of its citizens resident abroad as a matter of course. In addition, the US authorities permitted American Airlines to breach our bilateral aviation treaty for several years by allowing it to have direct routes from London Heathrow Airport to European destinations. This was certainly extraterritoriality with a vengeance. We had to give legal notice of the termination of the treaty to obtain a fair and legal deal for our airlines.</p>

<a name="61218-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0612186000098"></a>I could give other examples, and we could all recall, as some noble Lords did in Committee on another Bill, the recent problems with our bilateral treaty on extradition. My point is simply that the US has regularly extended its international legal reach to promote its perceived national interests. International jurisdiction is thus an active and sensitive subject in the USA; it is a far more important issue there than it is here. We should do nothing to stir this hornets&#146; nest, which I fear the Bill risks doing in its existing form.</p>

<a name="61218-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0612186000099"></a>The long passages in the Bill making excessive and heavy-handed references to existing law are rather unfortunate and have no direct effect on international legal enforcement. If no one has questioned the validity of the various laws that are cited in the Bill, why do we need to list them now? If it is thought necessary to list them, they should be in a separate annexe with the Explanatory Notes, which are already to be treated in the same way, instead of in the body of the Bill.</p>

<a name="61218-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0612186000100"></a>I thank the Minister for his kindness in discussing some of these matters with me on the telephone last week. At one point late last Thursday, he persuaded me to abandon the amendment but, after a sleepless night, I decided that my first instincts were right. He also expressed unease that my amendment, if accepted, might delay the passage of the legislation. But if speed is essential, why has it taken so long to prepare the Bill? Several people, including me, foresaw this difficulty some weeks ago. I cannot believe that it would cause concern if we were to delay this matter for some days or even a few weeks longer, given the very clear policy statements courageously made by Ministers about the acceptance of foreign ownership.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0612186000101"></a>All these difficulties could be overcome by accepting my amendment or another amendment on similar lines. Will the Government please decide to defer progress on the Bill until they have examined afresh the issues that I have mentioned this afternoon? The Bill does not strike the right balance in its present form. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="0612186000102"></a><b><a name="61218-0002.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="0612186000322"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I sympathise with at least part of the intention behind the amendment, which I think is to put on record our determination to resist extraterritorial encroachments on our ability to regulate UK markets in accordance with UK and EC law. In doing so, I acknowledge the expertise of the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, on the international scene, and I am sorry if I gave him a sleepless night on Thursday. Let me stress that the Government have no difficulty resisting extraterritorial encroachments. Indeed, I hope that that was made clear in my Second Reading opening speech and by my honourable friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury in his Second Reading opening speech in the other place, in which he said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0612186000229"></a>&#147;our interest in the ownership of the London Stock Exchange is that it should not affect the existing regulatory regime under which the exchange and its members and issuers operate. We are determined to act to protect our domestic regulatory environment, founded in both UK law and EC directives, that has made the City a magnet for international business. If a company operates in London, it should be regulated in London&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 28/11/06; col. 990.]</ul>
<a name="61218-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0612186000103"></a>However, we would not wish to accept this amendment today for both handling and substantive reasons. On the substance, the amendment would detract from the clarity of the Bill and would introduce an element of protectionism. While it leaves the existing processes in the Bill untouched, it adds a requirement that, if it were to have any effect, would make it impossible for the operation of the markets operated in the UK by recognised investment exchanges to be moved to another country. That could be the state in which the new owner is established or indeed any other state.</p>

<a name="61218-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0612186000104"></a>A UK-recognised body does not cease to be a UK-recognised body if control of it passes to a foreign person. Provided that it continues to carry on activities regulated under the Financial Services and Markets Act by way of business in the United Kingdom after the change of ownership, the exchange or clearing house concerned will still need to be either an authorised person under the Act or exempt from the need for that authorisation by being a recognised body. In both cases, it remains subject to the Act&#146;s requirements and to the relevant provisions in EC law. It will still be supervised by the Financial Services Authority. There is no question of supervisory responsibility passing to a foreign regulator and there never has been. LIFFE, which is owned by the Dutch company Euronext NV, NYMEX Europe and ICE Futures, which are owned by US parents, and Virt-X, which is owned by a Swiss parent, are still supervised by the FSA and have to comply with the same FSMA requirements as the London Stock Exchange and the London Metal Exchange.</p>

<a name="61218-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0612186000105"></a>If a UK-recognised body carries on activities in another country that are regulated in that country, it will have to comply with that country&#146;s law. That would include, of course, complying with the conditions for a &#147;passport&#148; under the relevant EC directives if it wished to carry on such activities in another EU member state.</p>

<a name="61218-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0612186000106"></a>There will be no more opportunity for the SEC or any other foreign regulator or authority to commence proceedings against a UK-recognised body after a change of ownership than there is now&#151;or against a member firm of the recognised body, against an issuer whose securities are quoted on that body or against any other person, such as the directors or employees of recognised bodies, member firms or issuers. We cannot stop the authorities in any foreign country taking action against its own citizens or residents in its own courts; we have never been able to do that and will never be able to do so. But the Bill will give them the defence of being prevented by local, UK law, from carrying out the foreign regulator&#146;s wishes.</p>

<a name="61218-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0612186000107"></a>There is no need to legislate against any attempt by a US or other foreign regulatory authority to impose its provisions directly on a UK recognised body. The Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 and the corresponding EC Council regulation are designed to protect Community interests by making it illegal for individuals and companies to comply with extraterritorial demands by US or other overseas authorities. Under that legislation, UK companies are obliged to inform the Government and the European Commission of any extraterritorial action taken against them in order that appropriate protective measures can be taken. Those measures make it unlawful for persons in the UK and the EU to comply with the requirements of the foreign legislation, regulator or court. None of this will happen on account of the Bill; it is simply a consequence of how the existing law works. The amendment is not therefore needed to make that point clear or to put it beyond doubt.</p>

<a name="61218-0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0612186000108"></a>The Bill is directed at a different problem. Its purpose is to prevent foreign-owned bodies from applying regulatory schemes from other states that would be excessive when considered against the existing UK and EC regulatory framework. It is possible that the foreign owners of a UK-recognised body might wish to do this for commercial reasons. It is more likely, however, that the regulatory authorities or Government in their home country would attempt to force the hand of the foreign owners by passing legislation or taking enforcement action under existing legislation in that home country. The Bill&#146;s provisions will prevent such actions from resulting in unwelcome changes to the operation of UK-recognised bodies and the markets and systems that they run by giving the FSA a right to veto excessive regulatory provision proposed by UK-recognised bodies irrespective of their ownership or whether there has been a change of ownership.</p>

<a name="61218-0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0612186000109"></a>We also have concerns about how the amendment would work. The issue raised here is similar to issues that were raised in the other place when probing amendments were tabled. The Government believe that limiting the Bill&#146;s provisions so that they took effect only after a change of control of a UK-recognised  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1833"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1833</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>body or after a foreign takeover would be undesirable. Equally, the Government recognise that, if an owner of a recognised body wants to operate in a completely different way and seeks to move the domicile of the body to enable him to do so, then that is his right in a world of free markets. Attempting to prevent such steps would be unworkable, discriminatory and unfair. It is unlikely that any regime along these lines would be compatible with the UK&#146;s obligations under the EC treaty or under the World Trade Organisation&#146;s general agreement on trading services.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0612186000110"></a>Any new owner would also be taking an enormous business risk in seeking to move the centre of operations and the legal domicile of the exchange to another state, which is the only way in which overseas regulatory authorities would be able to take on any regulatory function in respect of any of the existing UK markets or the exchanges that operate them. In other words, the exchange would have to cease to be a UK exchange. Exchanges cannot force issuers or member firms to follow them if they migrate. Issuers and member firms are ultimately just users of the facilities that the exchange provides on a commercial basis. They are customers who can go elsewhere.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0612186000111"></a>The Government do not want to send out the message that the UK does not welcome foreign owners or foreign investment in the financial services sector. I am sure that few Members of the House would wish to send that message out either. My honourable friend the Economic Secretary said in another place:</p>

A policy of protecting &#145;national champions&#146; would damage, not bolster, the interests of London and the UK&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 28/11/06; col. 989.]</ul>
<a name="61218-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0612186000112"></a>As to the handling reasons to which I referred earlier, if we amend the Bill now it will have to go back to the other place and its passage would be delayed. NASDAQ&#146;s bid for the London Stock Exchange is on the table. It is important, therefore, as I said in my Second Reading speech, that we move quickly. I do not accept the contention of the noble Lord that the Bill has been a long time in coming. Once it was identified as an issue to take forward, the Government moved swiftly. I am grateful for the support that we have had from the Opposition Benches. Correspondingly, I must oppose the amendment.</p>

I do not pretend to be an expert in this highly complicated field but I am aware of what I have heard from experts outside the discussions of the House and of what I took from the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, in moving the amendment. He asked the Minister whether it would be possible for Members of the House, with their advisers, to consider the highly important and, if I may say so with great credit to him, extraordinarily complex statement that he has made&#151;which, after all, envisages questions of extraterritoriality, foreign legal systems and European

There has been the opportunity of a limited debate at Second Reading to discuss some of the broader principles and there has been a full debate in the other place. As I said, the NASDAQ bid is on the table. The Government are neutral as to the outcome of that&#151;we do not know where it is going to go&#151;but we want to make sure that any challenge to the regulatory environment that we have on the exchanges at the moment cannot succeed. I believe that there has been a fair opportunity in the passage of this legislation thus far, through the other place and here, for due consideration to be given to it; the Bill has taken the normal course.</p>

I have to say that I am not convinced on one important matter which I thought I had mentioned, so perhaps I should explain it again. This is the question of extraterritorial jurisdiction. Let us suppose that the SEC, which follows these matters with close attention, decides that the way in which the regulator is managing affairs in this country is not quite to its satisfaction. The SEC contains expert people who have their own ideas about what should be done. They might therefore use their influence to ensure that the owner introduced certain changes that we had difficulty with. There would then be a conflict of jurisdiction. Where would this be settled? Would there be proceedings in the High Court? Would it be at a European court? Do we honestly believe that, in response to a summons from this country, a representative of the Securities and Exchange Commission would come to London? I can see that we have built in, no doubt with the very best of intentions, a situation that I fear could possibly come about, and I think that it ought to be dealt with at this stage. I would be very grateful if the Minister could kindly answer those questions.</p>

If we had a situation where, by one means or another, the SEC sought to impose on the London Stock Exchange a regulatory provision, the provisions of the Bill would kick in. The Bill would require the recognised exchange to notify the FSA, assuming that it fell within its rules of notification, as, if the issue were important, it doubtless would. The FSA would then have to consult on that with key stakeholders and make a judgment on whether it thought that excessive regulation was involved. If so, it would veto that provision. That issue would be conducted in the UK courts. I think that that is right and as it should be. If the exchange wishes to challenge the FSA, it could seek to do so through judicial review&#151;again, a process in the UK courts. If it was successful, the issue would either go back to the FSA or the FSA&#146;s judgment would be abrogated. If the courts supported the FSA, the veto would remain. That is how the provisions of the Bill are meant to operate.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0612186000123"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I welcome this opportunity to debate the information provided to the European Commission under Section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993. Each year the Government report information to the Commission on the economic and budgetary position and our main economic policy measures, and each year we aim to ensure that each member state&#146;s economic policies are consistent with the goals of the treaty. That includes non-inflationary economic growth, high levels of employment and social protection and better living standards for citizens in the UK and across the EU. These goals are consistent with the Government&#146;s approach to economic policy to maintain long-term stability. The Government&#146;s monetary policy framework seeks to ensure low and stable inflation, while fiscal policy ensures sound public finances over the medium term.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0612186000124"></a>Section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993&#151;or the Maastricht Act, as it is better known&#151;requires Parliament to approve the information sent by the Government to the Commission for this purpose. We set out such economic information in the Pre-Budget Report earlier this month, and this material forms the basis of what we send through to the Commission. It is this assessment, set out in the PRB, for which approval is sought today. By formally sharing information from the Pre-Budget Report with our European partners, we can help ensure a proper, accurate and effective EU system, contributing to enhanced employment and growth.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0612186000125"></a>The background for debate on the economic position is the need to address the great global challenges ahead. Asia is already out-producing Europe; China alone is manufacturing half the world's computers, half the world's clothes and more than half the world's digital electronics. But in the next 10 years, the competitive challenge is even more  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1836"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1836</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>profound. Once responsible for just one-eighth of the world's growth, China and India will soon capture almost half. So economies like ours have no choice but to out-innovate and out-perform competitors by the excellence of our science and education, the quality of our infrastructure and environment and our flexibility, creativity and entrepreneurship.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0612186000126"></a>Just as in the last decade by planning long term we created a new and enduring British framework for economic stability, so, too, for the coming decade the task is to think long term again and create a new framework for investment and innovation, a strategy to make the next stage of globalisation work for the British people.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0612186000127"></a>To put this challenge in context, we should look at some of the global developments and trends in the past year: global imbalances, exchange rate uncertainties, stalled trade talks and high commodity prices. Against this backdrop, growth this year is expected to be 2.75 per cent, rising to 2.75 per cent to 3.25 per cent next year. The UK is experiencing its longest unbroken expansion on record, with GDP having grown for 57 consecutive quarters. By mid-2007 we expect inflation to be at its 2 per cent target and remain at target in 2008. Productivity, which in the last economic cycle up to 1997 grew by 1.9 per cent, is averaging 2.4 per cent since 1997. This year alone there are 200,000 more people in employment; there are 2.5 million more jobs than in 1997, the highest ever number of men and women in work in our country, and employment is higher in every region and nation since 1997. Over the past 35 years, employment has risen by 17.8 per cent. Well over half of that rise has occurred under this Government. Taken together, the UK is currently experiencing the longest period of sustained productivity and employment growth since the 1950s, when records began.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0612186000128"></a>This performance is the direct result of the monetary and fiscal policy framework we have introduced. We will continue to maintain fiscal discipline; I am sure that all Members of this House would expect no less.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0612186000129"></a>Our two fiscal rules are the golden rule that current spending should be paid for by current revenues, not borrowing, and the sustainable investment rule that debt is held at a prudent and stable level over the economic cycle. In the Pre-Budget Report, the Chancellor announced that we are meeting both rules. With an overall surplus of &#163;8 billion in this economic cycle, we are meeting the golden rule, and are already on course to meet it in the next.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0612186000130"></a>While net debt is 47 per cent of national income in the USA, 55 per cent in the euro-area and 90 per cent in Japan, in the UK it stands at 37.5 per cent. With debt lower than our competitors, Britain is also meeting the sustainable investment rule, and at the same time it has tackled the historic under-investment in our infrastructure and doubled capital investment in health, education and transport.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0612186000131"></a>Alongside each Pre-Budget Report that we publish, we publish a long-term public finance report, providing a comprehensive analysis of long-term socio-economic and demographic developments, and

Even taking into account our new commitments on pensions, it showed that the country&#146;s public finances are also on a sound and sustainable basis for the long-term.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0612186000132"></a>Within this strong and sustainable fiscal position we are therefore well placed to make decisions about our long-term priorities. As recently as the mid 1990s, 75 per cent of all new public spending went to debt interest and social security benefits. Today it is down to less than 20 per cent. And the purpose of all these savings is to ensure that front-line services will have the resources they need.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0612186000133"></a>So up against the global challenge and with fiscal rules that allow us to borrow for sustainable investment we should not postpone or avoid essential new investment in infrastructure and education.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0612186000134"></a>Capital investment in education stood at only &#163;1.5 billion in 1997; it will be &#163;8.3 billion next year and we will set out long-term plans for investment to rise further over the next decade. Investment in transport&#151;just &#163;4 billion in 1997&#151;will be &#163;9.6 billion next year and in the Comprehensive Spending Review we will set out an updated 10-year spending plan; and investment in housing, which was just &#163;2 billion in 1997, will be nearly &#163;8 billion next year, with sustained investment in the next spending round.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0612186000135"></a>In an increasingly integrated and competitive global economy, raising UK productivity is critical to delivering continued economic growth and sustained increases in standards of living. Raising productivity requires the openness and flexibility to seize new opportunities in the global economy, while making the essential long-term investments needed to support business growth&#151;including vital infrastructure and skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0612186000136"></a>The Leitch report says that instead of today's 6 million unskilled workers, the 2020 economy will need only half a million unskilled workers and that instead of 9 million high skilled workers and graduates today we will need 14 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0612186000137"></a>The Government want British workers to gain the skills for these higher-paid jobs of the future. So our aim by 2020 is to have 90 per cent of adults reaching at least the equivalent of 5 GCSEs&#151;achieving in just over one decade an ambition that no other country has yet managed; by reforming underperforming colleges, doubling from 2 million to 4 million the number of adults achieving A-level equivalent skills; and ensuring that our economy has over 5 million more men and women with high level professional and graduate skills.</p>

The next challenge for Britain is to match strength in basic research with success all round in transforming knowledge into successful products and new jobs. Therefore the Government will, from 2007-08, award universities an extra &#163;60 million of quality-related funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0612186000143"></a>The planning system is fundamental to the contribution of sustainable development and employment to economic growth. The Government will take full account of the Barker review of land use planning, which recommends improvements to streamline the planning application process and reduce the burden on business, and that a test of economic benefit be factored into planning considerations. The same partnership of responsible individuals, companies and Governments is vital to meeting the environmental challenge. A key component of that is to use market mechanisms and incentives to work towards global carbon trading. Following the Stern review, 31 countries in the EU and EFTA have already signed up to emissions trading as the first step to this global framework. We are bringing together the major financial institutions, our being aim to make London the world&#146;s leading centre for carbon trading.</p>

<a name="0612186000147"></a><b><a name="61218-0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0612186000329"></a>Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market:</b> My Lords, this is the second time in a week that I have unexpectedly followed the Minister. I will again choose specific topics rather than try to comprehensively cover the field. I used to be what might be described as a Budget and pre-Budget nerd or weirdo, in that, following my time in the Treasury, when I used to be intimate with all the documents, I gave myself the challenge of reading the Budget Statement and many other documents before midnight at the end of the day they were published.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0612186000148"></a>I have long since ceased to be such a nerd or weirdo. One of the reasons is that the endless detail in the PBR needs to be put in context. I suspect that it washes over everyone else in the same way as it does over me. For example, I do not believe the &#147;golden rules&#148; are now given much credibility; the dates of the cycle have clearly been shifted to make those rules fit, and we know that substantial elements of what used to be known as &#147;government borrowing&#148;, which would include Network Rail and the ever-accumulating off-balance-sheet financing of the PFIs, are not included under the golden rules.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0612186000149"></a>I have to admit that as I listen to the relentless, grinding recital of statistics from the Chancellor as he makes his Budget Statement, it now induces sleep or the mind wanders elsewhere&#151;particularly as I realise that he is often repeating figures he has given earlier so that he can present them as new. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, for example, said that, of the &#163;36 billion education budget that he announced, only &#163;100 million was actually new. As we know, he very often gives five-year figures to make them look larger. </p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0612186000150"></a>I shall make one or two observations on the macroeconomic scene before I come to two specific topics, where I hope to support the Government&#146;s approach and offer some constructive suggestions. I shall start with government spending, on which the Minister has spent so much of his time. I am concerned that, having got it to realistic levels as a proportion of GDP in the late 1980s, and again in the late 1990s, government spending is becoming an increasing proportion of GDP again. It is still too high, although there is a noticeable and inevitable slowdown in the figures ahead.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0612186000151"></a>I accept that, between 1997 and 2000, the Government were prudent in their spending, but since 2000 they have been all too inclined to throw money at everything in the belief that it will achieve results. Since 2000, spending in nominal terms has risen by an average of 7 per cent per year, well in excess of economic growth, and without questioning value for money. I think I am right in saying that the Government have now spent &#163;7 billion on consultants. Much money has been wasted&#151;my noble friend Lord James could give many examples of that&#151;some of it through sheer government incompetence, such as the very large sum that we are  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1840"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1840</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>now paying in EU fines for errors connected with the Rural Payments Agency, or simply through the Government not achieving the results that they had hoped because they have not introduced appropriate reforms, as in the NHS.</p>

<a name="61218-0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0612186000152"></a>The result is that taxes are now too high. They have risen substantially in the corporate sector, at a time when many of our competitors are reducing corporation tax to rates well below ours. We were not in that situation a few years ago: indeed, the opposite applied. Our taxes are too high for individuals. As the Governor of the Bank of England recently pointed out, the increased taxation for individuals is one of the contributory factors to the squeeze on spending which we can now anticipate. The Chancellor has run out of ideas for stealth taxes, but he must find scope for reducing the burden of taxation and regulations and for simplifying them. It is significant that Tolley&#146;s tax handbook was 4,555 pages long in 1997&#151;one might well have considered that too many&#151;and it now has 9,841. There is no sign of any of these matters in this year&#146;s Pre-Budget Report.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61218-0004.htm"/>


<a name="61218-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0612186000153"></a>It is interesting that, in each of the past three years, the level of borrowing anticipated in the PBR, and the actual outcome, was a good deal higher than predicted in the Budget of that year. We are now seeing substantial increases this year. I grant that the low inflation has certainly been a success so far, but there are signs of upward creep. The latest Bank of England inflation report in November concluded:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="0612186000231"></a>&#147;Overall the risks to growth and inflation are judged to be broadly balanced though as in August there is greater than usual uncertainty over the outlook for inflation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="61218-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0612186000154"></a>I often wonder about the extent to which our low inflation has been assisted by two key factors. I would like to see a proper analysis of this. The Minister referred to competition from China, India and other developing countries. The reduced price of many imported products that are key ingredients of everyone&#146;s spending has been a major contributory factor in keeping inflation low. I notice that the Bank of England&#146;s latest quarterly bulletin, in referring to this factor without quantifying it, said that that beneficial tailwind had waned somewhat in the past couple of years. If that beneficial impact falls from its present level, and even reverses, we could see an upward pressure on inflation.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0612186000155"></a>Equally, immigrant workers, particularly from former Soviet Union territories now in the EU, have contributed substantially to keeping pay levels low in certain parts of the country, especially in the south-east and even in East Anglia, and to keeping that area of inflation under control. I sometimes wonder whether our economy is not benefiting from the productivity improvements of other countries and of immigrants to this country. That may not last.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0612186000156"></a>That leads me to what I think is one of the greatest concerns of all. Productivity is one of our biggest worries. Our productivity growth has fallen. In 1992-97, productivity improvement was 2.6 per cent a year. It was 2.1 per cent a year between 1997 and 2001&#151;already declining. Since 2001 it has been a mere 1.5 per cent a year. It is no wonder that the World Economic Forum shows us falling from

That is an extremely worrying trend.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0612186000157"></a>On the macroeconomic situation, we have seen enormous and significant contributions to growth and the feel-good factor from the City of London and from financial and various other services. That is certainly reflected in City bonuses at the moment. Indeed, the Bill, to which we have just given Report clearance and which the Minister knows I wholly support, is designed entirely to ensure that we remain predominantly the leading financial centre in the world. I wonder whether to some extent the feel-good factor prevalent in London is contributed to by, on the one hand, the success of the City, the substantial bonuses and wealthy people coming here and, on the other, the contribution of other immigrants to keeping the costs of services low. I wonder whether that feel-good factor extends as much to the rest of the country.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0612186000158"></a>I want briefly to share a concern to which I hope we can return on another occasion. There are increasing warnings on the level of highly leveraged debt backing European companies, the majority of which is held by private equity-owned businesses. In the past two weeks, there have been three warnings. The first was from Sir John Gieve, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, on the danger that hedge funds and equity groups are over-borrowing. Secondly, Standard &amp; Poor&#146;s drew attention to the fact that the average debt-payment burden of outstanding leveraged buy-out deals is now four times above the normal safe level. Thirdly, today a private equity professional has drawn attention to the fact that debt-driven private equity houses face a tenfold increase in corporate defaults, which, he believes, will come soon. While this is a subject for later debate, if some of those warnings come true, the financial sector will face a very different situation.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0612186000159"></a>I now turn to two topics on which I wish to be constructive. First, the Eddington report contained two key findings that are highly related to what I said about growth and productivity. One finding was that,</p>
<ul><a name="0612186000238"></a>&#147;in mature economies with well-developed transport networks it is transport constraints that are most likely to impact upon a nation&#146;s productivity and competitiveness&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0612186000221"></a>Another states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="0612186000232"></a>&#147;Eliminating existing congestion on the road network would be worth some &#163;7-8 billion of GDP per annum&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0612186000222"></a>As a former Secretary of State for Transport I strongly support the report&#146;s recommendations on road pricing. I could not do otherwise, because in May 1993 I published a document, <I>Paying for Better Motorways</I>, which, if I may say so, covered all the arguments much more succinctly than the Eddington report and others that I have seen, but the arguments were compelling. My own concern was that one of my officials suggested that motorway tolls should be known as motorway access charges, or &#147;macs&#148;, in the same way as teacher training days in schools became known as &#147;Baker days&#148;. I was not sure that I wanted to be associated with motorway charging in quite that way, but we set out all the arguments in our report. I wish to make three points.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1842"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1842</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="61218-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0612186000160"></a>First, I regret the lack of progress since then. We have lacked political courage, and I am concerned that the Eddington report talks about the introduction of road-pricing within the next 10 years. We cannot wait that long. I recognise that there is a technology requirement but, having looked at this matter carefully in 1993 and gone to the United States, Norway and elsewhere to do so, I think it is clear that the technology could have been developed in the 10 years since then. I hope that we can get on with it.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0612186000161"></a>Secondly, as with identity cards, in road-pricing the Government are destroying a good idea in principle by being over-complex, which could lead to excessive costs. It would be better to focus on motorways and not to try to be too sophisticated by introducing a sensitive road pricing system on many other roads in the UK. That, I believe, would also have a serious effect on rural areas. It can be done on motorways. I constantly have to make the point to people who live in urban areas, where there is alternative public transport, that there is no such alternative in rural areas. I do not see the need for road pricing in rural areas, where the congestion is not the same and alternative transport is not available.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0612186000162"></a>Thirdly&#151;and I emphasise this&#151;it is vital that we use the proceeds for motorway improvements. During the Prescott era, we saw a substantial decline in investment in roads infrastructure. We all know that there are demands for bypasses, and so on, and we will never be able to entertain them all in the short term. If we are to get motorway improvements at the same time as the advantages of motorway tolling, which can be adjusted according to times of congestion in different periods of the day, the proceeds of tolling must be hypothecated to the improvement of the motorways. In <I>Paying for Better Motorways </I>in 1993 we made precisely that point and gave a commitment that, if charging were introduced, it would provide another source of finance for improving roads. That is the only way that it can be made acceptable to the public.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0612186000163"></a>My final comments refer to the Barker report. I shall be brief but hope that we can return to the issue another time. It is impressive how the delays in the processes of our planning system lead to much higher costs for so many businesses and for our infrastructure generally. It is significant that that is one of the main obstacles foreseen by people who want to invest inwardly, and it is increasingly seen as a burden on businesses. I do not have time to go into the detail, but many improvements can be made in the process without diminishing the opportunities for democratic accountability and for the public to make their views known. I very much hope that the Government will pursue with sufficient speed the appropriate recommendations on processes in the Barker report.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0612186000165"></a>My noble friend repeated what the Chancellor said in 1997 about having a referendum on the issue. I find the idea of having a referendum on the five economic tests difficult, to put it mildly. I image that readers of the <I>Sun</I>,<I></I>and even the <I>Times</I>, might find it difficult to decide how to vote. I am not altogether sure that Members of both Houses could make a clear decision on something as complex&#151;to describe it safely&#151;as the five economic tests. I find it more than complex; it is rather silly, but that is another matter.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0612186000166"></a>In addition to talking about a referendum, the Chancellor said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0612186000239"></a>&#147;in principle, a successful single currency within a single European market would be of benefit to Europe and Britain&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 27/10/97; col. 583.]</ul>
<p><a name="0612186000223"></a>I certainly agree with that, but I should like confirmation from my noble friend that that is still the policy of Her Majesty&#146;s Government, because at times it does not appear to be.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0612186000167"></a>My impression on hearing the Statement on the Pre-Budget Report, and on reading it later, was that the Chancellor had taken the opportunity of writing his successor&#146;s Pre-Budget and Budget Reports for many years ahead. I hope that his successor will appreciate what the Chancellor has left him. One thing is clear: this is not what is sometimes described as&#151;incorrectly, in my view&#151;a green Budget in any sense of the word. There is a clear misunderstanding by what is meant by a green Budget.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0612186000168"></a>I put a question at Question Time to my noble friend a few weeks ago on this precise issue. I said that if the tax was not high enough, it would raise some revenue but do nothing whatever about climate change. If you want to do something about climate change, you must raise no revenue by placing it at such a high level that you will not get any tax. People will stop emitting, if that is the right word, and that will help to address climate change. But most people see a green Budget, green matters and green taxes as determined only by how much tax you are raising. I do not accuse the Official Opposition of that because they would call it &#147;stealth taxes&#148; or something that the Chancellor has dreamt up, you might say, as a means of cutting his Budget deficit&#151;although they would not say it as politely as I would. Can my noble friend confirm that the Chancellor&#146;s policy that I asked about at Question Time remains basically not a green tax but a means of raising revenue, which is what it certainly appears to be?</p>

I declare an interest. Of course I am not specifically looking for a discount for myself, but I hope that the Chancellor was seeking to

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0612186000170"></a>The Pre-Budget Report refers to efficiency saving and, inevitably, the Gershon report; it does not refer to the equally famous report of the noble Lord, Lord James. The Chancellor told us in the Pre-Budget Statement that that means a 3 per cent cut in costs plus a 5 per cent cut in administrative cost&#151;not one-off but every year until 2011. I assume that that means that not only every department but also every local authority and non-governmental body will achieve this 3 per cent plus 5 per cent administrative saving. What happens if those departments do not carry out their remit between now and 2011? How do the Government intend to enforce these savings? Am I right in assuming that the assumed savings from the Gershon committee have already been included in the Pre-Budget Report figures, whether or not they will be achieved?</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0612186000171"></a>We have been told that 45,000 jobs have gone and that the total target was 84,000&#151;not every year, of course. Where will the Gershon savings come from given, I assume, that they have already been taken into account in the Pre-Budget Report figures? How does the Chancellor hope to meet that target all the way through to 2011?</p>

I am glad to see in his place the chairman of the Select Committee on Economic Affairs, whose latest report came out today. Although I have not yet had a chance to read it in full, I have read press briefings&#151;some of which I do not recognise from my brief look at the noble Lord&#146;s report&#151;which seem to say that the Economic Affairs Committee believes that the Treasury&#146;s reports on economic growth and forecasts have been taken into account by the Monetary Policy Committee, which is one reason for our high interest rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0612186000176"></a>Certainly, Treasury forecasts from time to time are just as likely to be wrong as right, as the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, and I both know from days in government. We do not need to get too excited about them, although I noted that the committee&#146;s witnesses from the Bank said that of course the decisions were taken on more and much bigger issues than just the Treasury forecasts. As I say, they are not so stupid as to rely solely on those forecasts.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0612186000177"></a>I want to raise a point about the Chancellor&#146;s current forecasts on economic growth, not those made in the past. It is forecast to be about 2.75 per cent this year, which most forecasters of all kinds apparently agree is likely. Next year, it will be 2.75 to 3.25 per cent, as my noble friend repeated today. Again, nobody has quite disputed that as yet, and it may well happen. However, the trend growth figure is probably even more important. We are now being told that the trend growth has gone up to 2.75 per cent&#151;previously, it was 2.5 per cent.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0612186000178"></a>I confirm, sadly, that the Government and the Chancellor do not expect the 3.25 per cent that they might achieve next year to be sustainable. Indeed, 2008 is already forecast to be slightly lower, and it might be lower still in 2009, although inflation will continue at round about the 2 per cent target figure given to the Monetary Policy Committee. Will the Monetary Policy Committee then allow, if I may put it that way, a 2.75 per cent trend rate if it affects the achievement of the remit about the rate of inflation, being 2 per cent&#151;or, rather, 1 per cent up or down?</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0612186000179"></a>My impression has always been that the Governor worries more about writing a letter to the Chancellor than about his other remit, which is to consider the Government&#146;s economic policies. He seems to be frightened to death of sending a letter to the Chancellor to say that we might have gone 1.1 per cent over the 2 per cent target. I do not know why he needs to worry in that way. He is obviously not worrying about what his policies on interest rates do to economic growth, which seems to me to be much more important. The remit could be changed to 1.25 per cent above or below the target rate of 2 per cent.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0612186000180"></a>I said in a recent debate that I would not worry if inflation was slightly higher, as long as we had higher rates of sustainable growth. I was then accused of supporting a high rate of inflation. I would certainly support 0.5 per cent more if that gave us a sustainable higher rate of economic growth. I have said this before, but I worry that the Monetary Policy Committee, the Bank of England and the Governor have clearly taken no account whatever of their remit that, &#147;subject to that&#148;&#151;in those famous three words&#151;they are supposed to look at what is happening to economic policy. They do not seem to be doing that at all.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0612186000181"></a>I hope that the Government and the Chancellor are as concerned about that as I am. I cannot see how we will be able to have a sustainable rate of growth higher than the average&#151;I congratulate the Chancellor; I assume that no congratulations will come from the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, but the past 10 years have seen an average of 2.5 per cent growth. We have  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1846"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1846</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>never had that from any Chancellor before; we are entitled to congratulate him on that, and I certainly do.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0612186000182"></a>The question is: is it sustainable at that or even a higher rate? Of course, that depends to a considerable degree on improvements in the level of productivity, to which the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, referred. He gave one or two reasons why productivity may or may not achieve the figures that we have had up to now.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="0612186000183"></a>In the Pre-Budget Report, the Chancellor told us&#151;again, we are talking of averages, which is a difficult thing to do in any forecast&#151;that average productivity growth was 1.9 per cent before 1997 and, since then, has been 2.4 per cent. I do not know how the statisticians measure productivity rates, but I am as suspicious of them as I am of any other forecast. Even assuming they are right, that increase in productivity did not achieve a higher level of sustainable economic growth, which stayed at 2.5 per cent. I assume that it is accepted in the Treasury that it will not be able to sustain a higher rate of economic growth on average than 2.5 per cent, yet we are told that we have a trend growth rate of 2.75 per cent.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="0612186000184"></a>Can my noble friend tell us how the 2.75 per cent trend rate was calculated? Under the Monetary Policy Committee&#146;s remit as it sees it&#151;not as I would see it&#151;I wonder whether it would allow a 2.75 per cent rate of growth while it is more concerned with having to write a letter to the Chancellor because we have gone more than 1 per cent above the target rate of inflation.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="0612186000185"></a>I conclude&#151;I have gone on too long so I had better conclude&#151;by again congratulating my right honourable friend the Chancellor and looking forward to him doing even better as Prime Minister.</p>

My thoughts, for what they are worth&#151;not being an economist&#151;on the MPC's role are that I fear that its focus is on inflation at the expense of economic growth and perhaps its role should be more like the Federal Reserve which, as I understand it, has to take a more overall view of events.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="0612186000187"></a>What should have been the Chancellor&#146;s last Pre-Budget Report was more interesting for its background of reviews rather than the rest of its content. The Leitch review on skills is a welcome contribution to the effort of improving the country's skill base. The Gowers review of intellectual property is a serious attempt to look at the complexities of the intellectual property system. The Barker review, following on her well written 2004 report on housing supply, contains valid criticisms of the current planning system, although her suggestion of the &#147;son of development land tax&#148; is unwelcome. The Gershon review has also been a major attempt to cut back on Civil Service costs and has achieved some successes. However, Treasury announcements of job cuts do not coincide with the ONS statistics. The Treasury stated in the 2006 Budget that 32,237 Civil Service posts had  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1847"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1847</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>been cut since the original review. In contrast, the ONS stated that between the end of quarter one of 2004 and the end of quarter one of 2006, the reductions were only 10,000. Can the Minister explain the discrepancy?</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="0612186000188"></a>The other main positive factor to emerge from the Pre-Budget Report is that the Chancellor has increased his growth forecast to 2.75 per cent this year, which was well above his original prediction. I ask the same question as the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, on that. I reserve judgment on his decision to raise the growth forecast except to ask the Minister the justification for that. However, it is noticeable that the Chancellor, as the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, stated, downgraded his growth forecast for 2008 by 0.25 per cent.</p>

<a name="61218-0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="0612186000189"></a>The Minister may feel that I shall only applaud the PBR, but I have some serious concerns about it. This is not just a case of opposition political criticism, but it is supported by an eminent independent think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which validates my case that while growth in the economy appears strong, public finances in recent years have been deteriorating. As my noble friend Lord MacGregor stated, the Chancellor has consistently had to revise his borrowing forecasts upwards since 2002. In 2003-04, the Government spent &#163;8.5 billion more than forecast in the previous Budget; in 2004-05, the figure was &#163;6.7 billion; and in 2005-06, it was &#163;5.1 billion. In the 2006 PBR he has increased his future borrowing requirements to 2011 by &#163;7 billion more than forecast in the last Budget. The IFS has also said that the Government have continually pushed forward the date that the current Budget, after adjusting for the cycle, would move back into surplus. That does not take into account, as my noble friend Lord MacGregor said, Network Rail and PFI initiatives of balance sheet spending.</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="0612186000190"></a>To compensate for the increased borrowing problem, the Government have taken various approaches. The first is to raise taxes. The <I>Financial Times</I> of 8 December contained an article in which the IFS pointed out that Gordon Brown has raised taxes by no less than &#163;6 billion a year since the 2005 election, finally facing up to weaknesses in the public finances which could have been predicted. At the time of the last election, Gordon Brown said that there was no need to raise taxes to fund his existing expenditure plans, contrary to independent voices, ranging from the IFS to the International Monetary Fund. Robert Chote, the director of the IFS, has stated that tax increases in two Pre-Budget Reports and one Budget since the election were evidence that the Treasury now accepted that it had been wrong. He said that measures announced by the Chancellor would raise the tax take by &#163;6 billion a year or on average &#163;200 per family from 2008-09. According to the article, the Treasury has not questioned the IFS figures. Can the Minister confirm that?</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="0612186000191"></a>In the Pre-Budget Report, taxes have been increased again: first, there was a hike on fuel tax; and, secondly, the Chancellor has raised air passenger duty. Yet even in regard to that, he has decided to make the tax rise very complicated. He has, in effect, made the tax apply from when passengers fly, not exempting those who  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1848"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1848</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bought their tickets before the PBR if they fly after 1 February. I can imagine the half-term chaos at airports after then.</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="0612186000192"></a>Tax-avoidance measures are expected to make the tax rise &#163;2 billion in total. To disguise the fact that he has little room for extra government spending, the Chancellor has, not for the first time, taken to re-announcing government spending. As my noble friend Lord MacGregor has already stated, the IFS, in the same article of 8 December, accuses the Chancellor of misleading presentation in rolling many years of educational capital spending into one figure of &#163;36 billion. Luke Sibieta, an IFS research economist, criticises the fact that the money for schools had already been announced in the previous Budget. The new money going to schools was very small and amounted to only &#163;20 a pupil. What was big was old, he said, and what was new was small.</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="0612186000193"></a>Another ruse of the Chancellor has been his tampering with his self-imposed golden rule: that the Government should borrow only to invest over a full economic cycle. In his speech, the Chancellor not for the first time moved the end of the current economic cycle&#151;this time, he moved it forward to 2007 rather than to 2008&#151;allowing him to say that he will be &#163;8 billion in surplus over the full cycle. The IFS has also criticised these changes, saying that the cycle has lengthened and shortened like a yo-yo. It recommended that the Government should leave the dating of the cycle to an independent body to avoid accusations of changes motivated by political calculations or, better still, should move away from measuring the state of public finances over a specific period. This moving around of the golden rule seems to have discredited it considerably.</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="0612186000194"></a>Another area of concern to which the Chancellor has not really referred in the PBR is inflation. The latest CPI and RPI figures were published on 12 December. The CPI&#151;the Chancellor&#146;s preferred measure of inflation&#151;climbed by 2.7 per cent, up from the 2.4 per cent increase in the previous month. This is the fastest rate of increase since January 1997. This is the seventh consecutive month in which the CPI has been above the bank&#146;s target of 2 per cent. Independent commentators suggest that the MPC could remain in tightening mode on interest rates in the New Year. As a result, there is concern that higher headline prices could bolster consumers&#146; inflation expectations, as reflected in a speech by Paul Tucker, the Bank of England&#146;s director for markets.</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="0612186000195"></a>A survey by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation and accountants KPMG showed that the rate of pay inflation for permanent jobs is running at its highest level for almost six years and at a 22-month high for temporary work. The study said that competition for talent against a background of rising demand for staff was pushing up wage bills. A series of recent high-profile private-sector wage settlements, such as the annual rises of at least 4 per cent won by thousands of workers at Ford, Rolls-Royce and National Air Traffic Services have suggested that annual wage demands are increasingly linked to the increases in the RPI rather than the CPI. The RPI, which includes interest payments on mortgages, climbed in the 12 months to November by 3.9 per cent, up from

This is the highest reading since May 1998, according to the ONS. Does the Minister share my concern about the increase in inflation?</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="0612186000196"></a>As usual in Gordon Brown&#146;s Budget or Pre-Budget Reports, there was a sting in the tail in the small print. As with smaller companies&#146; corporation tax, it involved the withdrawal of tax relief already introduced by the Chancellor. According to the <I>Financial Times</I> of 8 December, tens of thousands of people who had hoped to bequeath a substantial amount of their pension to their relatives have had their hopes dashed by a pre-Budget measure that could see more than 80 per cent of money inherited from pensions wiped out by taxes. Thus, the Chancellor has removed a freedom over personal pensions that he introduced only eight months ago.</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="0612186000197"></a>Under new rules introduced in April, those over 75 could pass on their entire pension to their families, subject only to inheritance tax. In the Pre-Budget Report, however, Gordon Brown announced that, in addition to inheritance tax at 40 per cent, a new tax on death at,</p>
<ul><a name="0612186000240"></a>&#147;up to 70 per cent&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0612186000224"></a>will be levied on these pots. Effectively, this measure forces many pension investors back into annuities, just a month after they won the freedom to avoid buying one from an insurance company once they reach the age of 75.</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="0612186000198"></a>As the shadow pensions Minister in the other place stated,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="0612186000233"></a>&#147;We are trying to bolster confidence in pensions. This seems likely to have the opposite effect.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="0612186000234"></a>It is typical of Gordon Brown&#146;s mixture of confusion, complication and confiscation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0612186000225"></a>Could the Minister ask the Chancellor to rethink this unfair change of law for personal pensions?</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="0612186000199"></a>Despite the commissioning of the Stern report, the IFS comments that the Pre-Budget Report was not that green, as already endorsed by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. As the trustee of a new charity, I must declare an interest in this area. As the IFS states, fuel duty is by far the biggest green tax&#151;it raises about 2 per cent of gross domestic product. All other green taxes raise about 1 per cent collectively. Since 2000, the decision to allow the level of fuel duty to be whittled away by inflation has caused a big drop in green taxation. Even after the PBR rise of 1.25p a litre, fuel duties will still be 16 per cent lower after inflation than in 2000. If the Treasury were to restore fuel duties to their peak level, it would raise &#163;4 billion for the Government. What does the Minister think of this idea&#151;maybe cutting other taxes to make up for this increase? Interestingly, the IFS feels that the Government should tax air passenger duty per flight rather than per person.</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="0612186000200"></a>On the subject of additional taxation, I referred to the Barker report on planning, which I will examine in a little more detail.. Kate Barker recommended that Government should use tax measures to extract some of the windfall gain that accrues to landowners&#151;I declare an interest as an owner of agricultural land&#151;from the sale of land for residential development. She said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="0612186000235"></a>&#147;Government should impose a planning-gain supplement on the granting of planning permission&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="0612186000201"></a>I disagree with this policy. I believe in the Conservative Party view that we should oppose this plan for a new development land tax&#151;a stealth tax on homes and urban renewal. High taxes on development will undermine regeneration and will inevitably be passed on in the form of higher prices for new homes. The proposals would undermine the housing market and discourage the provision of affordable housing to rent and buy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="0612186000202"></a>Additional taxation will not be revenue-neutral. It will encourage land-banking&#151;namely, holding back land for development&#151;which will mean less land for new homes.

After 10 years&#146; success in this area, I would have thought the Chancellor of the Exchequer might be reasonably relaxed about any small change that might occur in the months or years ahead. But this is his 10th and possibly final Pre-Budget Report that we will examine, and it is reasonable to look over the past 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="0612186000204"></a>The most important decision that the Government and the Chancellor of the Exchequer took was to give power to the Bank of England, which resulted in greater stability and allowed incomes per head to rise by up to 60 per cent under this Government. As my noble friend on the Front Bench mentioned, the gross domestic product has expanded constantly for 57 consecutive quarters. The problem is that, as this has gone on for a dozen years, people forget how we have always had economic expansion followed by crisis. Not only do people forget the crises of the past, but young people never even knew them and do not realise what an impressive achievement this is. Meanwhile, the expansion continues this year, at 2.75 per cent against a Budget forecast in March of 2 to 2.75 per cent.</p>

We are a very minor player yet we pretend that these matters are so important that we can decide the future of the world&#146;s global warming.

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="0612186000207"></a>The other tax which has concerned me during the entire period of this Government is the maximum level of income tax, which is set at 40 per cent. The Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s scope for the whole of his Budget is severely limited every year by this decision, which was taken early in the life of the Government. At some stage I hope this will be looked at afresh. Forty per cent is not a very high level; in many countries it is much higher. Faced with some of the constraints that arise from time to time, there could be some adjustments there.</p>

We cannot run the economy only on the City of London. We import goods and we must export goods. We cannot allow the loss of so many of our manufacturing skills to be dissipated. Our manufacturing industry was dominant in the 1850s, with half of our total exports coming from textiles alone. Then we increased the range of other industrial goods. Now we are becoming more reliant on higher technological products. The products of innovation and manufacturing expertise will increasingly provide our exports in the years to come. Specialisation, not the basic manufacturing from which we benefited so much in the past, will be the basis of our manufacturing industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="0612186000209"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, pointed out, this is inevitable, as China and India, with their combined population of 2.5 billion, against our 60 million, and their large resource of labour from their agricultural areas, produce each year 2 million to 3 million science and technological graduates. This is enormous. China&#146;s index of production rose from 2000 to January 2006 by 87 per cent. With all these graduates coming and taking on some of the basic industries that we thought were ours indefinitely, the situation will change. In 2005, growth in China was 8.4 per cent and in India 4.4 per cent.</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="0612186000210"></a>Meanwhile we have witnessed a steady decline in our manufacturing industry as a proportion of gross domestic product. We have a unique experience of macroeconomic stability. This helps productivity, as it makes planning easier. We have benefited from this macroeconomic stability of the past 10 years, for which the Chancellor of the Exchequer is wholly responsible.</p>

I understand the difficulty of the timetable but if we are really serious, should not more realistic and earlier targets be set? It would be splendid if 90 per cent of adults achieved that, but I would like to have seen an aim for a solution and progress rather earlier than 2020. In comparison with Germany, France and some other western countries, our skills levels are not very high. Although the Government stress the need to act in that regard, we must come to a conclusion about how our aims can be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="0612186000212"></a>Meanwhile, the budget deficit is continuing and has to come to an end. Macroeconomic stability has helped productivity, since it enables companies more easily to plan for the future, and we have benefited from that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="0612186000213"></a>In 2004 the Chancellor of the Exchequer commissioned Sandy Leitch to identify the skills needed to maximise economic growth, productivity and social justice. The report was produced this month. On page 3, the Leitch review recommends that,</p>
<ul><a name="0612186000242"></a>&#147;the UK commit to becoming a world leader in skills by 2020&#148;.</ul>
<a name="61218-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="0612186000214"></a>I would like to see something more positive than just a statement that we will become the world leader in skills. It seems an objective that needs rather more thorough examination. The review goes on to say that the aim is for,</p>
<ul><a name="0612186000243"></a>&#147;90 per cent of adults qualified to at least Level 2, an increase from 69 per cent in 2005. A commitment to go further and achieve 95 per cent as soon as possible&#148;.</ul>
<a name="61218-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="0612186000215"></a>Level 2 is the academic equivalent of five GCSEs at grades A to C and a number of other qualifications. At present, more than 4 million people of working age in England have no qualifications at all and lack basic skills. The new skills envoy, Sir Digby Jones, a member of the national Learning and Skills Council, was appointed the day after the publication of the Leitch report. That shows some enthusiasm, which I am pleased to see. He told the <I>Guardian Unlimited</I>:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="0612186000236"></a>&#147;The job is to really push with the employers the need to skill their employees&#148;.</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="0612186000216"></a>I understand the importance that the Chancellor of the Exchequer gives to this; it is probably the most critical long-term issue in our objective of maintaining an important industrial base in this changing 21st century. To justify the Chancellor&#146;s expectations, many more of the details need to be set out. I look forward to seeing this in due course.</p>

With free capital markets, there will be such flows in and out all the time. We are very much indebted to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, for having the courage when he was Chancellor to remove external capital controls. The British economy has benefited from that move. For the firm, there will be benefits from capital diversification and potentially from productivity improvements. Increased competition of that kind may also lead to improvements in the wider economy.</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="06121811000002"></a>From our point of view, what is most interesting is the scale of recent inflows of this kind, which in 2005 were the largest in the world. We also have the largest level in Europe of these investments of such assets viewed as a stock. Worldwide, we are second only to the US. Equally, we have a large outflow and the second largest stock of overseas assets&#151;again, second only to the US.</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="06121811000003"></a>One may argue about some aspects of the meaning of these capital flows in and out, but it clearly does not suggest remotely an economy in which serious foreign investors lack confidence&#151;quite the contrary. I am a natural supporter of the Government, as are my noble friends Lord Barnett and Lord Sheldon, so your Lordships can leave us out, but the best evidence of the enormous success of our economy under the Government is the behaviour of foreign investors when it comes to investing here.</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="06121811000004"></a>On the economy, I shall not repeat at any length the remarks that I made in the debate on the gracious Speech. In essence, we have a successful and stable economy. That is also confirmed, as my noble friend Lord Barnett pointed out, by the independent forecasters, who have no debts or anything to get from the Government. They tell us that, on average, GDP growth is on its long-term trend; CPI inflation is returning to its target value; and public sector net borrowing is within the target range. Those are averages, and different forecasters will disagree, but the general position is satisfactory.</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="06121811000005"></a>On a related point, we continue to be bombarded by reports commissioned by the Government on how we can do better. From my rather cynical standpoint, these reports specialise in reinventing the wheel and stating the obvious. The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, gave us a very good example; I could give him another dozen, going back my whole life ever since I was an economics undergraduate. These reports uniformly fail to answer the basic question. Since nothing of what they say is original, why have the appropriate changes not occurred already? We are

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="06121811000006"></a>I hope that I misheard the Minister, but I have a feeling that he announced yet another report from some independent body. I stand second to none in my regard for Sir Digby Jones. However, I can remember at least 45 years ago the National Economic Development Council going along exactly those lines and promising us all great improvements from more education, more training and so on. I do not want to put a damper on it, but we have heard all this before. To put it differently, I would rather have action than yet another set of reports.</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="06121811000007"></a>I turn now to the point raised by my noble friend Lord Sheldon. Again, I very much agree with him. The appropriate question is this. What should be our response to climate change? I do not doubt that climate change is occurring. I am not undermining the view of the natural scientists. The Government are right to emphasise the need for international co-ordinated action. But if you take my view&#151;namely, that there is not going to be any international co-ordinated action&#151;the central question is: what next? I agree that in many cases it is in our direct economic interest to promote the efficient use of energy. That is obvious. I have not had a chance today to check the figures, but I have a strong feeling that energy input per unit of GDP has been falling continuously for a great many years. It has fallen, both directly and indirectly, as a result of oil price rises, technological advance and, more generally, the market mechanism working to cause firms to economise in energy. As far as I know, it has not occurred as a result of government intervention. What we should not do is to place a burden on British industry&#151;this is the point made by my noble friend Lord Sheldon&#151;which our competitors are not placing on their industries.</p>

<a name="61218-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="06121811000008"></a>Perhaps I may also add the technical economic point. It may be optimal to use the tax system to raise the relative cost of some activities, such as those generating carbon emissions. But that does not imply that those tax revenues should add to the total tax burden and, therefore, be spendable. I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, said, in referring to this brilliant concept of motorway access charges, that it is right to have such charges to remove the distortions as a result of congestion, but that that does not tell you that those funds are then available for any purpose whatsoever. That requires a separate argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="06121811000009"></a>I turn now to public expenditure and taxation. In broad terms, it seems to me that the public finances are in reasonably good condition. I agree that we can argue about the dating of the cycle over which the current budget is not in deficit. Your Lordships&#146; Economic Affairs Committee said that the cycle should be decided by an independent body, as the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, argued, and not by the Treasury. I stick to that view. But even if we take a different view from the Treasury and say that there has been a current budget deficit, that deficit would

So I do not think that we need to get terribly hot under the collar about all of that.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="06121811000010"></a>What is good is that it is now accepted and understood across the political spectrum that, in the medium to long term, public expenditure has to be paid for. In other words, a higher growth path for government expenditure, given the path of GDP, means either a lower growth path of consumer expenditure or lower investment. Therefore, if you want more expenditure on some things, you are bound to come up with the other point: on what do you want less expenditure? Perhaps I may say somewhat tartly that that applies to Trident as well as to many other things.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="06121811000011"></a>I have two worries. The first is the question of efficiency gains, which my noble friend Lord Barnett has drawn to our attention. The Public Accounts Committee in the other place said in July that the announcements of efficiency gains have lacked analysis to support the claims that are being made, and it asked for more and better information. I agree, as I think we all would. The Treasury claims that in 2006 efficiency gains have amounted to some &#163;13 billion. I have searched the Pre-Budget Report in vain for precise details of how that calculation is done and what those gains are. I would like not only to know how the Treasury calculates them, but to see them spelled out by department.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="06121811000012"></a>&#147;Efficiency gain&#148; means either getting more and better services for the same money or getting the same services for less expenditure. In some cases it is one, in some the other. As I say, though, I fail to see a full account of that in the Pre-Budget Report, and the ad hoc examples that are given&#151;this department has done a bit of that, that department has done a bit of something else&#151;are not what is required in a serious analysis of the problem.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="06121811000013"></a>Thirty years ago, I was one of the first economists to become very unpopular in the Labour Party for arguing that it was at least as vital for the public sector as for the private sector to make efficiency a top priority. Indeed, I went further: since we were committed to the public sector, our responsibility was at least to insist that that sector became more efficient. That was not very much liked when I used to tell my friends on this side of the House that that was how we had to look at it. They thought that there was an easy way out.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="06121811000014"></a>I would like to see, perhaps in the next Pre-Budget Report from a different Chancellor, a careful, serious account, department by department, of how the efficiency gains are occurring. I think that most noble Lords would agree with that. Wearing a very reactionary hat, I would prefer to see the gains made before the question of how we spend the resulting sums was determined, rather than that the gains were taken for granted and we were simply told how the money was going to be spent. I would not do that in my private life, and I certainly do not think that is how the Government ought to behave.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="06121811000015"></a>My second and final worry is the PFI. Will my noble friend the Minister clarify the position&#151;not necessarily in his wind-up speech, because we are all getting tired already, but perhaps by writing to us&#151;concerning the payments and repayments over the long term of funds arising from the PFI? Is there a ticking time bomb, as some have alleged, regarding repayment in due course? The Pre-Budget Report refers to an assessment of the lifetime costs of both providing and maintaining the underlying assets and delivering the required level of service, or the running costs. I have to ask: are we confident that all those costs have been budgeted for and that the relevant bodies&#151;at all levels, right down to hospitals and so on&#151;are in a position to meet them? The more difficult question is: are we monitoring the PFI projects to determine whether, ex post facto, the gains that are claimed in terms of efficiency and cheaper finance have actually occurred and been advantageous to the public sector?</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="06121811000016"></a>I shall end as I began. This is unusual for me, because normally I believe that the main badge of honour of a serious economist is to take a totally black view of every topic, but I will say that, in my lifetime&#146;s experience, the economy is in as good shape as it has ever been. More to the point, it is in extremely good hands. I hope and expect it to stay that way.</p>

On the macroeconomy, the Chancellor&#146;s decision on day one of this Government to adopt Liberal Democrat policy and make the Bank of England independent was the most important that he has made as Chancellor, as most noble Lords have said. It has worked well and more than any other single decision has given the stability and certainty of policy direction to keep inflation down and stimulate growth. Your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on Economic Affairs has once again, in its report today, criticised the way in which the Chancellor makes appointments to the Monetary Policy Committee, which at its most charitable could be called eccentric, at least in the administrative procedures that are adopted. I absolutely agree with that, but despite that wrinkle in the system the MPC has clearly worked well.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="06121811000018"></a>As far as the growth projections are concerned, for the next couple of years the Chancellor&#146;s projections look a bit on the high side, but as always the outcome will depend in large measure on growth in the US, where the picture is mildly discouraging, and in Europe, where it is mildly encouraging. The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, in particular, discussed why the Chancellor felt able to raise the trend rate of growth from 2.5 per cent to 2.75 per cent. I believe that the single biggest reason is the projected growth in the population, for which the single biggest reason is the large increase in net migration into the UK. In the past couple of years,  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1857"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1857</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we have seen possibly as many as 600,000 migrants coming into the UK from the former eastern bloc and elsewhere. Although that level is set to fall, all the projections show that net migration is set to remain relatively high, at over 150,000 per year, way into the future.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="06121811000019"></a>In some respects, that is good news. In many industries and regions, migration has met labour shortages, both at the top end of the scale&#151;I believe that 30 per cent of doctors in the UK were born outside the UK&#151;and the bottom end of the scale, where almost one-fifth of those employed in the leisure services industry and tourism were born outside the UK. It has held wage growth in check, as the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, said. At the same time, however, an underlying weakness has enabled and encouraged that high level of migration to take place&#151;the fact that there is still a large proportion of economically inactive adults. Of those people and those with low-skilled jobs, we find that some 20 per cent do not have the literacy and numeracy levels that we expect of 11 year-olds. It is a sad indictment of the Government, who have placed education absolutely at the forefront of their thinking, that they have fallen so far short of ensuring that all young adults have the basic tools of employability.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="06121811000020"></a>It is equally depressing that during the Government&#146;s lifetime the number of young people studying the core disciplines of maths, science and modern languages has fallen in both relative and absolute terms despite the huge amount of extra funding that has gone into the education system. While I hope that the Government will be successful and that, by 2020, 90 per cent of adults will have the equivalent of five GSCE grades A to C, experience over the past 10 years suggests that, far from that being too far in the distance as a target, frankly it is a pipe dream on current policies. The Government missed a huge opportunity to tackle the problem by not accepting the Tomlinson report on vocational education. One hopes that they do not miss another opportunity by not implementing the Leitch report, which, as far as it goes, should be warmly welcomed.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="06121811000021"></a>The Chancellor established the golden rule as the centrepiece of his strategy for public finances. It is just possible that the rule has had a restraining influence on the Chancellor&#146;s natural spending habits, but it now looks pretty threadbare, partly because it is constantly revised, which undermines credibility whether or not the revisions are right, and partly because there is a problem with a rule that looks at cycles of 10 years, as in most cases Governments do not neatly span 10-year cycles. If a Government coming in in years nine and 10 of a 10-year cycle were faced with the need severely to curb public expenditure just to meet the golden rule, would they do so? I think not. Therefore, the rule has serious flaws. If we really think that the rule is of fundamental importance&#151;I am not sure that there is a consensus that it is as important as, say, the rule that underpins the MPC&#151;the logical step would be, as the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, said, to establish an independent body along the lines of the MPC to

I am not sure that Prime Minister Brown will be any keener on that than Chancellor Brown has been.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="06121811000022"></a>I cannot, unfortunately, accept the rosy picture of the public finances painted by the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, because in this year&#146;s PBR, as in last year&#146;s, and as in the Budget, we see taxes rise to fill a hole in the public finances. I shall come to the specifics in a moment, but the overall position is absolutely clear. In recent years, we have seen an unsustainable surge in spending, which will have to be severely reined in as soon as the Chancellor is safely out of No. 11. Nothing demonstrates this better than education, which we are told will be protected in next year&#146;s public spending round. The annual growth in schools&#146; expenditure between 1997 and 2007 is 16.3 per cent. By comparison, for 2007-10 it is expected to be 4.9 per cent. This is not a sensible approach. Stop-go spending on public services, even on a rising trend, is as inefficient and demoralising as it is for the entire economy. I suspect that the crunch on public spending will come in negotiations on public sector pay, in which the Chancellor appears committed to forcing through a real-terms pay cut. How ironic that this Chancellor, who has been so keen to court the unions to further his career up to this point, is set as Prime Minister to face a confrontation with them as one of his first challenges in that office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="06121811000023"></a>In addition, the Chancellor as Prime Minister will be faced with a number of open-ended public expenditure commitments&#151;the continuing Afghan and Iraq wars; defence procurement contracts such as the Eurofighter and Trident; new nuclear power; and ID cards&#151;none of which he seems keen to reverse. With these commitments, even if he is able to keep his pledges on education, the outlook for other key public spending commitments&#151;on pensions, policing and hospitals, for example&#151;looks pretty bleak.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="06121811000024"></a>The major tax change in the PBR was, of course, the increase in air passenger duties as part of the Chancellor&#146;s plans to tackle climate change. However, the form of the air passenger duty is highly inefficient as a means of curbing aircraft greenhouse gases, because it takes no account of whether the aircraft is empty or full and it excludes freight altogether. It is very difficult to resist drawing the conclusion that this duty increase was a product of fiscal necessity, not of environmental concern.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="06121811000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, discussed the concept of the green budget. I believe that the phrase was first used not in relation to the environment at all but to describe a provisional budget with a number of options for a full budget. This certainly is not a green budget, although the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, sets too high a bar on the potential effectiveness and value of green taxes. In my view, to be effective a tax increase does not have to completely destroy the activity that is being taxed. If green taxes on aircraft, for example, merely slow or stop growth in air travel, that would be a major achievement. One has to accept that taxes can have a valuable impact without totally destroying the activity on which they are imposed.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="06121811000026"></a>The other environmental measures in the Pre-Budget Report are pitiful. The total financial consequence of all the other environmental announcements was &#163;5 million in 2007-08 and literally zero in each of the following years. On the potentially vital issue of carbon capture and storage, the Chancellor announced a study to be undertaken with Norway. Frankly, we do not need further study; we need financial commitment to demonstration projects, in which power generation companies are champing at the bit to participate.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="06121811000027"></a>When we discussed the Stern report during the debate on the Queen&#146;s Speech, and in today&#146;s debate, the noble Lords, Lord Barnett, Lord Sheldon and Lord Peston, raised the issue of whether we should be taking a lead on global warming. They pointed out that, given that the UK accounts for only a small proportion of total greenhouse gases, we could not make much difference, either directly or indirectly, in anything that we did, and that, therefore, we should not seek to take a lead. I have two points to make on that.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="06121811000028"></a>First, since the Queen&#146;s Speech debate, I have had a number of conversations with representatives of major environmental players, including the former environment Minister of Brazil. It was clear to me that a lead taken by Britain would have an impact way beyond its immediate effects. The whole world knows that we must act on global warming, but it looks to the countries with the longest track record of environmental pollution&#151;and we are the leaders in that field&#151;to set a practical and moral lead.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="06121811000029"></a>Secondly, I compare tackling global warming to tackling global poverty. The noble Lords who argued that we should not take a lead on global warming have, over the years, been keen supporters of UK funding for international development. Yet while there is a moral case for supporting action against both climate change and poverty, not least because broadly the same people suffer most&#151;notably the poor in Africa and elsewhere&#151;we will be afflicted much worse by global warming. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, pointed out, we are not just speaking of minor costs. He spoke about the inundation of Essex, which a number of noble Lords seemed to find mildly amusing. Perhaps the prospect of having to spend billions of pounds over a sustained period to stop the inundation of London will focus people&#146;s minds more clearly. Extreme poverty makes us uncomfortable, but extreme global warming would make us poor.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="06121811000030"></a>My final thought on this Pre-Budget Report, as it wings its way to Brussels, is that this Chancellor has developed to an extraordinary extent the concept of publishing at the time of the Pre-Budget Report as wide a range of material as the Treasury printing presses can produce. I suspect that this Pre-Budget Report broke all records, although I have not weighed it. Perhaps the Minister could pass on to the Chancellor one suggestion to make to his successor&#151;to produce over a slightly more digestible period the myriad reports that the Treasury now deems necessary for the effective running of the economy, so that noble Lords, the Commission and the country at large can take more note of them.</p>

<a name="06121811000031"></a><b><a name="61218-0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="06121811000058"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> My Lords, in the corporate world the average tenure of chief executives is five to seven years. The turnover of chief financial officers is even more frequent, at around every three to five years. After that, they tend to run out of ideas and their organisations need to be refreshed. I am sure that the Chancellor thinks that the Prime Minister has run out of steam in his near 10 years in office, but can the Chancellor see that he, too, has run out of ideas and that the Treasury could do with refreshment? Judging from the Chancellor&#146;s performance in the Pre-Budget Report, it is clear that he does not see that.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="06121811000032"></a>I wish to outline what we saw and heard in the Pre-Budget Report. My noble friends Lord MacGregor and Lord Northbrook have already made excellent speeches that covered much of the territory that I had planned to discuss, but, since those points were important, I shall make no apologies for repeating some of them. First, we saw the usual boasting about growth in the economy. We are completely used to the Chancellor ignoring the fact that the current run of growth started well before 1997 and not in 1997. We are pretty used to the fact that he relegates inconvenient facts, such as dropping the estimate of growth in 2008, to the small print of the report itself. But we cannot get used to him boasting about growth while the plain fact is that our current growth is at the bottom of the EU. It is below the OECD and world averages. Growth is a relative concept. It is no good growing at a slower rate than the rest of the world. We will become detached&#151;to use the imagery of Polly Toynbee&#151;from the caravan and get left behind if we do not accelerate our growth rate.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="06121811000033"></a>Then we saw the usual fiddling of the figures. I did not believe the rumours in the press suggesting that the Chancellor would change the golden rule parameters yet again. That is the fourth change, three of them involving the timing of the cycle. But, hey presto, the Chancellor decided that the golden rule meant that the cycle would end in a few months&#146; time, albeit with the smallest of margins. How convenient it was that the NAO was not asked to review this latest change, given its fairly damning comments about the lack of evidence that existed in the Treasury on previous decisions on the timing of the cycle. Even more convenient in the run-up to the next election is the ability of the Chancellor to rely on a new, hypothetical cycle as well as new estimates of the trend-rated growth. This demonstrates the urgent need for independent oversight of the fiscal rules, as my party has long been advocating. I was pleased to note this afternoon that there appears to be an emerging consensus on that.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="06121811000034"></a>The Chancellor swaggered and fiddled the figures, but he also ignored many of the real issues in the economy. He did not mention that unemployment&#151;at 1.7 million&#151;has been rising faster than anywhere else in the developed world. He certainly did not mention that unemployment in the 16 to 18 year-old range is 40 per cent higher than in 1997. He trumpeted the increase in employment, but the ONS more accurately describes the trend rate in employment as &#147;flat&#148;, and any increases are modest compared with the increase in unemployment.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1861"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1861</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="61218-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="06121811000035"></a>Behind all these figures is the impact of immigration, a topic already raised by the noble Lord, Lord Newby. The Governor of the Bank of England recently noted the lack of reliable statistics on immigration. It is important to understand the impact of immigration on growth, employment and wage rates, and on demand for public services. I asked the Minister about this in our debate on the gracious Speech, but his reply was merely:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="06121811000050"></a>&#147;The economic impact of migration from the new EU member states has been modest but broadly positive&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report,</I> 27/11/06; col. 635.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06121811000048"></a>At best, that was a partial answer.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="06121811000036"></a>I ask the Minister again to set out what the Government are doing to understand the impact of all forms of immigration on our economy. We believe that we should be seeing the issue of immigration in terms of maximising the net benefit to the UK of GDP per capita, but if we have ropey statistics and an imperfect understanding of the mechanisms at work, we could be storing up trouble for the future.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="06121811000037"></a>The Chancellor ignored unemployment issues. Another issue he ignored was the funding crisis in the NHS, which is having a serious impact on services. What did he say about that? Absolutely nothing. The Chancellor does not understand that pouring money into unreformed public services adds to, rather than solves, problems. He just turns his back on the problem.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="06121811000038"></a>A further issue he ignored is the collapse of private sector pension provision, some of which is attributable directly to his annual &#163;5 billion cash raid since 1997. The savings ratio is nearly one half of that in 1997. What did the Chancellor do in the Pre-Budget Report? He increased the rate of pension credit ahead of the rate of basic pension to ensure that as many old people as possible remained trapped in his prison of means-testing. In the small print he attacked alternatively secured pensions, a matter referred to by my noble friend Lord Northbrook, because they help people who have saved for a secure and prosperous retirement. State dependency coupled with the politics of envy is the hallmark of old-fashioned socialism, and that is what we saw in the Pre-Budget Report.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="06121811000039"></a>Another regular feature of the Chancellor&#146;s statements is the re-announcement of past decisions dressed up as new ones. We had a few of those, such as the &#163;1 billion of research moneys that were already available. We also saw his old trick of the apparent promise of new money, not backed up in the small print. This year&#146;s big lie, as has already been referred to, is about education. The Chancellor played to his Back-Bench gallery by pretending that there would be an increase in education capital investment. He talked about &#163;36 billion, but, as the devastating analysis of the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows, only &#163;0.1 billion was new money. The increased direct payments to schools, which are a drop in the ocean of educational spending, are for one year only. I was going to ask the Minister how the Chancellor expects head teachers to plan and manage on that basis, but I realised that the

That is part of the problem.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="06121811000040"></a>The Chancellor&#146;s well worn tricks of borrowing and taxing yet again feature in the Pre-Budget Report. Another &#163;7 billion of borrowing has been added since the Budget, and the tax bill goes up by around &#163;2.2 billion a year. Nearly half of that is the increase in air passenger duty, which, as has been pointed out, is a revenue-raiser rather than a genuine switch to green taxes. The noble Lords, Lord Barnett and Lord Newby, got that absolutely right. The verdict of Ed Matthews, of Friends of the Earth, perhaps says it all:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="06121811000051"></a>&#147;I would give him probably one out of 10 ... I think it&#146;s pretty feeble&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="61218-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="06121811000041"></a>Most of the rest of the tax hikes basically hit business in one way or another. The Chancellor continues to ignore the calls from the business community that our tax rates, once among the most competitive in the world, are now among the least competitive.</p>

<a name="61218-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="06121811000042"></a>The Chancellor also ignores the fact that his tax and tax credit structures result in more than 2 million people experiencing marginal withdrawal rates of over 60 per cent. A recent Joseph Rowntree report found that work incentives are worse now than they were in 1997, especially for those moving from low-paid or part-time work. The Chancellor has created welfare dependency stretching well beyond the poor. This PBR did nothing to reverse those trends.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61218-0007.htm"/>


<a name="61218-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="06121811000043"></a>The PBR also did nothing to stop the decline in living standards that a recent report by Capital Economics has shown. All the measures of inflation are rising and are the highest since 1997. Wage increases are now running well behind the inflation experienced by people on low incomes. Pensioners are experiencing cost increases of nearly 9 per cent, which is roughly two and a half times the rate of their pension increase.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="06121811000044"></a>Lastly, the Chancellor said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="06121811000052"></a>&#147;I have also considered representations for a third fiscal rule which would require us to cut spending by &#163;28 billion this year alone. This is a choice for Britain I reject&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06121811000049"></a>Will the Minister explain which bizarre third fiscal rule the Chancellor was referring to, and how he calculated the &#163;28 billion? He usually uses the term &#147;a third fiscal rule&#148; to refer to our own policy of prospectively sharing the proceeds of growth. Will the Minister confirm that, if the Chancellor was referring to that, his own figures have expenditure growing by 1.9 per cent in real terms over the period to 2011-12 and that 1.9 per cent growth is less than the growth rate of the economy over that period? Does that not amount to sharing the proceeds of growth, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies concluded?</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="06121811000045"></a>I will summarise my charge sheet. The Chancellor brags and fiddles the figures; he ignores the real issues facing the country, and claims more than he actually delivers. The truth is that the Chancellor taxes and borrows a lot, while pouring the proceeds into unreformed public services and the creation of welfare dependency. He then has the cheek to misrepresent our own policies, while following them to the letter. The Treasury certainly

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="06121811000046"></a>We are debating the Pre-Budget Report in the context of the annual report that we have to make to the EU on our public finances. As I have often remarked, this is a meaningless report, since we are not part of the euro-zone. The one thing for which I have consistently praised the Chancellor is his ability to keep our membership off the agenda. The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, asked today about the complexity of a referendum on the euro, but it is really very simple; it is a question of yes or no. It is not a question of working out the complexities of the five tests, if indeed they are at root complex. If the noble Lord has difficulties on that yes or no question, I will be happy to help him with the answer when the time comes&#151;if, indeed, it ever does.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="06121811000047"></a>The European Commission&#146;s latest economic forecasts are that the UK&#146;s structural deficit is larger than that of any other large EU country, including Italy. What is the Government&#146;s response? Do they think that it is a largely irrelevant commentary by a not especially relevant body, or that the views of the European Commission on our economy actually matter? If they do, how will we see the Government respond?</p>

I thank all noble Lords who have contributed and welcome the breadth of discussion and of interest expressed. This Motion asks the House to take note with approval of the Government&#146;s assessment, as set out in the Pre-Budget Report, for the purposes of Section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993, which enables the UK to make an effective contribution to multilateral surveillance within the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="06121819000002"></a>I will seek to answer as many of the issues raised as I can. The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market, questioned the golden rule. He asserted that it had lost credibility, due to the dating of the cycle and the definition of borrowing. As other noble Lords raised this point, let me clarify that the NAO will be invited to audit the dating of the cycle once the Treasury has made a firm judgment on when it ends, just as it was asked to date the beginning of the cycle. I do not see the issue there.</p>

On the current assessment it will end in early 2007. Because of particular issues about labour market data, the Treasury needs to see that through to make a final determination. There is nothing wrong in that, as labour market data is quite complex; in some respects&#151;such as on migration&#151;it is problematic, as the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, pointed out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="06121819000005"></a>To clarify, by moving the end of the cycle to 2006-07 we would actually miss out two years, which together have an average current surplus, so I do not see how the Government can be accused of seeking to fiddle the figures on that basis.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="06121819000006"></a>As for changing the cycle, when we debated this a year ago, there was, if I may say so, a certain amount of gloating from Members on the opposition Benches about the Chancellor having to reduce the growth forecasts. The extension of the cycle was a consequence of the reduction of the forecast for growth, because it is longer before you get back through trend. If, in fact, growth has been stronger in 2006 than anticipated, it is entirely reasonable that we will get back to trend growth sooner, so the end of the cycle changes.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="06121819000007"></a>The definition of borrowing and the decision whether a PFI project is on- or off-balance sheet are made independently of the Government. The reason for the increase in net debt is that the figures for PFI contracts that should be on-balance sheet are now included in the net debt figures. We debated that issue before and have addressed it. The issue of Network Rail is, if I may say so, an old chestnut. It has been looked at independently and a judgment made that, considering the risks involved, it should not be on the Government's balance sheet. The Government did not make that decision; the ONS and the NAO considered the issue.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="06121819000008"></a>The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, and others said that taxes, especially business taxes, are too high. Since 1997, the Government have cut the main corporation tax from 33 to 30 per cent, the lowest ever UK rate of corporation tax. The structure of the UK tax system favours jobs and competitiveness. The UK tax-to-GDP ratio is substantially below its peak of 38.8 per cent in the early 1980s, when we had a Conservative Government. Indeed, the recent report from PricewaterhouseCoopers and the World Bank placed the UK very favourably in terms of ease of paying business taxes; and the latest OECD figures for 2004 show that taxes on corporate income in the UK are below the average for the OECD and the EU 15 and EU 25. In terms of the approach to taxation, the proposals for HMRC to improve its relationship and processes with big business, in particular, for clearances, should be widely welcomed.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="06121819000009"></a>The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, referred to highly leveraged debt and hedge funds. The FSA, the Bank of England and HMT keep an eye on these things and are wary of the risks that they entail, although they bring liquidity to markets and encourage innovation in some respects. Corporate balance sheets are stronger than they have been for a considerable time. If we look at the sector in aggregate, the data show that they are strong. I am pleased that the noble Lord broadly welcomed the Eddington report and the Barker report. My noble friend Lord Peston made the point that we have had lots of these reports before and that nothing much changes. The difference this time is that the strength of the UK economy and the framework in place enable the Government to deal with those issues and take forward those long-term possibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="06121819000010"></a>The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, mentioned productivity. Although historically, UK productivity has been lower than in other major economies, ONS data show signs of catch-up between the UK and its main industrial competitors. Since 1995, the output-per-worker gap with Germany has closed; the gap with France has roughly halved; and the UK now leads Japan by about 11 percentage points.

Our position on membership of the single currency was set out by the Chancellor in his Statement to the House of Commons in October 1997 and again in his Statement on the five tests in June 2003. The determining factor underpinning any government decision on membership of the single currency is the national economic interest and whether the economic case for joining is clear and unambiguous.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="06121819000012"></a>The Chancellor announced in the 2006 Budget that the Government do not propose a euro assessment to be initiated at the time of this Budget, and the Treasury will again review the situation at Budget time next year. The question of what the process and the question would be if we held a referendum is an interesting point, but I suspect that we would not ask people to give their views specifically on the five tests.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="06121819000013"></a>My noble friend Lord Barnett talked about the green budget and the effect of taxes. Are taxes meant to change behaviour or are they meant to raise revenue? One has to look at the Government&#146;s approach to climate change as a whole. The climate change levy was introduced at the same time as cuts in national insurance contributions for employers were made, so taxation was switched to something that was bad in an attempt to improve energy efficiency and to relieve costs on employment. That was one example. The Government are involved in a range of processes, such as the emissions trading scheme, the climate change levy to deal with energy efficiency and a range of taxes to seek to change behaviour.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="06121819000014"></a>The noble Lord asked what was happening to assist pensioners with gas and electricity costs. I have nothing on that to hand, but I shall write to him with an early Christmas present. He asked about the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and the Government&#146;s economic objectives. Output and employment are important factors in the MPC&#146;s monetary policy decision. The minutes of the MPC, which are published within two weeks of its monthly meetings, show the importance of GDP growth and labour market conditions as factors underpinning the committee&#146;s interest rate decisions.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="06121819000015"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, and others raised issues about the Government&#146;s forecasts. We should put that into context. Since 1997, the Treasury, on average, has outperformed the independent consensus in both current-year and year-ahead GDP growth forecasts. In comparison with the previous Administration, this Government have a better record of current-year and year-ahead forecasts.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="06121819000016"></a>The noble Lord asked about trend growth and the reason for the changes. The NAO will audit budget assumptions and has already looked at the change in trend growth and determined that it is reasonable and cautious. The data releases since Budget 2006 relating to inward migration provide new evidence to support an upward revision of the assumed working-age population growth post-2006. That is one of the key features in determining trend growth; others are productivity, hours worked and employment levels.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="06121819000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, welcomed the Gowers review, the Barker review, with some reservation, and the Leitch report. He specifically asked about the Gershon savings and the reconciliation of the figures. Workforce reduction figures will never precisely match changes to Civil Service figures reported by the ONS, as the two measure different things over different periods and have different coverage. The ONS figures are broadly consistent, showing a reduction in the size of the Civil Service for the past seven consecutive quarters. A technical notice published on the Cabinet Office website explains the difference between the figures. I draw the noble Lord&#146;s attention to that.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="06121819000018"></a>The noble Lord suggested that public finances have been deteriorating but borrowing is still projected to fall in each year of the forecast period. The current balance will move into surplus in 2008-09, with the surplus rising to 0.8 per cent of GDP by 2011-12. The Government are meeting their strict fiscal rules over this cycle and are on course to meet the fiscal rules in the next cycle. The noble Lord referred to air passenger duty and asked why it was not introduced when one bought one&#146;s ticket. The structure of the tax is that it operates when people fly and there could not be two systems for charging the tax. It was introduced prospectively to operate from February next year. The noble Lord spoke about the change of the cycle, a point with which I have tried to deal.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="06121819000019"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, and others raised the issue of alternatively secured pensions. The changes made were entirely consistent with the Government&#146;s policy announcement that those provisions were meant to deal with specific circumstances, particularly for those with a religious objection to entering into annuities; so the Government&#146;s position and the changes introduced should have come as no surprise.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="06121819000020"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, talked about an open letter and asked whether there was a difficulty with that because of the inflation figures. Inflation has risen above target in recent months, driven by increases in energy and food prices. The rise in oil prices since early 2003 is the largest sustained oil price shock in 25 years. Oil prices have tripled since early 2003 and doubled since the beginning of 2004. These effects are, however, expected to be temporary, and oil prices are expected to be lower on average in 2007 than in 2006. The MPC has an excellent record on keeping inflation at or around target. Even if an open letter is triggered, that does not mean that the MPC has failed. The short-term relationship between output and inflation is only imperfectly understood, and monetary policy affects output and inflation with

As a consequence, inflation may temporarily move outside the thresholds that trigger an open letter.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="06121819000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, also spoke about the impressive performance of the economy, which is absolutely right, and he reminded us of what the past held. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, referred to 57 quarters of growth and said that the Chancellor conveniently forgets that some of those accrued before 1997. That is right but, since 1997, we have avoided the boom and bust of the past&#151;a key feature of the Government&#146;s fiscal and monetary framework.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="06121819000022"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, mentioned air-passenger duty and asked why we could not have an aircraft tax. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, made the same point. There are difficulties with such a tax, partly because there is a risk that people would simply rearrange their fleets so that the more effective ones operated from UK airports. There are also issues about a tax on emissions that could be outwith our international obligations at the moment. There are already pressures to increase load factors for economic reasons that have nothing particularly to do with emissions.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="06121819000023"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, also referred to the current high rate of income tax. He will be aware that we have a manifesto commitment not to change those rates.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="06121819000024"></a>My noble friend Lord Peston talked about the success of the economy as demonstrated by foreign direct investment, and I agree. Indeed, he talked, as I remarked earlier, about a plethora of reports in the past, but there really is a difference now in that the framework in place and the strength of the economy enable us to make progress in those key areas, which we need in any event for the future. He said that green taxes should not be a burden on industry. Indeed, the climate change levy, as I said earlier, was accompanied by a reduction in employers&#146; national insurance contributions, so it is a good example of taxing a bad and relieving tax on a good. He also referred to efficiency gains and inquired how they were calculated. Perhaps I might follow that up with him outside this sitting. Of course I agree with my noble friend that it is as important for the public sector to be efficient as it is for the private sector. He asked about PFI and the risk that not all costs are budgeted for. The process that I outlined a little earlier is that a judgment must be made about where the risk in these contracts lies and whether they should be counted as government expenditure. Until recently, the relevant components of the net debt figures on balance-sheet PFI contracts were not included. They are now, which accounts for some of the changes to the figures before us. The noble Lord commented that the economy is in as good a shape as it has ever been. I agree with that, and with his remark that he hopes it stays that way under the guidance of a Labour Chancellor and a Labour Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="06121819000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, said what a good idea it was to make the Bank of England independent. I believe that he claimed some credit for that, but I remind him that what has been successful about the economy is not only making the Bank of England  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1868"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1868</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>independent for monetary-policy reasons but having that sit alongside the fiscal rules&#151;the golden rule and the sustainable investment rule. They work together to ensure that the economy is successful and has sustained good growth, good employment, low inflation and low interest rates.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="06121819000026"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, queried whether the growth projections were a little on the high side and questioned the Treasury&#146;s position. I touched on the Treasury&#146;s record earlier. He asked whether the growth in population is affected by migration. The answer is yes. Net migration increases the UK&#146;s working-age population, which in turn increases the economy&#146;s growth potential. Using working-age population growth as one of the drivers of trend growth projections has long been part of established HMT methodology. The migration projection does not take into account any increase in post-succession migration from A8 and makes no allowance for possible additional migration from Bulgaria and Romania.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="06121819000027"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, suggested that the golden rule was seriously flawed because it could span more than two Governments. But it is an objective economic analysis based on evidence that drives the golden rule&#151;one would hope that if it were to span two Governments, an incoming Government would see the great sense of the rule in operation under this Labour Government. I do not anticipate that happening for a little while, however&#151;I hope not in my lifetime.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="06121819000028"></a>It is not right that there has been an unsustainable surge in spending. The rise in the rate of spending may be moderated, but we are still talking about historically high levels of investment in public services.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="06121819000029"></a>We have talked about air passenger duty and whether that should be a tax on aircraft. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, said that there was a wide range of material and asked whether it could be spread in a more digestible way. All these documents are interlinked and part of a complete story. I would only add that I have to read them all as well for the purposes of this debate.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="06121819000030"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, was less than enthusiastic about the Chancellor&#146;s performance and was critical in a number of areas. She referred to the usual boasting about growth in the economy. Certainly part of that growth was from before 1997, but this Government have made sure that that growth has been sustained.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="06121819000031"></a>We discussed the timing of the cycle. I said that the NAO would be asked to review this once the final decision was made&#151;when there is a complete picture, particularly of the labour market. We expect the date to be in the current year.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="06121819000032"></a>The noble Baroness said there was a crisis in NHS funding. That is simply not a fair reflection of the position. She talked again about pensions and the Chancellor&#146;s alleged raid on pension funds. The Turner report is very clear on this. The short-term effect of the change in ACT on pension funds was small compared to the effect of wider factors, such as  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1869"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1869</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>poor stock market performance and the increase in pension liabilities due to rising longevity. We have had that debate before.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="06121819000033"></a>The noble Baroness also talked about taxes hitting business. The latest OECD figures show that taxes on business in the UK are analysed by the OECD as comparing very favourably with our competitors.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="06121819000034"></a>We talked about welfare dependency. The number of people who might be in that category has decreased by about a million from 1997 to date. The noble Baroness asked about how the so-called third fiscal rule will operate and how that interrelates with the Government&#146;s projections. That is a matter for the CSR, on which we will have more next year.</p>

<a name="61218-0007.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="06121819000035"></a>We have had a number of interesting points in this debate. I am sorry if I have not been able to deal with each of them completely in the time available, but there have been quite a number of questions. I will review the record and follow up in writing as appropriate. The Pre-Budget Report drives forward the greater economic mission of our time to meet the global challenge and to unleash the potential of the British people, so that the British economy outperforms our competitors and delivers security, prosperity and fairness for all. Having taken long-term decisions to achieve and sustain low inflation and economic stability, we are well placed to face up to the global challenges of the 21st-century economy.</p>

The Statement is as follows:</p>
&#147;With permission, I would like to make a Statement on the European Council held in Brussels last Thursday and Friday. As the House knows, it is customary for my right honourable friend the Prime Minister to make this Statement. I have been asked to convey his apologies, as he is currently on an official visit to the Middle East.&#147;There were two main outcomes to this Council. The first, as expected, related to enlargement. The Council endorsed the agreement reached earlier in the week by Foreign Ministers on what action the European Union should take in response to Turkey&#146;s failure to implement the Ankara agreement protocol. There was also a wider discussion on enlargement strategy.&#147;There had been widespread predictions that the discussion on Turkey at the General Affairs Council would be extremely divisive, would spill over into the European Council itself and might risk derailing the process of Turkish accession: the so-called train-wreck scenario, in other words. But this was avoided. The UK&#151;along with others&#151;made a strong strategic case for Turkish membership, and the train remains very much on the track. Negotiations can move  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1870"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1870</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>forward on 27 of the 35 chapters of the acquis. And&#151;for the first time in an EU of 25&#151;there is positive language which will be adopted by the Council, in January, on resuming work &#145;without delay&#146; on a direct trade regulation to end the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriots.&#147;No one is in any doubt that Turkey must meet all the requirements and obligations of membership before joining the European Union. But as this House has consistently agreed, a European Union with Turkey as a member will be stronger, richer and more secure. &#147;The conclusions of the European Council further stressed the strategic importance of enlargement more generally&#151;inspiring reform, driving prosperity and competitiveness, and strengthening the EU&#146;s weight in the world. Those conclusions reaffirmed that the European Union should keep its commitments towards all the countries that are in the enlargement process, moving forward on the basis of strict conditionality at all stages of the negotiations and judging each country on its own merits.&#147;The second focus of the Council was to make progress on the very practical issues that resonate with and matter to the people of Europe and where, through joint action, the European Union can make a positive difference on the ground.&#147;On climate change and energy, the Council built on progress made at the informal summit in Lahti. We agreed that the spring Council will discuss options for a global post-2012 agreement on climate change, consistent with the EU&#146;s objective of a maximum global temperature increase of two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. And we reiterated the need for a global carbon market and reaffirmed the crucial role and the long-term ambition of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.&#147;The Council called for the priority measures in the Commission&#146;s action plan on energy efficiency to be implemented rapidly and endorsed the setting up of a network of energy security correspondents early next year. The spring 2007 European Council is due to adopt a prioritised action plan as part of an integrated approach for a secure, environmentally friendly and competitive energy policy for Europe. And we agreed that European energy and climate change policy will be discussed by the European Council on a regular basis in the future, beginning with an integrated debate on these issues at the spring 2007 meeting.&#147;On Africa, we welcomed the progress report on the implementation of the EU strategy, <I>The EU and Africa: Towards a Strategic Partnership</I>, and called for the implementation of the priority actions for next year identified in that report. We also reaffirmed our commitment to working towards a joint EU-Africa strategy to be adapted at the second EU-Africa summit in the latter half of 2007.&#147;On the globalisation agenda, we asked the Commission to take a number of concrete steps to further promote innovation within Europe. This included presenting a comprehensive intellectual property rights strategy in the course of 2007; working up proposals for industry-led joint technology initiatives  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1871"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1871</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with a view to launching the most advanced ones next year; and, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, coming up with ways in which to improve the working methods and overall resources of the European standardisation bodies. We also agreed to do further work on the idea of a European institute of technology.&#147;On justice and home affairs, the Council agreed to consider options for strengthening the framework for decision-making in order to respond effectively to the current changes in the area of freedom, security and justice.&#147;On migration, we agreed that we need to strengthen our efforts on the global approach and make sure that we address migration in a comprehensive manner. The Council agreed on the next steps that the EU should take in 2007, including detailed action in three areas with regard to illegal migration: first, strengthening and deepening international co-operation with third countries of origin and transit&#151;for example, doing more to integrate migration issues into aid policies and working more effectively with third countries to combat human trafficking; secondly, strengthening co-operation among member states&#151;for example, intensifying measures against illegal employment and developing identification technology at borders; and, thirdly, improving the management of the European Union&#146;s external border&#151;for example, finding sustainable and effective ways to announce the capacity of FRONTEX. The Council also agreed to have a common European asylum system in place by the end of 2010, starting next year with a preliminary evaluation of its first phase.&#147;The Council issued separate declarations on Lebanon, Afghanistan, Iran and African issues. On the Middle East peace process, the European Council set out how it would engage with a legitimate Palestinian Government that adopted a platform reflecting the quartet principles.&#147;The European Council quite rightly concentrated on those areas, not least enlargement, where the European Union can make a real difference to the lives of people in Europe. The progress that we made at the Council and, perhaps just as important, the dangers that we avoided demonstrate again the benefit of having a UK Government with not just a clear strategy on Europe, but a strong influence based on consistent and close engagement to see that strategy through. I commend the outcome to the House&#148;.My Lords, that concludes the Statement.<a name="time_16"></a>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="06121823000005"></a>It was a curious event that took place at the end of last week, because it received amazingly little coverage in the press. One is tempted to think that that must have been because it was a non-event. But  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1872"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1872</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>past experience teaches us that on just such occasions big decisions get slipped through and sensitive matters such as the loss of veto powers get agreed, or some other agreement gets bypassed, surrendered or slipped through. So we need to watch carefully the small print, as at all other meetings. Let me just comment on a few of the salient issues.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="06121823000006"></a>First, on Turkey and enlargement generally, of course we are glad to hear that the Turkish membership issue remains &#147;on the track&#148;. Does that mean that the full range of negotiations can be resumed? How is this going to be done? What steps will be taken to persuade the Greek Cypriot Government in Nicosia, who have so far proved themselves to be totally intransigent, blocking progress at every point, to lift their blocking policy on the inclusion of Turkish Cyprus in the EU? Many people thought that the EU member states had promised that that would happen when Cyprus was admitted to the European Union, but it has not. Are the Government aware of how rapidly Turkish opinion is turning away from the European Union altogether? Are they also aware of the very dangerous implications for all our futures if that is allowed to happen, and the strategic defeat that it would impose on the West? We are glad to hear that there is progress and that Turkey is back on track, as it were, but there are some very high hurdles to jump before we can be reassured.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="06121823000007"></a>Secondly, although I have said that I want to talk about salient points, there is one point that was not salient at all in that it was not even mentioned&#151;the European constitution. This really was the missing guest at the party. It seems barely credible that this issue, which has been vigorously debated in several European capitals these last few weeks and much aired in the press, was apparently not discussed at Brussels at all. But there was no mention of it in the Statement. Has a new timetable been agreed for a new constitutional document, as has been widely reported? What will it include? Will it again propose a full-time President and a full-time Foreign Minister of the European Union, as well as a host of other proposals that were in the failed previous constitution? In fact, will it be another &#147;constitution&#148; at all, given that the word caused so many people a degree of indigestion? If it does have constitutional implications, and big ones, will Her Majesty's Government give this country a referendum on it, as they were prepared to do last time? We need some reassurance; it is very odd that the issue does not get a mention in the Statement.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="06121823000008"></a>Another central issue in everyone&#146;s thinking is climate change and carbon emissions. Of course we are glad to hear that there is a post-2012 agreement in the making and we hope that this has a cutting edge to it. Was it noted at the meeting in Brussels that emissions growth in the United States, which is often criticised and did not even accept the Kyoto Protocol targets, has been notably less in percentage terms in the past five years than has been the case in the European Union? Is there something basically wrong with the EU approach, and can we be assured that a new emissions trading scheme will work a lot better than the current one, which has made very little contribution&#151;indeed, some argue that it has made things very much worse?

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="06121823000009"></a>On the issue that is on everyone&#146;s mind&#151;the quagmire of the Middle East&#151;the Statement tells us what the EU would like to do if only there was a Palestinian Government who would reflect the quartet principles. If only&#151;the problem is that there is no such united position. I wonder whether the Ministers assembled in Brussels had anything to say or any wisdom to add about the hideous internecine fighting in the Gaza area&#151;and, I am afraid, elsewhere&#151;between Al Fatah and Hamas and the growing signs of division and civil war, which mean that the prospect of a Palestinian Government who could negotiate or join in the quartet road map procedures is even more remote than it was before.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="06121823000010"></a>The Statement rightly argues that the need is for a European structure that makes a real and positive difference to all our lives. The biggest difference of all would be to set the European Union on a path towards flexibility, an end to over-centralisation and a modern adjustment to the requirements of a networked world. That is what is needed. Did Her Majesty's Government give a strong lead in that direction? Frankly, there is not much sign of it in the Statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="06121823000012"></a>We have a short Statement but a very long communiqu&#233;, which contains a great deal requiring careful scrutiny by your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on the European Union. There are a number of commitments regarding what we might be doing, including the network of energy security correspondents and the suggestion of a maritime patrol in the Mediterranean. I recall our Prime Minister saying several years ago that Britain&#146;s frontiers are now in the Mediterranean, but we would all like to know a great deal more about how far Britain will be committed to close co-operation in FRONTEX and in everything that happens in patrolling the Mediterranean and Atlantic borders of the Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="06121823000013"></a>On enlargement, it is good to know that we are still on track with Turkey. The western Balkans, about which we had an interesting short debate the other week, must not be forgotten. It is important that we maintain progress on the western Balkans as some other EU member state Governments begin to get cold feet about those countries. I hope that the Government accept that, although we talk about the capacity to absorb new members, enlargement necessarily requires some further institutional change, because the idea that we shall end up with 30 commissioners and 30 representatives on many other institutions simply will not work. Therefore, I emphasise at least as  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1874"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1874</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>much to the Conservative Benches as to the Government that modest further institutional change is part of what we have to do in order to keep enlargement on track.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="06121823000014"></a>The communiqu&#233; spent most time on climate change and energy, Africa and migration. We on these Benches found it disappointingly vague on climate change and energy. It suggests, as the noble Lord, Lord Howell, also suggested, that there is some way to go before we have agreement on an effective strategy. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme has not worked well so far. The initial quotas were clearly too large in several other countries. The role of the EU is crucial in pushing forward the global climate change agenda and we will give the Government every support that they may wish for&#151;probably more than they desire in some ways&#151;in pushing this further.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="06121823000015"></a>We are slightly puzzled by the commitment that the spring European Council in future will have a report on progress and energy policy. The spring European Council agreed some years ago to pay particular attention to progress on achieving the Lisbon goals. Does this suggest that the Lisbon goals in effect have now been abandoned and that we shall instead discuss energy policy?</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="06121823000016"></a>Africa and migration go together. Much of what is said in the communiqu&#233; about Africa is to do with managing the roots of migration, stabilising African governance and encouraging African economic and social development so as to contain the intense pressures of migration. Again, we support that, although the implications for the future EU budget and the ESDP are far more radical than the Government have yet begun to explain to the public.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="06121823000017"></a>On a European institute of technology, again I assure the Government that we on these Benches support their deeply sceptical approach to this proposal. The idea has required a certain amount of momentum which does not seem to us to be a governmental priority.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="06121823000018"></a>On justice and home affairs, the Council talks about,</p>
<ul><a name="06121823000025"></a>&#147;options for strengthening the framework for decision making in order to respond effectively to the current challenges&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06121823000022"></a>In distinction from the Conservatives, we stress that in Britain&#146;s national interests some of those options involve some extension of qualified majority voting. There are areas in which Britain has advantages to gain from making sure that decisions can be taken effectively and quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="06121823000019"></a>A common European asylum system is the sort of thing that will frighten the <I>Daily Mail </I>every day of the week.

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="06121823000020"></a>The two last declarations are, first, on the Middle East peace process and, secondly, on Afghanistan. I am not entirely clear whether Her Majesty&#146;s Government are now working with the European Union initiative on the Middle East or with the US Administration. There is, after all, a widening gap between the approaches that the US Administration and the majority of EU Governments are now taking to the Middle East peace  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1875"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column 1875</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>process. The Government have been remarkably silent on the French, Spanish and Italian joint initiative on the Middle East. We have heard nothing from the Government about the EU monitoring role on the Rafah crossing point between Gaza and Egypt. We have also heard little about the funding implications for the EU and, therefore, for Britain of closer involvement in supporting the Palestinian Government. The declaration remarks:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="06121823000024"></a>&#147;The European Council calls for the release of Palestinian customs and tax revenues withheld by Israel&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06121823000023"></a>That is worth underlining. Israel has an association agreement with the European Union, and some of those revenues are collected on goods that come through to the EU. We have some real leverage in that respect.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="06121823000021"></a>Lastly, the Government claim to have a clear strategy on Europe. We are very glad to hear that. We would be even happier if the Government would explain it to the British public through the pages of the popular and Euro-sceptic press. The 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome is approaching and we understand that the 27 member Governments will issue a declaration on 25 March. At lunchtime today, I met the Italian Government&#146;s special representative for drafting that declaration. He tells me that all Governments have appointed such a special representative, and I would be interested to know who the British representative will be. I hope that between now and March Her Majesty&#146;s Government will share with us and the British public what they see as the priorities for the European Union that should be set out in such a declaration on the 50th anniversary.</p>

I shall do my best to answer some of them. If I miss anything out, no doubt a letter will wing its way to me. I had a personal briefing in the locker room of the gym this morning by the Minister for Europe. He had been at the Foreign Ministers Council earlier in the week. It was extremely helpful to me, I freely admit.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="06121838000002"></a>On the latter point made by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, I do not know whether I will have a name to give him before I sit down, but the Government have been committed to engaging with the public on the issue of Europe. I know it is not easy to increase awareness about the European Union and the fact that it continues to reform and deliver for its citizens. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, said that there had been little coverage in the press and, rightly, that you have to read the small print. That is a fair point, but I am not aware that anything is buried in this text. I do not think that is what he was suggesting, but you certainly have to read it a second time. There has not been a lot of coverage in the press.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="06121838000003"></a>I am grateful for what both noble Lords said about Turkey. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, asked me about the Greek Cypriots. That is a contentious issue, but we welcome the positive reaction from both sides to proposals put forward by the UN Under-Secretary-General in mid-November to implement the July agreement aimed at the resumption of substantive negotiations leading to a comprehensive and durable settlement. We support that route to a solution.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="06121838000004"></a>The noble Lord also mentioned Turkish public opinion turning away from the EU. However, from all that I have read, and as has been noted in this House, there have been remarkable changes in many areas in Turkey during the process of trying to join the European Union. I accept that there is still a long way to go, but there have been substantial changes in how society is organised and in the economy that have benefited the people of Turkey.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="06121838000005"></a>On the European Union constitution, I understand that the term is that we are in a &#147;reflective period&#148;. In answer to the noble Lord&#146;s substantive question, during the six months of the German presidency from 1 January, they will consult member states and report back to the Council at the end of that period. They will discuss with all 27 member states where we are with the constitution, and I cannot forecast what the result will be. It is not as though the matter was not discussed; it is generally accepted that the Germans will undertake that consultation. The Government&#146;s commitment to the referendum continues; there is no backtracking on that.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="06121838000006"></a>On energy correspondence, it may simply be a grand description and I do not wish to denigrate the people involved but it is a network of senior officials appointed to drive forward the project, so no new institution is created.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="06121838000007"></a>We welcome the ongoing evolution of thinking for a European institute of technology, which the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, asked about. But&#151;this is where the noble Lord was sceptical&#151;it is important that we get the design right so that it can contribute to Europe&#146;s innovation record. The view of the UK Government is that the European institute of technology must add value, be distinct from existing instruments and assist creating incentives for business research and academic involvement.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="06121838000008"></a>We do not need to apologise on climate change. The European Union has a role to give a lead and the UK will play a central role in ensuring that the EU continues to demonstrate our commitment to tackling the issues. I am not in a position to get down to whether America has cut its emissions to a greater or lesser extent. Obviously there have been substantial changes in America since Kyoto because some of the states of the United States have taken a more proactive green stance than ever was the case before; clearly that is the case in California. So there is a key role, and there is no doubt that we have a good record in emissions trading and our recent proposals. I understand that we are the only country whose programme satisfied Brussels. All the others were sent back to look at how they are going to operate. We need not be mealy-mouthed about that.</p>

<a name="61218-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="06121838000009"></a>The noble Lord said that the western Balkans were on track for enlargement. There were general discussions about enlargement. We want to push the principle of enlargement, not just in relation to Turkey, although that is a substantial part of the discussion. The UK remains committed to EU enlargement for the western Balkans. The only viable solution to the region&#146;s difficult past is a European one. We welcome the Commission&#146;s recent progress reports on the Balkans. They are a useful tool for the western Balkans to focus their efforts on the priorities for reform, so I hope that that is a positive response.</p>

We are committed to the road map. I cannot go beyond the statements published from the European Council and that which the Foreign Secretary made in the other place. I do not see why anyone should be upset or take a misleading view, as implied in the noble Lord&#146;s reference to the common asylum system. Most ordinary people would say that it was about time that we had a common asylum system so that one country was not played off against another, but that need not raise horror headlines. We are trying to get our house in order in a very difficult area of policy, where it has not been done before.</p>

What assurances or guarantees did the Government receive from the Government of Cyprus that, on the 27 chapters of the Turkish negotiation which are not frozen, negotiations can now go ahead unhindered and not be blocked by the Cypriots as they have been hitherto? If they did not receive any guarantees or assurances on that point I am not sure that it was worth a great deal.</p>

<a name="61218-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="06121838000012"></a>As I understand it, the eight chapters that have been frozen in the Turkish succession negotiations have been so as a consequence of the unwillingness of the Turkish Government to accept a set of proposals from the Finnish presidency on the implementation of the extension of the EU-Turkey customs union agreement to cover the new member states and on the freeing-up of trade between the north of Cyprus and the EU. What penalty is being imposed on the Government of Cyprus, who also rejected precisely those same proposals? If the answer is none, is not that an unfair and unjustified discrimination?</p>

Negotiations can move forward on 27 of the 35 chapters of the acquis. I have no caveat to that. I may not have the nuances right, but I make no qualification to that answer. I understand the sensitivity of the matter. I could read out further statements, but I do not think that it would be helpful to go beyond what I said to the noble Lord. Given the importance of the UN/Cyprus settlement process and the expert involvement of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, anything I might say outside my notes will cause confusion. But on the main point of the noble Lord&#146;s question, no member state has erected any barrier at the European Council to moving forward on the 27 unfrozen chapters.</p>

Can the noble Lord let us know what those initiatives are? If he cannot do so now, will he be good enough to write to me, putting a copy in your Lordships&#146; Library?</p>

<a name="61218-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="06121838000016"></a>I further put it to the noble Lord that Brussels is clearly up to its usual trick of quietly adopting new powers for itself, even if there is no clear legal base. When we come to the next intergovernmental conference, those new powers will be taken as read and incorporated into the treaties because they are already there. If we do not like it, we should have said so at the time. That is why I am asking the questions now. I would be grateful if the noble Lord could assure me that I am wrong and that any new powers have a clear legal base. To confirm his point, if that is what he is going to say, I ask him again to write to me with the initiatives which are currently going through based on Article 308.</p>

The noble Lord assumes that nobody should do anything, even though the existing treaty provisions allow for it. I am happy to give him the chapter and verse that he asked for, but the underlying assumption of his question cannot be valid. Many existing treaties are operating in the normal course of events. Nobody ever implied or inferred that that would not be the case. I reject what the noble Lord is implying because it is simply not the case.</p>

The background is the enormous pressure on the Canaries, where more than 26,000 illegal migrants arrived this year from west Africa. Tragically, thousands died en route either to the Canaries, Malta or Italy. We are told that the capacity of FRONTEX would rapidly be enhanced; we are told that there will be a centralised record of technical equipment, the creation of a European surveillance system and greater efficiency in co-operation on search

But what is proposed is, essentially, greater co-ordination by FRONTEX of the national coastguard systems.

I do not know the dates and I do not think that they have been set. It is accepted that there is a long way for the negotiations to go. Indeed, as I said, regarding the western Balkans, there is no evidence of a higher hurdle being put in front of those countries. Their aspirations and those of other countries to join the European Union are there and all of them know what the rules are&#151;they are not changing and they include the rule of law, democratic systems and other attributes of the European Union. It does mean a lot of change for some countries compared with the way that they have been operating their societies. If they think that the prize is worth it, they will make the changes. In the negotiations, each application will be dealt with on its merits, on a country-by-country basis.</p>

I very much welcome the communiqu&#233;&#146;s concentration on climate change and the fact that there will be a major strategic discussion next spring that will, I hope, lead to real action over the long term. However, we can sometimes be too pessimistic about the emissions trading system. First, a huge amount of carbon trading has taken place since the scheme was introduced and, although it has many flaws, the current system is a financial market that works and has an important operating base in the United Kingdom. We can already show that climate change management can start to work through market mechanisms. We should not underestimate its success so far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="06121838000024"></a>Having said that, the system is now entering a phase&#151;leading up to 2012&#151;that will decide its success. For the moment, much is needed to ensure that the system works effectively between now and 2012 in terms of allocations among industries and which industries are included. What practical conversations have there been between heads of Government in this key area to ensure that the 2008 to 2012 period for the emissions trading system works effectively, so that it can be one of the major global tools for climate control, given that one in five of the world&#146;s carbon emissions comes from the European Union? The amount is, admittedly, smaller than that of China, but we are still a major player globally.</p>

I agree with him that we should not be apologetic about starting the emission trading system. A price has already been put on the product. It is early days and there will be changes. I do not know whether it was discussed in more detail than I indicated in the Statement, but the fact is that we are working with the Commission to encourage a strengthening of the European emissions trading system.</p>

<a name="61218-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="06121824000003"></a>The EU heads agreed that climate change and energy should be considered together. The energy policy contains many of the levers that we want for a transition to a low carbon economy. Good progress has been made on climate change and energy security under the Finnish presidency. The German presidency will start in January. Germany has announced upfront that climate change will be a key feature of its presidency.</p>

<a name="61218-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="06121824000004"></a>We look forward to a spring European Council, which is likely to have a strong focus on climate change and energy issues. We will play a central role in ensuring that the EU continues to demonstrate its commitment to tackling these issues. We need to make some changes to policy; and to be ambitious and not mealy-mouthed about it. The emissions trading system will probably require some changes. But the fact is that once the Governments have set a price on the market, the market will perform. I hope that in future that can work as well as it does in other areas.</p>

<a name="06121824000005"></a><b><a name="61218-0009.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="06121824000029"></a>Lord Williamson of Horton:</b> My Lords, first, I welcome the non-reference in this Statement to any constitutional treaty. There is no need to bore the British public with that; it is, after all, the season to be merry.</p>

<a name="61218-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="06121824000006"></a>Secondly, I welcome very much the emphasis put on the strategic importance of enlargement, not just the individual issues in relation to one or another country. Overall, enlargement is a vital part of what is happening in the European Union. The more we stress it the better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="06121824000007"></a>Finally, I draw to the Minister&#146;s attention a point about migration. The Statement promises &#147;detailed action&#148; in 2007 on a number of important issues. It quite clearly says that that is what the EU is trying to do. This is an issue that the public is much concerned with. I invite the Minister to indicate to his colleagues the importance of respecting a promise which is put in here; otherwise, we will have a counterproductive effect.</p>

The noble Lord is absolutely right: migration is important. It is important for legislators, Government and opinion-formers to be upfront about this because that can prevent misleading tabloid headlines. That is the reality. If you do not discuss it and do not accept that it is an issue, then you are more likely to have the agenda led by the headlines in the press. They can sometimes be less than factually accurate&#151;I will put it in that way. The point is well made by the noble Lord, and I will ensure that my colleagues are made aware of it.</p>

<a name="61218-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="06121824000009"></a>I am grateful for the noble Lord&#146;s point about the strategic importance of enlargement. Obviously, there was a discussion about Turkey. Turkey did not form a

An agreement was made, as I indicated in the Statement. </p>

<a name="61218-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="06121824000010"></a>The noble Lord made a happy reference to the fact that good tidings were around because there was not a big discussion of the constitutional treaty, for reasons that I hope I have explained.</p>

<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="06121824000011"></a><b><a name="61218-0009.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="06121824000031"></a>Lord Stoddart of Swindon:</b> My Lords, I am afraid that I am going to break the consensus on the admission of Turkey. I believe that Turkey is not a European country. Indeed, by the time it is admitted its population will be 90 million, the largest population in the European Union and it will be dominant. I imagine that I am in a minority on that issue.</p>

<a name="61218-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="06121824000012"></a>What is meant by &#147;justice and home affairs&#148;? Does it mean that the Government are about to give up the veto on all matters relating to justice and home affairs? What is the latest situation on that?</p>

<a name="61218-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="06121824000013"></a>As regards asylum, there is a United Nations policy on that. How will any agreement by the European Union affect the United Nations policy? Perhaps the Minister could remind me whether the decisions will be taken by QMV or unanimity.</p>

<a name="61218-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="06121824000014"></a>Finally, I note this declaration at the end of paragraph 3:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="06121824000025"></a>&#147;The European Council reaffirms the importance of commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome in order to confirm the values of the European integration process&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06121824000023"></a>I had understood that Her Majesty&#146;s Government were in favour of the European Union being an organisation of nation states co-operating together, not a process of integration. That is bound to lead eventually to a European superstate, or a country called Europe. I really would like to know the Government&#146;s policy on that, and the Opposition&#146;s for that matter.</p>

<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="06121824000015"></a><b><a name="61218-0009.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="06121824000032"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> My Lords, to be honest the Government&#146;s policy is set out in the Statement. My noble friend Lord Stoddart&#151;for he is still my noble friend&#151;raises scepticism about Turkey, and he is of course entitled to his views. However, as I have made clear, Turkey is of strategic importance. It is a large state but it will not join the European Union for some years, as negotiations will take a while.</p>

<a name="61218-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="06121824000016"></a>As I indicated in answer to an earlier question, Turkey has made huge changes in recent years by abolishing the death penalty, by significantly reducing torture&#151;it should not be doing that anyway, but it is significantly reducing&#151;and by ensuring constitutional rights for women and improved cultural rights for minority groups. The EU accession process has been a catalyst for that reform, which has to be good, while Turkey has been an incredibly loyal and active member of NATO. Therefore, it does not quite fit to separate Turkey out as though it is some wayward state that has nothing to do with Europe.</p>

<a name="61218-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="06121824000017"></a>There is no proposal to give up the veto at the Justice and Home Affairs Council, and I have no real details so far as celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome is concerned. I understand that 2007 will be a year for celebrating several treaties&#151;whether separately or together, I do not know.</p>

Would that not open the way to much needed negotiations?</p>

I cannot remember the phrase now, but I will come to it; it was about accepting &#147;a legitimate Palestinian Government&#148;. I do not want to say that we would adopt one set of proposals, because of the nuances involved. Quite clearly, we want the road map for the Middle East to work, and to bring about peace. Indeed, that is why the Prime Minister was not making the Statement in the other place today, and why he is in the Middle East.</p>

<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="06121824000020"></a><b><a name="61218-0009.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="06121824000035"></a>Lord Grenfell:</b> My Lords, does the Minister agree that it is important to see what lessons the member state governments of the European Union have learnt from the 50th enlargement? I am pleased to see that, among the many lessons that there should have been, they have certainly learned one in saying that,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="06121824000026"></a>&#147;The Union will refrain from setting any target dates for accession until the negotiations are close to completion&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06121824000024"></a>Although we welcome Bulgaria and Romania coming in, it was not a terribly smart move to tell them that they would fail the exam in 2006 but were guaranteed to pass it in 2007. That is no way to give a country&#146;s government incentives to make necessary reforms on time.</p>

<a name="61218-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="06121824000021"></a>Would the Minister also agree that we need some assurance on whether one other lesson has been properly learnt? It is clearly great folly to bring into the European Union any state that has serious unresolved disputes with another non-member state. We do not want&#151;the European Union should not want and should never allow&#151;that kind of problem to be imported into the European Union. I hardly need mention what country that is. The lesson needs to be learnt because we must be extremely vigilant that in the case of Kosovo and Serbia that cannot happen again. Disputes need to be resolved before a country comes in. We made a mistake in the fifth enlargement in that one case.</p>

On the point about refraining from setting target dates, it has been made clear why that has been done. That is a lesson learnt. I am not sure that one could be as bold as to say that all disputes have to be completely settled before you are in. Sometimes, getting countries in may be a way to solve the dispute to people's satisfaction, but there remains a veto for existing member states on new member states joining. In some ways, that is partly an incentive to get such disputes solved. Solving disputes by talk around the table in the European Union is by far a better way than doing it with tanks and guns.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000010"></a>Although I was unable to speak at length on Second Reading, I mentioned that I was concerned about the expression &#147;territorial committee&#148;. In Part 1, we are dealing with something that will be called the National Consumer Council, and territorial committees apparently to be set up in Wales and Scotland. I will speak only to those amendments that are substantive and not consequential in this long group. The point of my amendments is to reassert the principle of devolution.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000011"></a>The new Scottish Consumer Council and Welsh Consumer Council&#151;the bodies that were&#151;are defined in the Bill as territorial committees of the new National Consumer Council. The Bill defines the remit of those committees as being: the,</p>
<ul><a name="06121813000105"></a>&#147;provision of advice and information&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="06121813000097"></a>to the new NCC about &#147;consumer matters&#148; affecting Scotland or Wales respectively;</p>
<ul><a name="06121813000106"></a>&#147;the provision of advice to the Council about the exercise of the Council&#146;s functions in so far as they affect&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="06121813000098"></a>Scotland or Wales respectively; and,</p>
<ul><a name="06121813000107"></a>&#147;such other purposes as the Council may determine&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06121813000099"></a>That is not in any measure satisfactory. At present, the Welsh Consumer Council and, as I understand it, the Scottish Consumer Council&#151;my noble friend may wish to speak on that matter&#151;respond directly to Welsh and Scottish Ministers. It seems an odd retreat of the Government from devolution that they now wish to make those bodies subservient to a National Consumer Council and only to offer advice.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000012"></a>The aim of Amendment No. 3 is to ensure that the core functions of the council&#151;representation, information and research&#151;are properly delegated to those bodies now called territorial committees,

Clause 1(4) allows but does not require the new NCC to delegate functions to the new territorial committees. However, that provides no safeguard for the future. The wording that I suggest is very simple. It is used in the Equality Act to describe the relationship between the UK Commission for Equality and Human Rights and its committees in Scotland and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="06121813000013"></a>Amendment No. 4 concerns the relationship between the National Consumer Council and its&#151;regrettably, I use the term again&#151;territorial committees. The point of the amendment is to ensure that, before the National Consumer Council exercises one of its functions in a way that may affect an area covered by a territorial committee, the matter must be discussed with the territorial committee in question. That seems absolutely essential. Again, the wording is taken from the Equality Act 2006, and I believe&#151;</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000026"></a>I move on to Amendment No. 13A, which is the substantive amendment in my name. The wording again tracks that of the Equality Act, and the aim of the amendment is to ensure that the functions of the new National Consumer Council are delegated to the territorial committees in respect of council activity in the areas that they cover. That seems to me to be a perfectly simple matter, but at the moment it is not in the Bill.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000027"></a>If the Committee will allow me and because I do not wish to try its patience, I shall move on quickly to Amendment No. 13B on funding. The Bill is silent on the proportion of funding that will flow to the new territorial committees in Scotland and in Wales. It gives no safeguard for the future and, in theory, it could mean that the new territorial committees could be starved of funding and thus unable to deliver their remit. The amendment would ensure that Scottish and Welsh consumers received a secure, sustainable and sufficient flow of funding to enable them to work effectively in their own territorial areas.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000028"></a>Amendment No. 36 addresses the question of who reports to whom. It would ensure that the Scottish territorial committee, whatever it is to be called, reports to the Scottish Parliament and that the Welsh territorial committee, whatever it may be called, responds to the National Assembly for Wales. That is really very simple, but Clause 4(7) requires the new National Consumer Council, rather than any new Scottish Consumer Council territorial committee, to send a copy of its forward work programme to Scottish and Welsh Ministers respectively. This provision represents a step back not just from devolution, but from what we have at the moment. The Scottish Consumer Council and Welsh Consumer Council produce their own forward work programmes and deal directly with Scottish and Welsh Ministers respectively. I understand that Clause 1(4)(c) allows the new NCC to delegate other functions to Scotland and Wales, but that is not a requirement and there is no safeguard.</p>

<p><a name="06121813000029"></a>I shall speak to one more amendment, Amendment No. 37&#151;I am sorry to try the patience of the Committee&#151;which would ensure that the Scottish and Welsh committees were required to produce for each financial year their own annual reports on the progress of the project described in their respective forward work programmes for that year, to do so separately from the formal annual report produced by the National Consumer Council, and to send a copy of that report to Scottish and Welsh Ministers respectively. Clause 6(3) requires the new NCC, rather than the new Scottish or Welsh councils or territorial committees, to send a copy of its annual report to Scottish and Welsh Ministers. I would like the Committee to pause on that thought for a moment and, again, to think about the nature of devolution. If something is to do with devolution, people operating in Wales should respond to Welsh Ministers directly on it, and people operating in Scotland, as I am sure my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill will say, should operate and report directly to Scottish Ministers on it. That is devolution.</p>

<p><a name="06121813000030"></a>I apologise for taking too much of the Committee&#146;s time and for being inaudible at the outset, but these amendments are important. They go to the heart of devolution. I hope that the Minister will indicate that the Government are not resiling on devolution and that we can change the Bill accordingly. I beg to move.</p>

While the amendments do not put it quite in that fashion, we have to take account of the rather narrow view of the nature of devolved responsibility that is being presented by the Government.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000033"></a>In many respects, what we see, as my noble friend Lord Williams has just pointed out, is a number of options opening up, but the soft option is always the one that is being accepted; that is, that the National Consumer Council will eventually, in its wisdom, be able to do certain things. That is very much the product of the metrocentrism of Victoria Street. We have the DTI muddling on, not actually appreciating that we have had a devolution settlement in the United Kingdom since 1999, when the Parliament and the Assembly were established, or indeed since the referenda of 1997. I stress that they are now part of the British political firmament; they are mature institutions. I have to say as a Scot that I am a wee bit less than satisfied with certain aspects of the performance of my colleagues in Holyrood, but I will be working very hard when it comes to the elections in May, and before that, to ensure that many of my Labour Party colleagues are able to form the majority of the Scottish Government.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000034"></a>The point I really want to get across is that we have in the United Kingdom, and we have always had&#151;this was one of the arguments for devolution&#151;a number of institutions that were quasi-Scottish, quasi-Welsh and quasi-Northern Irish, but they were answerable at the end of the day to no one. We would like to see a new balance being struck which takes account of the integrity of the Parliaments and the capacity of the Parliament and the Assembly to pass legislation that will impinge on and affect the working of the National Consumer Council, because the character will be Scottish and Welsh. It seems sensible to give the Scottish and Welsh representative bodies the opportunity to establish accountability with the Westminster Parliament and the National Consumer Council.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000035"></a>I do not wish to detain the Committee at length, because my noble friend has gone through this in some detail. We are trying to establish that the National Consumer Council has to have UK responsibility. Equally, it does not have to&#151;grudgingly or otherwise, and I do not think it would be grudgingly&#151;grant powers to Scotland and Wales. They are entitled to have them under the devolution settlement. Indeed, it is appropriate that they have them because in certain areas Wales, and probably to a greater degree Scotland, will have the opportunity through the Scottish Parliament  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC143"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column GC143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and the Welsh Assembly to pass legislation on the consumer councils of the two. I do not like the expression &#147;territorial committees&#148;. I would be quite happy, as I said at Second Reading, to have Yorkshire, north-east and north-west committees established as and when appropriate. At the moment, I do not think it is particularly appropriate to designate committees or councils that will be operating within the purview of devolved Administrations as simple territorial committees. It is important that we grant them their due status.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000036"></a>Secondly, it is important that they are properly funded and that this funding is appropriately ring-fenced. It will doubtless be the product of arm-wrestling between the comparative Administrations. Equally, however, there have to be areas in which it is appropriate to look at the UK as a whole. Therefore, it is appropriate that the National Consumer Council should be required to investigate on a United Kingdom basis issues that are appropriate to the United Kingdom, but have arisen from a regional or national concern. We have to establish in statute the responsibility of the National Consumer Council to follow up issues raised by the Welsh or Scottish councils.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000037"></a>It is equally important that appropriate reports are timeously presented because often people can dig deep, look hard and forget. We want accountability and want reports to be published. We must also ensure that we have appropriate funding for these committees. Therefore, it ought to be established in statute that there is no get-out clause. We are not legislating for Government A or Government B or in perpetuity, but it is important that when we talk about functions and capabilities, we also talk about resource. It may well be that it is the responsibility of the National Consumer Council to appoint appropriate people to sit on these committees, but after the committees are established in that way, they are entitled to have appropriate funding, subject to public scrutiny, whether by the Scottish and Welsh bodies or the Public Accounts Committee.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000038"></a>This group of amendments covers most of the appropriate areas. At this stage, the Government may not be inclined to accept them. I am a new boy in this House, but I am sufficiently realistic to know never to push matters too hard because that would deny us the opportunity of coming back to them at a later stage. There is always more rejoicing in heaven over a sinner that repenteth, and I would like to think that the Government will look afresh at this.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000039"></a>In discussions with the Minister and his officials, I got the impression that there is a lack of appreciation of, but not necessarily hostility to, the nature of the devolution settlement. There are Parliaments of the United Kingdom in Scotland and London and there is an Assembly in Wales. There are bodies with differing responsibilities that touch the lives of people who live in those places. They should be given appropriate consideration. At the moment, the DTI, in sponsoring this legislation, is guilty&#151;I use that word without too much consideration&#151;of a kind of metrocentrist insensitivity and believes that what operates in the interests of Victoria Street operates for the interests of the whole UK. That is not appropriate. We must recognise that we have moved on from that. I would

Were we to get that, that Assembly would sit alongside the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament and have appropriate rights and responsibilities. The Government have taken their eye off the ball. I am disappointed that a Secretary of State who is a Scot who played such a distinguished part in the campaign for the establishment of the Scottish Parliament allowed his department to have made a faux pas of this nature. As I say, we could change it.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000040"></a>These may not be the best amendments, but, let us face it, the good should not be the enemy of the best. If it does not disagree and accepts the force of our argument, it is up to the department at a later stage to table amendments that can do this job. At the moment, there is a big gap which will cause a lot of difficulty for a lot of people, not least those candidates who, in May, will stand in elections in Wales and Scotland on behalf of the party that the Minister, my noble friend Lord Williams and I are proud to be members of.</p>

<ul><a name="06121813000108"></a>&#147;the Committee must take it into account&#148;,</ul>

<p><a name="06121813000101"></a>No doubt, that has been spotted already.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000042"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, has opened the batting on this discussion with an energetic set of amendments. The noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill of Clackmannan, has given us a long and, perhaps I may say, a passionate intervention for this stage. I was interested to hear what they said&#151;in particular, the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel. While I do not agree with the majority of his amendments, they highlight, as I hope does my Amendment No. 5, the lack of clarity in the Bill on the proposed functions of the regional committees of the National Consumer Council. The noble Lord&#146;s earlier amendments would effectively split up the NCC into three bodies&#151;one each for England, Scotland and Wales. I shall be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s views on such a move. We on these Benches could not endorse such a move. While independence is a vital ingredient of the NCC, the interests of consumers must be addressed as holistically as possible. I believe that the NCC stands stronger united, especially given the vast volume of the new responsibilities it will be expected to undertake.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000043"></a>Amendment No. 5 seeks to clarify the Government&#146;s vision for the role of the committee. The amendment would ensure that when a territorial committee was established and made representations to the new National Consumer Council, the NCC would have to take those representations into account. I do not wish to railroad the NCC&#146;s research processes, yet I am concerned that under Clause 1(4)(c) the NCC has the power to delegate its functions to the Scottish and Welsh consumer councils, but there is no reciprocal function. If functions are to be delegated, it is in the interests of the consumer and the execution of thorough research into consumer

From the outset, I must make it clear that I believe strongly in the continued independence of the National Consumer Council. I cannot emphasise enough how important it is to get this merger right. We will do everything that we can from this side to assist the Government in doing that.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000044"></a>I shall speak later to amendments that I have tabled on cost and the extent to which the Secretary of State can influence the running and functions of the NCC, which are related matters. But it is so important to get the internal structure right. It is vital to retain the adaptability of the NCC to address the rapidly changing demands of our consumer world. My fear is that new powers to delegate functions to the regional committees could result in a one-way system. Previously, functions have been delegated, but on a project-by-project basis. It is important not to over-plan for the NCC. As the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, rightly illustrated at Second Reading, there is a healthy relationship between the regional branches of the NCC and the central base.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000045"></a>I am concerned that the independence of the NCC will be threatened by the new funding arrangements in which the Secretary of State will be recouping the costs of the NCC through regulation, according to paragraph 26 of the Explanatory Notes. I hope that the Minister will reassure me that the funding arrangement will not tie the NCC to the wishes of industry, nor to the wishes of government. I should also be interested to know how closely related the funding of the NCC will be to its functions. It is important to have separation in order to maintain the NCC&#146;s invaluable impartiality. In the light of these concerns, I would be grateful if the Minister could inform Members of the Committee how he envisages the relationship between the NCC and the regional committees will develop under the provision in this Bill.</p>

I am less fussed than my noble friends Lord Williams of Elvel and Lord O&#146;Neill of Clackmannan about the phrase &#147;territorial committees&#148;. I can see that, if those words stood by themselves, they might appear somewhat insulting, particularly in the light of the devolution achievements of the earlier years of the present Government. But in Clause 1 the phrase is clearly linked and associated with, and defined as, the Welsh Consumer Council and the Scottish Consumer Council. Surely no one can feel insulted by those terms. That is what &#147;territorial committees&#148; means according to Clause 1, and so I am not worried about that.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000047"></a>On the substantive argument of my noble friend Lord Williams of Elvel, in line with the devolution aspects of our constitution I fully agree that there should be a taken-for-granted delegation by the National Consumer Council where the matters at issue involve either Scotland or Wales. What functions is my noble friend Lord Williams talking about? He is talking about the core functions as set out in Clauses 7, 8 and 9, which we shall discuss more fully later.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000048"></a>My only quarrel with my noble friend is that his Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 refer to those functions as &#147;decision-making&#148; ones. As I see it, the function of advising Ministers and proposing policies to them, and certainly the function of research and so on, which the National Consumer Council is given under those clauses as core functions, are only decision-making in the very narrow sense that they are decisions on the policy of the National Consumer Council. However, they are not decision-making so far as concerns the populace because the NCC does not have any executive functions at all.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000049"></a>I am sorry if my noble friend regards this as pernickety. However, while I think that Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are inappropriate and unnecessary, I agree with the substance of his amendments in this grouping&#151;I shall not list them all&#151;for the reasons that both he and my other noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill enunciated.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000051"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Elvel, raised some very important points on devolution. As the noble Lord, Lord O&#146;Neill, correctly said, the decision on whether the amendments in this group are necessary depends to some extent on the small words &#147;may&#148; and &#147;shall&#148;, which we will debate later.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000052"></a>Without doubt, the principles of devolution are extremely important, as are the practicalities. In the Bill, the Government are considering making changes to the Consumer Council for Water, for example. As my noble friend Lord Livsey of Talgarth has often reminded the House, the situation in Wales with regard to water is very different because the water body is effectively a mutual company and the advocacy required there will be very different from that required in England. Indeed, we have not yet debated the difference between advice and advocacy. As we go through the Bill, it will become apparent exactly where these amendments will need to focus. What representation have the Minister and his department had from the Welsh Assembly and Scottish Parliament about this? Do they feel that this situation is entirely satisfactory?</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000053"></a>The point will no doubt be brought up again as we debate the rest of the Bill that, with regard to something like energy, Scotland, for instance, may face immensely different pressures from England with regard to consumers. That is in the very nature of the energy market.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000054"></a>Some very important points have been raised and it is likely that at the next stage we shall need to see something from the Government Benches or elsewhere that will take the matter forward.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, mentioned Welsh Water, but I did not think that the Welsh and Scottish territorial committees would be involved in that issue. That leads us on to other points, which I shall bring up when we discuss water.</p>

<p><a name="06121813000056"></a><b><a name="61218-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="06121813000133"></a>Lord Whitty:</b> As on Second Reading, I declare a direct interest as chair of the current National Consumer Council. I shall say something about how the present arrangements operate and how we want to preserve them as far as possible in the expanding National Consumer Council. To that extent, I agree with what my noble friend Lord Williams said about strengthening the devolution provisions of the Bill. I ask Ministers to consider the wording of the Bill, perhaps, rather than to accept all the amendments.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000057"></a>My noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill implied that sometimes the DTI does not &#147;do&#148; devolution. That is because, by and large, most DTI functions, including the consumer function, are not devolved. Therefore, there are issues on which the National Consumer Council gives a GB, UK or even an EU position when it is clear that the territorial committees&#151;or however we find the best way in which to describe them&#151;give advice to the National Consumer Council. So Wales and Scotland, with regard to GB, UK or EU legislation, would give advice and information, as provided under Clause 1.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000058"></a>The two consumer councils also deal with an awful lot of devolved powers, including the whole of the public services, which are almost wholly devolved in Scotland and to a large extent in Wales, and with Scottish law, which is an entirely separate system. Some markets, as the noble Baronesses, Lady O&#146;Cathain and Lady Miller, said, are very different in Scotland and Wales from those in England. So there are areas in which the competence of the Scottish and Welsh councils is the most important issue. It is not simply an issue of advice and information to the national council; it is a matter of those councils having the responsibility for dealing with devolved issues, or issues that are primarily an issue for Scotland or Wales.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000059"></a>I do not know what precise form of words would be best, although my noble friend Lord Williams has made a good fist of it in his amendment. But the Government and the Minister need to accept that there is a problem here with referring simply to &#147;advice and information&#148; to the national council, because it is more than that. Much of the Scottish council&#146;s resources come from the Scottish Executive, because its task involves investigations and research into the Scottish public services and professions. The present form of words does not fully reflect that, so I ask the Minister to accept some of the arguments and to come back later with a form of words that reflects even more strongly the current devolutionary settlement within the pre-devolutionary structure of the NCC and take a way forward that recognises the constitutional position on devolved responsibilities as compared to reserved policy areas.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000060"></a>The General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland is by and large responsible for its own area and I would not wish to interfere with that. The only

Territorial committees can be a mirror image if the council decides to delegate all its functions. We are leaving it to the council to decide those matters, together with the territorial committees. Scottish Water was not included in the Bill, although it may be considered to be included some time in future. The Bill provides that the consumer body for water in England and Wales will be consulted on from 2008.</p>

<p><a name="06121813000070"></a>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 establish the Scottish and Welsh consumer councils as decision-making bodies. They prejudge the nature of the functions that the Bill allows the council to delegate to the Scottish and Welsh consumer councils.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000071"></a>Amendment No. 3 removes the power of the new National Consumer Council to add to the power of the territorial committees and establishes that the core functions of the council must be delegated to them. Amendment No. 13A requires the council to delegate core functions to territorial committees and removes its ability to exercise core functions in the areas for which the territorial committees are established. The effect would be to make the Scottish and Welsh consumer councils function separately and independently of the council, at least in the exercise of functions, and prevent the council taking action on a cross-territorial basis, which is the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, and my noble friend Lord Borrie. That would represent a serious retrograde step and would compromise the power of the council to speak for consumers generally as the situation demanded on a cross-territorial basis.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000072"></a>I believe that it is important that the new arrangements should promote a clear expression of consumer views and needs. That is best achieved by providing for the new body to take its own decisions on how best to balance the achievement of a clear voice for consumers with the need to take account of differences or of particular conditions that might prevail in Scotland or Wales. There is also a need to provide for flexibility to meet future developments. None of those objectives is best served by providing for three essentially independent consumer organisations.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000073"></a>Amendment No. 4 obliges the council to consult the territorial committees before exercising one of its functions if it considered that persons within the territorial committee&#146;s area would be affected. That could prove to be an onerous provision, which would stifle the council in the exercise of its functions.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000074"></a>Amendment No. 5 provides that the council must take into account advice and information provided by a territorial committee. No provision is made in the Bill about the extent to which the council should take into account advice or information from territorial committees. However, given that the Bill establishes that the territorial committees have a statutory duty to provide that advice and information, it is unnecessary to make further provision about how the council should take it into account. I suggest that a duty to take something into account, no matter how strongly expressed, will not in itself make a significant difference.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000075"></a>Amendment No. 13B requires the council to ensure that the territorial committees receive a sufficient share of resources to enable them to exercise their functions. A number of noble Lords raised the issue of funding, so I shall go into a little more detail. Separate committees, comprising a chair and members, will be appointed to the Scottish and Welsh councils by the Secretary of State, and questions of funding should be left to negotiation between the council and the territorial committees. The proposed

Funding from industry for the new NCC will be in line with the costs of the council in undertaking functions in those sectors. The overall budget of the new council will be agreed between the DTI and the new body as the budgets of Energywatch, Postwatch and the NCC are now. A question was asked about the funding of the Welsh and Scottish consumer councils. It comes from the National Consumer Council, and the Welsh and Scottish councils have no separate existence. Funding is agreed between the DTI and the NCC. All the main budget comes from the DTI.</p>

<p><a name="06121813000076"></a>Amendments Nos. 20, 22, 25, 27, 28, 32, 33 and 34 all amend the provisions relating to the preparation of forward work programmes by the council by providing for separate forward work programmes to be prepared by each of the territorial committees. The Bill is silent on forward work programmes and territorial committees, but it is open to the council and the new territorial committees to arrange how they go about the preparation of the forward work programme required of the council. It is a matter for the council.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000077"></a>Amendments Nos. 35 and 36 remove the requirement for the council to send notice of its forward work programme to the Scottish and Welsh Ministers and insert a requirement for the territorial committees to consult separately, and with their appropriate devolved administrations, over individual forward work programmes. It is open to the council to devise with its territorial committees how best to consult on the activities and functions set out in its forward work programme. The amendment is unduly prescriptive.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000078"></a>Amendment No. 37 requires each of the territorial committees to prepare an individual annual report in relation to their individual forward work programmes and to submit these reports to Scottish Ministers or Welsh Ministers, as appropriate. It is for the council to decide what to include in its annual report and how to publish information relating to the activities of territorial committees. For the reasons that I have given, I must resist all these amendments.</p>

I am grateful to my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill for expressing the Scottish problem, as I expressed the Welsh one. I understand why the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, is opposed to this; the Conservatives have very little representation in Wales and even less representation in Scotland, so they have always been opposed to devolution. But the serious point is that the devolution settlement is here to stay, whoever forms whatever Government. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, was constructive on the point. She recognised the issues and I hope that her party will support something along these lines as we move forward to the next stage. My noble friend Lord Borrie criticised some of my wording, quite understandably. I would never pretend that the wording of amendments I produce in Committee is perfect and beyond criticism.</p>

I ask him to do this Committee one favour and to speak to my noble friend Lord Whitty, who made a powerful intervention on the right lines and who will be responsible in time for some of these issues.

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000090"></a>The noble Baroness said: This fearsomely long group of amendments explores a single point of principle. For what new purpose will the NCC exist? The Bill does not spell out the principle of the NCC&#146;s primary duty. What &#147;shall&#148; it do and what &#147;may&#148; it do? Nothing in the Bill promotes, campaigns for or protects the interests of consumers through advocacy. I could have proposed an amendment to fill that gap. Instead, I chose to take what the Government have tabled and explore the effect of changing the word &#147;may&#148; to &#147;shall&#148;. At this stage, it is important to examine exactly what the Government think the Bill should achieve. The consumer&#146;s voice needs to be strengthened for a number of reasons, partly because of the enormous changes that are taking place in areas that we shall be discussing, be it mail and post offices, energy or water. Those are all going through some fundamental changes, and I am sure that we will come to them in later clauses.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000091"></a>Without establishing exactly what the NCC&#146;s duties are to be, it is very difficult to be certain that the Bill is taking the right approach. It is not good enough for the DTI simply to bring forward a Bill and say, &#147;Yes, we&#146;ve streamlined; we&#146;ve got rid of some red tape. We&#146;ve done our bit in streamlining&#148;. We intend to ensure that that does not happen.</p>

<p><a name="06121813000092"></a>Perhaps the Minister can help me on one point. The word &#147;may&#148; appears in a large number of clauses. I shall run through some of them without, I hope, wearying the Committee. For example, my Amendment No. 8 concerns a provision in the Bill that states that staff appointments &#147;may&#148; be made to the NCC; Amendments Nos. 9 to 12 concern the NCC&#146;s regional committees, which we have just discussed; Amendment No. 13 would ensure that the council &#147;shall&#148; regulate its own procedure; and Amendment No. 44 would strengthen the council&#146;s representative function to ensure that it provides advice, makes proposals and represents. I recommend most strongly the use of the word &#147;shall&#148; in Amendments Nos. 44, 72 and 73, so that the council really &#147;shall&#148; have the representative function and &#147;shall&#148; be concerned with issuing advice, information and guidance in improving standards and promoting the interests of consumers. Surely those functions should not be optional, and I cannot understand why the draftsmen have used the word &#147;may&#148; in those instances. At the very minimum, it should be changed to &#147;shall&#148;.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000093"></a>Amendments Nos. 77, 78, 82 and 84 concern co-operation, giving assistance and voluntary activities, and perhaps those are areas where it would be appropriate to use the word &#147;may&#148;. However, it is incumbent on the Government to establish why they have chosen not to be specific about what the NCC &#147;shall&#148; and &#147;may&#148; do. If they do not set out the principle behind this body at the heart of the Bill, they then have to spell out very precisely what its duties are and what it may consider doing voluntarily. The two little words &#147;may&#148; and &#147;shall&#148; are incredibly important. We cannot get this wrong at this stage. Depending on the Minister&#146;s reply, the Committee may feel that it is appropriate to introduce a principle but, if we fail to draft the Bill more tightly, we shall have failed indeed.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000094"></a>I do not propose to go through the effect of each of the amendments, as that would take a substantial amount of time. I hope that the examples that I have given are sufficiently illustrative for Members of the Committee to take on board my point. I am sure that that is so but, if the Committee would like me to explain any of them further, I shall be pleased to do so. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="06121813000095"></a><b><a name="61218-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="06121813000143"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> Certainly, the case has been made for looking at a number of the amendments that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, has spoken about. It seems to me absurd that the National Consumer Council merely &#147;may&#148; appoint staff. The idea that it will not have any staff at all strikes me&#151;and, I hope, my noble friend Lord Whitty&#151;as somewhat extraordinary. Similarly, in relation to its core functions, the idea that the council &#147;may&#148; choose whether to represent the consumer seems to me extremely odd.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="06121813000096"></a>However, I disagree with the noble Baroness on just one point&#151;that is, in connection with Amendments Nos. 9 to 12 concerning regional committees. There, I think that the word should be &#147;may&#148;. The National Consumer Council may find it useful to appoint regional committees and there may be some justification for having a committee in one or two parts of the county

Its website states that it represents,</p>
<ul><a name="06121829000074"></a>&#147;the interests of the disabled or chronically sick, pensioners, people on low incomes and those who live in rural areas&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06121829000070"></a>It takes up all manner of problems, from incorrect advice given at post offices to lost letters. It gets involved in local issues such as the closure of post offices or problems with delivery rounds. Its research is impressive: no matter is too small for its scrutiny. For example, it conducted surveys on collection tabs on postboxes on three separate occasions. Staff and members visited hundreds of postboxes, each time reporting to Royal Mail whether there was a collection tab at all and whether the information on it was accurate. The result is a much better service for the consumer than would otherwise have been the case. Other surveys include the testing of the accuracy of advice around the UK on posting three different items; needless to say, the advice varied, which they were able to point out.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000002"></a>Can we be sure that the new NCC will undertake this basic, unglamorous research, which is so important for those who use the postal services from their homes and rely on them to a huge extent? These are often people who do not own a computer and cannot access websites or send attachments with e-mails. How can we be confident that this research will be continued?</p>

My noble friend Lord Borrie, who has a great deal of knowledge in this area, referred to this point, too&#151;I am grateful for his contribution.</p>

<p><a name="06121829000004"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, queried the phrase &#147;may ... appoint staff&#148;. My noble friend Lord Borrie referred to it as well. On the face of it, it could be questionable, since any organisation will require staff. &#147;May&#148; is used because this is a power which the council may exercise from time to time. It is not obliged to have any particular number of staff&#151;that was the intention of the drafting. The council will of course require staff, but the Bill is drafted in such a way as not to be prescriptive, to retain maximum flexibility for the council.</p>

We are dealing with legislation which will probably exist for some time, so we want to get it right first time. Would it not be better for it to be tightly worded, rather than loosely&#151;or perhaps, as those on the Conservative Benches would say, &#147;sloppily&#148;&#151;worded, as it seems to be now?</p>

<p><a name="06121829000017"></a><b><a name="61218-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="06121829000092"></a>Lord Truscott:</b> I do not agree that it is sloppily worded. Perhaps I may comment on the amendments before us and deal with some of the issues which have been raised. If one was too prescriptive and established fixed staff numbers or objectives, one would not give any flexibility to the council to deal with changing circumstances or consumer patterns and other issues that may arise as the council evolves. That is the intention behind the Bill.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000018"></a>Amendments Nos. 44, 45 and 49 would remove the flexibility of the council to concentrate on those functions and activities that it considers would be most effective and beneficial to consumers, given its priorities in the coming year. Clause 4 already places a duty on the council to produce a forward work programme, which will set out the proposed activities of the council over the coming year and must be published and consulted on. It will ensure that the council&#146;s intended use of its core functions will be made public, and that parties are able to make representations about those intentions.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000019"></a>Amendment No. 50 would require the council to investigate complaints made by consumers that appear to it to raise issues of general relevance, or any matter that appears to be related to a problem that affects consumers generally or consumers of a particular description. This is an important power for the council. However, the amendment would remove the discretion of the council to prioritise the cases that it investigates. Where there is a range of issues that could command its attention, the council needs to be able to set its own priorities according to its resources and its forward work programme. That was my earlier point: the council must have the ability to set its own priorities, to work according to the resources that it has and to devise its own forward work programme. We should not be too prescriptive.</p>

<p><a name="06121829000020"></a>Amendments Nos. 67 and 68 relate to Clause 16, which concerns the council&#146;s function to prepare and publish reports in relation to any matters that fall within its scope. These amendments would place a duty on the council to carry out this function. Amendments Nos. 72 and 73 to Clause 18, which covers the &#147;advice, information and guidance&#148; function, would place a duty on the council to issue and publish advice or guidance, and to prepare and publish reports that are along similar lines to those to which I referred earlier in Clause 16. Amendments Nos. 77 to 81 and Amendment No. 86 are along similar lines, as they all replace a power with a duty. These amendments would limit the discretion of the council in carrying out its functions and oblige it to observe these duties. This may not be an appropriate use of its resources in all circumstances.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000021"></a>Amendments Nos. 82 and 84 would have no effect. I must resist them as no material differences result from them. Amendment No. 85 would require the Secretary of State to publish reasons for any approval of the acquisition of an interest in a body corporate. These steps are unnecessary and I do not accept the amendment.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000022"></a>Amendment No. 87 would in effect place a duty on the council to require a person specified in Clause 23(3) to supply it with information. These persons are the Office of Fair Trading, the designated regulators, a person who supplies goods or services in the course of a business carried on by that person, and any other person specified or of a description specified by the Secretary of State. However, in the course of any period, it may not be appropriate for the council to request information from one of the people specified in subsection (3). The current drafting retains flexibility for the council to request information that it requires to carry out its statutory functions from a person specified in subsection (3). I am not therefore convinced that a duty is required in this instance.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000023"></a>Amendment No. 90 would place a duty on the council to publish any notice received from the OFT or a designated regulator setting out their reasons for refusing to supply information to the council. I envisage that the council will generally prefer to publish any notice received to allow public scrutiny of a person&#146;s refusal to supply the council with the information that it requires to carry out its statutory functions. However, the amendment would remove the flexibility of allowing the council to use its discretion if it considered that it was not in the public interest to publish the notice.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000024"></a>Amendment No. 93 would place a duty on the council to apply to the court for a compliance order if a non-regulated supplier refused to provide the council with information. Again, this would remove the council&#146;s discretion to determine whether such action was proportionate, given the content and extent of the information requested and the cost of applying to the court.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>

I have included some &#147;shalls&#148; here where I would have put &#147;mays&#148;, and the Minister has replied to a few of those, but, on the whole, I am enormously disappointed by his reply. A public body is being established with public money and with clear duties to the public, and I believe that those duties should be spelt out in the Bill.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000028"></a>I have missed enormously the expertise from the Conservative Front Bench&#151;in particular, that of the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, who I am sure has strong views on this matter. I hope that between now and Report she will give us the benefit of her thoughts. The Minister said that it is necessary to be flexible&#151;for example, with regard to whether the council appoints staff. But, as the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, pointed out&#151;I am grateful to her for her comments&#151;that is clearly ridiculous. The council can be flexible about numbers, with any number between one and 1,000, but surely it cannot be flexible about whether it appoints any staff at all.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000029"></a>In his reply, the Minister failed to spell out the difference between what it is essential that the council does, what it is desirable that it does and what it may do if it has the capacity after doing the essential and the desirable. I am very disappointed that the Minister and his department have not been able to define the difference between &#147;essential&#148;, &#147;desirable&#148; and &#147;possible&#148;. Whatever words they choose, and whether it is the difference between &#147;may&#148;, &#147;must&#148; or &#147;shall&#148;, by Report we shall table amendments specifically along these lines. I am disappointed with the Minister&#146;s reply but I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="06121829000033"></a>The noble Baroness said: Again, this is a very large group of amendments, which I hope will give the Committee the opportunity to discuss the principle behind the Bill. After the last debate, that is even more important.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000034"></a>Our main concern with the Bill is that it brings energy and postal consumer services under one body. Unless that body has sufficient teeth, the Bill will simply have the effect of muzzling what is currently a very effective voice in championing specific concerns. In saying that, I do not at all denigrate the existing NCC, but the expertise that bodies such as Postwatch and Energywatch currently have will almost certainly be lost to some degree when they come under the NCC. The amendments would prevent this merger taking place until we receive some assurances about how the new regime will affect consumers.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000035"></a>It is important to state that we are not against the continued existence of the National Consumer Council, which does an important and worthwhile job. However, our amendments would prevent an increase in its power and scope, because the current regime serves the interests of consumers well and the DTI has not proved the case for altering it.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000036"></a>Amendments Nos. 14, 96, 97, 98 and 99 and the Question that Schedule 2 stand part of the Bill would delete attempts to amend and annul previous Acts concerning energy and postal consumer services. The Question that Clause 3 stand part of the Bill, along with Amendments Nos. 23, 24, 29, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 61, 62 and 63, relate to the term &#147;designated consumer&#148;. We wish to delete all references to the &#147;designated consumer&#148;, because that is the way in which the Government have chosen to describe those people who will be covered by the Bill and who then have to move to the new regime.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000037"></a>Amendment No. 31 concerns estimates of expenditure under the formal work programme in relation to gas, post and designated consumers, as do Amendments Nos. 23, 24 and 29. The Question that Clause 12 stand part of the Bill relates to energy disconnections. I shall reserve specific comments on that matter until we reach Amendment No. 53, because it deserves its own debate. However, the issue should be referred to under this group of amendments to enable Members of the Committee who want to discuss the impact of these provisions as a whole to do so. The Questions that Clauses 13, 14 and 15 stand part of the Bill will give rise to important debate when we come to them.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000038"></a>The later amendments in the group also deal with the term &#147;designated consumer&#148;. Will enforcement by the regulator substantially change the current regime? Even with the aid of the Explanatory Notes, I was not clear about what the Bill did in that regard. It is important to understand it. The amendments probe exactly what it is that the DTI is seeking to achieve in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="06121829000039"></a><b><a name="61218-gc0003.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="06121829000095"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> I was under the impression that we spent some time about two weeks ago discussing much of what is included in these amendments and the purpose of the Bill. My understanding was that the purpose, certainly in respect of the amalgamation of Postwatch and Energywatch, and the establishment of the various institutions under the umbrella of the National Consumer Council, is to integrate the functions and create a smoother and more easily accessible form of consumer access. Concerns were then expressed, but, having accepted that principle, albeit because we do not divide on Second Reading in this House, we do not need to go round the track again.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000040"></a>If there is a defect in this Bill it is that it does not go far enough. We should take into account the fact that Ofcom, the transport consumer councils and other bodies are not included. They should be included, because if we are arguing for a central focal point for consumer concerns, it would be better to have a single number and a single place to call. Anyone who uses call centres these days knows only too well that the  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC159"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column GC159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>first number is only the first of many that you have to deal with, and you are then offered a choice of X, Y and Z. So if we had a straightforward 0800 number&#151;although I know that the Minister is not in a position to offer that&#151;you could go to a place that deals that with energy, gas, electricity, telecoms, television, cable television and so on. Relatively quickly, you would have a fairly straightforward way in which to contact people.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000041"></a>I am not opposed to an integrated consumer complaints system. I repeat my belief that if there is a criticism of this Bill it is that it does not go far enough and that post, energy and water are not enough. But I realise that the political reality is that the other departments, financial services and the Treasury, as I said of the Treasury earlier, give up nothing, and that they will probably hang about as some sort of predatory presence. If the DTI is to be dismembered, they will go around picking up any bones and scraps that they can get their teeth into. But that is for another day and time.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000042"></a>In large measure, this group of amendments is not really probing. It is going back to the debate that we had two weeks ago, and I am not sure that we really need it. I hope that the noble Baroness, who has made a number of very useful contributions, will set aside this last one so that we can move on to something worth while. There is a lot of meat on this legislation, and we could usefully use the Government&#146;s proposals to advance the interests of consumers. Although I am not totally uncritical of the Bill, as most Members of the Committee will appreciate, I none the less believe that it is something we should give good wind to.</p>

<p><a name="06121829000043"></a><b><a name="61218-gc0003.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="06121829000096"></a>Baroness O'Cathain:</b> I listened very intently the noble Lord&#146;s remarks. Unfortunately I was unable to take part on Second Reading, but the purpose of the Grand Committee is to look at the Bill clause by clause, in view of what was said in that debate, and to see whether there are glaring omissions or mistakes or too much laxity or control. That is the purpose of the amendments. It is all very well for the noble Lord to say that it is like ringing a call centre; if people had to deal with these matters through call centres, it would be like having a huge basket of goodies. Can you imagine how many of them would persevere right through to the end? I reckon it would be something like 1 per cent.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000044"></a>It is unfair of the noble Lord to say that we have been around this course once and that now we are just picking at it. We are not picking at it; we want a National Consumer Council; the consumer is king and must be supported. But an awful lot is done that is wrong in the consumer field, and we want to make the best possible Bill for the protection of the consumer. When you have something as woolly as this, you have to try to tidy it up, and that is the purpose of our interventions.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000046"></a>We have to be clear about the function of the Committee stage of a Bill, and it is playing a bit fast and loose with it to say that because a Second Reading has taken place we have bought into the

It is for the Minister to justify every detail of this Bill; that is why we have a Committee stage. One amendment that we are dealing with, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, relates to Clause 3 and designated consumers. It will be important to probe whether the provisions are appropriate.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000047"></a>As other Members of the Committee have said, we are all very much minded to ensure that the National Consumer Council works well, has appropriate powers that are clearly delineated and that the right designated consumers are listed in the Bill. I am not at all clear that they are. I hear what has been said about the need for an umbrella organisation, but first and foremost the question must be asked about whether we are convinced that the consumer will be better served. It may well be the case; I wait for the Minister to assure me on that, on Postwatch and on Energywatch.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000048"></a>My concern is water; I had the privilege of chairing a sub-committee of the Science and Technology Select Committee, where we did a report on water management in the United Kingdom at a time when the Consumer Council for Water was just starting out, having succeeded WaterVoice. We were impressed by the start that it made; we are fairly sure that it is counterproductive to pull up an organism and inspect the roots too often. I would have thought that good practice would require that you gave an organisation such as this one at least five years to settle down, particularly as we are coming to the next stage of reviewing water prices.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000049"></a>I am simply giving notice, since it will come up later, that I for one will need persuading on the detail of the Bill. I am not prepared to be told that because we have had a Second Reading whole clauses are naturally and inevitably appropriate. I hope the Minister will assure me that Clause 3 should stand part of the Bill.</p>

We all basically understand what it means, but it is probably unnecessarily exclusive. I would prefer &#147;priority consumer&#148;, because that is what is meant by &#147;designated consumer&#148;. Other consumers should not be left out of this provision altogether. There should be a further description in these clauses, so that it could be a priority to deal with priority consumers, but not excluding all other consumers.</p>

I am not objecting to discussing them here, but were they to be accepted, much of the institutional change introduced by the Bill would then fall. Therefore, the case for integrating Energywatch, Postwatch and possibly the Consumer Council for Water into one organisation needs to be made. I am sure the Minister will make it. </p>

<a name="61218-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000052"></a>My take on this is that when those industries were privatised, it was clearly necessary to establish a regulator for them to protect the interests of the consumer. Those regulators will continue to exist and continue to exert their powers. At the same time, it was felt necessary to establish either within those regulators or separately,  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC161"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column GC161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or subsequently separately, a consumer organisation. As time has gone on, it has become clear that the consumer anxieties, apart from those that reflect a not completely free market, are very similar to consumer anxieties and detriment elsewhere. The treatment by a utility company of its consumers in misleading billing, misleading advertising, overcharging, failure to describe a service, or failure to maintain a service is not actually that dissimilar to the failures of a bank, a builder or, with due respect to another Bill before the House, a lawyer.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/61218-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000053"></a>Therefore, there are generic issues relating to consumer detriment, consumer anxiety, and the way in which consumer views are taken into account when we are furthering legislation and regulation of those industries. It is therefore quite important that we have a single organisation that is able to deal with that. At the other end of the scale, there are consumer queries about every sort of supply of service or product, which probably, as my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill has said, would be better served by having a single point of call rather than a whole range of different numbers to contact about different services.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000054"></a>Because the National Consumer Council and the new National Consumer Council in this legislation have a particular responsibility for vulnerable consumers, it is important that we make it as easy as possible for the more vulnerable consumers to make contact about basic information. That will be done by an extension&#151;as I understand the DTI&#146;s proposals&#151;of Consumer Direct. The new National Consumer Council will bring together all those generic concerns of consumers in one advocacy body, which will cover the water front. I agree with my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill that it would be better if it covered the whole water front and not 80 per cent, but we have 80 per cent, with water possibly coming in at a later stage.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000055"></a>It is important that that organisation has a full view of all the concerns of consumers and is able to transfer expertise from one area, which has perhaps been developed in relation to financial services, into an area such as utility provision, provision of energy or provision of postal services. At present, the advocacy or policy role of Energywatch and of Postwatch is relatively limited and very focused. Those areas that require continuing attention continue to be reflected in the Bill&#151;for example, the number of post offices, which is a matter of acute concern at the moment&#151;would become the issue of concern for the new National Consumer Council quite explicitly, and it would have at least as powerful a role in that respect as Postwatch currently has. It would bring to bear a wider range of consumer expertise to deal with that problem. For example, rural post offices are part of a broader problem of the decline of services, both private and public, in rural areas more generally. Put in that context, there may be a more creative solution than simply the issue of how many rural post offices maintain in existence.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000056"></a>As far as the issue of designated consumers is concerned, however, it is important that the consumers of postal services and energy services do not lose any rights in this transfer, either into the complaints issue or into their representation in policy-making. Therefore the issue is not just priority consumers, as the noble

Maybe &#147;designated&#148; is not a particularly helpful term, but it is important that they are clearly identified and that their rights under current legislation are transferred into the new organisation.</p>

First, my noble friends Lord O&#146;Neill of Clackmannan and Lord Whitty, who has great knowledge in this area, raised the issue of an integrated consumer body. A number of noble Lords have asked why a consumer body cannot do more, and why we have not incorporated more consumer-representative groups in the Bill. That issue was raised on Second Reading, but I will go over it briefly again.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000058"></a>We undertook a consultation with groups such as the Financial Services Consumer Panel and the Ofcom Consumer Panel. However, the majority of responses to the consultation said that the role of these panels was different from that of statutory consumer bodies, being primarily regulator-facing rather than consumer-facing. There were other groups, and the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, mentioned the water sector, where the consumer representation function has only recently been reformed. It was viewed as unwise at such a stage to incorporate the water sector. A similar view was held on the rail sector, which has just had its consumer representation reformed as well. It was inappropriate to incorporate them at this stage. The Air Transport Users Council is part of the sectoral regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority; it is not actually a separate consumer representation body. However, we do not rule out any further developments or any of the sectors being incorporated at a later stage. At this stage, after extensive consultation, it was felt that it was not appropriate to incorporate them.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000059"></a>I shall go through one or two points that have been raised. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, raised the method of enforcement by the regulator. Enforcement in the energy sector is currently the same as that provided for in the Bill. Currently, in the postal services sector the court enforces a provision of information to the sectoral consumer body.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000060"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Oppenheim-Barnes, raised the point about designated consumers and vulnerable consumers. Designated consumers are those in sectors that require special attention in view of the market. They may or may not be a priority at any time, hence the description &#147;designated&#148;. The council will have functions in relation to vulnerable consumers. That is in Clause 11. The council will also have functions in relation to energy disconnections and it is felt important that vulnerable consumers should be covered by the Bill.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000061"></a>I shall turn to the main points on Energywatch and Postwatch. The intention behind the amendments is to remove those consumer bodies from the scope of the Bill. In effect, the result would be to create a new consumer council from the existing National Consumer Council only, which would not be able to require information from the sectoral regulators to carry out  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC163"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column GC163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>its functions. The new body is intended to be stronger than the sum of its parts&#151;an assurance that I can give to the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, and to my noble friend Lord Whitty. The idea is to produce a strong consumer advocate for consumers in all sectors. Achieving that aim would create a powerful consumer advocate, able to address consumer issues that frequently exist across sectors of the economy. The new body would have the critical mass to engage effectively with the Government, regulators and industry sectors on the basis of expert and informed analysis, with the benefit of being able to draw on experience and expertise from a number of sectors. Responsibility and authority to speak for consumers would rest with a single organisation, thus providing a stronger and more effective policy voice in the UK and EU. Therefore, the Committee will understand that I cannot accept these amendments. I believe that Clauses 3, 12, 24 and 29 and Schedules 2 and 3 should stand part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000062"></a>Clause 36 contains provisions that enable the Secretary of State to extend the functions of the council if he considers that it is in the interests of consumers or in the interests of a particular description of consumer. That is subject to the proviso that such additional functions must be connected to an existing or former function of the council. It provides flexibility in expansion of functions if that becomes necessary in the future. The Bill provides for prior consultation. The clause does not permit provision to be made which would be within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament. If a provision is made under that clause it would fall within the legislative competence of the National Assembly for Wales. The provision may be made only with the consent of the Assembly.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000063"></a>Clause 37 provides that the Secretary of State may make an order removing the functions of the council in respect of Northern Ireland, provided he is satisfied that arrangements are in place for another body to exercise the functions which were exercised by the council under the Bill in relation to Northern Ireland. That refers to the proposal under the Bill that only postal services in Northern Ireland will be covered. That is intended to provide flexibility in the face of changing circumstances. The clause provides for the Secretary of State to consult the council and such other persons as he considers appropriate before making an order under the clause.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000064"></a>Amendment No. 142 deals with Clause 59 and concerns the matter of applying the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 in respect of regulations made by regulators under Clauses 42 or 45. The amendment refers to the removal of the subsection from the Bill. However, the intention is to provide that the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 should apply to such regulations made by regulators under Clauses 42 or 45. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000065"></a>Similarly, Amendment No. 144 is necessary to ensure that regulations made under Clauses 42 or 45 are recognised as having the same status as regulations made by regulators included in the Documentary Evidence Act 1868 for the purposes proving certain documents. Amendment No. 147 has the effect of removing certain specified orders related to designated consumers, the designation of the

That would make them subject to the negative resolution procedure, but given the importance of their effect, I think they should be debated in Parliament. For the reasons that I have given, I must resist all the amendments and that Clauses 3, 12, 24, 29, 36 and 37 and Schedules 2 and 3 should not stand part of the Bill.</p>

I look forward to debating at greater length with the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, in view of his expertise on water. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, for his intervention when talking about designated consumers. He said that the Bill covered 80 per cent of the water front. It might do that in strict terms, but consumers would not see it as covering anything like 80 per cent because Ofcom, transport and financial services are not included. Mayor Bloomberg of New York attributed his election with such a whopping majority to the fact that he invented not 911&#151;not an emergency service number&#151;but 311, which can be rung for any public service. If the Bill had some ambition, instead of just drawing together what is possible at the moment, while maintaining the flexibility of which the Minister has spoken so eloquently, and if it had some teeth, it would make sense to consumers.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="06121829000067"></a>The Minister spoke of the Secretary of State being able to bring in other matters, which might give hope to consumers that, at some point in the future, the Bill will be rationalised to bring everything together. As the Bill stands, it will be very confusing to consumers. At any one time one may be a consumer, a designated consumer and a vulnerable designated consumer or any one of those. The body to which one relates may or may not be covered by the Bill and I do not think it will be clear whether one goes to Consumer Direct or the NCC or what the rules are. Much needs to be clarified, not just for us. Most importantly, by the time the Bill has gone through Parliament, consumers must be absolutely clear about the duties of the body and where they stand in relation to the various authorities and regulators and so on and what their roles are. At the moment it is quite confusing. I look forward to exploring it in more detail during the passage of the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="06121832000003"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendment is straightforward. We have legislation that provides a degree of protection for consumers when they make transactions emanating from the United Kingdom, most likely by means of the internet, although it could just as easily be done by telephone. We have a situation at the moment where the pound-dollar exchange rate is something like 2:1.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="06121832000004"></a>When I came through Edinburgh Airport this morning&#151;taking rather longer than I would have anticipated because the temperature fell below zero which, in an age of global warming, is something of a surprise to the airport authorities, who had made no provision for the de-icing of planes&#151;there was rather a large queue of people waiting to travel to the United States. A number of those people will be going there for Christmas, and a number will be going for what can only be called last-minute shopping. They will be getting into Newark, taking the fast train to Penn station, dashing across the road into shops such as Macy&#146;s, and doing all the things that sensible shoppers do&#151;of course in line with the customs regulations when they return to the United Kingdom. Those people will be making purchases and doing deals, and they will return to the United Kingdom to find that maybe not all their bargains were as attractive as they thought when they laid down their credit cards or, sadly, perhaps even paid dollars. This clause is trying to take account of transactions made outwith the United Kingdom by British citizens and afford them a degree of protection that they might not be able to access going to the authorities in Manhattan or elsewhere outside the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="06121832000005"></a>Caveat emptor is a principle that many of us have learnt to live with, sometimes uneasily, but sometimes when we go abroad we are the victims of rather more systematic difficulties. One thinks of the people who go on holiday who, albeit foolhardily, enter into the purchase of timeshare accommodation and the like, without very much protection. They are not afforded any degree of protection at the moment in UK legislation. Those people may in many respects be hapless consumers, but none the less it is incumbent on us, when we are looking at legislation that is seeking to reassert the rights of the consumer, to afford them a degree of protection that, frankly, we have not been able to provide in the past, partly because legislation of this nature does not come up all that frequently. I made that point earlier.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="06121832000006"></a>One of the problems that we have in the UK is that our system of legislation is not always that responsive to changes, so we only get such an opportunity once every 10 or 15 years. I remember dealing with matters, for example, relating to mental health, I think in 1983. I am sure the noble Baroness, Lady Oppenheim-Barnes, will remember that. It was about that time just before the 1983 election that legislation on mental health was going through both Houses. It transpires about once every 25 years. Legislation relating to consumers often comes up as frequently as that. There was the Consumer Credit Act 1974.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="06121832000007"></a>This idea has slipped through the net. We now have vast numbers of our population travelling abroad, entering into financial transactions and making purchases  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC166"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column GC166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and not always having an understanding of the consumer protection legislation of the country in question. You could say that they should do that and hell mend them if they do not. It is necessary for us to have a national consumer body that is capable to act where appropriate. We are not saying that every tuppence-ha&#146;penny transaction should be taken up and that people should be cosseted and protected at every turn. We know that there are unscrupulous dealers, property developers and the like who fleece a number of our citizens who are less sharp than they ought to be. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that the National Consumer Council should have sufficient powers to deal with matters of this nature and take up the problem on behalf of British citizens, not necessarily in every case&#151;I stress that&#151;but where there could be the equivalent of a class action. Therefore, an amendment of this nature could well be necessary. Does the Bill cover this issue? If a British tourist&#151;albeit somewhat hapless&#151;going abroad enters into a transaction that is not sensible, is he or she entitled to any degree of advocacy, if not protection? If it becomes apparent that there is an element of doubt about this, the National Consumer Council should be given the powers to take this up with the appropriate authority in the appropriate country.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="06121832000008"></a>A number of people go abroad who, frankly, almost deserve to get taken apart. However, the fact that they are not the sharpest tools in the box does not deny them the right to a degree of advocacy and protection. To what other body can they look than the National Consumer Council? If a number of cases come up at a particular time and a systematic mis-selling of goods abroad does not attract the attention of the consumer bodies in the European Union, let us say, it would not be inappropriate for the National Consumer Council to take up cudgels on people&#146;s behalf. Doing so would afford a degree of protection. We should not encourage people to enter into foolhardy transactions, but the vast numbers of our citizens who travel abroad regularly and, probably for the worst of reasons, enter into these kinds of deals, should be afforded a degree not necessarily of protection but of representation. That is what we are asking for, and it would not be inappropriate for the National Consumer Council to be given that responsibility. I beg to move.</p>

It is quite ridiculous. I wish that all the consumers in this country had the faintest idea of their rights and obligations and what the laws are in this country, let alone in many others. It has long been my quest to educate consumers and tell them what their rights and obligations are so that they can avoid the disasters that sometimes befall them. But the amendment proposes that we should try and protect them against foreign laws which are binding in foreign countries and that we should intervene. I am quite sure that even the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, who is second to none in his expertise in these matters, could not tell you what the law on consumer rights is in various countries. If we move even remotely into this area, we will be wasting a great deal of time and money which would neither be justified nor in the fundamental interests of consumers in this country.</p>

Amendment No. 16 is a probing amendment, intended to clarify the exact definition of a consumer. The Bill differentiates between an existing consumer and a future consumer. While it is clear what an existing consumer is, I should be grateful if the Minister could inform us whether use of the term &#147;future consumer&#148; suggests that part of the National Consumer Council&#146;s remit will be to target people who may become consumers in certain markets in the future. If that is so, I shall be interested to know whether the National Consumer Council, in its new proximity to the Government, will be given access to sensitive information to aid its research. This is an important point. Certain government departments have access to sensitive information such as the marked electoral register, the ID cards register and other databases, such as those containing credit history. As the Bill stands, the Secretary of State&#146;s powers to bestow functions and allowances are widely set. I am sure the Minister will be able to reassure me categorically that access to sensitive information will not be increased as a result of the NCC&#146;s new status.</p>
<h5><a name="06121832000028"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="06121832000011"></a>Amendment No. 17 is intended to ensure tha  sole traders and small businesses are considered consumers for the purposes of the NCC. Smaller ventures are not only consumers in the traditional sense of their being private individuals, but are also consumers within a far wider business food chain. It is important that they are recognised as such in the Bill. A classic case in point would be where a small business or sole trader loses electricity, or is set to lose electricity, and due to its status as a business, not a consumer, suffers serious losses as a result of not being able to use Consumer Voice as an advocate with energy companies to prevent disconnection.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="06121832000012"></a>Amendment No. 18 is a probing amendment that would delete the reference to &#147;goods&#148; in the definition of &#147;consumer materials&#148;. I should be grateful for some clarification from the Minister. First, does the phrasing that,</p>
<ul><a name="06121832000025"></a>&#147;&#145;goods&#146; includes land or an interest in land&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="06121832000021"></a>mean that &#147;goods&#148; refers to nothing else in this context? Secondly, it is my understanding that a reference to &#147;land&#148; at this point in the Bill is at odds with the definition of &#147;goods&#148; in the Sale of Goods Act 1979. Will the Minister inform noble Lords of the genesis of that definition? I should also be interested to know whether the inclusion of,</p>
<ul><a name="06121832000026"></a>&#147;land or an interest in land&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="06121832000022"></a>which I take to mean a financial interest, in the context of consumer affairs, could result in double redress being awarded to an individual who has problems with exchanges of land, as they could be awarded redress as a consumer in Part 2 and under the estate agency scheme in Part 3.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="06121832000013"></a>Amendment No. 19 is another probing amendment intended to tease out the definition of &#147;received goods&#148;. I am curious to know whether that could refer to loans taken out on the doorstep. Among the most expensive loans in the country are those sold to consumers in their own homes. While I welcome the  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC168"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column GC168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>new provisions to equalise solicited and unsolicited sales rights in Part 4, they do not apply to financial loans. I believe the serious problem of personal debt in this country is occasion enough to warrant inclusion in the NCC&#146;s list of relevant consumer areas, and indeed to warrant heightened consumer education and protection with regard to solicited and unsolicited sale of services.</p>

<p><a name="06121832000014"></a><b><a name="61218-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="06121832000032"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> I have some comments on Amendment No. 15, tabled by my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill, and Amendment No. 17, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox. On my noble friend&#146;s amendment, I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Oppenheim-Barnes, that he is well aware that the Bill is not creating individual consumer rights, legal rights or anything of the sort. It does not seek to give consumers in this country rights that they do not otherwise have against suppliers in the United States or elsewhere. He will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that he is saying consumers in this country have a body called the National Consumer Council, which is there to protect the interests of consumers generally, give advice to Ministers and consumers, conduct research and so on. In the course of giving advice to British consumers, to extend a restraining arm to those who might otherwise go wild on the continent of Europe or in New York in doing their shopping and who do not take sufficient care of their own interests would seem to be perfectly reasonable among the other advisory and warning sounds that the NCC might make.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="06121832000015"></a>I do not think my noble friend&#146;s amendment is needed, because although the consumer, as distinct from the supplier, has to be in this country, the definition of &#147;consumer&#148; and &#147;supplier&#148; in Clause 2 does not restrict itself to a supplier who is within Great Britain. It says: &#147;a person who purchases&#148; and so on,</p>
<ul><a name="06121832000027"></a>&#147;in Great Britain, goods or services which are supplied in the course of a business&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06121832000023"></a>It does not say where the supplier has to be. That could cover the problem my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill is concerned about.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="06121832000016"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 17, I know the business background and experience of the noble Baroness, and I was not surprised when she said she was mainly concerned with sole partnerships, small businesses and so on that do not have vast legal departments such as major business firms like ICI may have, and therefore may know the law about the buying and selling of goods and services no better than what I might call the ordinary, private consumer. She makes a fair point. Due to the way she has drafted the amendment, however, the &#147;consumer&#148; includes a person who purchases and so on for the purposes of their own business. In law, the word &#147;person&#148; includes not just natural persons but corporate persons. Therefore, when ICI is buying either machinery or an expensive car for the chief executive, it is a consumer. I hope that my noble friend Lord Whitty, as the person running the National Consumer Council, does not want the NCC to be spending time on the concerns of businesses that no doubt have their own lawyers and legal departments at their beck and call.</p>

The point of this group of amendments is flexibility for the new National Consumer Council. I would like the Government&#146;s view on whether an amendment such as that in the name of my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill is necessary. The new council would need the flexibility, but not the requirement, to intervene in areas like the misleading selling of timeshare. If the present provisions do not allow for that, we need something like my noble friend&#146;s amendment.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="06121832000018"></a>Likewise, the present National Consumer Council has a responsibility for future consumers as well as current consumers, and does not really require a lot of definition. It is part of the long-run policy focus. We will come on to the issue of sustainability under a later amendment. I hope the Minister can assure the noble Baroness that this does not imply access to any sensitive information. My understanding is that that is not implied at all, and that this is simply what its predecessor bodies have been doing anyway.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="06121832000019"></a>On the issue of business, I agree entirely with the point made by my noble friend Lord Borrie, who put it very well. Small businesses that are effectively equivalent to domestic and individual consumers need a champion, but the clause as it is currently phrased would give a wider range of responsibility to businesses in general, which I do not think is the intention of the Bill. I hope the Minister will allow the new organisation a bit of flexibility here over what is a small business that needs such protection, and what is not.</p>

I am also grateful for the erudite contributions of my noble friends Lord Borrie and Lord Whitty.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000001"></a>I shall begin with the points made by my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill. The Bill raises the question of consumer protection but is focused on vulnerable consumers. A new consumer protection regulation provides for co-operation between consumer protection bodies across the EU, and we are in the process of implementing it, so work is going on internationally. However, the proposed new council is a statutory body, and we must be careful not to give it statutory responsibilities that it is unable to discharge effectively, particularly in other jurisdictions. If the council tried to get its writ to run on Park Avenue in Manhattan or in the bazaars of Istanbul, it would find it difficult. However, I understand the point that the noble Lord is raising.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000004"></a>Other amendments change the definition of &#147;consumer&#148; in Clause 2. Amendment No. 15 extends the definition of consumer to include a UK resident who purchases, uses or receives goods or services outside the United Kingdom. The definition in the Bill already includes goods or services purchased, used or received in Great Britain, irrespective of the origin of those goods or services. In the case of goods or services purchased in Great Britain, the definition covers the consumer, irrespective of where the goods or services are supplied or received. The proposed additional definition would expand the functions and duties of the council beyond the United Kingdom into areas where the council would not be able to exercise its functions effectively. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Oppenheim-Barnes, on that&#151;and there is always room on our Benches if she wishes to cross the Floor.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000005"></a>Amendment No. 16 excludes future consumers from the definition of consumer&#151;a point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox. The council should be able to address the position of future consumers and to research and detect trends and developments in markets in order to facilitate the empowerment of consumers. We should not restrict the scope of the new body to markets as they operate today.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000006"></a>Amendment No. 17 includes in the definition of consumer,</p>
<ul><a name="06121845000153"></a>&#147;a person who purchases, uses or receives goods or services for the purpose of their own business&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06121845000131"></a>This amendment is not necessary. The definition of consumer in the Bill deliberately does not exclude any class of consumer, which means that the council will be able to focus on the areas of greatest consumer detriment.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000007"></a>Amendment No. 19 adds to the definition of &#147;receives&#148; by stating that it includes,</p>

<p><a name="06121845000132"></a>The definition of consumer already includes a person who purchases, uses or receives goods or services, and we do not consider that the amendment adds substance to that definition.</p>

<p><a name="06121845000017"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 26, 42 and 43. These amendments alter the Bill in two respects but seek to achieve a common aim. The arrangements for the merger are in need of clarification. Amendment No. 26 is a probing amendment and, if it were accepted, it would alter the remit of the forward work programme so that only measurable objectives could be included. The amendment is tabled in a spirit of common sense, as unquantifiable elements would do little to provide a forward-looking programme. It seems sensible to plan for work that is possible to define in advance and to leave a margin of time and funding to adapt to unforeseen demands on the National Consumer Council. Can the Minister clarify what he envisages the report will produce and how those who read it will use it?</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000018"></a>The NCC already has to produce an annual report&#151;the remit of which the Secretary of State has the power to direct&#151;that informs the Government and Parliament of what it has achieved in the year. There is huge scope for the Secretary of State to intervene on the policy side of the NCC, and I shall be interested to hear from the Minister what directions he anticipates the Secretary of State will give to the NCC under Clause 6.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000019"></a>Amendments Nos. 42 and 43 go to the heart of our concerns about the proposed merger of Postwatch, Energywatch and the NCC. Noble Lords will know that the watchdog organisations provide a highly technical complaints service. While many companies prove unable to interrogate their own customer services systems, the watchdogs are invaluable in providing insight and resolution on complex complaints matters. Complaints provide the most transparent feedback from the consumer. The NCC will not be a direct service provider, and I wish Consumer Direct every success in that respect. However, it is vital that the NCC maintains its accuracy and standard of research and that it provides insight into complaints.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000020"></a>The amendments in this group widen and extend the NCC&#146;s accountability and take its remit in the right direction. The NCC must have enough flexibility in its planning to meet the changing challenges in the consumer world, but its remit must be strong enough to ensure that, in its new position as a non-departmental public body with funding from the taxpayer, it provides the insight and research that will make it, as it is now, a real champion for consumer affairs.

If the consumer council is to be a powerful advocate&#151;which we all want it to be, and I am sure it will be&#151;one of its most important roles will be gathering and disseminating information, particularly about the frequency of complaints, because that is where any practice that needs to be dealt with swiftly or that needs to be publicised or even legislated against will come to light. Therefore, unless there is a clear

Complaints are important indicators of where problems lie. The number of complaints&#151;and even of inquiries, because an inquiry might not always be a complaint&#151;gives a clear indication of where consumers are experiencing problems. That enables policy-makers and others to get a clearer idea of what is happening in the market so far as consumers are concerned. This is a practical suggestion.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000024"></a>Amendment No. 26 requires the council to include the measurable objectives of a project in any forward work programme. That appears to exclude objectives which are not measured and which would represent an undue constraint on the transparency and flexibility of the forward work programme. I take it that the underlying intention is to promote measurable objectives for projects that the council proposes to undertake. I am happy to support the broad thrust of that argument but I do not agree with the amendment.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000025"></a>Amendment No. 42 adds to the obligations of the council in respect of the annual report and requires it to include details of the most frequent complaints from consumers about post and energy. It also requires the new NCC to include recommendations to regulated energy and post companies to change their practices. The council has a general information function under Clause 9&#151;referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Oppenheim-Barnes&#151;which allows it to facilitate information provision to consumers. Under Clause 44, it has an obligation to publish information on levels of compliance by an energy or postal services company with any complaint-handling standards set by the regulator. An obligation on the council to set out information for consumers in its annual report may not be the most appropriate way of providing consumers with that information or information on its recommendations to regulated post and energy companies on their practices. We should leave it to the council to decide how best to bring such information to the attention of consumers.</p>

<p><a name="06121845000026"></a>Amendment No. 43 adds an obligation on the council to include in its annual report an account of its fulfilment of its duty to arrange for the annual report to be published. That appears unnecessary. For those reasons, I must resist these amendments.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000031"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 30 sets a cap on the spending of the new National Consumer Council. I have already noted my concern that the new funding arrangements for the NCC could diminish its independence, and running parallel to that point is my concern at the potential for spiralling costs of the NCC.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000032"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for his correspondence following Second Reading. It was useful to receive such a well prepared summary of the points raised and to have some insight into Ministers&#146; thinking in advance of today. Can the Minister indicate how costs will be kept under control, given that, in his words:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="06121845000141"></a>&#147;What the Bill does not do is specify that there should be any particular number or location for any regional committees&#148;?</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06121845000133"></a>I agree with the Minister that there needs to be flexibility within the NCC, but that should not come at the expense of sound structure and sensible spending.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000033"></a>Indeed, I was surprised to read a few pages on in the Minister&#146;s letter that costs-savings are expected from,</p>
<ul><a name="06121845000155"></a>&#147;the reduction in the regional office network&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="06121845000134"></a>That seems to be at odds with the fact that there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the establishment of many offices. I will be grateful if the Minister will inform the Committee whether he envisages more regional offices and greater spending or fewer offices and cost-savings. Whatever answer the Minister gives, it is clear that funding forecasts on this merger cannot be as stable as the Government claim. My amendment ensures that the National Consumer Council would operate within a strict budget and maintain its current low-cost status.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000034"></a>Has the Minister considered the likely cost implications of migrating complaints handling away from Energywatch and Postwatch to companies? While I believe strongly that complaints are one of the most effective consumer tests for companies, I am concerned that the sudden new burden of the complaints procedure will result in slower complaints handling and a worse deal for the consumer. What is more, tying the funding of the redress scheme to a per- complaint basis, as suggested in paragraph 2.56 of the regulatory impact assessment, could lead to Catch-22 funding, where a slow complaints system reduces the value of a redress system dependent on complaints for revenue. I shall be grateful if the Minister can say, in figures and percentages, how much revenue he expects complaints to produce. I also hope that he can confirm the precise function of Clause 4(3)(b). Does he anticipate expenditure by the NCC on designated consumers and, if so, what kind of expenditure does he envisage?</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000035"></a>There seems to be very little consistency in the Bill and the regulatory impact assessment. There are far too many loose ends for me to feel confident in the efficiency and sustainability of the merger of the NCC and the other bodies. My amendment ensures that there is a clear strategy for the merger and subsequent maintenance of the new NCC. I hope the Minister will agree that it is essential that there is a constant factor in this equation and that, while the NCC needs to remain flexible, as will the level of charging by the regulator through licences, it is important that that is not accompanied by a blank cheque of taxpayers&#146; money. I beg to move.</p>

On the basis that the new National Consumer Council will have greater powers and responsibilities than the current council, why is the budget not going to be increased? Is there going to be a bigger budget?</p>

<p><a name="06121845000037"></a><b><a name="61218-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="06121845000170"></a>Lord Truscott:</b> Amendment No. 30 provides for regulations to limit the expenditure that the council can make for its forward work programme. Its budget would be discussed between the department and the council. It is normal practice to provide indicative budgets for three years ahead to aid planning and provide certainty. Making regulations to limit the expenditure would be too onerous and, in the circumstances, unnecessary, so I do not support the amendment.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000038"></a>The noble Baroness made a point about permission to close regional offices. Paragraph 27 of Schedule 1 provides that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="06121845000142"></a>&#147;The Council must maintain an office in each of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06121845000135"></a>and,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="06121845000143"></a>&#147;The Council may, with the approval of the Secretary of State, establish additional offices in the United Kingdom&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000039"></a>The number of offices can be expanded, but proposals to close offices must go before the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000040"></a>The assumed cost of the redress scheme was estimated on complaint levels in 2005-06, and the figures in the RIA are based on our best estimates of the assumed income from complaints. The idea is that the core savings will come from the consolidation of Energywatch and Postwatch. The industries in those sectors will continue to be responsible for the costs of the complaints and the operation of their sectors, so in future they will have funding responsibility for Energywatch and Postwatch, as they do currently. It is not envisaged that that will lead to increased costs. I will write to the noble Baroness on her other points.</p>

Amendment No. 38 would ensure that the NCC would indeed carry out the work promised in its forward work programme. Quite apart from the justification of the cost of producing such a document, it is important that the NCC, where it pledges to carry out work, does so, within reason, so that its functions are transparent to the consumer public. Amendment No. 39 tightens up the duty under subsection (6) so that one of the NCC&#146;s main functions is to operate with the most efficient use of resources. The NCC is historically an efficient and, effectively, low-cost organisation; it would be a shame and a wasted opportunity if that was allowed to change and a further burden was placed on the taxpayer and industry.</p>

Now is not the time to debate the meaning of the term. Perhaps we shall come to it in more detail on Report.

It will be a great relief to him to know that he is going to be able to endorse the concept that the council must use its resources in the most efficient and economic way. I simply cannot believe the Minister would disagree with that.</p>

I, too, hope the Minister will welcome them because it would be inconceivable to have a clause about a forward work plan that may or may not be implemented. There would be very little point in drawing it up unless it was implemented. Indeed, in other publicly-funded bodies, such as local government, there would be plenty of inspectors from all over the place&#151;not least from the Audit Commission&#151;making sure that the body had implemented its forward work plan to the letter. I am not sure who will inspect the NCC to ensure that it has implemented its work plan, but perhaps the Minister will tell me.</p>

I agree that it is important for the council to undertake a work programme that has been subject to public scrutiny and consultation. However, the amendment would require the council to implement the programme in full and could potentially affect the flexibility of the council to respond to unforeseen changes in priorities that may arise after the forward work programme is published, which could not therefore be captured in that programme, about which it would be necessary or highly beneficial for consumers for the council to make representations on their behalf. It is therefore feasible that, with finite time and resources, the council would legitimately be unable to implement the forward work programme in its entirety.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000055"></a>Amendment No. 39 would create a duty on the council to use its resources in the most efficient and economic way. I am sorry to disappoint the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, but, in our view, it would place too onerous a burden on the council to demonstrate compliance with the duty. I am not convinced that it is required because the chief executive of the new council will be designated as the accounting officer and, as such, will be required to ensure that all funds are used economically, efficiently and effectively. Further, the National Audit Office will also be able to review the efficiency with which the new body uses its resources to ensure that those requirements are being met.</p>

<p><a name="06121845000056"></a>Amendment No. 41 seeks to amend the new council&#146;s objective in relation to sustainable development. As drafted, the clause clearly places a duty on the council without placing too onerous a burden on it.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="06121845000146"></a>&#147;The Council must have regard to the desirability of acting in the manner best calculated to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development&#148;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06121845000136"></a>I am sure that the Minister will say that it is designed to achieve, in the phrase of the afternoon, the greatest flexibility. However, if energy comes within the purview of the council, as the Bill proposes, this phrase will be much more important than the Minister has perhaps thought.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000063"></a>The public are, rightly, consistently asked to do more to conserve energy because of climate change considerations. It is one of the biggest issues of the moment, and the public are taking an interest in what they can do beyond buying properly labelled white goods or insulating their loft. Some of the work of Energywatch is relevant here, such as talking to Ofcom about smart metering. The consumer could be put in charge in a very visual way of the amount of energy that they use. Those who decided to go into microgeneration would be able to sell to the grid. The council will need a clear overview of exactly what is stopping or frustrating consumers and making them complain in their efforts to mitigate the effects of their actions on climate change.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000064"></a>I accept that my amendment may well be imperfect, and I hope that the Government&#146;s experienced draftsmen will be able to come up with something far more definite, but unless Clause 5(8) is worded more definitely, it will not be sufficient to enable the council to act strongly. One of my questions for the Minister is whether it is as strong as the duty currently laid on the NCC or other bodies.

I do not mind whether the Government prefer the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, or my amendment, but either would have more teeth than what is in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

I hope that the Government accept it or come up with something equally strong. The NCC and Energywatch have put a lot of effort into ensuring that sustainability is part of their policy. For example, there was a joint statement last week on the need to promote green tariffs and to avoid misleading or unclear advice to consumers on them. Consumers are often blamed for failing to adopt sustainable policies. It must be part of the remit of the new organisation to ensure that it is easier for consumers to make sustainable choices and to ensure other changes that make it more likely that consumers will make sustainable choices.</p>

<p><a name="06121845000067"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and I have sat through a lot of institutional change in government over the past few years. This is one of the weakest formulations on sustainability, including the provisions in the Water Act, which among other things established the Consumer Council for Water and gave it a sustainability objective. There are other forms of words in legislation that the Government could adopt if they do not like the noble Baroness&#146;s words. I seriously hope that they will do so later in the passage of the Bill.</p>

The situation is similar to the debate on the powers of Natural England. There is surely an obligation on the NCC to do more than have regard. Surely there is an element of promotion and championing. I know that those ideas are difficult to formulate without being too draconian, but an organisation that exists to represent the consumer on energy&#151;and perhaps on water, although I hope not&#151;and other such issues should surely go much further. I hope that the Minister will follow the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and will go back and read some of the debates as well as some of the final Acts that determined the role of sustainable development in other organisations. We can do better than this.</p>

The aim of the amendment is to strengthen the new council&#146;s objective on sustainable development. However, the clause already clearly places a duty on the council, without placing too onerous a burden on the new body.

First, on Amendments Nos. 46 and 47, the amendments seek to place a duty on the council to carry out its information function. However, this would remove the flexibility of the council to concentrate on the other core functions in Clauses 7 and 8 if it considers that this will be most effective and beneficial to consumers, given the priorities of the council over the coming year.</p>

<p><a name="06121845000089"></a>Amendment No. 48 also seeks to amend the information function of the council. The amendment would limit the carrying out of the function to disseminate information and advice to the council. As drafted, the function permits the council not only to disseminate information but to facilitate the dissemination of information and advice by others, as it will be a strong consumer advocate with cross-sectoral expertise. I consider this to be an important function to assign to the new council, and one that will be beneficial to consumers in terms of the quality of information and advice that may be received from the council and others.

Non-departmental public bodies are not inexpensive. My amendment would ensure that while the NCC would have the leeway to explore issues that were of interest to it, it would have to have regard to the efficient use of resources.

However, I am not convinced that this is required, given that Part 5 of Schedule 1 already sets out the requirements of the council in relation to its accounts. Schedule 1 places a duty on the council to keep proper accounts and to prepare in respect of each financial year a statement of accounts. A copy of this statement must be given to the Secretary of State and to the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The Comptroller and Auditor-General must in turn examine and report on the accounts of the council. That report and a copy of the statement of accounts must be laid before Parliament.

<p><a name="06121845000100"></a>Amendment No. 52 relates to the general powers of investigation of the council. Clause 10 is not intended to permit the council to investigate individual complaints. It is limited to those complaints that are set out in Clauses 11 and 12. Clause 10 essentially provides the council with another source of information about consumer matters, where it considers that complaint from a consumer has a more general relevance that applies to the market as a whole and therefore to all consumers within that market. For the council to be an effective advocate for consumers across all markets, it is important that it can obtain information about matters that concern consumers the most and result in the greatest consumer detriment. Clause 10 represents one of the ways in which the council will be able to obtain such information. For the reasons given, I must resist the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="06121845000109"></a>The noble Baroness said: These amendments deal with consumers who in the terms of the Bill are &#147;vulnerable&#148;. Amendment No. 53 is a probing amendment to discover whether the Government still define &#147;vulnerable&#148; as it is defined in previous statute. If so, where is it so defined, and exactly what is the definition of &#147;vulnerable&#148;?</p>

<p><a name="06121845000110"></a>There is a presumption against the disconnection of water, which has led to many debates in your Lordships&#146; House about the &#147;can&#146;t pays&#148; and the &#147;won&#146;t pays&#148; and what is to happen to them. While no sympathy is felt for the &#147;won&#146;t pays&#148;, the &#147;can&#146;t pays&#148;, and those who truly fall into the category of &#147;vulnerable&#148;, whether because they are elderly, ill, mentally or physically disabled, or have a large number of young children, might make them vulnerable. The first amendment is simply designed for the Government to put on the record who they regard as vulnerable. If there is an official definition, my amendment seeks to explore whether it is wide enough and suggests inserting the words &#147;or otherwise disadvantaged&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="06121845000111"></a>Amendment No. 65 raises the question of who will do the urgent advocacy work that Energywatch undertakes on disconnection. Of course, people can have energy supplies disconnected. Energywatch has many files and has done huge amounts of work for people who were about to be disconnected, did not know where to turn and turned to Energywatch, which examined the case. I wish to put one example from Energywatch on the record for the Committee, so that Members know what I am talking about. A customer, who fell into debt with her gas account and was unable to repay was disconnected by her supplier. She was registered disabled and was in hospital when the supply was cut off. Her 15 year-old daughter was alone in the house without heating and hot water for nearly a month. The consumer was discharged from hospital to a cold house. Prior to the disconnection, her supplier had gone to court to obtain a warrant. The consumer was ordered to pay &#163;22 a week by the court, despite receiving only &#163;98 a week in benefits. Energywatch took up her case with the company, which eventually agreed to reconnect her supply and allowed her to pay her debt through the Fuel Direct scheme. Energywatch continued to negotiate on her behalf. Now she pays &#163;2.80 a week towards her debt and &#163;7.10 a week for gas, a payment level she is able to manage on her income.</p>

<p><a name="06121845000112"></a>That example illustrates two points about which I am concerned. If the new arrangements come into being, who will be the advocate in the immediate term with a customer, for example, who returns from hospital to a cold house? Will the same body continue to take the case to a satisfactory conclusion both for the

Getting this right is particularly important, which is why I have tabled this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="06121845000113"></a><b><a name="61218-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="06121845000195"></a>Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan:</b> This debate is important. After Second Reading, my noble friend sent a number of us a very helpful letter in which he covered some of these points. But it would be useful to get them on the record in public, because some of the points that the noble Baroness has raised are of significance. On vulnerable consumers, we are not concerned about only those who are formally disconnected, we are also concerned about this grey area of self-disconnection. There is nothing more disturbing than the self-congratulatory approach of the energy retailers when they say that they no longer disconnect anything like the horrendous numbers that a number of us used to have to contend with in days gone by. Now it is a rather more subtle process. It is self-disconnection by people who get themselves into financial difficulties, cannot cope and, by any stretch of the imagination, are vulnerable. Those individuals have got to be afforded a degree of protection as well. They very often fall through the net of concern that the electricity and gas retailers have. I use the word &#147;net&#148; advisedly, because it is not a blanket that will catch everyone. Too many people fall through it.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000114"></a>I would like to think that the definition of &#147;vulnerability&#148; will be a little sharper than in the past. The &#147;discreet poor&#148; are people who do not admit that they are in difficulties. But, with a wee bit of effort, energy retailers could go some way to discovering who they are and do something about them. These very often are people who only get in touch with Energywatch or Citizens Advice in the most fierce of extremis. They will need to know that there is a new revamped body. Electricity and gas bills should state clearly the easiest telephone numbers for these people to use for making contact. Therefore, in the context of this debate, it would be useful for &#147;vulnerability&#148; to be defined broadly and precisely. Vulnerable people are not just the folk who get switched off or who are in difficulty, they are also people who very quickly&#151;for the best and, sometimes, the worst of reasons&#151;get themselves into financial difficulties. We must try to help them as well. Sometimes, they are not on the books of the social services, the housing department or anyone else as being poor payers. It would be useful to have clear guidance as early as possible on the issue of vulnerability.</p>

Energywatch has obvious expertise and experience in dealing with very vulnerable customers, which was shown in the Energywatch example that was read out. Will that experience and expertise in dealing with these people be easily translated into the new NCC, if there is to be this great body? This concerns really vulnerable people. The life-threatening situation of not having gas and electricity is matched only by not having water, which is also life threatening when not readily available. Those of us

I fear the sensitivity of that group of people; as the noble Lord said, they do not want to admit that they are in this situation. A case involving a 15 year-old girl living for a month without heat or hot water was mentioned. Is it possible to put that experience and expertise into an organisation which has never had dealings on that level? Obviously, it may have dealt with vulnerable customers who have fallen into debt, but these cases are life-threatening. This is probably the wrong time to interject, but we have to be very mindful of whether the Government are right to put Energywatch in this organisation.</p>

<p><a name="06121845000116"></a><b><a name="61218-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="06121845000197"></a>Lord Truscott:</b> I acknowledge and empathise with the case given by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, which is food for thought. I agree absolutely with the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, that these issues are of great concern. The role of Energywatch in dealing with disconnections will be transferred to the new NCC. A clear objective of the new council is that it will retain the expertise from the current body. The work that goes on now in Energywatch and Postwatch will be transferred to the new body.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000117"></a>As regards the vulnerable consumer and the points raised by my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill, which I take on board, this is a new statute with a new definition. The definition does not have to be interpreted in the light of previous definitions, although they may be helpful. The words have their ordinary meaning. We want to leave it to the council to interpret what is meant by &#147;vulnerable consumer&#148;; there is no legalistic framework. Amendment No. 53 would add after the word &#147;vulnerable&#148; in Clause 11 the words &#147;or otherwise disadvantaged&#148;. I recognise the intention behind the amendment, but I consider that the term &#147;vulnerable&#148; provides the necessary flexibility for the council to interpret such cases in accordance with changing circumstances and developing views on how to define those in greatest need in society.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000118"></a>Also under Clause 11, Amendments Nos. 59 and 60 would place the council under a duty, rather than providing a power, to investigate a complaint by a designated consumer and to provide advice and make representations where it appeared to the council that it was appropriate to do so. This would be onerous because the council might decide that the complaint could be dealt with more effectively by another party under Clauses 13 or 14, for example.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000119"></a>Amendment No. 65 to Clause 12 would expand the list of complaints by consumers to be assisted by the council in circumstances involving a disconnection of premises from the supply of electricity or gas. I am sympathetic to the intention behind the amendment, referred to eloquently by the noble Baroness and my noble friend Lord O&#146;Neill, and we will need to consider what can be done about this issue. However, for the time being, for the reasons I have given, I must resist the amendments.</p>

I am left wondering whether guidance is needed on the word &#147;vulnerable&#148; and whether the Government are going to define it in the Bill. I can understand why they might not want to do so but this matter could be subject to a requirement for the Minister to issue guidance. Perhaps I may leave that thought with him and we shall see whether he is minded to introduce such a provision on Report. If not, perhaps we will bring forward an amendment.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000121"></a>On the other issue, the Minister made me feel slightly more worried. Consumers would fear that they would go to the NCC with an acute or ongoing problem and then, as the Minister said, they might be covered by Clause 13, which is headed &#147;Reference of matters to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority&#148;. But that is exactly what consumers do not want&#151;they do not want to ring one number and be passed to another body. You explain your case and then they hum and haw over it and say, &#147;Well, actually, I think that&#146;s for the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority&#148;. The strength of Energywatch is that it takes the case and deals with it. If passing this legislation means that consumers will receive a lesser service in which there is more buck-passing, we shall definitely be doing them a disservice. However, I shall read carefully what the Minister said and, in the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="06121845000125"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 66, 69 and 71 in my name. When I looked at this matter, my mind went back to Christmas 1980, when I returned to Scotland with a virginal copy of the Education (Scotland) Bill. My job was to fillet it and produce amendments for Committee with the express intention of keeping the Government as far away as possible from securing the legislation. In those days, new Front-Benchers had to undergo a kind of D101 course, which said, &#147;When you see &#145;may&#146;, put in &#145;shall&#146;; when you see &#145;three months&#146;, put in &#145;six months&#146;; when you see such and such, change it&#148;.

<p><a name="06121845000126"></a>The fact is that these amendments have some express purpose, which is not particularly irrelevant or a waste of the Committee&#146;s time. Amendments Nos. 64 and 69 afford to the National Consumer Council a degree of flexibility that the legislation as drafted appears not to; that is, to find the best way to fulfil and deliver the functions. It affords the National Consumer Council the opportunity to subcontract some of the responsibilities to other bodies. Perhaps I

There are specialist bodies that have a rather narrower focus than the NCC, and the NCC might well need some form of specialist advice, particularly in other areas, such as public inquiries and consumer complaints.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000127"></a>Amendments Nos. 70 and 71 are of a slightly different order. We have been trying to impose burdens on the NCC today. This is a kind of softening of the obligation in the sense that in proposing the amendment it is not reasonable in every instance for the NCC to be required by the Government to do things. It should not be the creature of the Government. It is intended, as I understand it from the legislation, to be an arm&#146;s-length satellite body. As a consequence, I am not sure that it necessarily should be required or demanded by the Government to produce reports. A polite asking rather than a demand might be appropriate in this instance. Having said that, if we are going to have a relationship between the Government and the NCC for research purposes, there is nothing more frustrating for bodies such as the NCC to produce erudite, well thought-out, clearly expounded reports and then discover that they lie gathering dust in government departments, and that what will be a late summer becomes an early autumn becomes a &#147;just before Christmas&#148; type of publication.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000128"></a>Having been for some 10 years the chairman of a Select Committee, one of the consolations that I had was that maybe the Government would not always agree with what we said, but they had to respond to it within something like six to eight weeks, or we would create hell and they would be rather embarrassed. Therefore, if the Secretary of State asks the NCC to produce a report, there ought to be a duty to publish it within a reasonable timescale. That is the burden of Amendment No. 71.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="06121845000129"></a>We have these four amendments, two affording a degree of flexibility to the NCC and the other two enabling it to have a perhaps slightly less onerous relationship with the Secretary of State; but at the same time not letting the Secretary of State off the hook when reports have been asked for, agreed to and produced and then we find that there is problem with publication. I would like to think that the Minister will be able to tell us that such a thought would be so far from the Government&#146;s mind&#151;certainly in relation to the last amendment&#151;that it is unnecessary, but some of us, through bitter experience perhaps, have more than an iota of cynicism on these matters. Unless it is written down and the hands are nailed to the table, we are not convinced that they will necessarily produce the reports that an independent body such as the NCC would perhaps produce in all honesty, but might cause the Government a bit of embarrassment to publish. So we think this amendment is necessary. The amendments are both flexible towards the National Consumer Council and requiring the Government to assist the NCC as well. I hope the Minister will be able to respond positively. I beg to move.</p>

I shall speak to Amendment No. 83 and oppose the Questions that Clauses 20, 21 and 22 stand part of the Bill. This group of amendments contains both probing amendments and amendments which would make a valuable, substantive change to the functions of the National Consumer Council.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="06121848000003"></a>I read Clauses 20, 21 and 22 with some trepidation. While the principle of each clause seems positive, a closer reading of their provisions gives rise to concern. Clause 20 gives the National Consumer Council the power to &#147;co-operate ... and give assistance&#148;, while Clause 21 allows it to undertake &#147;voluntary activities&#148;. I cannot see why providing for the NCC to undertake voluntary activities should preclude it from co-operating and giving assistance. I would have thought that the one includes the other. In the light of the wide-ranging provisions of Clause 21, will the Minister explain why it is necessary to include Clause 20?</p>

<a name="61218-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="06121848000004"></a>Perhaps his explanation will touch on the real purpose of Clause 21. It is entitled &#147;Voluntary activities&#148;, yet the Explanatory Notes state:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="06121848000040"></a>&#147;This clause is intended to enable the Council to undertake paid work or other work for other persons&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="06121848000036"></a>Clause 21 enables the NCC to,</p>
<ul><a name="06121848000041"></a>&#147;make such charges as it thinks fit in respect of anything done in exercise of its powers under this section&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="06121848000037"></a>which is to say that the National Consumer Council can charge anybody for providing advice or assistance, research work undertaken&#151;or, most interestingly to me,</p>
<ul><a name="06121848000042"></a>&#147;in the exploitation of commercial opportunities arising from the activities it carries on in the exercise of its functions&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="06121848000005"></a>The clause stand part Questions are probing. I would not wish to curtail the healthy engagement of the NCC in business or prevent it making useful alliances with private businesses. Where private investment can lessen the use of public funding or where industry can sustain the NCC's work, providing it with an invaluable insight into the needs and wishes of consumers, I should be glad to see that arrangement working effectively. However, the wording of Clause 21 is alarming. In the context of the Government's record to date on appointments made to the Big Lottery Fund, as my noble friend Lord De Mauley illustrated earlier, and the possibility of using NDPBs as a useful arm of government for publicity, I am concerned that Clause 21(3) will be too wide. Under it, the NCC will be permitted to spend,</p>
<ul><a name="06121848000043"></a>&#147;such sums as it considers reasonable in the exploitation of commercial opportunities'.</ul>
<p><a name="06121848000038"></a>While it is important that the National Consumer Council is able to retain independence and autonomy of management, subsection (3) seems to provide an opportunity for extensive spending on advertising. I am concerned that such a close alliance with both government and the commercial world could change the NCC's current, non-partisan perspective. I should therefore be grateful if the Minister were to put on record exactly what the two clauses are intended to achieve and how they will contribute to the NCC&#146;s new status or maintain its current standards.</p>

<p><a name="06121848000006"></a>Amendment No. 83 provides a more detailed suggestion of how the actions of the NCC under Clause 21 could be more accountable.

I do not wish to curtail the independence of the NCC&#151;I do not believe that this amendment would do that&#151;but I wish to highlight the importance of ensuring that the functions of a body which is funded, even if in part, by the taxpayer and formally associated with the Government are transparent.</p>

Will the National Consumer Council have to petition the Secretary of State in order to change office buildings or expand and will the status of the new NCC&#146;s assets be available as public information? Clause 22(1) states that the National Consumer Council,</p>

We have entered the territory of what really is independence and what needs to be approved by the Secretary of State, who has quite some say in the tone of the National Consumer Council under Schedule 1 because he appoints the chairman. Therefore, no doubt he will be assured of the probity of the person he is appointing and, presumably, his or her judgement. How people are appointed and the terms of their reappointments, and so on, has a lot of bearing on a number of these so-called independent bodies, some of which are a lot more independent than others. The NCC, under the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, is probably very independent, knowing how independent-minded he is. Nevertheless, this needs further explanation from the Government.

<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC189"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column GC189</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Clause 20 provides the council with powers to make arrangements to co-operate with and give assistance to any person if that will facilitate the exercise of its own functions. The amendments are therefore not required.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="06121848000012"></a>The amendments to Clauses 17 to 22 relate to the other functions of the council. These amendments fall into two distinct parts. One category relates to the council&#146;s powers and how they affect the way in which it carries out its functions; another category relates to the Secretary of State&#146;s interactions with the council. On the issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, the whole point of the new NCC is that it will be at arm&#146;s length from the Government and therefore independent from it. The second category of amendments includes Amendments Nos. 69 and 71. In practice, it is likely that the Secretary of State will work closely with the council and, hence, these amendments will have no material effect.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="06121848000013"></a>Clause 19 requires the council to enter into co-operation agreements with certain named parties, and it provides power for the Secretary of State to make an order to designate additional parties for that purpose.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="06121848000014"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, spoke about Clause 20. It is important that this clause stands part of the Bill because it allows the council to co-operate with, or give assistance to, others in the course of exercising its own functions. It enables the council to co-operate with bodies of its own choosing outside the category of designated bodies with which it must enter into co-operation arrangements under Clause 19. The council would be able to take a view on which bodies it needed to work closely with in relation to progressing its functions. The nature, frequency and extent of co-operation would be a matter for the parties concerned, pitched at the right level to fit in with the pursuit of the council&#146;s own interests and the assistance that it can offer others.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="06121848000015"></a>Likewise, Clause 21 provides the council with the power to carry out commissioned work in any areas where it has skill, experience or expertise. This clause must stand part of the Bill because it enables the council to give advice or assistance to others and be paid for providing that service. I hope that the noble Baroness is in favour of that principle. This provision is intended to give the council the power to participate in voluntary activities of its own choosing and to receive remuneration for the services provided. Amendment No. 83 would require the prior approval of the Secretary of State before the council could acquire an interest in a body corporate for the purposes of exercising functions of the council under Clause 21. I do not consider these steps to be necessary and therefore am unable to accept the amendment. I should also mention that the annual report and accounts and so on of the NCC will be published and audited.</p>

<a name="61218-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="06121848000016"></a>Clause 22 provides the council with the supplementary powers that it needs in exercising its functions, and this clause must stand part of the Bill. It gives the council the power to do whatever is

For example, it enables the council to enter into general contracts for administration and other related issues. Amendment No. 86 would therefore have no effect. For the reasons I have given, I resist the amendments and stress that Clauses 20, 21, and 22 should stand part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="06121825000021"></a><b><a name="61218-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="06121825000449"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord Drayson):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="06121825000022"></a>In March 2006 I announced to the House that following a number of developments, primarily the decision to extend the depth repair programme for the FV430 fleet of armoured vehicles, the previously contemplated rationalisation of four of ABRO's business units, including the closure of ABRO's armoured vehicle facility at Donnington, would need to be reconsidered.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="06121825000023"></a>Further work has reinforced the decision I made in March. A major rationalisation of ABRO's operational capacity and capability on the scale previously contemplated (including closure of the Donnington armoured vehicle facility) is not likely to be required in the short to medium-term because of the volumes of repair, upgrade, maintenance and overhaul work. The market in which ABRO operates will continue to evolve in the medium to longer-term, in line with the demands of the military customers and the potential introduction of new arrangements for supporting land-based military equipment.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="06121825000024"></a>The Government remain committed to modernising our Armed Forces. To this end, we must continually look for more efficient support solutions to enable us to invest more resource to support our men and women at the front line. To enhance the future prospects of the organisation, ABRO, like all providers of equipment support, will therefore need to build on the improvements it has already made to its efficiency and effectiveness, in particular to the infrastructure supporting its operational capacity and capability. I have asked ABRO to pursue these further improvements with renewed vigour.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="06121825000025"></a>ABRO expects to announce plans to deliver this objective during the early part of 2007. Where required, ABRO will of course consult staff and trades unions about any changes impacting staff.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="06121825000028"></a>The Companies Act 2006, which received Royal Assent on 8 November 2006, will bring major benefits to business by modernising and simplifying company law. The noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, made a Statement to the House of Lords on 2 November 2006 in which he explained that it is our intention to commence all parts of the Act by October 2008. As part of our implementation of the Act, I intend to commence some provisions early next year.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="06121825000029"></a>With effect from 1 January 2007, I intend to commence provisions in the Act relating to changes to the first company law directive. These changes are in large part designed to ensure increased facilities for e-communications with the national registrar of companies. With effect from 20 January 2007, I intend to commence the following provisions linked to implementation of the transparency obligations directive:</p>
the provisions on company communications to shareholders and others, which include provisions facilitating electronic communication;provisions concerning a public company's right to investigate who has an interest in its shares; andSection 463, which sets out a statutory basis of directors' liability to the company in relation to the directors&#146; report (including the business review) and the directors&#146; remuneration report.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="06121825000030"></a>I also intend to commence all powers to make orders or regulations by statutory instrument with effect from 20 January 2007. I intend to commence some self-contained provisions of the Act from 6 April 2007, including:</p>
the provisions in Part 28 of the Act implementing the takeovers directive;provisions extending the community interest company regime to Northern Ireland; andSection 1281, which amends Part 9 of the Enterprise Act 2002 to enable public authorities, in certain circumstances, to disclose information where the information is to be used in civil proceedings or otherwise for the purpose of establishing, enforcing or defending legal rights.
<a name="61218-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="06121825000031"></a>I also intend to repeal the following free-standing provisions of the Companies Act 1985 with effect from 6 April 2007:</p>
Section 41 (authentication of documents);Sections 293 and 294 (provisions relating to directors aged 70 and over in public companies or private companies which are subsidiaries of public companies);

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="06121825000032"></a>I also intend to commence the provisions about fees payable to Companies House under the new Act. The provisions about fees under the old Act will still remain in force until all the repeals of provisions in that Act have been brought into force.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="06121825000033"></a>The Government consulted in August on the application of the Companies Act 2006 to existing companies. The consultation focused on a number of difficult transitional issues affecting company constitutions, which will arise for existing companies when the Act is commenced. I am today publishing a summary of the responses and the Government's conclusions, together with the individual responses where respondents have given their consent for their full response to be made public. We will consult in February 2007 on the policy issues related to secondary legislation which will need to be made under the Act, and on further transitional issues.</p>

This confirms the commitment given by the Prime Minister on 6 December 2006.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="06121825000035"></a>Section 1 will make the breach of civil orders made under the Family Law Act 1996 a criminal offence punishable by up to five years&#146; imprisonment. The Family Law Act 1996 provides victims with the non-molestation order and the occupation order. Victims can apply to a court for a non-molestation order to forbid someone using or threatening violence and/or harassing, pestering or intimidating them. Victims can also apply for an occupation order to enforce their entitlement to remain in occupation of the home, make the respondent leave the home, or regulate the occupation by both parties.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="06121825000036"></a>Section 12 extends the powers on restraining orders under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 to cover all violent offences. It also provides the courts with the power to make an order where a person is charged, pending trial, or where a person is not convicted but the court considers that it is necessary to make an order to protect the victim. The benefit is that a court may make a restraining order even if a defendant has been acquitted of other charges but the court considers there is sufficient evidence of harassment that it is necessary to protect a person from harassment by the defendant.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="06121825000037"></a>Both of these measures will significantly strengthen the suite of measures available to courts. Earlier measures already introduced included:</p>
Making common assault an arrestable offence so that a police officer may arrest without a warrant under Section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. This provided the police with significant extra powers in respect of domestic violence and violent offences generally.Amending the eligibility criteria in the Family Law Act so that same-sex relationships are treated in the same way and to offer the same level of protection to people in relationships who are not living together.<a name="wms_subhd_4"></a>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="06121825000052"></a>The Government are committed to improving access and engagement in the democratic process. Increased registration is one way to achieve this. Some 3.5 million people entitled to vote are not registered. We have therefore commenced provisions that allow anonymous registration for a person who believes that having their name and address on the register would put at risk the safety of themselves, or others in their household. In addition, people will now be able to register 11 days before the poll, whereas in the past the deadline was between six and eight weeks before the poll.</p>

At elections, postal voters must provide these identifiers on their postal voting statement when they cast their vote. The Government believe this, along with the introduction of new election offences, represents a comprehensive set of legislative changes that will improve confidence in the electoral system.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="06121825000055"></a>I have today granted consents under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 for the construction and operation of the Thanet and London Array offshore wind farms.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="06121825000056"></a>The consents have been granted to Thanet Offshore Wind Ltd (a subsidiary of Warwick Energy) and London Array Ltd, a consortium comprising Shell Wind Energy, E-on Renewables UK and Core Energy (itself comprising Farm Energy and DONG).

I was also aware that the developers have made changes to the proposed works in order to provide further mitigation for some of the potential impacts.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="06121825000059"></a>The Justice and Home Affairs Council was held on 4 to 5 December 2006 in Brussels. The Home Secretary, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, and I attended on behalf of the UK.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="06121825000060"></a>The Finnish presidency opened the council with the &#147;A&#148; points list which was approved. These included general approaches on taking account of convictions in new criminal proceedings (an important measure that requires member states to ensure that judges can take into account previous convictions in other member states&#151;when, for example, sentencing&#151;in the same way that they would take into account previous domestic convictions) and the draft Council regulation (a measure that applies only to Schengen member states) listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of member states.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="06121825000061"></a>The presidency presented its draft conclusions on the Hague programme review. Discussion focused on two elements of the conclusions: the passerelle and the wording with regard to the assessment of progress made in the areas of criminal and judicial co-operation. On the passerelle, there was robust discussion with some member states seeking to have reflected in the text the need for further work to explore the possibilities in the passerelle and a reference to the constitutional treaty. The UK opposed these suggestions strongly, noting that the majority of member states were against further work on the passerelle. The Home Secretary made clear additionally that there should not be any link to the constitutional treaty and that, given the limited support for the proposed use of the passerelle, the current debate should be regarded as over. A number of other member states joined in opposing reference to possible European Council discussion of the passerelle. The final text states that, &#147;the subject of decision making would remain under consideration by the Council [i.e. the JHA Council]. This would be brought to the attention of the European Council in December&#148;.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="06121825000062"></a>On the Hague programme review more generally, the agreed conclusions reflect the UK views that proposals or initiatives for new instruments at EU level should be based on a rigorous assessment of their potential impact and welcomes the progress made in implementing the programme to date.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="06121825000063"></a>The council reached political agreement on the regulation establishing the Fundamental Rights Agency on a basis that avoids any formal extension of the agency's remit to the areas covered by Title VI and any reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the operative part of the regulation. Both of these elements were essential to enable the UK to agree the regulation. The text of the regulation will be formally adopted at a council in January 2007. The

<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="06121825000064"></a>No agreement was reached on the Prisoner Transfer Framework Decision. The presidency, with the support of the UK and a number of delegations, pushed hard for agreement on the latest text on the basis that it represented a compromise package for all. However, one member state maintained that the text did not go far enough to meet its concerns about the need for prisoner consent and the right of the executing state to determine whether transfer to its territory would facilitate social rehabilitation. Work will continue in the council on the outstanding issues.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="06121825000065"></a>The presidency asked whether the council wished to pursue work on a binding framework decision on procedural rights in criminal proceedings, pointing out that it and a non-binding resolution on practical measures (which had been put forward by six member states) were not mutually exclusive. Several member states, including the UK, preferred the non-binding text, arguing that the framework decision added no value for the citizen and created legal uncertainty. A large majority of member states were in favour of a binding instrument or prepared to be flexible. However, within the majority there was disagreement on whether a binding text should contain explicit derogations so as to protect national law. The issue would be taken up by the German presidency who are making it a priority of their presidency to reach agreement on a binding text.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="06121825000066"></a>Commissioner Frattini presented the Commission's communications on the global approach to migration and reinforcement of the southern maritime border. These were welcomed by the council, though it was noted that there was more that needed to be done. The UK introduced a paper on behalf of the G6 and underlined our wish for succinct, practically focused conclusions from the European Council. Work needed to be done to build partnerships with third countries and effectively planning the management of the southern maritime border.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="06121825000067"></a>The second-generation Schengen evaluation system (SIS II) and interim solution to connect the new member states to SIS I (SISOne4All) were discussed at length. A majority of member states wished to proceed with SISOne4All given their view that the political implications of delaying the lifting of internal borders were serious. The UK stressed its support for measures to allow the new member states to join the Schengen area as soon as possible, but also reiterated its concerns about costs, timetable and technical feasibility. The presidency proposed a compromise text on the basis that only those member states connected to SIS I would be liable for the extra costs resulting from the extension of the network, thereby excluding the UK and some other states from liability. The council conclusions were agreed on this basis.</p>

This represented a major move towards the UK position. Community finance would have remained within the scope of the instrument for the transport of civil protection assistance to disasters inside and outside of the EU provided the member state sending the assistance met 50 per cent of the costs. The amount of Community expenditure available for transport would also have been capped at 60 per cent of the total spend available through the instrument. There was support for this proposal from most other delegations. However the UK was not prepared to agree the instrument at the council on this basis. The presidency agreed to send the item back to COREPER for further discussion. Following a further concession to the UK whereby the maximum amount of Community expenditure available for transport was lowered to 50 per cent, agreement was reached at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 11 December.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="06121825000070"></a>The EU counter-terrorism co-ordinator presented a stock-take report which noted good progress on developing EU counter-terrorism legislation, secure intelligence analyses from the EU's Situation Centre and international co-operation. The report also identified shortcomings identified in implementing the legislation and in national capabilities to respond to attacks. As such, it may be useful to note that the EU has recently begun to develop initiatives in the field of combating radiological and biological terrorism. The UK has been closely involved with this work since its inception, lending our considerable expertise in this field, and ensuring that this work progresses in a manner that adds value at the European level and is not detrimental to UK interests.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="06121825000071"></a>The presidency presented a progress report on the strategy for the external dimension of JHA, which had been agreed under the UK's presidency. It was noted that implementation of the strategy was progressing, but that more time would be needed before a full evaluation of results would be possible.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="06121825000072"></a>There were a number of AOB items: the European evidence warrant should be adopted early in the German presidency; European contract law, during which the Commission stressed that the project concerned better law-making, not a European code of contract law; progress on the Pr1/4m Treaty was noted and the German presidency indicated that it intended to attach priority to bringing the treaty into the EU acquis during its presidency.

There was a brief exchange of views on violent video games where the Home Secretary emphasised the need to protect children, and others, from violent material and set out the UK's specific concerns about extreme pornographic material. Domestically the UK is proposing to make illegal the possession of a limited range of violent and extreme pornographic material and would like other member states to consider how they control

The Home Secretary urged that this work be taken forward under the German presidency. Judge Vassilios Skouris, president of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), gave a presentation on the ECJ's proposals for accelerated procedures for handling cases in the area of freedom, security and justice. Lunch items on day 2 included a presentation by Michel Barnier, diplomatic adviser to Nicolas Sarkozy, on disaster response and a presentation by Kristiina Kangaspunta, chief of the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit in the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, followed by discussion of the EU action plan to combat human trafficking.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="06121825000075"></a>I represented the United Kingdom at the Telecoms Council in Brussels, on the morning of 11 December 2006. The council began with the presidency asking member states to approve the council resolution for a strategy for a secure information society in Europe. The resolution concentrates specifically on trust and security in the ubiquitous information society of tomorrow. There was a brief endorsement from the Commission after which three remaining linguistic and scrutiny reserves were lifted without discussion.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="06121825000076"></a>The presidency then presented its paper on the progress made in the council concerning the Commission proposal for a regulation on roaming on public mobile networks within the Community. In my intervention I welcomed this proposal, agreeing that there is definitely a need for control of wholesale and retail prices, but expressed my concern at the Commission's proposed course of action to achieve this reduction. I along with several other member states proposed the introduction of a sunrise clause on the imposition of an average (rather than maximum) retail cap. This would result in the best deal for consumers in terms of sustainable lower roaming prices, competition in the marketplace and continued innovation in the packages offered. I also referred to a co-authored UK and French paper setting out principles on how we believe the regulation should be structured (attached at Annexe A). I am pleased to report that the UK/French approach received considerable support.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="06121825000077"></a>The presidency concluded the discussion by emphasising the good progress that had been made on the dossier that would now pass to the German presidency for a conclusion before the summer.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="06121825000078"></a>Discussions then turned to the agenda items listed under any other business. The first of these was a presentation by the Finnish presidency on the i2010 conference, which it held in September. This was followed by an update on discussions that took place at the internet governance forum in October. As both of these presentations were fundamentally feedback on past events I did not intervene.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="06121825000079"></a>Commissioner Reding then made a brief request to member states to sign the memorandum of understanding on eCall. ECall is an automated emergency call system which is able to report traffic accidents from the vehicles involved in the crash which in turn could improve the emergency services&#146; response time. The Government are yet to decide whether to sign the MOU. This is a DfT lead, on which I understand the House has received one Explanatory Memorandum (EM 1238/05 COM2005431 FINAL) and will shortly receive a supplementary EM (EM15932/06 COM2006723 FINAL).</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="06121825000080"></a>The fourth and final item under AOB was an update on the debate about &#147;116&#148;, on the request of the French (this was a last-minute addition to the agenda). &#147;116&#148; is a draft decision from the Commission requesting all member states to allocate numbers (116 XXX) for pan-European services of societal value. In my intervention I agreed with the Commission on the importance of this service and supported the French proposal that one of these numbers, when the decision is adopted, (116 000) should be reserved for a hotline for reporting missing children. I concluded my intervention by affirming the United Kingdom's commitment to do everything that we can to take this initiative forward.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="06121825000081"></a>On conclusion of discussions on telecoms issues, Commissioner McCreevy, the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services, presented the third postal services directive. The directive proposes the full accomplishment of the internal market for Community postal services through the removal or reduction of obstacles that hinder the functioning of the internal market. I along with several other member states supported the Commission's proposal and highlighted the benefits that we have experienced in the UK, such as choice of provider, better service quality and improved value for money, following the liberalisation of our postal market at the beginning of this year.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="06121825000089"></a>The Commission gave a further report on progress in the PPP concession contract negotiations on the Galileo satellite navigation programme. It is keen to ensure that the main elements of the concession contract are in place by early 2007; was hopeful that the financial regulation setting out the financial and legal commitments for the public sector over the 20-year period of the concession contract could be finalised by autumn 2007; and expected that final signature of the concession contract could then take place by the end of 2007. I urged that the Commission ensure sufficient information is made available to the March transport council so that some preparatory work could be carried out before the important decisions that will need to be taken at the later June council. I underlined again the civil nature of the project, and called for better information for the council on economic returns versus cost.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="06121825000090"></a>The Commission announced that it would shortly issue a paper setting out its recommendations on future relations with non-EU countries in the Galileo programme.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="06121825000091"></a>Over lunch Ministers discussed the member states&#146; bids for location of the Galileo Supervisory Authority (GSA). The UK's bid is for Cardiff and I spoke in favour of it. There are 10 other bids: from Greece, Spain, Belgium, Slovenia, Malta, Germany, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Italy and France. The presidency noted that all 11 bids met the criteria it had drawn up. It was not possible to reach a conclusion, so the Finnish presidency remitted the issue to the incoming German presidency.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_9"></a>
<a name="06121825000100"></a><b><a name="61218-wms0002.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="06121825000458"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My right honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a><a name="06121825000101"></a>I have today issued a consultation document on <I>The application of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive to &#145;stalled&#146; reviews of old mineral permissions and periodic reviews of mineral permissions in England</I>. This seeks comments on proposals for amending regulations relating to England to deal, first, with initial reviews of old mineral planning permissions which are undetermined and so &#147;stalled&#148; for want of environmental information. Secondly, comments are sought on proposals to apply sanctions to make the application of the environmental impact assessment Directive to all reviews of mineral planning permissions as effective as possible. Similar amending regulations are being proposed in relation to Wales.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a><a name="06121825000102"></a>The proposed regulations would put beyond doubt that the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) (England and Wales) Regulations 1999, as amended by the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) (England and Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2000 (the 2000 regulations)&#151;which include a sanction of suspension of operations for failing to provide the necessary environmental information&#151;apply to stalled applications for initial reviews of old mineral permissions. These applications were submitted before the 2000 regulations came into force, and some have not been determined because necessary environmental information has not been provided.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a><a name="06121825000103"></a>Many mineral sites are operating under permissions granted many years ago which contained few, if any, conditions to mitigate the impact of mineral extraction. Uniquely within the planning system, legislation was introduced in the 1990s to review and update to modern environmental standards these old permissions which can last for many decades and to regularly review all mineral permissions. At that time, it was assumed that, because the reviews did not grant consent but merely updated mineral operating conditions, there was no need to apply the environmental impact assessment directive. However, subsequent court judgments established that conditions reviews did constitute &#147;development consent&#148; as defined in the directive, which had not, therefore, been fully transposed. Consequently, the 2000 regulations were introduced to apply the environmental impact assessment directive to these reviews.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_73"></a><a name="06121825000104"></a>Guidance issued with the regulations advised that they applied only to applications for review made after the 2000 regulations came into force on 15 November 2000. Operators of sites with applications for initial review which had not been determined by that date were asked to submit any necessary environmental information voluntarily. Most did so. But there are around 40 such applications in England which are &#147;stalled&#148; for a variety of reasons, including some where operators are refusing to provide

There is currently no sanction to encourage them to do so and at active sites operations can continue under the terms of the original permissions with little or no mitigation of the environmental impacts.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_74"></a><a name="06121825000105"></a>Subject to consultation comments, the proposed amending regulations would apply the sanction of suspension for continuing failure to provide the necessary environmental information and so help to conclude these reviews and bring operations up to modern standards.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_75"></a><a name="06121825000106"></a>The consultation paper also proposes further sanctions to apply to all reviews of mineral permissions for failure to provide necessary environmental information. These are:</p>
automatic suspension of operations if additional environmental information required to enable a determination of whether a review requires an environmental impact assessment is not provided;a requirement for mineral planning authorities to consider making suspension orders to secure environmental remediation where operations have been automatically suspended for a period of 12 months without provision of outstanding environmental information; anda requirement for mineral planning authorities to make orders prohibiting resumption of mineral working where operations have been automatically suspended for two years without provision of outstanding environmental information.
<a name="61218-wms0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a><a name="06121825000107"></a>Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The paper is also available on the Communities and Local Government website at http://www.communities.gov.uk/index. asp?id=1505253. The consultation period ends on 12 March 2007.</p>

By the time of the October Statement the coroner had provided us with details of outstanding inquests into six deaths from previous conflicts or other military exercises abroad and three further civilian casualties, the earliest of which occurred in 1998. The position in relation to the inquests in these additional deaths was reported to the House in the October Statement.

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_383"></a><a name="06121825000418"></a>In April 2007 the independent mental capacity advocates (IMCA) and some directly related elements of the legislation to support it, the code of practice to provide guidance, and the criminal offence of ill treatment and wilful neglect will be in place. In Wales, the Assembly's Minister for Health and Social Services will very shortly be determining the date of commencement of the IMCA service in the light of this Statement.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_384"></a><a name="06121825000419"></a>From October 2007 the new Court of Protection, Public Guardian and the Office of the Public Guardian will become operational for England and Wales. This will ensure adequate time to train the many civil servants and professionals affected by the Act and the very important changes that it brings. Lasting powers of attorney will also begin operating from this time.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_14"></a>
<a name="06121825000420"></a><b><a name="61218-wms0004.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="06121825000463"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord Drayson):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Adam Ingram) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_385"></a><a name="06121825000421"></a>When I announced the settlement package for the Royal Irish (Home Service) on 9 March this year, I advised the House that a bespoke Royal Irish aftercare package would be provided to support former members of the UDR and the Royal Irish (Home Service) as well as their dependants.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_386"></a><a name="06121825000422"></a>I can announce today that we plan to maintain a publicly funded Royal Irish (Home Service) welfare organisation and, subject to trades union consultation on civilian staff appointments, will be recruiting the necessary personnel as soon as possible. The organisation will provide the vital interface needed between the regimental headquarters, ex-service personnel, their widows and their families.</p>




<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS229"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column WS229</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_387"></a><a name="06121825000423"></a>We recognise that the disbandment of the Royal Irish (Home Service) and the Civil Service redundancy programme associated with security normalisation will result in particular challenges for ex-Home Service personnel: this was fully recognised in the settlement package announced earlier this year. Full-time soldiers of the Royal Irish (Home Service) leaving as a result of disbandment will be eligible for the normal tri-service resettlement package (seven weeks&#146; graduated resettlement training time, &#163;534 towards costs), and fully funded access to the MoD's Career Transition Partnership (CTP) service for two years after discharge. Extended access to the CTP for a further five-year period is available through the Regular Forces Employment Association or Officers Association in cases of greater need.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_388"></a><a name="06121825000424"></a>In addition to these provisions, members of the Royal Irish (Home Service) discharged after 1 August 2005 will be eligible for a grant to fund further resettlement training. The Department for Employment and Learning, Northern Ireland has also agreed exceptionally to waive the qualification period of six months for entry to the &#147;New Deal&#148; programme for the Royal Irish (Home Service). This will allow immediate access to government-funded employment support. We will also be making additional provision for mental health and physical therapies to meet the particular needs of ex-Royal Irish (Home Service) and UDR personnel. Furthermore, we will be discussing with the trustees of the Royal Irish Benevolent Fund the need for some public support for the fund to take account of the disbandment of the Home Service element.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_389"></a><a name="06121825000425"></a>This package, worth in the region of &#163;2 million a year, reflects our commitment to treat the Home Service with fairness and dignity. We intend to ensure that it is kept under review to guarantee that it continues to meet the needs of ex-UDR and Royal Irish (Home Service) men and women, and their dependants, both as we move through this difficult period of change and in the longer term.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_15"></a>
<a name="06121825000426"></a><b><a name="61218-wms0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="06121825000464"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_390"></a><a name="06121825000427"></a>The department announced last week that it has started a competition to find an operator to run train services on the InterCity east coast main line from London to the north-east and Scotland.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_391"></a><a name="06121825000428"></a>We expect that a new operator will be in place in 12 to 18 months&#146; time. Until that date it has been agreed that the current operator, Great North Eastern Railway (GNER), will operate the franchise on the department's behalf under a temporary management contract. The agreement, which was announced to the Stock Exchange on 15 December, is backdated to 10 December 2006, the start of the current railway accounting period. Under this temporary contract,  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS230"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column WS230</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>GNER will continue to deliver train services and will help ensure a smooth transition to the winner of the franchise competition.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_392"></a><a name="06121825000429"></a>Most of the net worth of the company passed to the Government in addition and GNER will cover the department's costs of re-letting the franchise early. DfT has set GNER a challenging but achievable revenue target to incentivise a growth in the value of the franchise. If GNER beats this target it will earn a share of that success.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_393"></a><a name="06121825000430"></a>For passengers and staff the new contract will mean that services will operate as normal. All tickets are valid and passengers can continue to book and reserve seats in exactly the same way as today. This is in line with our intention in the rail White Paper of July 2004 that if an operator falls into financial difficulty it should expect to surrender the franchise. To renegotiate a contract would set a precedent that we are willing to bail out operators at extra cost to the taxpayer.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_394"></a><a name="06121825000431"></a>Companies interested in operating the services in the future are being asked for expressions of interest. My department is also consulting on the specification for the new franchise. Copies of that consultation have been placed in the House Library. It proposes that the current service levels are maintained and the additional Leeds half-hourly services are included. By ending the franchise early and putting this management contract in place we are protecting the interests of taxpayers, passengers and staff. It will ensure services continue to operate as normal.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_395"></a><a name="06121825000433"></a>In June, I announced that the first schemes to be considered for funding from the productivity strand of the Transport Innovation Fund fell into two priority themes which fitted with the key objective of supporting national productivity. We considered a number of strategic rail freight schemes which could improve the capacity and resilience of the strategic national freight distribution network. We also considered several strategic road network schemes involving improved traffic management techniques which could help to make the most of capacity at key pressure points.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_396"></a><a name="06121825000434"></a>I am pleased to confirm that after initial scrutiny a number of these schemes have shown they have strong potential to provide a significant benefit to national productivity and to demonstrate high value for money. These schemes would all fit well with Rod Eddington's recommendations to address the constraints of our congested and growing city catchments, key inter-urban corridors and international gateways.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_397"></a><a name="06121825000435"></a>My department will now be working with Network Rail to take forward work on the detailed case for TIF funding for the following rail freight schemes: the reinstatement of Olive Mount Chord at Liverpool (including Chat Moss); the Humber ports/Immingham  


<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS231"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column WS231</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>rail capacity enhancement; gauge and capacity enhancements from Peterborough to Nuneaton; and gauge enhancements from Southampton to the west coast main line near Birmingham. My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Transport, the Member for Glasgow, South has similarly agreed that work should be taken forward on the Gospel Oak to Barking line scheme, in which I have an interest. Particularly if some or all of these schemes were taken forward together, they would greatly enhance the capacity of the railway to move modern, larger containers that would otherwise have to move by road.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_398"></a><a name="06121825000436"></a>We will work with the Highways Agency to develop the case for TIF funding for the traffic management schemes on the Birmingham motorway box and the M62 (Leeds Bradford). We will also be asking the Highways Agency to do further work on the A14 traffic management scheme.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_399"></a><a name="06121825000437"></a>Consideration of TIF funding for some of these schemes will be dependent on confirmation of funding contributions from regional bodies and private sector beneficiaries. We will be making final decisions on the allocation of funding as these schemes develop and in the light of my department's detailed investment appraisal and business case scrutiny process.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_400"></a><a name="06121825000438"></a>There were three other prospective schemes: the A1, M1, M11 resilience; the Teesport/east coast main line rail-gauge enhancement; and A14 widening (Ellington to Fen Ditton) scheme.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_401"></a><a name="06121825000439"></a>No clear proposals were put forward for the A1, M1, M11 scheme and therefore it has not been taken through to the next stage of consideration. The A14 Ellington-to-Fen Ditton scheme is subject to further consultation and it would, therefore, be inappropriate for us to prejudge the outcome at this point. However, we do recognise the need to deliver this scheme as quickly as possible, subject to the outcome of the necessary consultation and statutory procedures.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_402"></a><a name="06121825000440"></a>The Teesport/east coast main line rail-gauge enhancement scheme fitted well with our strategic approach, but the scheme was not sufficiently developed to enable an accurate appraisal to take place. Network Rail has, however, been working with the Northern Way and other stakeholders to develop a wider northern &#147;W10 gauge&#148; strategy for routes to markets for the major northern ports, in which Teesport would be a key element. We look forward to seeing the outcome of this work.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_403"></a><a name="06121825000441"></a>Decisions have not yet been taken on the future criteria or method for allocating productivity TIF resources, but, subject to meeting the criteria, these schemes would be eligible and will be considered for future rounds of TIF funding.</p>

<notus-date day="18" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS232"></a><b>18 Dec 2006 : Column WS232</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_404"></a><a name="06121825000443"></a>Today I am announcing a package of funding of &#163;3 billion to improve local transport outside London. It builds on last year&#146;s settlement of &#163;1.6 billion to ensure that 122 local transport authorities, including the six passenger transport authorities, are allocated a total of &#163;8 billion over the five years of the local transport plan period. This capital funding is in addition to the &#163;3 billion made available in regional funding allocations for local authority major schemes and Highways Agency schemes of regional significance over the next four years. This is the first local transport settlement since local authorities reviewed the delivery of their first five-year plans and produced the final versions of their second five-year local transport plans.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_405"></a><a name="06121825000444"></a>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate local authorities on their good performance over the course of the first five-year plans. I have been very impressed with the improvement in delivery of transport services during this period. There has been sustained progress, for example, in reducing local road casualties and in the condition of many local roads. Authorities have made substantial investment to manage traffic more effectively and reduce its adverse impacts on residents, town centres and the environment more generally. In many areas, better infrastructure for buses, cyclists and pedestrians has been put in place and transport is making a contribution to more sustainable development and economic growth. Examples of local authority achievement throughout the country are highlighted in a recent report by Atkins which has been placed in the Library of the House and is also available at www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_localtrans/ documents/divisionhomepage/032393.hcsp.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_406"></a><a name="06121825000445"></a>Local authorities have also taken the opportunity to make substantial improvements in the quality of the provisional plans submitted last year. Some 21 authorities have been assessed as having produced excellent plans. Today&#146;s announcement clearly demonstrates our commitment to building on the successes already achieved.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_407"></a><a name="06121825000446"></a>Alongside this year's settlement we have also issued financial planning guidelines for a specific road safety grant set up as part of the move to integrate safety cameras into the wider road safety delivery process from 1 April 2007. This funding represents a long-term commitment to fund further improvements in road safety and provides local authorities and their partners with the flexibility to implement a locally agreed mix of road safety measures that will deliver the greatest reductions in road casualties in their area.</p>

<a name="61218-wms0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_408"></a><a name="06121825000447"></a>Details of the 2007-08 allocations and assessments made of authorities&#146; performance and a report on the delivery of the first local transport plans have been placed in the Library of the House and are also available at www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_localtrans /documents/divisionhomepage/032393.hcsp.</p>

The BCS questionnaires on sexual victimisation also collect information about the relationship between offenders and victims. The latest published results are reported in Home Office Online Report 12/06 (Finney, 2006). According to the 2004-05 BCS most women and men who had been victims of serious sexual assaults had been assaulted by people who they know rather than strangers. Altogether 11 per cent of females and 17 per cent of male victims of serious sexual assaults had been assaulted by a stranger.</p>

It clearly states that pupils should be taught: how uncertainties in scientific knowledge and scientific ideas change over time; the role of the scientific community in validating these changes; that variation within species can lead to evolutionary changes; and that similarities and differences between species can be measured and classified.</p>

It is up to the local SACREs (standing advisory councils on religious education) to set the syllabus for how this should be done. The department is currently working with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to communicate this message to schools.</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_67"></a>How much money, over and above the &#163;600 million package of financial support announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Budget Day 2006, will be devoted to meet his pledge of 25 October that &#147;every talented young sports star should have extra support to help them train and develop&#148;.

Government and UK Sport assess that there are now sufficient levels of funding in the performance system to 2012 to ensure that genuine world class talent is not lost to summer Olympic and Paralympic sports.</p>

<a name="61218w0006.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_579"></a><a name="06121826000759"></a>The national governing bodies (NGBs) of English non-Olympic sports receive funding from Sport England through their whole sport plans and will use a proportion of this to identify and support talented athletes. In addition, the Government's school sport strategy provides access to a range of non-Olympic sports, and talent in particular is supported through the gifted and talented scheme. Since 2003, over &#163;6.5 million has been invested in this scheme.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_580"></a><a name="06121826000760"></a>The talented athlete scholarship scheme (TASS) enables talented athletes to continue in their sport beyond the age of 16 while pursuing further or higher education. TASS 2012, a strand of the TASS programme, supports our most talented 12 to 18 year-olds in a variety of Olympic, Paralympic, non-Olympic and non-Paralympic sports. Between 2004 and 2008, the Government will have committed &#163; 17 million to TASS and TASS 2012.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_581"></a><a name="06121826000761"></a>Lastly, government funding extends to the advanced apprenticeship in sporting excellence programme, which is a structured national training and development route across all sports for young people who have the realistic potential to achieve  excellence in their sport and perform at the highest level. Up to &#163;15 million is being invested into this two-year programme.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_583"></a><a name="06121826000765"></a>The Government's school sport strategy provides access to a range of non-Olympic sports, and talent is supported through the gifted and talented scheme. Since 2003, over &#163;6.5 million has been invested in this scheme. The talented athlete scholarship scheme (TASS) enables talented athletes to continue in their sport beyond the age of 16 while pursuing further or higher education. TASS 2012, a strand of the TASS programme, supports our most talented 12 to 18 year-olds in a variety of Olympic, Paralympic, non-Olympic and non-Paralympic sports. Between 2004 and 2008, the Government will have committed &#163;17 million to TASS and TASS 2012.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_584"></a><a name="06121826000766"></a>Government funding also extends to the advanced apprenticeship in sporting excellence programme, which is a structured national training and development route across all sports for young people who have the realistic potential to achieve excellence in their sport and perform at the highest level. Up to &#163;15 million is being invested into this two-year programme.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_585"></a><a name="06121826000767"></a>The Government do not intend to ask the Central Council of Physical Recreation for a list of talented athletes, but would encourage it to share any information it has directly with the NGBs.</p>
