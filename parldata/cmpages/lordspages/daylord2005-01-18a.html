<p><a name="qn_0"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spopq0"></a><b> Baroness Perry of Southwark </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>Why they have changed their plans for the National Health Service University.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My Lords, the NHS is going through an unprecedented period of growth and improvement. As part of this, we remain committed to widening access to training and education for all NHS staff, the original purpose of the NHS University. We consider that that purpose can best be achieved through the new NHS Institute for Learning, Skills and Innovation, to integrate and strengthen the way we support people development, service improvement and technological innovation in the NHS.
</p>




<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Perry of Southwark: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Can he explain to the taxpayers and the 13 universities that were involved why the NHS University, which was launched with enormous fanfare and given a vice-chancellor designate fewer than two years ago and has since then spent &#163;50 million of taxpayers&#039; money, been turned down for the title of university by the Privy Council and failed to gain an adequate number of students, has now, it seems, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Warner, passed its sell-by date?
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the NHS University has made important progress since it was first conceived. We have a different interpretation of history, but that is not unusual between this side and the party opposite, particularly on the NHS. The university has provided education and training to thousands of NHS staff. However, because of the Government&#039;s success in developing a wide range of training and education opportunities that meet the needs of NHS staff, the situation has changed. The NHS University was primarily a provider; we are now moving to a situation where many of those other providers offer the training programmes that our NHS staff need. The role and situation have changed, so we are making the same <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_640"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 640</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

kind of changes&#151;as I understand from yesterday&#039;s James report announcement&#151;as the party opposite wants to make.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </b>   My Lords, why, on a point of interpretation, are the wards now being padlocked?
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I am not sure that that has much to do with the Question.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Howe: </b>   My Lords, as my noble friend said in her supplementary question, in its brief existence the NHS University has spent around &#163;50 million of taxpayers&#039; money. With that money, it set itself a target to have helped 100,000 people to receive educational and training opportunities by April 2005. Precisely how many people has the NHS University helped so far?
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, it is certainly in the area of tens of thousands of NHS staff. I shall write to the noble Lord with more precise figures.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Corbett of Castle Vale: </b>   My Lords, instead of carping about some minor administrative change in the health service, would we not be better thanking those employed in that service, who deliver a first-class service day in, day out, in improved hospitals, accident and emergency units and cancer units up and down the country?
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, my noble friend is right. I think that it is very uncomfortable for the party opposite that under this Government death rates from coronary heart disease and cancer have fallen by unprecedented levels due to the Government&#039;s investment in the NHS.
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Neuberger: </b>   My Lords, most people welcomed the idea of the NHS University when it was first mooted because it was particularly designed to help people to get access to education. What will happen under this new system, with the new organisation, NILSI, to ensure that the low-paid and least-skilled workers, to whom we are all grateful, now really get access to foundation courses, which they have not had thus far with the NHSU?
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, it is worth bearing in mind that, during the three years from April 2003, more than &#163;180 million will be invested in support of NHS learning accounts, NVQs, adult literacy and numeracy and language skills development. That will help the very people about whom the noble Baroness is concerned. Specifically between April 2003 and March 2004, 100,000 NHS staff accessed NHS learning accounts and undertook NVQ training for levels two and three.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   My Lords, may we take it from the Minister&#039;s conviction of the value of training and education for NHS staff that, first, there will be no reduction in the level of funding? Secondly, will it take <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_641"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 641</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

full advantage of the Government-created University for Industry, distance learning, colleges and higher education?
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, the health sector will of course take full advantage of all the opportunities available. The new NHS Knowledge and Skills Framework is a key part of the Agenda for Change programme. It will enable staff and managers to use joint personal development planning to identify development and career opportunities.
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, is the Minister aware&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   My Lords&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   I think it is our turn.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spmin1"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My Lords, my noble friend has taken two supplementary questions from the Opposition Benches and only one from these Benches.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </b>   I am sorry, my Lords. I could not hear my noble friend. In view of the laudable aim to develop training and education for many of our low-paid workers and people just starting in the health service in the way described, has my noble friend analysed the impact on those staff made by the Tory announcement of that party&#039;s intention to reduce funding for initiatives of this kind?
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, I am glad that my noble friend has raised the issue because I think that it is a very serious matter. By way of reminder, let me give the House a snippet from what the Conservative Party proposed yesterday in relation to the NHS University:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;It would transfer functions to another Department of Health body. It would restructure and simplify regulation of the NHS&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50118-01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>The fact that the NHS University is not even a regulated body seems to have escaped the James review. The review then sets out a series of totally unspecified proposals for saving money in this area, while we have set out very clearly in our review of arm&#039;s-length bodies precisely what we would do in merging the NHS University with NHS Modernisation Agency work and the new Innovation Centre. These are bean-counter proposals gone mad.
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew17"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, is it not a fact&#151;
</p>

</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew19"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   I am sorry, my Lords, but I think it is my turn. I have been waiting a long time to speak. Is it not a fact that the proposal for an NHS University was included in the 2001 Labour Party manifesto for that general election? Is it not therefore <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_642"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 642</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

rather strange that, having included it in a manifesto, given it a brief life, the Government are now killing it off before the next manifesto is published?
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew20"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   My Lords, as I have explained, when situations change, wise governments review their position. That is exactly what we are doing in this case.

<a name="50118-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Judd </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>What are their priorities for the intergovernmental conference to be hosted by Finland and Tanzania in February 2005 to prepare for an international arms trade treaty.
</p></ul>

<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="50118-01_spnew21"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, the Government are aware that a seminar in relation to a proposed arms trade treaty may be hosted by Tanzania in February. To date, however, we understand that formal invitations and the agenda have yet to be issued. It is therefore not possible now to establish what the probable results of the seminar will be. However, the Government are committed to pursuing the objective of an arms trade treaty, as announced by my right honourable friend Jack Straw on 30 September 2004. If we are invited to attend, we will continue this work at the seminar.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050118/text/50118-02.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="50118-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   My Lords, while thanking my noble friend for that encouraging reply, does she not agree that uncontrolled arms trafficking in unstable parts of the world is fuelling conflict, undermining human rights and encouraging violent crime? Is it not therefore essential to make an international arms treaty the priority that the Foreign Secretary has suggested it should be? Further, can she assure the House that both at the meeting of the G8 in this country and during our presidency of the European Union, we should put this issue very high on our agenda?
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="50118-02_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, I strongly agree with my noble friend&#039;s analysis of the terrible destruction that could be brought about by an unbridled arms race. We are the first G8 member, UN Security Council member and large defence exporter to give our committed support to an arms trade treaty. I hope that my noble friend will be encouraged when I say to him that we will use our presidency of the EU and our chair of the G8 this year to ensure that the arms trade treaty is taken up by as many countries as possible, and that negotiations should begin.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="50118-02_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </b>   My Lords, can the   noble Baroness give us an assurance that the Government will pay particular attention to bringing to a stop the sale of weapons and even landmines, still, to very sensitive areas like Aceh in Indonesia, Darfur, the DRC and all other trouble spots around the world? <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_643"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 643</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Without such initiatives before the troubles resume, we shall see continuing disruption and disaster. We have the power; will the Government do it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="50118-02_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, the Government are determined to lend their strongest support to the arms trade treaty. As the noble Baroness knows, only a month after the Government came to office in 1997, we decided to introduce national regulations to cover all applications for arms exports. That was the first time that this country had such regulations. A year later, during our first presidency of the EU, we established an arms treaty negotiation with other member countries based on that original set of national regulations. We are now looking at the arms trade treaty to see what can be done with other member states and with our international partners to make it a reality.
</p>




<p><a name="st_28"></a>
<a name="50118-02_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </b>   My Lords, do the Government perceive this treaty to be one mainly concerned with small arms and light weapons, or one covering the full spectrum of weaponry, given that the Government are concerned about indebtedness in developing countries? We all know that some of those debts have been incurred by previous regimes in the competition to acquire expensive, top-end weapons systems such as missiles and manned aircraft.
</p>




<p><a name="st_29"></a>
<a name="50118-02_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, although we are only at a very early stage of the ATT and therefore unable to go into the detail of what it will contain, we hope that it would be subject to future multilateral negotiations. At the moment there is no blueprint for what the treaty should look like, but in terms of its scope, we are not inclined to limit it to cover small arms and light weapons. So far as we are concerned, it would be preferable for the treaty to be as wide as possible&#151;at least for now.
</p>




<p><a name="st_30"></a>
<a name="50118-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Howell of Guildford: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that we all agree with the analysis of the noble Lord, Lord   Judd. Obviously small arms kill more people around the world every day than the bigger weapons systems, or weapons of mass destruction even. Exactly what kind of treaty are we working for? Will it include not only full weapons systems and manufactured weapons but also components? I understand that we have loosened our controls on the export of components which go to make up arms. Will the treaty be really comprehensive? Unless it is, of course, it will be about as useful as a water bucket full of holes.
</p>




<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="50118-02_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, we want the treaty to be as comprehensive as possible. I congratulate the noble Lord. I believe it is his birthday today. We want the treaty to be a legally binding set of rules on arms exports, with the objective of reducing, and ultimately eradicating, the irresponsible arms exports which fuel conflict and human rights abuses. As I have said, we do not have a blueprint; we are not going to pre-judge the negotiations with UN and EU countries on this. We are discussing the arms trade treaty with Finland, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_644"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 644</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

France, Russia, Germany and the Netherlands, and the Secretary of State will discuss it with China this week. Other countries in favour are Brazil, Cambodia, Mali, Macedonia, Kenya and Costa Rica. It is a very small group, but we shall work very hard this year to increase the list.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="50118-02_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </b>   My Lords, has the EU revised its code of conduct on arms control? If so, what is it?
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="50118-02_spnew9"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, the EU code of conduct is being revised at this moment. The state of play so far is that we would increase the scope of the code&#151;which, as I have said, has been in place since 1989&#151;to cover applications for brokering, transhipment and electronic technology transfer licences. It would also oblige member states to refuse export licences if they consider that there is a clear risk that the items covered by the licence could be used to commit serious violations of international human rights law.

</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_2"></a>Whether government and public sector purchasing of imported products, especially from developing countries, is based on fair-trading and ethical standards.

<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="50118-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport  (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </b>  My Lords, the Government are committed to supporting ethical trading wherever possible and through the Department for International Development they provide significant support to the Fairtrade Foundation&#039;s efforts in promoting the supply and marketing of Fairtrade products. Contracting authorities have to consider a range of factors&#151;EU procurement rules, value for money for the taxpayer, the authority&#039;s objectives and the subject and nature of the particular contract. Guidance on fair trade and public procurement is available on the Office of Government Commerce website.

<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="50118-02_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Hylton: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his helpful reply.

</p>

<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="50118-02_spnew12"></a><b> Baroness Rawlings: </b>   My Lords, have the Government any plans to expand the number of public sector imported goods covered by Fairtrade standards, keeping in mind, too, a fairer free trade policy?
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="50118-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, that is a balance which must be maintained. There is no restriction on the number of products, goods and services covered by Fairtrade purchasing arrangements. There is no restriction in the Office of Government Commerce guidance on these matters. Clearly the principles will be adopted wherever they are appropriate.
</p>




<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="50118-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Judd: </b>   My Lords, have the Government noticed the flourishing Fairtrade groups which are now active across the country and which are having considerable success in persuading local authorities and others to pass resolutions declaring their region of authority a Fairtrade area? Is this not again an example of the British people not only demanding with words but demonstrating by actions their commitment to international justice in trade? Is it not important therefore that the Government continue to do everything possible to demonstrate that they are at least as equally committed as local authorities across the country?
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="50118-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </b>   My Lords, it is exactly the right approach&#151;people in local areas should put pressure on public authorities to follow the guidance on ethical trading.

But the question goes a good deal wider than   that. In fact, the question of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, is an answer to the further question of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett.

difficult to set a target for purchasing Fairtrade products which did not also take account of the other considerations which have to be included in any purchasing decisions&#151;value for money for the taxpayer, the objectives and the subject and nature of the particular contract.

<a name="50118-03_spnew2"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord&#039;s question was about leadership by example.

There was a recent, very serious situation, where the standards were raised on 1 January and no training was in place until some interventions were made very late in the day. It could have damaged Fairtrade in developing countries very considerably. We could put this right for the future. Can the Minister give that undertaking?

However, training forms a very substantial part of the DfID budget. Indeed, DfID was under quite unjustified attack for spending &#163;697 million on consultants when in fact it was spending the money on training and research. I am sure that part of that research includes the matters to which the noble Baroness, Lady Chalker, refers.

disappointing reply that my noble friend Lord Newby received to the debate on Caribbean banana growers on Friday. It referred to fair trade as simply a niche market and seemed to dismiss it, rather than being aspirational and wishing to encourage it. That will no doubt greatly depress the very successful fair trade organisation that has been set up for Caribbean banana growers, on which they are working hard.

In order to work, they have to set up organisations of small producers in specific countries for their products. That is not done everywhere. It can be done for bananas; it can be done for coffee and tea. I see that it is being done for wine from Chile&#151;and very good wine it is, too. These are niche markets in comparison with the bulk of international trade, but they are none the worse for that.

As we have said in many responses to energy Questions, the overall diversity of sources of energy is vital, not just for security of supply but for the environment and many other matters. It is taken very seriously.

<p><a name="st_66"></a>
<a name="50118-04_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford </b>   moved Amendment No. 125ZA:
</p>

<a name="50118-04_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>Before Clause 63, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_0"></a><br>
   &quot;PRINCIPLE TO BE USED IN BY SECRETARY OF STATE IN EXERCISING POWERS

<br>
   In exercising any powers under Part 3 of this Act and Parts 2 and 3 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 (c. 31), the Secretary of State is to have regard to the principle that, in the organisation of secondary education, there shall be no extension of selection by ability&quot;.</p>



<p><a name="st_67"></a>The noble Baroness said: We are now moving on from Part 1 to Part 2 of the Bill. On Part 1, we discussed the Government&#039;s consultation paper entitled <i>A New Relationship with Schools</i>, which was about inspections and the new inspection framework. The document underlying Part 2 is no longer <i>A New Relationship with Schools</i>, but the five-year strategy document, published in July last year.
</p>

<a name="50118-04_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>We on these Benches are in agreement with a great deal of the Government&#039;s five-year strategy for education. We very much endorse the emphasis on early-years and extended schools. We like the emphasis on personalised education&#151;which some might call child-centred education if it were not a rather unfashionable phrase. However, personalised education&#151;which is the fashionable phrase these days&#151;is very much about child-centred education. We think it right that the child should be at the centre of the education provided for him.
</p>

<a name="50118-04_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>We endorse the proposals on 14-to-19 education and the need to consider very seriously the education and career paths for the 50 per cent who do not go on to higher education. We are also delighted to see the commitments to staff development and continuous professional development and to partnership between schools. Schools should work together within a community framework. That is part of the essential vision that we have for the way in which schools should work.

</p>

<a name="50118-04_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>Where we depart from the Government in their five-year strategy is on structural issues. In some senses, the Government seem to be putting forward contradictory messages. On the one hand, they are encouraging all kinds of new structures at the secondary level. They want what are currently called community secondary schools to move as quickly as possible towards foundation status with a degree of independence from local education authorities that they do not have at the moment. They are encouraging private promoters of schools to come in. In again viewing local education authorities as enablers rather than providers of education, they are encouraging more voluntary-aided schools and more academies.

</p>

<a name="50118-04_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>All those proposals envisage a situation in which there are many secondary schools, but that is not always applicable in rural areas. Moreover, they endorse the view that competition between schools helps to promote performance. It is that conflict between competition and collaboration that we find slightly odd, and indeed we are not the only ones to find it slightly odd. I notice that when the Bill was published the Labour chairman of the House <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_651"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 651</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of Commons Select Committee on Education and Skills   noted a degree of schizophrenia at the heart of government on these particular issues.
</p>

<a name="50118-04_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>As I say, we do not endorse the notion of setting secondary school against secondary school. We find it very interesting that the Government, who early on set their mantra as &quot;standards, not structures&quot;, have now shifted so totally and put so much emphasis on structure. We do not share their view that changing a structure can have the effect of changing performance; indeed we think it often has precisely the opposite effect&#151;that changing structures can destabilise already established structures and cause a good deal of time to be spent on unnecessary structural change at a time when more emphasis should be put on more important matters.

</p>

<a name="50118-04_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>Those are the underlying issues that we shall be looking at in Part 2: the changing structures and changing financial position of schools and the changing ways in which the Secretary of State will effect these changes in structures. Amendment No. 125ZA suggests that we should have a new clause before Clause 63 on the principle to be used by the Secretary of State in exercising his powers. It suggests that it would be helpful if the Secretary of State were to put into writing a commitment which he has already made on several occasions that there shall be no extension of selection by ability.
<a name="time_5"></a>
<a name="50118-04_time2"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50118-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>The amendment picks up the five-year strategy and the degree to which the Government are trying to face in two directions at once. Everyone admits that the current admissions system is a mess&#151;a point examined last year by the House of Commons Select Committee, which concluded that, in the current system, fairness is a matter of luck rather than a matter of course. In the conclusion to its report, the Select Committee stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;We believe that it is time for Ministers to engage in an informed debate about the role of selection in secondary education and its impact across the education system as a whole. The Government needs to explain how it reconciles its insistence that there will be no return to selection with its willingness to retain and increase selection where it already exists. Without an honest and robust engagement with this issue the Government&#039;s policy on selection will continue to appear <i>ad hoc</i> and without principle&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>We are trying to provide the Government with an honest and a robust statement so that they can answer that criticism from the Select Committee.

</p>

<a name="50118-04_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>The Government&#039;s response to the point, published before the Select Committee report, came in the five-year strategy itself. In his statement on the five-year strategy, the then Secretary of State, Mr Charles Clarke, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;Independence will be within a framework of fair admissions, full accountability and strong partnership. We will never return to a system based on selection of the few and rejection of the many. The strict national requirement for fair admissions will remain and we will not allow any extension of selection by ability&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 8/7/04; col. 1012.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>That is a commitment never to return to a system based on selection and it is repeated in the strategy at least five times. I therefore believe that one can regard it as something of a commitment by the Minister.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_652"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 652</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-04_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>The commitment is also on page 44 of the document, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;We will never return to a system based on selection of the few and rejection of the many; we will not abandon intervention in failing schools; and we will not cast aside our ambitious targets for schools to keep on improving. Independence will be within a framework of fair admissions, full accountability and strong partnerships that drive improvement&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-04_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>The Government have given that commitment in their five-year framework. As I say, the aim of the amendment is to enable them to put their promise into practice&#151;a chance perhaps for them to regain some of the public trust that seems to be eluding them so much at present.

</p>

<a name="50118-04_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>The implications of that are spelt out by someone who, although one of their own, is also one of the foremost critics of the Government&#039;s current policy. Regarding that commitment on admissions, Fiona Millar said last September, in an article in the <i>Education Guardian:</i>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;This would mean quietly dropping the idea that new independent state secondary schools could set their own admissions criteria. But it would reinforce rather than undermine other existing commitments to put schools at the heart of their communities. And it would help to smooth the transition between primary and secondary school, back up the Children&#039;s Bill proposals for the most vulnerable young people, and, crucially, enhance progress on standards for the most challenging pupils by giving them an entitlement to the schools that are currently the preserve of the most socially and academically desirable&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50118-04_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>The Government have made it clear that they are committed to their five-year strategy and to a policy of restructuring secondary education. As both the chairman of the House of Commons Select Committee and one of the Government&#039;s foremost commentators have pointed out, the commitment to fair selection should be a central plank in the planning of their third term. The Bill, which provides the framework for those developments, contains no mention of this issue. We believe that we are doing the Government a considerable service by moving the amendment, which would embody in the Bill the principle underpinning all the new developments that they propose. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_68"></a>
<a name="50118-05_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   This has somewhat taken on the nature of a Second Reading debate, so I shall try not to respond in kind, since we are in Committee. I shall answer the direct questions and the amendment.
</p>

<a name="50118-05_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>It has always been government policy that there should not be any extension of selection on the basis of academic ability. That is why new selection by academic ability is prohibited by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Only 164 grammar schools remain in England and none in Wales. Furthermore, the Secretary of State has little involvement in school organisation decisions. These are matters for local decision, either through the school organisation committee or the schools adjudicator. It is for local education authorities or the promoters of a school to publish proposals&#151;in the case of a secondary school, following a local competition.
</p>

<a name="50118-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>However, Clause 64 allows the Secretary of State to consent to local authorities bringing forward proposals without a competition being held. It would not be possible to publish proposals for a new <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_653"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 653</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

grammar school under this clause. Section 104 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 means that there can be no new grammar schools other than those that existed by 1997 and which have been designated as grammar schools by the Secretary of State. Similarly, new partial selection by ability is prohibited by Section 100 of the 1998 Act, unless it is fair banding, which is allowed under Section 101. We have also made it clear in schools&#039; capital guidance that the department will not provide funding for the expansion of grammar schools.
</p>

<a name="50118-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>I do not need to give undertakings from this Dispatch Box on the Government&#039;s policy in respect of the amendment since it is already made explicit in legislation. I welcome the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, for much, if not all, of the five-year strategy. The issue is about promoting parental choice so that parents have more ability to choose what they think is in the interests of their children to obtain a good education in their area. It is also about developing a new relationship with schools, which seeks to free them from unnecessary controls, to give them more control over their resources and to hold them accountable for the results and the outcomes that they achieve. There is much evidence to say that that philosophy of how you stimulate the performance of public or private sector organisations is a better mechanism than seeking to control input mechanisms and detail.
</p>

<a name="50118-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>I hope that I have made the matter clear and put the mind of the noble Baroness to rest. There is no intention to reintroduce selection by ability&#151;and statute makes that clear.
</p>




<p><a name="st_69"></a>
<a name="50118-05_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I thank the Minister for his reply. I clearly stated that the Government&#039;s position was written five times in the five-year strategy and that they had no intention of extending selection by ability. The purpose of the amendment was to enable the Government to put that within the context of this Bill, because there is the potential in some of the new structures that they are establishing for some schools with greater independence to introduce some element of selection by ability. I proposed the amendment to ensure that that would not be the case.
</p>

<a name="50118-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>I do not apologise for making something of a Second Reading speech because we are moving from Part 1, which dealt with inspection, to Part 2, which deals with the changing structures in secondary education. As we move on, it is useful to set the general context in which our discussions take place. It is useful for noble Lords to recognise that the Bill makes substantial changes to the way in which new secondary schools may be set up. It is possible that that they might have greater independence over who they select and who they do not. In many ways, I do not feel that the Minister&#039;s response was particularly helpful.
</p>

<a name="50118-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>Perhaps I will return to this matter on Report, but, meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>Page 37, line 28, leave out subsections (3) and (4).</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>




<p><a name="st_71"></a>The noble Baroness said: Clause 63 amends Section 28 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, which set up the current system for considering proposals for both the closure and promotion of new schools, by   the establishment of a schools organisation committee&#151;a statutory sub-committee of a local education authority to consider proposals and make decisions for either the closure of a school or the promotion of a new one&#151;and the use of the schools adjudicator to rule in disputed decisions.
</p>

<a name="50118-05_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>Section 28 currently provides the statutory basis for the LEA to propose new community or foundation schools and allows, as a result of amendments passed in the Education Act 2002, other promoters to propose the establishment of new foundation or voluntary schools.
</p>

<a name="50118-05_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>Clause 63 would effectively nullify all of that. It stops Section 28 being used by the LEA or other   promoters to propose a new secondary school. Clauses 64 and 65 provide the new machinery and redefine the concept of a middle school, so that those which include a year 11 class&#151;the GCSE class&#151;are included within the competition for new secondary schools proposed in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50118-05_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>The purpose of the amendment is, first, to ask the Minister whether our understanding is correct. Am I right to say that Clause 63(3)(2A) will stop Section 28 being used as a means of proposing new schools? Secondly, I wish to probe this shift in the definition of middle schools. Why are the Government making this move? Why do they wish such middle schools to be included within the framework of their structural proposals? I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>The aim of this part is to extend the requirement for local authorities to invite promoters to come forward with proposals to establish new schools, so that the requirement applies whenever statutory proposals are required to establish a new secondary school. Local authorities are currently required to invite proposals, under Section 70 of the Education Act 2002, only when a new secondary school does not replace an existing school&#151;that is for an &quot;additional&quot; secondary school.
</p>

<a name="50118-05_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>In a number of circumstances, the Secretary of State will be able to disapply the requirement on local authorities to invite proposals. This is intended to allow flexibility for the particular requirements of local circumstances. The Secretary of State would currently decide proposals for additional schools. Under the new provisions, all proposals will be decided by the local school organisation committee or the schools adjudicator.

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a>The policy will inject more choice into the system, encourage new providers, including charitable or community groups, to act as promoters of schools and will lead to a more diverse range of schools. We wish to see the creation of more schools that have a distinctive ethos and sense of identity and deliver a better quality education in tune with the wishes and aspirations of parents and communities.
<a name="time_6"></a>
<a name="50118-05_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50118-05_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>The policy forms part of the five-year strategy, which envisages a new role for local authorities as the commissioners of educational services, rather than direct providers. Where a local authority decides that a secondary school is required, different providers should normally be given the opportunity to come forward with proposals to establish a school. Local people will then have the opportunity to express views about the options, rather than about a single option. When deciding which proposals to approve, the school organisation committee or the adjudicator must take account of local people&#039;s views.
</p>

<a name="50118-05_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>I understand the wish of the noble Baroness to probe the amendments that this clause makes to Section 28 of the 1998 Act. Clause 63 modifies the existing provisions in respect of statutory proposals for new schools so that only proposals for primary schools, or middle schools where the upper age is not at least 16, may be published by local authorities and promoters under existing provisions; in other words, primary schools and middle schools where the upper age is not 16 are not caught by the provisions. It is complementary to Clauses 64 and 65, which contain provisions detailing the conditions under which proposals for new secondary schools may be published.
</p>

<a name="50118-05_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>The effect is as follows. They include in the definition of a secondary school, for the purposes of school organisation legislation, any middle school catering for children of 16 and upwards. The legal definition of a middle school is that it must cater both for children below the age of 10 years and six months and for those above the age of 12 years. A middle school may be deemed to be primary or secondary, depending on the age range of the pupils. That definition is contained in Section 5(3) of the 1996 Act.
</p>

<a name="50118-05_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>The definition of the term &quot;secondary school&quot; is intended to capture middle schools which are &quot;all-through&quot; schools; that is, schools catering for the full secondary age range plus primary pupils. That seeks to answer the question posed by the noble Baroness, Lady   Sharp, about why they were included. Effectively, they are teaching secondary-age school pupils, and the policy is focused on them. The effect of the amendment in the wider context of the Bill is to provide for local authorities to invite proposals when they wish to establish all-through schools.
</p>

<a name="50118-05_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>That is the only effect of the amendments to Section 28 of the 1998 Act. Local authorities and others will continue to be free to publish proposals to establish, change or to discontinue middle schools that do not have an upper age range of 16 or more. It is not the Government&#039;s policy to promote the establishment of <br>&nbsp;<br>

all-through schools. We take a neutral view on that; that is for local education authorities. I hope that that has been helpful.

<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="50118-06_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I thank the Minister for his reply, but I am not sure that he replied to my question about why the definition of a middle school was being changed.
</p>




<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="50118-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   We are not generally changing the definition of middle schools. We are including in this part of the Bill for school competitions middle schools that have pupils of 16 or above and are, therefore, effectively teaching pupils of secondary school age. That is why they are included.
</p>




<p><a name="st_75"></a>
<a name="50118-06_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   Presumably, those schools were included under the School Standards and Framework Act. At that point, they were included as middle schools, and they were not part of the secondary school framework. I understand what the Minister is saying, and I thank him for his response.
</p>

<a name="50118-06_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>Clearly, as the Minister rightly indicated, Clause 63 is a prelude, in effect, to Clauses 64 and 65, on which we shall shortly have considerably more discussion. He has confirmed my understanding of the role of Clause 63 and, therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="50118-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
</p>

<a name="50118-06_para2"></a>

<a name="50118-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Clause 64 [<i>Publication of proposals with consent of Secretary of State</i>]:
</p>




<p><a name="st_76"></a>
<a name="50118-06_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford </b>   moved Amendment No. 125B:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>Page 38, line 13, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_1"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   When considering whether to grant consent to publish under subsection (2), the Secretary of State shall have regard to any representations made by the local education authority for the area in which the school is proposed, and any other local education authority likely to be affected by the proposal.&quot;

<p><a name="st_77"></a>The noble Baroness said: In this part of the Bill, which extends from Clause 63 to Clause 70, and in Schedules 10, 11 and 12, there are many instances where consent is to be granted by the Secretary of State or guidance or directions are to be issued by the Secretary of State. Clause 64(1), for example, says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;may with the consent of the Secretary of State&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>Clause 64(5) says:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a>&quot;guidance . . .  from . . .  the Secretary of State&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50118-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>Clause 65(6) says, &quot;Regulations may&quot;, and paragraph   4(4) of Schedule 10 says that the school organisation committee may be required,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;to have regard to any guidance  . . . from . . .  the Secretary of State&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>The aim of the three amendments is to ensure that, in taking decisions and in issuing guidance, the wider effect of those decisions is recognised. Amendment No. 125B says that the Secretary of State shall consider the impact of the reorganisation that is being proposed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_657"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 657</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

not only on schools in the local education authority area in which the school is located but in neighbouring local education authority areas.
</p>

<a name="50118-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>The Bill extends the circumstances in which new schools will be subject to competition. Under Clause   64, if local education authorities or promoters want to establish a new community, foundation or voluntary school without going to competition, they have to get the consent of the Secretary of State. This amendment establishes the principle that any proposal should be considered alongside existing planning arrangements for all local schools, avoiding unnecessary disruption of local schools and their communities.
</p>

<a name="50118-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>Amendment No. 126B inserts a new subsection:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;Before making any regulations under this section, or issuing any guidance under Schedule 10, the Secretary of State must consult such representatives of local government and such other persons (if any)&#151;as he considers appropriate&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50118-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>It would be subsection (7) to Clause 65. The amendment would require the Secretary of State to consult fully local   government and key stakeholders on regulations for school competitions. The amendment seeks a commitment from the Government that they will consult fully local government and other key stakeholders on the regulations for school competition. It is essential that the regulations recognise the complexity of school organisation and reorganisation.
</p>

<a name="50118-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>The extension of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 to cover the need for competition to include instances where, for example, two schools are being merged due to surplus places risks introducing planning blight into local systems. That may be the case, particularly where an authority is moving from a system of middle schools. Schools in a particular area are developed as part of a local strategic planning process, and schools should be seen as serving their local community. If some schools are to be allowed to expand, as is suggested in the DfES five-year strategy, inevitably other schools will lose places. The local authority has strategic responsibility to ensure that there are sufficient and appropriate places for all children.
</p>

<a name="50118-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>The final amendment in this group is Amendment No. 130A. This is a new clause to be included after Clause 69. It refers back to the whole of Part 2 and reinforces the point. The new clause states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;Before making any regulations or issuing any guidance under this Part, the Secretary of State must consult such representatives of local government and such other persons (if any) as he considers appropriate&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-06_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>The aim is to ensure that the complexities of school organisation and reorganisation are fully explored before being finalised in regulations and guidance. That will provide the opportunity to ensure that any requirements do not destabilise schools and their local communities. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_78"></a>
<a name="50118-06_spnew4"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </b>   I congratulate the Whips&#039; Office on the way this maze of amendments is grouped. I shall speak to Amendment No. 125B and to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_658"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 658</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Amendments Nos. 128 and 130. I am not clear whether it would be more helpful to do all that now or wait until later. My instinct is that I should get on with it.
</p>

<a name="50118-06_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>Questions about school organisation and rural schools touch closely on the work of the Church of England in education. A great many Church of England primary schools are rural. I believe that the majority of rural primary schools are Church of England schools, and I am not thinking just of the Isle of Wight. The Church of England is represented on each school organisation committee alongside a representative of the Roman Catholic Church, the local education authority, the school itself and, where post-16 proposals are envisaged, the local learning and skills council.

</p>

<a name="50118-06_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>On the whole, the system works well. The only fly in the ointment is the view of some local government lawyers that the Church of England representatives ought to declare an interest and not vote on issues affecting Church of England schools. That seems to me to be a misunderstanding of the very purpose of their presence, namely, to achieve the best for education locally from a specifically Church of England perspective. They are not there to be sectarian, but to represent a particular interest and ought to be free to do so.
</p>

<a name="50118-06_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>When the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was a Bill and being considered in this House, my predecessor but one as chairman of the Board of Education, Bishop David Young, then Bishop of Ripon, expressed himself content with the proposals about the school organisation committee. That enabled decisions on school organisation to be taken locally that previously would have been taken by officials in London.
</p>

<a name="50118-06_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>He was also content that, where the members of that committee could not agree, decisions would be made by an adjudicator. The then Opposition tempted him with   an amendment which would have prevented decisions about Church of England or Roman Catholic schools being referred to the adjudicator. He resisted temptation&#151;that is possible sometimes. Adjudicators have not always made the right decision from our point of view, but I support his resistance and take it as a lesson   in how we treat at least some tempting opposition and Lib-Dem amendments, or even government amendments.

</p>

<a name="50118-06_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>I apply the lesson to the question of rural schools. At first sight, it would seem to make sense that parents should have the final word on a rural school. More than most, I recognise the value to the rural community of a school, especially a Church school. Moreover, there are some really excellent, very small rural schools serving remote communities. They need to be preserved where at all possible despite the cost to the wider community of schools. Speaking for myself, we are in regular touch with the Isle of Wight County Council, for example.
</p>

<a name="50118-06_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>However, I am also aware of rural schools that in practice serve a local urban community much more than the rural community itself. Popular schools, often by no deliberate action of their own, can attract parents to drive sometimes extraordinary distances <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_659"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 659</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

out of towns. That is not always desirable from the point of view of the schools from which they are   driving away or even the   schools to which they are driving their children quite apart from the environmental cost. The school organisation committee and the adjudicators are between them the best people to make these very difficult decisions.
</p>

<a name="50118-06_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>Finally, I turn to the question of the Secretary of State&#039;s involvement in decisions about the publication of proposals for new schools. The Church of England is busily establishing new schools towards the target of 100 new secondary schools within the next three or four years. It was a target set us in 2001 by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. We are well on track.
</p>

<a name="50118-06_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>I understand the Government&#039;s purpose in Part 2 of the Bill to be an extension of diversity in the provision of schools. From these Benches we support that broad proposal. The Church of England and Church in Wales schools are part of the diverse educational system in Britain. It would be illogical if we were not to welcome other suitable providers of schools, especially among the faith communities.
</p>

<a name="50118-06_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>In this context I must briefly mention the speech made yesterday to the Hansard Society by Her Majesty&#039;s Chief Inspector. It was about teaching citizenship. He commented adversely on some independent faith-based schools, especially Muslim schools, that were not preparing their pupils to play their full part in British society, as he and others see it. I am sure that we all agree that they should do so if we are effectively to build a cohesive, inclusive and just society, which is a goal that we all share. Sadly, we are not at a point as a society where such criticism is likely to be taken at face value and treated neutrally; nor has it been. But such faith-based schools serving the Muslim communities, like Jewish and other faith-based schools, are themselves an important statement of the full inclusion of the communities they serve within British society. As such, it would be better if they were included within the maintained system. Then they would be required to offer the national curriculum and, I would hope, broad based religious education as well as a thoughtful induction into their own religious beliefs. We are working towards a broad framework of RE. I know that this is a matter of active debate and concern.
</p>

<a name="50118-06_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>If Clauses 64 and 65 of this Bill serve to encourage such diversity, even where the local education authority may have its doubts, I am in favour of them. But it does look a bit back-handed. As I understand it, normally, if there is a perceived need for a new school or an amalgamated school, there will have to be a local advertisement and a competition inviting bids from potential providers. But there will be circumstances where the Secretary of State can decide otherwise. Is this not a removal of local decision-making, running against the admirable trend of the 1998 Act and of other education legislation including parts of this Bill? We need to hear more about why the Secretary of State must make decisions that would make it unnecessary to invite local potential school providers to enter a competition and how she is likely to make the decisions.

<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="50118-07_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I shall move a series of amendments associated with these issues in a moment. But I would like to comment on one point made by the right reverend Prelate. He said that sometimes legal officers rule that representatives of the Church of England, the Catholic and other churches, on the school organisation committee are not allowed to participate, particularly to vote. That is sometimes also the rule for elected members. An elected member cannot speak or vote on the school which is to be established or reorganised in his or her area. Sometimes it also applies to governors of schools. Therefore, often electorates are unrepresented because their elected members cannot speak for them because they have, not a pecuniary interest, but an interest. It makes several of the school reorganisation proposals sometimes very difficult for local members, governors and Church representatives to speak about. I wanted to add that to the pot because it is a problem in terms of people being able to represent the views of others on school organisation matters. Can the Minister comment on those points about representation?
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="50118-07_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   Before this debate finishes I wish to make a couple of very quick points. Those made by the right reverend Prelate about rural areas are very important indeed in terms of the sparsity of population and the impact that school closures can have in those areas and the creation of new schools. We need to be very careful in particular about cross-border issues between England and Wales.
</p>

<a name="50118-07_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>If a new school was created, for example, in Oswestry in Shropshire, that might have quite an impact on the situation in Powys. If the local education authorities were not involved, it could cause an organisational crisis. By the same token, there is a school in Presteigne in Radnorshire which takes a lot of pupils from Shropshire. Although the amendments we are dealing with refer to England, I am sure the Minister can understand that decisions made without consultation with local authorities could have some very awkward consequences and need consideration.
</p>

<a name="50118-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>I also note what the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has just said. I certainly have experience of the local representative with no direct pecuniary interest in a school being unable to make representations which impinge on his or her geographical area, which might be very material indeed to the school structure.
</p>




<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="50118-07_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   Does the Minister wish to reply to the point about school organisation committees at this point? If not, I shall intervene and, in order to keep my interventions to a minimum, I shall speak on a block of four amendments&#151;this amendment and the next three&#151;which deal with one issue; that is, the involvement of local authorities.

</p>

<a name="50118-07_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>I must declare interests. As the right reverend Prelate has already mentioned, I was the chair of a committee that proposed an extra 100 Church of England secondary schools. I am also a vice-president of the Local Government Association. That has enabled me to see the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_661"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 661</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

operation from both sides and to see how well, in general, local authorities collaborate with, for example, the Churches.
</p>

<a name="50118-07_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>In relation to Clauses 64 and 65, I want to point out the advantage of involving local authorities, as has been proposed by the Liberal Democrat and Conservative Front Benches. Local authorities uniquely have a strategic view and understanding of the needs of the community and a responsibility to see that the community is well served. That predisposes me to think that the amendment to Clause 64, which I believe comes from the liberal side in particular, and which states that local authorities should be consulted before proposals are published, is valid. I also refer to Clause 65(2) and the provision that local authorities should be able to put forward proposals for community schools at the same time as others do so, and to the provision in, I believe, Clause 65(6), requiring local authorities to be consulted about regulations; those provisions have a good deal of advantage. Local authorities have knowledge and can make a valid contribution. The Government do not have sufficient knowledge to make the best possible decision without the input of local authorities. Therefore, I hope the Government will look sympathetically and constructively at the amendments that have been put forward by the two Front Benches on these matters.
</p>




<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="50118-07_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I am grateful to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth for speaking to his proposals <i>en bloc</i>. I hope that he will bear with me if I respond when we come to each proposal. Otherwise, I shall have to respond twice and I might contradict myself, which would be clumsy. I have the greatest respect for the way that the right reverend Prelate has resisted great temptation on other Bills and I respect the courage with which he did that on a certain Bill; he knows the Bill to which I am referring.
</p>

<a name="50118-07_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>I can categorically confirm that there will be proper consultation. There is no need for provisions on the face of the Bill. It is normal and proper practice to consult interested parties on draft regulations and guidance. On the matters covered by these clauses, we would always consult with local authorities and dioceses, as well as with teacher and head teacher organisations, governor representatives and others, including foundation and voluntary school organisations.

</p>

<a name="50118-07_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>On the specific concerns raised by the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Sharp of Guildford, the Secretary of State would consider any representations made to her before giving her consent to the publication of proposals for new secondary schools without the need for proposals to be invited from other promoters. Before reaching her decision, she would consider whether she had sufficient information on which to base it. She would seek the views of interested parties, including the local authority, where necessary. She would do so for good reasons: it is proper government and, defensively, because she would be open to judicial review if she did not do so. If she decided that a competition was not necessary, proposals would be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_662"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 662</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

published in the normal way, following consultation in the area, and there would be an opportunity for interested parties to comment and object.
</p>

<a name="50118-07_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>Some of the noble Baronesses&#039; concerns were shared by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and I made clear that local authorities and others will be consulted on regulations and guidance. The illustrative regulations have already been made available to your Lordships and show the provisions under consideration. Guidance of its nature is less significant than legislation and would not normally be considered by Parliament. We do not think that it should be. By its nature, guidance changes after proper consultation. Legislation, both primary and secondary, has not normally dealt with guidance. I cannot think of a case where we have dealt with it, although guidance has often informed the legislative process.
</p>

<a name="50118-07_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>The provision to have regard to guidance is common in education legislation. The requirements in these provisions mirror those in the School Standards and Framework Act applying to proposals for other changes in the organisation of schools. The existing guidance to school organisation committees and adjudicators is publicly available on the department&#039;s website. The factors considered significant for decisions on new schools include the effect on standards, the contribution to school improvement, the need for places, whether the proposals represent a cost-effective use of public funds and the views of interested parties. But we shall consult on draft guidance in respect of these provisions alongside draft regulations.
</p>

<a name="50118-07_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>I was asked about Welsh local authorities affected by the proposals for new schools in England. The illustrative regulations accompanying the Bill make clear that invitations for proposals must be sent to all local authorities that might be affected. That would include local authorities in Wales, were they to be so affected.
</p>

<a name="50118-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>I hope that this has been helpful and has clarified the points behind these probing amendments.
</p>




<p><a name="st_83"></a>
<a name="50118-07_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for his reassuring reply. It is helpful to have on the record the fact that the Secretary of State would consult these authorities. None of the amendments proposed that Parliament should be consulted, only that local authorities should be consulted as appropriate. That seems to me to be reasonable.
</p>

<a name="50118-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>This is the same old business that we come across all the time in the discussion of amendments. We have assurances from the Minister that consultation will take place, but there are occasions when it is useful to reinforce that message by having it in the Bill. I would have thought that one reference to consultation in this series of clauses would be helpful. This is an issue that we may come back to on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 64 shall stand part of the Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_84"></a>
<a name="50118-07_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   A series of amendments were tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. The Minister <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_663"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 663</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

has given some answers to them that may cover the amendments to which I am now speaking. One does not have time to catch all the answers given by the Minister, so I may be covering some of the same territory, but some of the points are new.
</p>

<a name="50118-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>Clause 64 introduces a new section in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said earlier. It deals with proposals for the establishment of new secondary schools by local education authorities and other persons with the consent of the Secretary of State. As the Bill stands, there is scant detail of how this clause will work in practice, as was mentioned in the debate that we have just had. Furthermore, I found the Explanatory Notes less than useful in this context. Therefore, I have a number of comments and questions that I wish to pose to the Minister.

</p>

<a name="50118-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a>The clause would allow private promoters to set up new foundation or voluntary schools. This sounds suspiciously like Conservative Party policy, and I am flattered that the Government have acknowledged the   merits of including it in this part of the Bill. Unsurprisingly, we support the idea that an organisation other than the state should be allowed to set up and run a new school with funding provided by the state. We believe that this can assist parents and pupils by providing a greater choice of schools and range of curriculum on offer in a local area. The Minister said something similar in his recent reply.
</p>

<a name="50118-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a>However, I would be grateful if the Minister would expand on how he sees such a measure working in practice. It will be interesting to understand the relationship between such promoter schools and those in the maintained sector, as well as the process for setting them up. Will he also mention the funding of these schools? How will the capital and the annual revenue funding be realised?

</p>

<a name="50118-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a>Furthermore, how many proposals does the Minister envisage will be received from promoters under this clause on, say, an annual basis? More importantly, how many does he think will be given permission to go ahead? Can the Minister describe the proposed criteria on which each promoter will be judged? Also, who will give the final go-ahead and approval that a new school can be established under such terms?
<a name="time_7"></a>
<a name="50118-07_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50118-07_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>Equally, from my reading of the Bill, the measure would also allow a successful LEA to open an affiliate of a successful school in a neighbouring borough&#151;something that could be encouraged&#151;financed with money from that borough&#039;s schools budget. That may be welcome progress towards more choice but, again, can the Minister expand on how he sees the measure working in practice?
</p>

<a name="50118-07_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>I also have several specific queries relating to this part. Proposed new Section 28(4) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;Proposals under this section shall  . . . contain such information, and  . . . be published in such manner, as may be prescribed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_664"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 664</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-07_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>The obvious questions are: what kind of information are we talking about and in what manner should it be published? Can the Minister tell us if any consultation has been undertaken on this part of the legislation?
</p>

<a name="50118-07_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>Is the noble Lord&#039;s department actively discussing these proposals with representatives of local government and, indeed, with other parties who may wish to submit proposals to set up a new school? Furthermore, the relevant LEA or promoter must consult any person whom it considers appropriate under this clause. Again, it would be useful if the Minister could give some indication of the groups the Government have in mind under this subsection.
</p>

<a name="50118-07_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>I believe it is very important that in such circumstances local people and parents are not only made aware of such proposals but that they have an opportunity to have a say over the provision of any new school. Will the Minister therefore consider placing in the Bill an assurance that local people must, as a matter of course, be consulted on any proposals for a new school? I have declared my own local government interest many times. I have been involved in many public meetings where we have put proposals for new schools to parents and so on, and one assumes that the Government would wish that to continue.
</p>

<a name="50118-07_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>In addition, I should like the Minister to explain the impact of the changes detailed in Schedule 12. Once again, I am sorry to say that I found the Explanatory Notes less than helpful in this regard, and that is why I found it necessary to question whether Clause 69 should stand part of the Bill.
</p>

<p><a name="st_85"></a>
<a name="50118-08_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   Like the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, I have also given notice of my intention to oppose the Question that Clauses 64 and 69 stand part of the Bill, and I want to add to what the noble Lord said. There is concern about the new proposals in Clause 64, which effectively substitutes Section 28 of the School Standards and Framework Act. It is felt that perhaps undue preference is being given to the independent foundation schools and that there is no level playing field with local authority proposals. We shall come to that in a moment when I talk about my small amendment to Clause 65.

</p>

<a name="50118-08_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, we are concerned that the Government want to overthrow the rather successful involvement of local people in the decisions over new schools in terms of the school organisation committee and, to some extent, to change the rules which have worked quite well over the past few years. Therefore, we echo very much the sentiments expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. We want to understand a little more what the Government have in mind here and why they are moving in this direction.
</p>




<p><a name="st_86"></a>
<a name="50118-08_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   This is a good and proper probing debate as part of the clause stand part process. As I have already explained, the aim of this part of the Bill is to extend the requirement for local authorities to invite promoters to come forward with proposals to establish new schools so that it applies wherever statutory proposals are needed to establish a new <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_665"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 665</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

secondary school. Clause 64 inserts a new section after Section 28 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 to provide that local authorities and promoters in England may publish proposals for new secondary schools with the consent of the Secretary of State without the requirement to invite proposals under Clause 65.
</p>

<a name="50118-08_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>The clause is complementary to Clauses 63 and 65, which, together with this clause, provide that proposals for new secondary schools may be published only with the consent of the Secretary of State or in response to a notice by the local authority inviting proposals.
</p>

<a name="50118-08_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>The effect of removing the clause while Clause 63 is retained would be that all new secondary schools would have to go through the invitation-to-bid process, but of course that was not the literal effect of opposing the Question that the clause stand part. We believe that there are some circumstances in which this would be unnecessary or, indeed, counterproductive. We envisage that it would occur in a limited range of circumstances where it was clear that the objectives of increasing the quality and diversity provision could be met without the need for an invitation for other proposals.
</p>

<a name="50118-08_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>An example would be where there is a failing school and the local partners, in concert with expert advisers, decide that the best way forward is a collaborative restart of the school with a particular character and ethos. Another example could be an independent school coming into the maintained sector. We also think that, in many circumstances&#151;
</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="50118-08_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   For information, can the Minister tell me whether I am right in thinking that these proposals do not apply to schools which have been put into special measures and which therefore might be regarded as failing schools?
</p>




<p><a name="st_88"></a>
<a name="50118-08_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   That is correct. They would apply only if a school were to be closed and therefore if there were a need for a new school to replace it.
</p>

<a name="50118-08_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>To continue, we also think that in many circumstances it might be appropriate for proposals to be brought forward to replace a non-denominational school with a school with a religious character where diversity in the area was low, for example, and all parties agreed that that was the best way forward.
</p>

<a name="50118-08_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>We would also be likely to consider an invitation to others to bring forward proposals to be unnecessary where an independent promoter proposed a new school to increase diversity, rather than in response to a local authority&#039;s need to reorganise.
</p>

<a name="50118-08_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>Similarly, if the local diocese, either Roman Catholic or Church of England, wished to rationalise provision in the area&#151;perhaps because of falling rolls&#151;it would seem to make sense if that could take place without the need to invite competitive proposals from other promoters.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_666"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 666</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>However, we suspect that in most cases it will be appropriate for a local authority to publish a notice inviting other providers to bring forward proposals for new secondary schools under the arrangements put in place by Clause 65 and for the reasons to which we referred in our earlier debate.

</p>

<a name="50118-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>Clause 69 provides for Schedule 12 to contain further amendments relating to proposals for the establishment, alteration or discontinuance of schools. The schedule updates previous legislation to take account of the provisions of this Bill, especially to include proposals published under new Section 28A of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 inserted by Clause 64 or under Clause 65, and to include those published under Clause 65 and to remove references to Section 70 of the Education Act 2002.
</p>

<a name="50118-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>In particular, it changes the definition of &quot;middle school&quot; so that the upper age becomes a specified age above 12 rather than simply an age over 12. For the purpose of these provisions, Clause 63 defines &quot;secondary school&quot; as including a middle school in respect of which the upper age is at least 16. We referred to that earlier.
</p>

<a name="50118-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>Schedule 7 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 is replaced by Clause 66. In Schedule 11 to this Bill in respect of England, changes are also made to make it clear that it now refers only to Wales and that powers are to be exercised by the Assembly. These amendments are necessary in order to take account of the new provisions, although I regret that they are not always easy to understand at a first hearing.
</p>

<a name="50118-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>I shall now do my best to answer the 10 or 11 difficult questions, if I recollect correctly, posed by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield. He asked who would give the final go-ahead or who would make the final decision. The answer is that the decision would be taken locally either by the school organisation committee or the adjudicator. On the question of the number to be set up, we expect up to 20 a year to be established. We have no idea how many bids there would be for each of those 20.
</p>

<a name="50118-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>The noble Lord asked what information the proposals will contain and how it will be published. That is set out in the illustrative regulations, which are already with the House, and they might be worth a glimpse, although perhaps not a full read.
</p>

<a name="50118-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>I was asked on what criteria the decisions would be made. We shall set them out in guidance, on which we shall consult. The Secretary of State and adjudicators will be expected to consider all proposals on their merits, taking into account such factors as their likely contribution to raising standards and increasing diversity. The first is the central thrust of the Bill and the latter is the central part of this part of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50118-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>The principle underlying the policy is that all new parties should have the same opportunity to bring forward proposals when new schools are required&#151;in other words, a level playing field. The Bill envisages a two-stage process. First, the local authority will publish a preliminary notice inviting promoters to put forward proposals for a new school. Secondly, the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_667"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 667</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

local authority will publish all the proposals received along with any proposals of its own for a new community or foundation school.
</p>

<a name="50118-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>Detailed procedures for the publication of the preliminary notice of proposals of promoters will be set in the regulations. The regulations provide that the promoters will have four months from the date of the preliminary notice to put their proposals together, or more if a local education authority wishes to specify a longer period. During this time the local education authority may prepare any proposals of its own.
</p>

<a name="50118-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>Following the end of the four-month period the local authority has three weeks to publish the proposals received and any of its own. There then follows a six-week period in which people may offer objections to the proposals. After that period the local authority has one week in which to refer the proposals to the school organisation committee to make the decision, or to the school adjudicator where the Secretary of State has directed that the adjudicator should decide on the proposals. These arrangements will ensure that all parties have the same opportunities to put their proposals together, and that all proposals are subject to the same public scrutiny and, it is to be hoped, a fair application of the criteria against them.
</p>

<a name="50118-08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>How will the schools be funded? Promoters will be invited to bring forward proposals for foundation schools, voluntary-aided schools or academies, and these will all be funded in the usual way. Recurrent funding will come via the local authority. Capital funding will come from the local authority and the Secretary of State and promoters as appropriate.
</p>

<a name="50118-08_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>I am sure that I have not covered every one of the questions of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, but I will spot those I have not answered and write to him.

<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="50118-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I thank the Minister for his answers. When he talked about the four months for preparation of plans and then a certain amount of time that people can object to those plans, I questioned how local people were to be involved. At the moment there are local meetings to which parents can go. Plans do not necessarily need to be published but there needs to be some kind of format in which people can discuss them. Does the Minister envisage how people can be well informed about these alternative plans so that people can make observations and decide whether to object to or approve the plans?
</p>


<p>
<a name="50118-09_spopq0"></a><b>  </b> </p>

<p><a name="st_90"></a>
<a name="50118-09_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, is right. The purpose of the local authority being required&#151;in the process that I described&#151;to publish all the proposals after it has received them is clearly for the purpose he indicates. It is so that local people have the opportunity to look at them, read them if they wish to and engage with them.

</p>

<a name="50118-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>He is also right that some local people will find it adequate to get the proposals off a website or get a paper copy. They will be able to engage with the proposals and put in their views. Many other local people&#151;for a variety of reasons&#151;might prefer to have the opportunity of a <br>&nbsp;<br>

briefing about the proposals and a discussion with either the local authority or the proposers about what is put forward.
</p>

<a name="50118-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>We will need to give thought to what extent it is necessary in regulations and guidance to be specific about what local authorities should be doing to involve local people in commenting on proposals. But it is absolutely fundamental that local people must have full and adequate opportunity of commenting on those proposals before the decisions are considered by either the school organisation committee or the adjudicator. That is part of why we are trying to get these issues taken into the local level, so that local people have more of an opportunity for engagement.
</p>

<a name="50118-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>Let me reflect on the extent to which we put this matter into regulations. I do not think we should ever go to quite the level of saying that a certain number of meetings should be organised, but certainly there should be the principle of a proper engagement of local people in understanding the issues and choices to be made, and giving them the opportunity to comment. I hope that is helpful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="50118-09_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   May I ask the Minister, in so far as he reflects on this issue, to take particular account of cases where proposals are published just before the summer holidays? Often, inevitably, consultation takes the form of meetings arranged at schools, and so on. If you have a limited period for consultation, that cannot happen during the six weeks of the summer holidays. That timing often limits the degree to which local people can get involved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="50118-09_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   Yes, I am very happy to do so.
</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="50118-09_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I thank the Minister for all that information, which we need to digest. I repeat that, with local authorities these days, for any new scheme&#151;even a minor road scheme&#151;presentations tend be put on in local village halls, and so on, so that people can go and look. Life has changed a lot in the past few years about how the public want to be involved in these matters. I agree that you do not want to prescribe exactly what should happen about the consultation, but there certainly needs to be in both regulation and guidance enough strength to make certain that local people are involved in the decision-making process.

<a name="column_669"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 669</b><br>&nbsp;<br>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 125BA is fairly small and is in many senses a probing amendment. Clause 65 is about proposals for new secondary schools. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;The following schools fall within this subsection . . .  a foundation school; . . . a voluntary school; . . .  an Academy&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>It goes on to state that it includes community schools. That comes back to the point I made in relation to the previous discussion on Clause 64 stand part. To what degree are the Government not creating a level playing field between community schools and other schools?
</p>

<a name="50118-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>The impression gained from some government publications is that the Government want to see foundation schools, more voluntary-aided schools and academies but that they do not want to see community schools established. Yet in many areas&#151;and again I stress that many of the proposals are London-centric, or metropolitan-centric&#151;community secondary schools are serving their communities very well and do not want to be foundation schools. They want to have the local authority behind them&#151;the strategic authorities&#151;and have no wish to change their status.
</p>

<a name="50118-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>The question is why a straight community school should not be considered among these new proposals. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="50118-09_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I hope that I can be both brief and helpful. Our intention is to ensure that promoters and local education authorities have the opportunity to publish proposals to establish schools on an equal footing. That is the heart of the policy&#151;that all parties should have the same opportunity to bring forward proposals when new schools are required.
</p>

<a name="50118-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>The procedure envisaged in Clause 65 is as follows. Where a local authority identifies the need for a school it must publish the preliminary notice inviting proposals. The notice will specify the period for which submissions must come in. At the end of the period the local authority has to publish the proposals.

</p>

<a name="50118-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>At the same time the local authority may also publish proposals of its own. The local authority does not have to advertise to itself that it can submit a proposal because it knows that it is advertising for other proposals. If the local authority wishes to make a proposal it brings it in on the same timetable as the other proposals, and it is published with any other proposals received. There follows the period in which local people have the opportunity to make representations. The proposal then goes to the decision-making process.
</p>

<a name="50118-09_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>The regulations make clear that all proposals will be published and considered in the same way whether they are put forward by promoters or by the local authority. According to the procedure I have described, once the local authority has published a preliminary notice it will have the same amount of time in which to prepare any proposal for a community foundation school as promoters will have to prepare their proposals. All the proposals will be published at the same time and subject to the same level of scrutiny by local people and then the decision will be taken by the school organisation committee or adjudicator.

We wanted in Amendment No. 125C&#151;and I hope the noble Lord will confirm this&#151;to ensure that the local authority would not be disadvantaged in putting forward proposals for a new school. A Member of the Committee referred to a level playing field. The amendment seeks to establish the principle that a local authority is a legitimate proposer and able to compete with all the other proposers.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>The competitive process for a new school should allow for all proposals to be discussed and consulted on in an open and transparent manner to ensure that local communities are fully aware of all the options and how all proposers, including the local authority, can have the opportunity to propose diverse provision in a locality. It is important that the local authority is able to present its work with partners as a comparator with other proposers if it wishes to do so.
</p>

<a name="50118-09_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>Local authorities are moving more and more into all sorts of partnerships. They are developing community schools and what we have referred to previously in the legislation as extended schools, which tend to support the family, along the lines of the Children Act. Therefore, the proposers of new schools would probably be local authorities in line.

<a name="50118-09_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>Do the Government believe that it is important that local people, if they want, can accept local authority maintained schools as well as other options? Local authorities have a strategic role to ensure that there is sufficient provision of a suitable nature for all children and young people in the area. That provision remains.

<a name="50118-09_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 126A ensures that the Secretary of State may require the information required by all proposers and not just the local authority. It seeks to confirm the principle that the local authority is able to act as a proposer for a new school on a level playing field with other proposals.
</p>

<a name="50118-09_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>Any proposer should be able to demonstrate how its proposal will link with the strategies of the local authority and its partners&#151;back to this increased amount of partnership activity.

<a name="50118-10_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   My name is associated with that of the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, on Amendments Nos. 125C and 126A. I want to reinforce his message that there is a feeling that perhaps there is not a level playing field and that local authorities are drawing the short straw over these proposals. We seek a reassurance from the Minister that there will be fairness in relation to the local authorities and that they are seen as real partners working with the local community for the local community in bringing forward new proposals.
</p>




<p><a name="st_101"></a>
<a name="50118-10_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   With the leave of the Committee, I shall speak relatively succinctly because we covered much of the heart of these probing amendments in the previous group. I repeat and re-emphasise that we think it is right and proper that there should be more choice for local people to comment on, and more choice for school organisation committees to make decisions on, when new schools are provided or are to be provided. The purpose is not some abstract theory but to see whether local people and school organisation committees have a better opportunity to make a judgment about which proposal gives them greatest confidence and will raise standards and produce good outcomes for children in that area, because that is what local people want.
</p>

<a name="50118-10_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>But&#151;and it is a clear &quot;but&quot;&#151;that means it is completely open to the local authority, if it wishes, to put in its own proposal for a maintained school. As the Committee knows, the decision on which school to choose, after local people have expressed their views by a proper process of consultation, will be made either by the school organisation committee or, if it cannot decide, the local adjudicator. So these decisions are retained at local level.

</p>

<a name="50118-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>On Amendment No. 126A, I can assure the Committee that the legislation already fulfils the intention of the amendment, in that the illustrative regulations set out the procedures for both publication of a notice inviting proposals for a new secondary school and the procedures for publishing the proposal received.
</p>

<a name="50118-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>Regulation 5 makes provision for the publication of a notice inviting proposals; that is, a notice published under subsection (1). Subsection (3) sets out the matters to be prescribed in regulations. Regulation 9 makes provision for the subsequent publication of proposals submitted to the local education authority, as envisaged in subsection (6).
</p>

<a name="50118-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree that the illustrative regulations make sensible provision for the publication of preliminary notices and proposals for new secondary schools and therefore will feel minded to withdraw their amendment.

<a name="amdtpar_0"></a>&quot;(8A)   Where any proposals published under this section relate to a school which is proposed to be situated in an area other than that of the local education authority who published the notice under this section, the provisions of Schedule 10 shall have effect in relation to the proposals with such modifications as may be prescribed.&quot;

<p><a name="st_104"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 127 provides for a regulation-making power so that the provisions of Schedule 10 may be modified where it is proposed to establish a school in an area other than the area of the local authority which published the notice inviting proposals. Such a situation might arise, for example, where a local authority identifies the need for a school in an area bordering that of a neighbouring authority and the most suitable site for the school happens to be physically located in the neighbouring authority.
</p>

<a name="50118-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>In those circumstances it would be for the authority publishing the proposals to secure the ownership of the   site as necessary. We would expect such a situation to arise exceptionally, but we think it is important to ensure that if it does arise the procedures for dealing with proposals establish clear ownership of the decision of the school organisation committee for the local authority area that will maintain the school. We also want to ensure that appropriate account is taken of the views of the school organisation committee for the area where the school is to be situated.

</p>

<a name="50118-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>Existing legislation governing the establishment of   schools already contains a regulation-making power   which permits the modification of the schedule governing the procedures when dealing with proposals. Regulations made under that section modify the schedule to provide, for example, that the school organisation committee for the local authority in which the school is to be situated considers the proposals and makes recommendations to the school organisation committee for the local authority which is proposed to maintain the school. If the views of the two school organisation committees differ, the proposals must be referred to the school adjudicator to decide.
</p>

<a name="50118-10_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>The intention behind the amendment is to replicate the regulation-making power contained in the 1998 Act. The omission of such a power from the original drafting was unintentional. The Committee may wish to note that new Section 28A of the 1998 Act, inserted by Clause 64, provides for such a power in relation to proposals for new schools, published by local authorities and promoters for the Secretary of State&#039;s consent.

</p>

<a name="50118-10_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>The alternative to providing a regulation-making power would be to make separate provision in the Bill for proposals to establish a school in an area other than the area of the local authority inviting proposals. We believe that a regulation-making <br>&nbsp;<br>

power is more appropriate. I also refer the Committee to Schedule 5 to the Education (School Organisation Proposals) (England) Regulations 1999, as amended, which contain modifications to Schedule 6 to the 1998 Act that we expect to replicate.

</p>

<a name="50118-10_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a>Amendment No. 131 does nothing more than remedy a drafting error. Amendment No. 132 inserts a new sub-paragraph (9)(b) in paragraph 4 of Schedule 7 to the 1998 Act in substitution of the existing sub-paragraph. The Bill makes several amendments to Schedule 7 so that it applies only to school organisation proposals published by the National Assembly for Wales. Comparable provision for proposals published by the Secretary of State for England is now made in Schedule 11 to the Bill. Amendment No. 132 supersedes the amendments to sub-paragraph (9)(b) originally contained in sub-paragraph (6)(c) of paragraph 13 of Schedule 12 to the Bill. I am sure that that is clear.
</p>

<a name="50118-10_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>Amendments Nos. 154 and 155 are consequential on Amendment No. 132. They delete repeal of some of the wording of sub-paragraph (9)(b) of paragraph 4 of Schedule 7 to the 1998 Act contained in Schedule 19. Those repeals are superfluous, as Amendment No. 132 repeals the sub-paragraph in its entirety, substituting a new sub-paragraph in its place.

</p>

<a name="50118-10_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>The school organisation committee is a statutory body established under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 that meets to approve the school organisation plan, which encompasses the planned provision of school places by the local education authority for the next five years, and has replaced the Secretary of State in making decisions about school reorganisations, new schools, closures and so on.

</p>

<a name="50118-10_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>The typical committee meets on average once a year to approve the school organisation plan, together with other meetings as required to consider specific issues: for example, changes to standard numbers, proposals for new schools or school closures. As we heard from the right reverend Prelate, each committee is made up of a number of representatives from a variety of sources: the local education authority, Church of England diocesan representatives, Roman Catholic Church diocesan representatives, the local learning and skills council and so on, and, obviously, representatives of schools, which should consist of seven school governors representing the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_674"></a>

balance of all types of schools in a local authority area, all types of governor and all geographical areas as far as possible.
</p>

<a name="50118-10_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>Decisions about school closures are made locally by the school organisation committee. If the committee cannot decide unanimously, the proposals are referred to an independent schools adjudicator, to which reference has been made several times today.

</p>

<a name="50118-10_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>There can be no mistaking the intention of our amendment. We believe that the days of the school organisation committees&#151;and, indeed, of the school organisation plans, especially given the legislation proposed by the Government&#151;are numbered. I am happy to give a firm pledge that a future Conservative government would legislate for their abolition. What might sound on paper like a sensible and rational idea has been in practice an interfering, obscure and bureaucratic mechanism.
</p>

<a name="50118-10_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>We have heard several instances today in which people who are part of those committees cannot speak, although they have a particular knowledge and expertise in the area being discussed, because of operating practices. People cannot participate in debates when they should. Those bodies should not be making such decisions as I have described. School organisation committees are as unnecessary as they are unwelcome. The administrative time, the planning and consultation processes and the referral of plans between neighbouring LEAs, as well as the servicing of the committee itself, mean that it is a very bureaucratic and time-consuming exercise.
</p>

<a name="50118-10_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>This is about the philosophy of how we want our education system to run in future. We believe in powers and freedoms being given to schools and schools running themselves. Research and common sense indicate that the best-performing schools are those in which the head teacher is free to make a difference and does so and in which teachers can tailor their lessons to the children in their charge and the requirements of the area in running the school. The school organisation committee applies red tape to the system.
</p>

<a name="50118-10_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>We would also like to end the surplus places rule, so that good schools can expand to meet local demand. We want any good school that can offer a good education for the same cost as a state school to be created and set up to offer a greater choice of education in the area. Parents would have greater choice. The presence of many school places in the area would act as a spur to underperforming schools.
</p>

<a name="50118-10_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>We need to consider the matter differently as a result of the legislation that is being proposed and to remove the bureaucratic nature of those decisions. In promoting the amendment, I am opening a debate that will, I hope, lead us to some more rational and constructive way to take those decisions. Those bodies have been around since 1998. They have not worked terribly well, from what I have seen of their operation, and their removal will only help to achieve what the Government, and everyone else, want: to make certain that there are more good schools. I beg to move.

<a name="50118-11_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   We face in a diametrically opposite direction from the Conservatives. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_675"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 675</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I have made it clear that our view of education is that it is provided for a community and that nursery, primary and secondary schools must all work within a system for that community and feed through to one another. Given the community base of education, it is vital that there is some overriding authoritative guidance in that community to take decisions, such as whether a new school is needed or not. What the noble Lord, Lord   Hanningfield, suggests leaves me with the feeling that there would be complete anarchy. Anyone who wanted to establish a new school could do so; there would be no criteria on which decisions would be taken.
</p>

<a name="50118-11_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>I should have had more sympathy with the noble Lord if he had said that we should revert to the local education authority, rather than have this sub-committee of it set up as the school organisation committee. The school organisation committee goes slightly wider, because it includes nominated members. As I said, those bodies should represent a community, and matters should be democratically decided. The local education authority is a democratically elected authority.
</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="50118-11_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   Perhaps I should have explained that abolishing the committees would take us back to the local authority, as it did in the past, taking those decisions, except when they were controversial, when they were referred to the Secretary of State. Most decisions&#151;probably 75 to 80 per cent of them&#151;were taken locally by a local authority. That is what I would prefer, with exceptional decisions&#151;which would certainly be relevant to the Bill&#151;taken by the Secretary of State.
</p>




<p><a name="st_109"></a>
<a name="50118-11_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I have more sympathy with the notion that the provision should refer to the local education authority. There is no doubt that on occasions there were difficulties regarding local authorities taking decisions. Rather than going to the   Secretary of State for a decision, having the adjudicator available has had some advantages. We believe that the school organisation committee has worked reasonably well and is in tune with local feelings. I should be worried about the relative anarchy of the Conservative Party proposals.
</p>




<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="50118-11_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   That was an interesting debate between the two Front Benches. I am grateful for the welcome by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, to the school organisation committee. We believe that it is working. I did not recognise the picture put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, although I acknowledge his great practical experience in this field.

</p>

<a name="50118-11_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>The amendments and the proposed new clause would remove the duty on local education authorities to establish SOCs and the Secretary of State&#039;s power to appoint schools adjudicators. The remaining consequential amendments would delete from Schedule 10 the paragraphs for dealing with the other procedures for deciding proposals. Those include procedures for the referral of proposals to the school organisation committee and the adjudicator in certain circumstances; and for consultation with the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_676"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 676</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Secretary of State on proposals for academies. Deleting those paragraphs would mean that the Bill makes no provision for proposals published under Clause 65 to be decided, except where the local education authority alone had published proposals.
</p>

<a name="50118-11_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>The adjudicator also decides cases of contentious admissions arrangements that are referred to him. The amendment, therefore, would also disadvantage parties with an interest in admissions in the area, including parents. For example, it would not be possible to refer objections to schools admissions arrangements to the adjudicator, as is provided for in Section 90 of the 1998 Act.
</p>

<a name="50118-11_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a>For all those reasons, I ask the noble Lord to reflect on the history of the organisation committees and the local and independent decision-taking that they represent. Before those decision-making arrangements were introduced by the School Standards and Framework Act in 1998, decisions on statutory proposals were commonly taken by Ministers in the Department for Education. The noble Baroness, Lady   Sharp, referred to that phenomenon. The improvement that we sought in the process reflected the importance we attach to local and independent decision-making. That has a long history in this country. All parties when in power have hitherto seen a need for regulation of changes to schools, in particular the opening and closing of schools. This system is a development of the system put in place in 1944. That has involved consultation, publication of proposals in a local newspaper, opportunity for interested parties to object and a decision by a third party.
</p>

<a name="50118-11_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a>We established the system in 1998 following pledges that decisions on schools would be devolved to local   level. There was widespread consultation and agreement on that. The constitution of the SOCs was designed carefully to give equal representation to all the local stakeholders including the LEA which has the statutory duty to ensure that there are sufficient school places; schools themselves, as the noble Lord, Lord   Hanningfield, pointed out; the local Church of England and Roman Catholic dioceses, as the right reverend Prelate pointed out; and the local learning and skills council.
<a name="time_10"></a>
<a name="50118-11_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50118-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>We believe that such decisions should be made at local level by key education stakeholders who would understand local issues and would be able to take a balanced view of competing arguments. They would also ensure that there was local ownership of important decisions affecting the local community.
</p>

<a name="50118-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>Local knowledge and the ability to balance competing arguments will be important when deciding between a number of different proposals. We have the five representative bodies. There is also the possibility of a sixth group to represent particular local interests&#151;community groups, for example, or district councils. Indeed, about a fifth of the SOCs have that. As the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, pointed out, over the past five years, the evidence is clear that in practice they are working in fair and effective ways.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_677"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 677</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>Perhaps I may give a few statistics. Of the proposals which went to the SOC for decision&#151;not all do so if the local authority is unanimous in its decision&#151;just over 90 per cent were approved unanimously. Only 1   per cent were rejected. The remainder were referred to the adjudicator to determine. We believe&#151;I think that I can pray in aid the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth&#151;that the system is working well. It has followed guidance which is expansive, clear and generous in its interpretation of all the issues which have to be taken into account. It has provided a sensible route for taking decisions which affect the organisation of local schools and education.
</p>

<a name="50118-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>The noble Baroness used the term &quot;anarchy&quot;. My speaking notes refer to &quot;virtual anarchy&quot;. The noble Lord sees the proposal as a return of control to local authorities. We cannot be sure. We see the proposal as the abolition of a system which is working well. It would benefit no one as competing interests fight over local decisions and a return to centralised decision-making in Whitehall. We do not see the system as interfering or bureaucratic but as making sensible decisions on a proportionate basis. We all agree that we owe it to our children to do our best to ensure that the schools system delivers equity and quality for all. While we are not complaisant, we have heard no clamour for change. Of course, things do go wrong in certain committees; we are aware of that. The department is alert to that. But we are not aware of a barrage of complaints. Far from being complaisant, we continue to monitor the arrangements. We take account of the extent to which they deliver good outcomes.
</p>

<a name="50118-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>I hope that we can agree that some such arrangements are necessary and that it is not practicable for schools to be set up without proper consideration of their viability or the educational and social needs of the area. As the Committee is aware, we are extending the contestability arrangements; and we propose to extend delegation further to ensure that decisions taken under the present arrangements by the Secretary of State will be taken by the local SOC and in some circumstances the school&#039;s adjudicator. The sections of the 1998 Act requiring the publication of proposals for changes to schools would remain; and they would require the proposals to be sent to the SOC for decision. Those proposing such changes could not decide the proposals for themselves and no alternative decision-maker would exist.
</p>

<a name="50118-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>The noble Lord has referred to the removal of the school organisation plans. The Children Act 2004 repealed the requirement to produce the school organisation plan alongside a number of other plans. It also provides for regulations requiring a children&#039;s services authority to produce a single plan. We look forward to rationalising local authority planning requirements. We aim to commence these provisions shortly. The fact that we have done that does not invalidate the other work of the SOC.
</p>

<a name="50118-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>I draw on the spirit in which the right reverend Prelate introduced his remarks. Decisions this important should not rest in the hands of a single body <br>&nbsp;<br>

or group of individuals. A range of stakeholders must be involved in the ownership of those decisions. That is what we have in the SOCs. The balance of interests, whether reflected in the choice of the establishment of a new school or the closure of an old school, involves decisions which have huge implications for families and children. It is important that a range of voices can   be heard. We believe that school organisation committees do that job well. On that basis, we fervently hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.

It was all done by agreement with schools, parents or the public. It is good to have a wider debate on a controversial proposal; that always happened previously. Much is now deferred and made more bureaucratic because simple things take much longer to achieve.
</p>

<a name="50118-12_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, hit the nail on the head when she said that academies would not refer to school organisation committees. The committees will not have a big part to play in those new schools, which will be established by outside bodies and will therefore be separate from much of the process. I envisage that   the bureaucratic nature of school organisation committees will handicap good local authorities in what they should be doing anyway. These days, local authorities have various checks and balances, such as comprehensive performance assessments, Ofsted inspections and so on. Obviously, partners should always been involved, but you do not need a school organisation committee to do that. Certainly, when I was involved in the process, such a body was never necessary: the two diocesan boards were more involved than the local authority at times, if they had an interest in a proposal.

</p>

<a name="50118-12_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>Unfortunately, we are now creating legislation to cover one or two bad instances. Sometimes we slow things up or stop the process when it is working fairly well. I would like a return to the good old days of school organisation whereby we get on with things rather than have a bureaucratic body distorting the process. Perhaps we need to look at how the committees operate and how the process can be speeded up.

<a name="50118-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>It is currently unclear in what circumstances the result of a competition should be referred to the adjudicator. It is essential that the regulations are workable and proportionate. For example, if promoters have been unsuccessful, it must not be possible for them to refer a decision to the adjudicator because they do not agree with it, only on the grounds that the process was unfair. We would not want referrals to the adjudicator unduly to exacerbate local community uncertainty about proposed decisions.
</p>

<a name="50118-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>The role of the adjudicator and the criteria on which   he will operate require much more detailed consideration.

<p><a name="st_119"></a>
<a name="50118-12_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I shall leave my remarks at that. This is another example of where it would be very reasonable to set out in the schedule, which is not part of the Bill, the criteria for determining whether a case should be referred to the adjudicator. On occasion, the Secretary of State will require that. We want to know what criteria the Secretary of State will use in those circumstances.
</p>




<p><a name="st_120"></a>
<a name="50118-12_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   Just when I thought that we were making progress, I find that we are about to go backwards again. The illustrative regulations made available to the   Committee deal with this issue. Regulation 14 makes it clear that proposals should be referred to the adjudicator by the school organisation committee in certain circumstances. The basic circumstances that we have referred to in previous debates have been when the school organisation committee cannot reach a decision on proposals; two groups cannot vote because of a conflict of interest; the proposals are related to other proposals already being considered by the adjudicator; or the committee had failed to reach any decision within two months.
</p>

<a name="50118-12_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>Paragraph (2)(1) gives the Secretary of State a reserve power to direct that proposals be referred to the adjudicator rather than the school organisation committee for decision. The Secretary of State might do so where there is a record of poor local decision-making in the area. Criteria for determining whether there was a record of poor local decision-making might include, for example, failure by the school organisation committee to comply with the regulations governing its own procedures; failure to check whether the proposals presented to it for decision had complied with the regulations governing their publication; disregarding statutory guidance on factors to be taken into account in decision-making; and taking decisions that are clearly unreasonable.
</p>

<a name="50118-12_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>We do not think that those circumstances need to be set out in regulations, although we intend to consult on guidance informing interested parties on the current thinking on the use of the provision. Any decision made by the Secretary of State to make a direction would, of course, be subject to judicial review. One hopes that having the powers in the cupboard, if I can use that expression, would render their exercise unnecessary, as one finds at times.

</p>

<a name="50118-12_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>I should explain why the power of direction should apply only to proposals published in response to a notice under Clause 65. We are satisfied that local decision-making arrangements are generally working well, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, acknowledged. This is a reserve power for use in exceptional circumstances.
</p>

<a name="50118-12_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>We recognise, however, that school organisation committees do not have a track record in deciding between a number of competing proposals. At present they are only ever required to decide whether to approve or reject a single set of proposals to establish a school. So this is new business.
</p>

<a name="50118-12_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>I should also make it clear that we are not proposing to give unsuccessful promoters or local education authorities the right to appeal to the adjudicator if their proposals are rejected. As I have explained, the Secretary of State may take action where there is evidence that a school organisation committee may not decide proposals impartially. Otherwise, the committee&#039;s decision would be final.

example, in putting forward schools that might operate in competition with local authority schools.

</p>

<a name="50118-13_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a>Let me be absolutely clear. I have already signalled today that we think it really important that local people, in particular local parents, have the opportunity to express effectively their views on the alternative options for a new school. That is healthy and right, and it is therefore helpful to give parents the opportunity to consider which of the proposals that comes forward will best meet the needs of their children and deliver the life outcomes they hope to see. It follows from that that we   want a fair and level playing field providing fair options and processes for decision-making by school organisation committees.
</p>

<a name="50118-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a>It is not our intent to skew the process one way or the other, but we do think it important to provide guidance to school organisation committees to ensure that they follow properly good and fair processes.
</p>

<a name="50118-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>As I signalled earlier by making a slightly premature comment on a previous amendment, parliamentary agreement to guidance of this kind has never previously been considered necessary.

Consultation as required by this Schedule shall be at such time and of such duration as may be required so as to ensure that persons wishing to respond to consultation shall have reasonable opportunity to do so having regard in particular to the incidence of school terms and periods of school closure.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_129"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment also relates to Schedule 10, the main purpose of which is to speed up the processes for establishing new schools through school organisation committees. It will replace Section 35 and Schedule 8 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, as amended by the Education Act 2002. The only requirement under Schedule 8 was that the proposal must be published, but it did not allow the legislation relating to other school changes to be used for consultation and determination of the change of category proposals. Current regulations apply these new procedures.

</p>

<a name="50118-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>The current situation in relation to the establishment of, for example, a foundation school is that the governing body must submit to the school organisation committee a full analysis of the school&#039;s strengths and weaknesses, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_684"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 684</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

including a summary of the effect of the change on the school; the viability of the governing body; and   the   tenure of the school buildings, land and so forth. In the future it is proposed that, after considering all   the   comments and objections that are submitted, the governing body should merely determine whether the proposals shall be implemented. That will greatly reduce the administrative burden of such changes on schools.
</p>

<a name="50118-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>The governing body has six months to determine whether to change the status after the closure of consultation, set a date to implement the change and inform the Secretary of State of the implementation date. The governing body cannot rescind the decision to change status but may modify the implementation date after consulting the local education authority.
</p>

<a name="50118-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a>The new consultation proposes that community or voluntary controlled school governing bodies must now make a proposal, publish it and allow only four weeks, not six weeks, for consultation. At the end of that period the governing body now must consider all objections and comments and determine whether the school should convert to foundation status.
</p>

<a name="50118-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>It does not appear from the proposed regulations that there is anything to ensure that the four-week period does not fall in the school holidays&#151;a point I have already raised with the Minister&#151;and the revised procedure does not require the governing body to consult before making the proposal, although it is described as &quot;advisable&quot; to check with the LEA what rights and liabilities might be apportioned to the school through a change of category. Once the proposal is made, the governing body is required to publish a notice in various places but it does not have to inform the LEA.
</p>

<a name="50118-13_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>This rapid shift to foundation status has both pros and cons. We know that there are some advantages in foundation status&#151;or there have been&#151;in terms of independence. But, given the degree of independence that is now available to community schools, there is really remarkably little difference.
</p>

<a name="50118-13_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Under the heading &quot;Freedoms and flexibilities for foundation schools&quot;, the sole example described in the consultation document issued by the Government concerns the Government&#039;s wish,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a>&quot;to encourage foundation secondary schools to acquire foundations which will be able to appoint the majority of the governing body of the school&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-13_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>in addition to owning land on trust for them.

</p>

<a name="50118-13_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>Schools may acquire a foundation in three ways: establishing a bespoke foundation; joining with two or more other schools to establish a foundation body; or through an existing charity with appropriate educational objectives acting as a foundation.
</p>

<a name="50118-13_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>At present, where a foundation school has a foundation, the foundation may appoint at least two governors but no more than a quarter of the governing body places. It is proposed that the foundation will in future be able to appoint a majority of up to two of the governing body places. This would obviously mean a major change in the constitution of governing bodies, principally at the expense of elected parent governors. These would be reduced under the proposals from at <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_685"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 685</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

least one-third, which is required under both the 1998 Act and the 2002 Act reconstitutions, to at least one&#151;only one&#151;parent governor, with the foundation governors including a sufficient number of people eligible as parent governors to make up at least one-third when counted with the parent governors. In other words, parents elected by governors would be replaced by parents appointed by the foundation. This is justified with the assertion that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a>&quot;experience suggests that the backing of the foundation can help strengthen a school&#039;s mission and ethos, and inject drive and dynamism into school leadership&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-13_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>I understand what the Government are saying but we have to beware this push towards bodies that are not   democratically accountable. Increasingly we are establishing half-way bodies, such as the foundation trusts in the National Health Service, which do not have direct accountability to anyone.
</p>

<a name="50118-13_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>The danger in this is that there is no local democratic accountability for the decisions made by foundation bodies. Indeed, local councillors cannot even be members of foundation bodies. If increasing amounts of education land and property are under the control of these bodies&#151;or, indeed, under the control of simple foundations&#151;it will be increasingly difficult for the local education authority to manage the education estate for the whole community. This runs counter to the Government&#039;s policy of developing extended schools and the successful implementation of the children&#039;s services agenda.
</p>

<a name="50118-13_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>So, once again, there is a contradiction in what the Government are trying to do. There is an issue in that we are establishing bodies that have control over considerable finances, but they are bodies which are appointed rather than elected. Ultimately, we, as a country, put great store by the principle of no taxation without representation. This House has no purview over money Bills, which are for the House of Commons because it is the directly elected House. If we carry that principle forward, we have to beware of establishing new organisations which we believe to be representative but which are appointed. I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>I expect local authorities to ensure that local people have the fullest opportunity to make representations about any proposals which are published. I do not believe, however, that it is necessary to make provision for this on the face of the Bill. It is more appropriately a matter for guidance to local authorities on publishing proposals.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>As I have already explained, this part of the Bill provides for a two-stage process under which local authorities first invite proposals for new schools, then publish all proposals submitted along with any proposals of their own. Those submitting proposals in response to a preliminary notice are not required to consult on their proposals.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>Once promoters have submitted their proposals and they have been published by the local authority, there is a six-week period in which local people may make representations about the proposals. I strongly agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that the local authority will wish to manage the process to ensure that this period does not coincide with school holidays; otherwise it will be nugatory and will not achieve the effect intended.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>With that strong assurance or emphasis from me, I hope the noble Baroness will feel minded not to press Amendment No. 127C.

<a name="50118-14_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I thank the Minister for that reply. As I pointed out, Schedule 10 speeds up the consultation process in regard to such issues as the establishment of foundation schools. Some would regard it as &quot;fast-tracking&quot; the route to foundation schools. I therefore took the opportunity to raise the issue of foundation schools, a subject to which we will return on Amendment No. 132ZA. It is an issue about which I feel strongly and I perhaps let my emotions carry me forward a little.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>I thank the Minister for his response. As with everything else, I shall read very carefully what he has said on the consultation procedures. I come back to the general principle that we have already raised: it is important that these consultations are open and above board and that people are given ample time to express their views. There are occasions when it is useful to nudge the Government by having something written on the face of the Bill. For the moment, I shall withdraw the amendment, but I suspect we shall come back to these issues in some form on Report.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para8"></a>

<a name="50118-14_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>Clause 66 [<i>Rationalisation of school places in England</i>]:
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 66 shall stand part of the Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_132"></a>
<a name="50118-14_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   Clause 66 introduces Schedule 11 which contains provision enabling the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_687"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 687</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Secretary of State to direct local education authorities in England, or the governing bodies of maintained schools, to bring forward proposals for the rationalisation of school places.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>The law on rationalisation of school places first appeared in the Education Act 1993, was consolidated by the Education Act 1996 and was updated to the new   school categories of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. The current law on this subject in England and Wales is found in Schedule 7 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>In moving this Question, I have a simple question to lay before the House: why does the Secretary of State need the centralised powers conferred by this clause? Why does he or she need the power to demand the production of plans for the rationalisation of school places, let alone the power to impose plans of the Government&#039;s invention if none is forthcoming? Why, at a time when all parties speak of conferring more power on local schools and local parents, do we want to preserve this central prerogative, this licence for diktat?
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>Even successive Secretaries of State over an 11-year period seem to agree that these powers are not required. Indeed, they have yet to be exercised in relation to a single LEA. They are wholly untested.

</p>

<a name="50118-14_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>The schedule also imposes duties which have been equally neglected. These include a requirement which has been on the statute book since 1993 that the Secretary of State set out principles which local education authorities should apply in bringing forward school reorganisation proposals. No Secretary of State has yet done so. This schedule is manifestly redundant. Or is the present incumbent proposing to be more active in this respect? If so, perhaps the Minister could shed some light on the Government&#039;s aims and thinking on the rationalisation of school places.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>I also draw your Lordships&#039; attention to the default criteria&#151;also pristine and unused&#151;which enable the Secretary of State to make his or her own proposals for school reorganisation and the subsequent local inquiry, as detailed in Schedule 11. We are entitled to ask how this unused power might work in practice. How, and why, should a Secretary of State set about determining the optimal provision of school places in my native Bolton, for instance, or in any other part of the country? This must surely be a matter for local schools and for local people. So let us undo the straitjacket of regulation and set our schools free.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>We would scrap the additional places rule and enable good schools to expand to meet parental demand. We would allow new schools to be created by charitable bodies. We would promote diversity, excellence and choice, and we would have no need for central direction or a Schedule 11 or a Clause 66.

</p>

<a name="50118-14_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>Not only is the clause undesirable, it is also unworkable now that academies have been included in school rationalisation provision. In practice, academies cannot be easily closed, for under Section 483(2) of the Education Act 1996, the Secretary of State has to give a notice period of not less than seven years, should he or she decide to maintain an academy no longer.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 688</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-14_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>This is a serious issue for neighbouring authorities which are committed to having a high proportion of academies. For example, Hackney is understood to want to convert all its secondary schools into academies. The neighbouring boroughs of Islington, Haringey, Newham and Tower Hamlets propose to have one academy or none. Given the likely attractiveness of academies to parents because of the capital resources and additional support available to them, it is unlikely that academies will suffer a shortfall in applicants, even with falling rolls. More pupils will travel further distances and there will be an emptying of school places in neighbouring boroughs.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>There are also implications for the fundamental duty of local education authorities to secure sufficient schools for secondary education to meet the age, aptitude and ability of the local population, as detailed in Section 14 of the Education Act 1996.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>I believe this is another area of possible concern, and I would welcome the Minister&#039;s thoughts on it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_133"></a>
<a name="50118-14_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   Along with the names of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, and the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, my name is attached to the Question whether Clause 66 should stand part. Specifically, my name is attached to Amendment No.   127D, to which I shall speak shortly.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>Clause 66 is a very short clause, consisting of one sentence. Its title is &quot;Rationalisation of school places in England&quot; and it states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;Schedule 11 contains provisions enabling the Secretary of State to direct local education authorities in England, or the governing bodies of schools maintained by them, to bring forward proposals for the rationalisation of school places, and for such proposals to be made by him&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-14_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>What cheek, if I may say so&#151;what absolute cheek. Why should the Secretary of State be able to tell local authorities what they should do with school places? Either we believe in local government and local accountability or we do not, and I suppose the answer is that successive governments have overruled all elements of local accountability. One has very little faith in them giving local authorities the chance to cope for themselves with their own decision on such issues.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>I have a great deal of sympathy with the general thrust of the arguments put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, for that reason. We feel that this is a matter for local action and local decision-making, and there is no reason why the Secretary of State should have to intervene.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>Having said that, Amendment No. 127D is a probing amendment asking the Government to tell us a little more about their proposals for expanding popular schools. Paragraph 25 of the five-year strategy that I talked about earlier states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>&quot;There is no &#039;surplus places rule&#039; that prevents schools from expanding. All successful and popular schools may propose to expand, and we strongly support them in doing so where they believe they can sustain their quality. We have introduced dedicated capital funding to encourage expansion, and have given strong guidance to local decision-makers that they should allow expansion in all but exceptional circumstances&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 689</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-14_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>Paragraph 26 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a>&quot;We will introduce a fast-track process to speed up expansion to take less than twelve weeks (unless there is an appeal); and we will reinforce the existing strong presumption that expansion proposals should be agreed&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-14_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>To some extent, we talked about this in terms of Schedule 10 and some of the amendments on the fast-track expansion process. I was talking about it earlier in relation to foundation schools, but it is also an expansion process for the popular schools.

</p>

<a name="50118-14_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>Interestingly, last week&#039;s <i>Times Educational Supplement</i> had a look at how far head teachers want to follow this through. In a survey of some 45 heads of top comprehensives, two thirds said they would not accept more pupils despite overwhelming parental demand. Many heads said that it was not practical for them to expand. Several did not have enough land, while others felt that expansion would change the school&#039;s character, making it much less attractive to parents.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>Sir Alan Steer, head of the Seven Kings High School in Ilford, Essex&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, who is not in his place at the moment, probably knows it very well&#151;said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>&quot;The principle of stack &#039;em high, sell &#039;em cheap may work in supermarkets but it is not a recipe for successful schools&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-14_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a>A lot of people feel that there are great dangers in the &quot;stack &#039;em high, sell &#039;em cheap&quot; proposal here.
<a name="time_13"></a>
<a name="50118-14_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50118-14_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a>In relation to this proposal, the National Association of School Governors has said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;Expanding one school means contracting others in an area. Pupils in these schools are every bit as entitled to a good education as those fortunate enough to be in the more &#039;successful&#039; schools&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-14_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>That raises a difficult and important issue for the Government. You can expand popular schools but, however hard you do so, they are still going to be oversubscribed. You can never meet enough demand. We have to make sure that we do not have any schools that are not providing a high quality education. More emphasis needs to be put on upgrading schools that are less popular, rather than expanding schools that are very popular.
</p>

<a name="50118-14_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>David Hart, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;Expanding popular schools, closing unsuccessful schools and creating more academies may well appeal electorally. But an unlicensed education market could all too easily damage the education of pupils in those schools that descend into an irretrievable spiral of decline&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-14_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>We all know schools where that has happened. They lose pupils, and there is a rapid downward spiral.

</p>

<a name="50118-14_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>Can the Minister tell us more about what the Government mean by the proposals and their implementation of them? Will they work out in practice, without creating schools that are planning blighted and will become sink schools providing a poor education for those who are unfortunate enough to have to attend them?

<a name="50118-15_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   I would like to expand a little on what the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has said on the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_690"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 690</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Government&#039;s attitude towards fast-tracking the expansion of successful schools. I can see why they would want to do that.
</p>

<a name="50118-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>Can the Minister tell us how that might need to be balanced by caring for a community in an area of social deprivation, where the school is very important to parents? How would they be engaged in lifelong learning and in the life of a school? We should recognise that such schools should be helped to increase their performance, to do a better job and to enrich the life of those communities, rather than letting the successful schools   expand in the leafy suburbs and letting the kids from deprived areas go to them. That would create a risk of increased truancy&#151;rather than engagement in schoolwork&#151;and that would be to their disadvantage.
</p>

<a name="50118-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, raises an important point of social policy here.
</p>




<p><a name="st_135"></a>
<a name="50118-15_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   The answer to the question put by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, has already been provided in my noble friend&#039;s outline of the Conservative Party&#039;s policy. That would allow people to found new schools with relative freedom, so that the parts of the community that are not already addressed by successful schools can be addressed by people who have the enthusiasm, innovation and ideas necessary to tackle the more difficult locations in cities and elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="50118-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>That is exactly what has happened in the Netherlands and elsewhere. The entrepreneurs have not tried to cherry-pick the leafy suburbs because they are already well served by good schools. They have gone for the areas where there are lots of customers crying out for the good schools that are not being provided at the moment. The system has worked extremely well in other countries, and there is no reason why it should not work well here.
</p>

<a name="50118-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a>We seem to be on a roll in producing good ideas in education at the moment. I hope that, when the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, replies to this debate, he will be cautious in criticising this. I suspect that it will be Government policy shortly. They have been following in our footsteps for some while. It is comforting to observe that&#151;except that by stealing all our good ideas they make it hard for us to make a contrast between our parties at the election. None the less, the latest thing that Tony Blair has said on this matter suggests that the Government are moving in the direction of allowing more access for the independent sector&#151;I mean that in the wider sense, not independent schools&#151;into the provision of state education. And a great thing it will be too.
</p>

<a name="50118-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>I entirely agree with my noble friend in opposing the clause. The Secretary of State has&#151;and should have&#151;no role in this matter. It is a matter for local discretion and local decisions. There are many factors that contribute to the question of whether it is necessary or appropriate to hold open vacant school places.
</p>

<a name="50118-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a>If a successful school expands, vacancies will occur in another school. In a way, that is an opportunity. You have the chance to re-build it and so on, but it takes time to agree that. You may need to make <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_691"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 691</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

structural changes. You hold those vacancies open because you do not want to go through the catharsis of closing the school. If, for example, one of your schools is a city academy which proposes creationism, you may feel that you do not wish to compel people to attend it by restricting school places.
</p>

<a name="50118-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>I would hate the idea that my children were forced to attend such an academy. I am delighted that such places exist. If people want to start schools proposing their own cultures and ideas, I am all in favour of variety. But I do not like the idea of my children being forced to go to such establishments because the Secretary of State has said, &quot;We must squeeze surplus school places. There are a thousand places at this city academy, and they must be filled with those local children&quot;. That is untenable.
</p>

<a name="50118-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>If we are going to have variety in schools and allow the more eccentric beliefs to be propagated through the city academies that are becoming ever more popular, we must allow a surplus of school places to allow proper parental choice. Having a surplus of school places is essential to parental choice. If there is no surplus of school places, parents have no choice in the aggregate, because they have to fill the places that are there. It is only if you have a surplus&#151;or a potential surplus&#151; that you can move between one school and another from year to year.
</p>

<a name="50118-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>For all those reasons, the question of the right level of surplus school places has to be set locally, in response to particular local conditions. In the past, we were centralist and imagined that we could control education from the centre and make it better that way. That clearly was not right. The changes that the Government have introduced mean that that is not consistent with what they have done or with where they say they are going. Considering our policy, it is not consistent with where we are likely to end up. I hope that the Government will drop it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_136"></a>
<a name="50118-15_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   The eloquence of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, in advocating the policy does not cause the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, and I are making. There is not necessarily an antithesis between what I was saying and what you are arguing. I am concerned that, in making such decisions, the   needs of particular communities&#151;particularly communities of social deprivation&#151;should be weighed in the balance of policy decisions.
</p>




<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="50118-15_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I will follow my previous practice of not being drawn on whose policy was pinched from whom, or whether that happened at all. We invented all our policies ourselves through a process called immaculate conception. I shall go no further.

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 692</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, spoke clearly and accurately about the provenance of that power. There is nothing new in the provisions. They started in 1993, moved into 1996 and have their current form as a result of the 1998 Act. The provisions in this schedule replace those in Schedule 7 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. They are re-enacted in one place for convenience. I always regret it when parliamentary draftsmen do things for convenience&#151;it brings more things to the attention of the Committee&#151;but that is in the nature of the job.
</p>

<a name="50118-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>The powers are reserve powers. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, argues that as they have never been used&#151;and I agree that they have never been used&#151;they are not required. I do not think that that is true. As I shall explain more in a moment, although we accept that there will have to be some vacant places in the system&#151;the management of an appropriate number of vacant places is one of the challenges that a local authority has to face, and they largely do it well&#151;it is not inconceivable that there could be situations when a local authority, because of its own internal difficulties, failed to face up to the responsibility to do so.
</p>

<a name="50118-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>I hope that that never happens. It has not happened so far. However, we would be a foolish government if we said that it will never happen. It therefore seems to me that a sensible government should have a statutory provision in the cupboard that imposes no burdens whatever on local authorities in practice, but is a protective device come the day when something goes   seriously wrong with a local authority and its community leadership function, as long as that government are not tempted to use those powers to interfere unduly with processes that are working well enough. We do not intend to behave in that manner.
</p>

<a name="50118-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>I think that we would be foolish if, in recognising the challenge that school reorganisations and surplus places creates for local authorities, we did not have a protective power in reserve just in case it might be necessary in future. I would take a different view on this if the existence of that power was burdensome to local government. However, it is not.
</p>

<a name="50118-15_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>I can also assure the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, that the powers are designed to deal with long-term chronic problems in an area if all other measures have failed. They would not be concerned with increases in admission numbers at individual schools, which are a matter for the admission authority for the school, or with objections to the school adjudicator.

</p>

<a name="50118-15_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>I should also touch briefly on the issue of the surplus places rule. There is no surplus places rule; there might have been in the past under the previous administration, but there is not one now. If memory serves me right, there has not been one since 1998. By that, I mean that it is government policy that school places should be located where parents want them. There is therefore a strong presumption that proposals to expand successful and popular schools, which is what parents often want, should normally be approved. The fact that there are surplus places elsewhere in the area does not necessarily <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_693"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 693</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

mean that that should not be approved. That may give comfort to parts of the Committee but cause increasing discomfort to other parts. Again, that is the nature of the role.
</p>

<a name="50118-15_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>Local authorities have been encouraged to take action to remove surplus places especially where schools have a quarter or more of their places unfilled. Different judgments need to be made in rural areas, for reasons which I think the House will understand and to which noble Lords will be sensitive. The Secretary of State wants to encourage local authorities to organise provision in order to ensure that places are located where parents want them and to encourage them to take positive action to remove any unfilled vacancies at schools to which parents do not choose to send their children.
</p>

<a name="50118-15_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>We opened a discussion&#151;using, I think, the illustration of Hackney and academies&#151;on whether that provision would cause wreckage to other parts of the system. However, academies are set up only when they take over failing schools. Therefore, they are a replacement for existing places when the children in that school have demonstrably not been receiving a decent education. If the argument that the quality of education in an academy was so outstandingly good that other parents wanted to come in from other areas or other boroughs were right, then that might be an incentive to the other authorities to think about using academies in their own areas.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>Undoubtedly, the capital may make a difference. But my experience is that parents will send their child to a school with pretty poor capital plant if the quality of education is good, but will not send their child to a school with a spanking new, high-quality physical plant if the teaching is poor and the results hopeless. So I cannot agree that capital investment alone will be the draw. The quality of outcomes will drive it.

<a name="50118-15_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, raised the issue of fast-tracking successful schools and how to balance the importance of schools in other areas. He is quite right. A local authority has to treat seriously, as most of them do, the importance of improving weak or poorly performing schools, an issue which we have talked about previously. That is why the school improvement partner is so important and why many other provisions in the Bill are so important. One of the remedies available to local authorities is to decide that they will promote an academy in that area; in other words, not just sitting and watching the rot continue but taking vigorous action. Those issues have to be weighed in the balance when judgments are being made about the balance of future provision.

<a name="50118-16_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   Perhaps I may quiz the Minister a bit further. He sees these very much as reserve powers&#151;clearly that is how they have been used in the past&#151;but I thought that one of the Government&#039;s innovations was the ability to place a local authority that was seriously failing on special measures and take over the management of its business. Surely, in those circumstances, whoever was put in charge of the local authority would be able, among the other things they did, to rationalise school places. So are we saying that there is a category of failing authority that is insufficiently bad that it should be placed under what might be called special measures but to which the Secretary of State would none the less wish to apply the measures in Clause 66? I find that very hard to comprehend.
</p>




<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="50118-16_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   It is conceptually possible. However, I shall try to make a fuller response by going away and reflecting on whether there is not in fact a duplication of powers. Taking the gist of the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, I shall examine my argument that we would be foolish to throw away the capacity to deal with exceptional circumstances when it is not burdensome and there are no other ways of dealing with the circumstances.
</p>




<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="50118-16_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I should like to go back to the issue of the city academies and the example of Hackney. I think that we touched on the issue earlier today. I believe that there are a number of proposals to establish city academies in Hackney. Inevitably, those will spill over to other education authorities. Particularly initially, city academies are often seen as very attractive to parents. Hackney is bordered by Islington, Newham and Tower Hamlets&#151;a whole series of London boroughs. Attempts by those boroughs to cope with their own schools can be affected by proposals to establish academies.
</p>

<a name="50118-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>The Committee may recall that one of the points that we made when we were talking about consultation was that other, adjacent local education authorities should be involved in the consultation provisions. That is one of the problems that arises. If there is a duty on a local authority to take a strategic view on the provision of facilities within its own area, where some schools are popular but others are less so, the decisions which that local authority is taking could be totally <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_695"></a>

lost by decisions that other local authorities are taking. Therefore, regarding the establishment of academies, you need to keep a track of what is happening and where.
</p>




<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="50118-16_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I thank the noble Baroness for giving way. I do not wish to prolong the debate, but there is a small danger that we are drifting into the question of British antipathy to excellence. If, as a consequence of an academy or a foundation school being founded, the quality of education for the children that it is serving improves such that other parents, either in that borough or in other boroughs, wish to bring their children to that school, it is a problem of success, not of failure. It is a spur to the local authorities in those other areas to do something about the quality of their schools better to meet parents&#039; aspirations.

<p><a name="st_142"></a>
<a name="50118-16_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   That was a good Conservative philosophy. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford, for her support for the general principle of the amendment but take issue with her about allowing good and popular schools to extend. We on these Benches believe fundamentally that where heads and governing bodies wish to expand their schools, they should be allowed to do so. As my noble friend Lord Lucas said, we welcome the provision of new schools and new providers and believe that these are the drivers of increasing standards. I thank the Minister for his detailed answer and look forward to receiving further information on the academies.

<a name="50118-16_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>The reason for retaining Clause 66 seemed to be that somewhere in the dim future a local authority might get it horribly wrong.

We believe that there are many anomalies in Clause 66.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>After Clause 69, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_5"></a><br>
   &quot;ABOLITION OF THE INDEPENDENT APPEALS PANELS

<br>
   Sections 67 and 68 and Schedule 18 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 (c. 31) shall cease to have effect.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_144"></a>The noble Baroness said: I trust that the intent of the amendment is clear for all to see, but I acknowledge that our draftsmanship has, perhaps, been less precise. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_696"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 696</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

The amendment of the provisions of the 1998 Act identified under our new clause would achieve what we have in mind. However, the Minister should have no fear. No doubt we will return to this matter at a later stage and have the amendment redrafted to include the required sections.
</p>

<a name="50118-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a>The independent appeals panels are discredited, unpopular and widely distrusted by parents and pupils alike. Reforming the system is, therefore, a priority. A couple of years ago two boys were expelled from Glyn Technology School in Surrey after making death threats against a teacher, only to be reinstated on appeal by the appeals panel. Such interventions ride roughshod over the judgment and authority of teachers and must not be allowed to recur. Parents also dislike the panel. They find it secretive in its operation, confusing and intimidating&#151;which are further reasons why we believe that the system cannot continue in its present form.
</p>

<a name="50118-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a>So we return to a question of philosophy and how best to run our education system. We on these Benches believe that head teachers should have complete control over expulsions. Expulsion is the last resort for head teachers, but it is critical that they have this option. Why should a class&#151;or even a whole school&#151;suffer because of the behaviour of one pupil? We believe that head teachers&#039; decisions should not be second-guessed by remote appeals panels. Head teachers should have the final say.
</p>

<a name="50118-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a>However, a child&#039;s future is far too precious simply to be written off because they are expelled from school. Today, too many expelled children simply fall out of education altogether, wasting their potential, and often get into crime. They deserve, as much as anyone, a decent education to get back on track for a successful and fulfilling future. Yet there are currently only 4,000 places in pupil referral units (PRUs) in England, but last year there were 9,500 permanently excluded pupils in the country. That means that almost 6,000 young people were last year in danger of falling through the cracks in our education system. More worrying still, less than half of those pupils in PRUs received a single GCSE pass and less than 5 per cent received five or more GCSE passes. Half of all children who are expelled receive less than 20 hours education per week.

</p>

<a name="50118-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a>I am sure that the Minister will ask what the alternative is if there are no appeals panels. Our answer to that problem is a new approach by providing new turnaround schools, which will replace PRUs. We will increase the number of places from 4,000 to 24,000, so that there will be a safety net for those expelled from school. They will follow an established curriculum and pupils will receive accredited qualifications. Turnaround schools will be required to publish their attendance and performance figures.
</p>

<a name="50118-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a>Today we have a system of independent appeal panels which has lost the confidence of parents and pupils and provides inadequately for excluded pupils. The amendment will both restore the authority of head <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_697"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 697</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

teachers and staff and provides an example of how we could help our more difficult pupils to lead more productive lives. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_145"></a>
<a name="50118-16_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   It is odd that we have reached exclusions at this point. I do not wish to speak about the independent appeals panels in particular. I do not fully share the noble Baroness&#039;s doubts about them, although there have been glitches along the way. The issue of exclusions is one to which we shall return in Part 4. It is vital that we cope and ensure that the pupils involved receive an adequate education. The great danger with the Conservative Party&#039;s proposals is that you could end up with grandiose, but failing, schools. Can the Minister say more about how this matter fits into the Bill?
</p>




<p><a name="st_146"></a>
<a name="50118-16_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, acknowledged that the drafting of the amendment was not quite right. Oppositions are sometimes allowed not to get it quite right. She is, indeed, referring to parts of Section 52 of the Education Act 2002, which currently provides for the setting up of independent appeals panels. But she made a good fist of explaining why she thought that the appeals panels had outlived their usefulness and I hope to counter that, while taking account of her description of the Conservatives&#039; policy on turnaround schools, for which we are all grateful.
<a name="time_15"></a>
<a name="50118-16_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50118-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a>I hope I can develop the theme of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. She said she did not fully agree with what the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said; indeed, we do not agree at all with what the noble Baroness said in relation to appeals panels. They were introduced by a Conservative government and they first came into operation in 1987.
</p>

<a name="50118-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a>I want to reflect on behaviour and how important we believe it is to establish the highest standards of behaviour in children. We want the best possible mechanisms for ensuring that behaviour and discipline are properly organised and effected in schools. In that context, it is also important to recognise that both the inspector&#039;s report and the DfES survey of head teachers reflect that the behaviour of the vast majority of pupils is good or acceptable.
</p>

<a name="50118-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a>As the Secretary of State said recently at the north of England conference, universal high standards require universal good behaviour and parents put that very near the top of their priorities for schools. In some places behaviour is not all that we want it to be, which is why we put it very near the top of our list as well. We are determined to ensure that behaviour is as good as it can be and to put an end, as far as possible, to unacceptable behaviour.
</p>

<a name="50118-16_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a>At its most acute, bad behaviour leads to exclusions, which are related to this amendment and to the appeals panels. However, for different reasons, I believe that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_698"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 698</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the noble Baroness is wrong to want to do away with appeals panels. They are a very necessary safeguard for pupils and parents; they are needed in the interests of natural justice and they comply with the Human Rights Act.

</p>

<a name="50118-16_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a>Yes, of course, we support the head teachers in the exercise of their authority. We are entirely committed to backing that authority when pupils&#039; behaviour warrants exclusion. We have made it very clear in guidance that heads can permanently exclude pupils who are very disruptive or violent. Guidance on exclusion to appeals panels backs that up.
</p>

<a name="50118-16_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a>Abolishing appeals panels would inevitably lead to a very sharp increase in legal action by parents against schools and more cases would be brought to court. I cannot believe that the majority of parents would want that. At present, there are about 1,000 exclusion appeals each year, of which in no more than six cases do parents seek judicial review. That total would increase significantly as parents would not have recourse to any other independent review of a school&#039;s decision. That would be costly, in time and money, to everyone involved: the estimated cost would be in excess of &#163;2,000, which would fall on schools, parents and local authorities.

</p>

<a name="50118-16_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a>Neither do I agree that parents find appeals panels unpopular. A recent national survey found that 60 per cent of parents wanted to keep appeals panels. That is very significant. Neither do I believe that a disproportionate number of pupils are reinstated. Independent appeals panels do not reinstate large numbers of excluded pupils. After consideration by an independent appeals panel, out of a total of 9,729 permanent exclusions in England and Wales in 2002&#150;03&#151;the latest figure&#151;only 173 excluded pupils were reinstated, which is 1.8 per cent of the total who were excluded.
</p>

<a name="50118-16_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a>I know that concerns have been expressed about decisions by the appeals panels to reinstate particular pupils. In the Glyn case, one of the minority of cases in which the panel reinstated the pupil, that was not a reason. We have to be very careful not to change the law because occasionally there are bad and injudicious decisions. The reason for the independent review is so that we can sort out this kind of matter.
</p>

<a name="50118-16_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a>At the same time, to improve on the process itself, in January 2003, the composition of panels was changed to ensure that they better reflect the realities of school life. Now, we have a three-member panel comprising a serving or recently retired head teacher, or in Wales another education practitioner, a serving or recently serving governor and a lay member who takes the chair. We believe that by making those changes, the panels are more in touch with contemporary classroom conditions. Moreover, since January 2003, in deciding whether to reinstate a pupil, powers have been required to balance the interests of the excluded pupil against the interests of all other members of the school community, including pupils and teaching and support staff. Other changes that were introduced at the same time concern reflecting the realities of the classroom.
</p>

<a name="50118-16_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a>We have also made improvements to the training to which appeals panels must have regard. By law, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_699"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 699</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

appeals panels have to have regard to guidance. Clearly, we want to ensure that they are well trained in what the guidance requires them to do, and to be updated whenever there are changes in the law. To that end, since 2001, a training pack has been available to train panel members in England. It has since been revised to reflect changes in exclusions and a few panels are finding that extremely helpful.
</p>

<a name="50118-16_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a>The noble Baroness asked about PRUs. We do not want children to be segregated in all cases; we want them to be reintegrated whenever possible so that they can enjoy the beneficent effect of school life and learn to behave better in circumstances in which people can help them, not least so that they have access to the full curriculum.
</p>

<a name="50118-16_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a>Last year, 20,000 pupils attended a PRU at some point, but not all of them had been excluded; some attended for other reasons. We must have regard to the relative costs of putting children into PRUs; &#163;10,000 a year compared with only &#163;2,500 for the average secondary pupil. Although they do not teach the full national curriculum, they should offer a balanced and broadly based curriculum, including citizenship, emotional health and well-being, drug education and appropriate behavioural support. PRUs perform a very important function.
</p>

<a name="50118-16_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>On turnaround schools, I share reservations expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that one might be creating a huge ghetto of children in those schools, rather than looking at ways of integrating them back into the community with support.
</p>

<a name="50118-16_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>In the light of all those reasons&#151;the human rights; the fact that parents support the appeals panels; the fact that the panels work and very few conclude with the reinstatement of pupils; and, most important, the   safeguards that they offer parents&#151;I hope that the noble Baroness will reconsider and withdraw her amendment.

<a name="50118-17_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton </b>   moved Amendment No. 130:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>After Clause 69, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_6"></a><br>
   &quot;CLOSURE OF RURAL PRIMARY SCHOOLS

<br>
(1)   No primary school located in a rural area, as defined by the Office of National Statistics under its Rural and Urban Area Classification 2004, may be closed without the approval of parents of registered children of that school.


<br>
(2)   The appropriate authority shall organise, fund and conduct a ballot to determine the views of registered parents, and shall inform the parents of their right to participate.


<br>
(3)   The results of the ballot shall be communicated by the appropriate authority to each registered parent, governing body and the Secretary of State.


<br>
(4)   Any ballot shall be invalid unless fifty per cent of the registered parents participate.


<br>
(5)   No further ballot may be held within 7 years of the first ballot being held.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_149"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a relatively simple and straightforward new clause designed to safeguard small, rural primary schools, as defined by the Office for National Statistics under the Rural and Urban Area Classification 2004. It would require that a ballot of registered parents be held before such a school was closed. The ballot, either way, would be a simple majority vote, which would need at least 50 per cent of the registered parents to participate in order for it to be valid. Even if the amendment is perhaps not the most beautiful piece of parliamentary draftsmanship, at least the intent is clear.
</p>

<a name="50118-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>I am aware that the Government have proclaimed &quot;a presumption against closure&quot; in regard to such schools. However, the amendment goes one step further in giving parents a clear role in the continued future of small rural primaries. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth said, the importance of the role played by small schools in rural communities cannot be overestimated. Tired old arguments that small schools cannot cope with the curriculum are being<i> </i>thoroughly refuted in ways that the public understands, in government inspections and national tests. Small rural schools are doing as well as, and often better than, the rest.
</p>

<a name="50118-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>The potential of village schools to serve wider community needs is an additional key factor in our amendment. We are aware of the usual ways in which such facilities can be used by members of the community. However, where no adequate meeting space is available, where no local centre for minor medical matters, clinics or prescriptions is available, even where no post office exists, it is well within the realms of possibility that some such provision could be based on the existing public plant that the school represents.
</p>

<a name="50118-17_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a>The modifications needed to provide such services, mainly space, could also incorporate the additional space that many small schools need for private meetings with parents, improved library facilities, a staff room, an office and a medical room for sick children.
</p>

<a name="50118-17_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a>With the permission of the Committee, I would like to give just one example of the way in which a rural school can be incorporated to play a key role in the life <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_701"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 701</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of the community. At Hook Norton in Oxfordshire, a rebuilt village school was designed to house an adult education wing. It is used by both the school and the community, sometimes in shared activities.
</p>

<a name="50118-17_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a>Modern technology also considerably enhances the potential of small schools to work together. The same technology is also available to promote wider links between communities. Many other examples are known, and the possibilities are endless, not least at a time when government policy seeks to strengthen rural life.

</p>

<a name="50118-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>We are also keen to see local transport needs focusing on provision based on existing school needs. I hope that it might answer some of the reservations of the right reverend Prelate. Currently, big coaches trundle around narrow country lanes twice a day, belching diesel fumes everywhere and carrying handfuls of children to school and home. A community minibus could do the same job. It could be available during the day to serve other school needs but also to take people into town, to the surgery, collect prescriptions and even the occasional outing. The investment in thousands of minibuses would be large, but the returns in enhanced public transport provision would be enormously beneficial and long-term.
</p>

<a name="50118-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>Community use could justify local charging that would offset the original education budget costs. This proposal extends the kind of principles and provision in the present post bus systems used in remoter parts of the nation.
</p>

<a name="50118-17_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>The debate is only just starting. We are only just waking up to the fact that village schools are central to the proper concerns of the countryside. The school provides a dynamic focus for families across the social spectrum, and no debate about housing, employment, conservation or services is complete without proper reference to the school. Yet, documents from most rural organisations rarely mention village schools.

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>In its report on small school performance in tests and inspections, Ofsted not only affirmed their educational credentials but argued that, taken together with their community virtues, there was a place for the small school in national provision. Now we need only to exploit those virtues and capitalise on the massive potential that such places represent. They serve as a fitting testament of a quality of life and purpose that can serve as an example in all schools and all communities. I beg to move.

<a name="50118-17_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I support what has been said about rural primary schools. I would like the Minister to clarify whether the amendment would apply to Wales as well as England or whether it relates totally to England.

</p>

<a name="50118-17_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>My experience has been long and sometimes painful as regards the closure of rural primary schools. The problem is that the definition of a small school is not clear. In some local authorities, we are talking about a really different moving target. In the area which I represented in another place, for example, there had been a policy of closure of rural schools. In fact, one rural <br>&nbsp;<br>

school per year was closed over a 30-year period. We ground that to a near halt because the local authority had cluster schools instead of small village schools, which were quite effective. The room for manoeuvre for closing more rural schools was extremely limited.
</p>

<a name="50118-17_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>The problem is that a neighbouring authority, with which I am familiar, hung on to having very small rural schools with about 10 or 11 pupils, which became unsustainable in the end. That authority is now faced with the problem of closing a swathe of rural schools of that size.
</p>

<a name="50118-17_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>As I am speaking from a Welsh perspective in this instance, there is an additional problem. There is a linguistic dimension to the matter because the small schools sustain the Welsh language. That is another issue altogether, specific to the National Assembly.

</p>

<a name="50118-17_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>It is important, as has been said, that the schools become a resource centre for the local village. In some more progressive authorities, new village halls have been built and leisure facilities added to them, which has enabled a much more sustainable rural community to exist. The problem is that, where rural schools are   closed and the school is a bit tenuous, the school is often the main social cohesive factor in the community. If that is taken away, we have serious problems in sustaining such a community. We all know what happens when post offices, pubs and schools are closed: the community withers on the vine. As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, made clear, the problem of inadequate rural transport can compound all these factors. We need to define what a small rural school is. That obviously differs in remote areas. It is difficult in such areas to sustain rural primary schools. I would like the Minister to state what exactly we are talking about and the circumstances in terms of numbers and to pay attention to what has already happened. Many rural schools have already been closed, with little room to manoeuvre to close further schools, if the Government are not going to give a commitment to the sustainability of our rural communities.

<a name="50118-18_spnew0"></a><b> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </b>   I shall not repeat what I said earlier as regards this and preceding amendments. The arguments are not absolutist. I have a huge amount of sympathy for what the noble Lord and the noble Baroness have just said. The issues are finely balanced. I can see their merits. In the end, I would resist the amendment. I am fully committed to rural schools and the rural way of life, but I believe that the onus should be on the school organisation committee and the adjudicator to make the final judgments. We are talking about complex issues here. It is about the relationship between a particular institution in a rural community, whether it is a school or something else, and the rest of the network. That applies to post offices and Methodist chapels and possibly even to parish churches. We seem to be the only people left in some of these communities, so I do not speak with distant coldness. This is a difficult matter, but I would resist this amendment.

which raised important issues. The noble Baroness presented her case very eloquently and I agree with everything that she said about using rural schools as the heart of the community. A lot of the things that we are intending to do by developing extended schools&#151;both primary and secondary&#151;will have particular relevance and resonance in rural communities. I have seen that in Wales. There is a very bright future for the rural school in the development of family and childcare facilities and the rationalisation of other services. That can give rural schools an important lease of life; the prospects are very bright. I say &quot;Amen&quot; to all that.

</p>

<a name="50118-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>This amendment would prohibit the closure of a rural primary school without a preliminary ballot in which at least 50 per cent of registered parents take part and approve the closure. I understand the intention of protecting rural schools. However, the amendment goes too far in creating too high a threshold and is unnecessary because of the developing policy and practice in maintaining rural schools.
</p>

<a name="50118-18_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, raised the question of whether the new clause would apply to England and   Wales. I shall come on to talk about Wales. Unfortunately, the amendment is deficient because it refers to the Secretary of State rather than to the Welsh Assembly. In order to be comprehensive, it would have to refer to the Welsh Assembly.

</p>

<a name="50118-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a>The noble Baroness referred to the fact that some years ago we introduced a presumption against the closure of rural schools in England. That is now in statutory guidance to decision-makers. Indeed, we have gone further than that because it was reinforced by the rural White Paper in 2000, which set out very clearly the role that we see for the rural school, the importance that we attach to it and the role that it plays. The presumption has been very successful. The rate of closure of rural schools in England has been reduced from an average of 30 a year to an average of five a year. By contrast, the average number of urban school closures is 32 a year. If noble Lords were to look at the accompanying guidance, they would find that it is very detailed about the sorts of evidence&#151;not least on transport implications and the distances that children might be required to travel&#151;that need to be taken into account by the school organisation committee before it contemplates closure. The guidance is impressive in its thoroughness and I commend it to noble Lords. Local education authorities and school organisation committees have to think very carefully about bringing forward proposals.

</p>

<a name="50118-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a>It is not only the guidance: rural schools now have the support of additional policy and funding arrangements. We have responded to the requirements of rural schools. However, the fact remains that local stakeholders and independent adjudicators have decided that, in some cases, it is right that a school should close. The arguments are not always one-way. We have to look realistically at the options that they face. All the arguments have to be taken into account and all proposals have to be decided on their merits. We believe that that is the right way and that, with our presumption against closure, the balance is right.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_704"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 704</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a>In Wales, where there is no presumption against the closure of rural schools, we believe that balance is being attained. I cannot answer the question of the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, about the definition of a small school, but I know that in Wales there is a higher proportion of small rural schools. The reasons are obvious in Powys and Dfyed, areas that the noble Lord knows well. About 14 per cent of primary schools in Wales have 50 or fewer pupils on the roll, compared with around 4 per cent of primary schools in England. There is also significant surplus capacity. The noble Lord will know that there is a need for investment in school buildings in many areas: many of them are Victorian.
</p>

<a name="50118-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a>Against this background, some rationalisation of provision is likely to be required if LEAs are to ensure that a high quality of education is available to all children. That is the policy challenge. Guidance issued in 2002 makes clear that the priority for educational provision in rural areas is access to high quality education. The case for the closure of any school has to be robust and any decisions are focused on educational issues and on using resources as effectively as possible.

</p>

<a name="50118-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>When we come to the amendment, I take comfort from the right reverend Prelate. He said that he did not believe that one group of people should be responsible and that he had faith in the capacity of the school organisation committee and the independent adjudicator to come to correct decisions. He repeated that when he spoke on the amendment. It seems to us that the important thing is that any closure proposal provides for appropriate consultation and the fullest possible consultation with parents. In a small primary school, that would probably include consultation with all parents. That is the gold standard. However, there may be circumstances where there would be valid educational reasons to close a school in spite of parental objections. We all know how hard it is as a pupil, a parent or a member of the community to contemplate it in those circumstances.
</p>

<a name="50118-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>We believe that the amendment would raise the barriers against closures too high. In some cases, schools can become too small to offer the rich educational experience that we want all pupils to have. It could be that a child would be the only pupil of that age and gender in the school. In other cases, there may well be alternative provision nearby.
</p>




<p><a name="st_153"></a>
<a name="50118-18_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I thank the Minister for giving way. Does she agree with me that the quality of the education has to be equated with the social well-being of the children? In some instances that I know of, children of four, five, six and seven are being asked to make a round trip of 50 miles a day. That has to be a very important issue in the balance between quality and stress, as it does affect very young children. In many cases, that is why parents oppose the closure of their local school so strongly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_154"></a>
<a name="50118-18_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   Yes, all noble Lords would agree with that. The relationship between well-being, however defined, and educational success and confidence is very clear. Travelling many miles a day is not good for small <br>&nbsp;<br>

children. Every decision-maker would try to avoid it, which is why the guidance for England emphasises transport arrangements and the alternatives.

</p>

<a name="50118-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>These are difficult decisions. Under the present arrangements, parents and others have to be consulted about proposals. Therefore, they have an opportunity to object once the proposals are published. The decision-makers have to take objections or comments into account in reaching their decision. Where the alternatives are acceptable, parents may not be motivated to vote in a ballot. Numbers may be insufficient for a valid ballot. There are all sorts of reasons why we believe that the amendment is not appropriate. Given what I have said about the way that the presumption is working, the way the weight of policy is being directed and the drop in the number of decisions that are closing small rural schools, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel comfortable in withdrawing her amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="50118-18_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, for his support. Indeed, it was our colleagues in the Welsh Assembly who brought this matter to our attention. As the Minister so kindly pointed out, the deficiency of our drafting meant that he did not realise that the amendment covered Wales as well. I keep thinking that perhaps my school report at the end of this Committee stage will be, &quot;Patricia could do better&quot;.
</p>

<a name="50118-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, also mentioned social activity. I often think that the closure of two things knocks the heart out of a village.

Many local pubs have closed and so we hope we can keep more of our local schools.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="50118-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a>We are conscious that, in promoting this amendment, we are effectively reducing the level of local decision-making and discretion&#151;a matter about which everyone knows I am passionate&#151;but I shall go on to explain why I am putting it forward.

</p>

<a name="50118-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a>We believe that this step is necessary not because of any lack of trust in local authorities but because of the Government&#039;s existing policy towards special needs and inclusion. It is clear that the policy of including more and more children with special educational needs in mainstream schools has not necessarily been satisfactory, benefiting neither pupil nor parent. Indeed, that view is supported by a number of teachers&#039; unions, including NAS/UWT, and it is clear that the Government&#039;s policy is having undue influence on the decision of local authorities to close special schools.
</p>

<a name="50118-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a>In 1983, there were 1,562 special schools in England. In 2003, there were, 1,160&#151;402 fewer. Yet the number of children with the most severe needs in mainstream schools has risen by 49 per cent over the past decade. We also know that during the course of their schooling around a quarter of all pupils will have some form of special needs, whether it be a passing behavioural problem or a more severe permanent disability.
</p>

<a name="50118-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a>Teachers in mainstream schools are having to cope with an increasing number of pupils with special needs. According to a study by the National Foundation for Educational Research, up to 40 per cent of head teachers said that the number of children with special educational needs had risen over the past year, including an increase in pupils with behavioural problems. Of the 320 head teachers surveyed, 58 per cent said that the range of special needs had widened and only 5 per cent said that it had narrowed.
</p>

<a name="50118-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>The Government support a policy of inclusion in which pupils with physical disabilities or behavioural problems, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, can be taught in mainstream schools. Yet schools say that that can be achieved only with considerable extra resources. The study found that almost half the heads surveyed had had to devote more of their budget to specialist equipment and support staff; four out of 10 said that they had been forced to make timetable changes to accommodate special needs pupils; and a third highlighted the impact that the more disruptive pupils had on the atmosphere in the classroom. A number of head teachers said that the parents of children without special needs had voiced concerns about the amount of time that teachers had to devote to special needs pupils.
</p>

<a name="50118-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>There is a danger that the policy of inclusion has gone too far and too fast. We on these Benches want to ensure that children with special needs are not suffering educationally from the policy. We need to ask whether the Government&#039;s policy of inclusive education for disabled children is working or whether children with special needs are being physically included but educationally excluded. We must ask whether disabled children are being failed by the system. At present, 13 per cent of non-disabled young people have no qualifications. The figure for disabled young people is 24 per cent.

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 707</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>We are under no illusion about the sensitivity of this question. We have a moral obligation to do everything we can to ensure that children with special needs receive the best possible care and education that we can provide. However, there must be a realisation that, given the severity of their condition, some of these children will never be able to be incorporated into the mainstream system&#151;nor should we or they try to do that. That is why it is so important that we protect our existing special schools and the excellent work that they do. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_158"></a>
<a name="50118-19_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   I welcome the amendment as a means of calling attention to an issue. Of course, it is right to include the principle, but it does not work unless teachers have the distinctive special skills to respond to those children and unless the resource is adequate to enable them to do so. My limited experience is that those conditions are not met and that therefore the children may not be receiving as good an education as they would if they went to a special school. It is very important to be conscious of this issue and I welcome the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_159"></a>
<a name="50118-19_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   When we debated the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act, which effectively incorporated the inclusion agenda, we on these Benches constantly said to the Minister, &quot;You are willing the ends but you are not willing the means&quot;. That is the problem. The responsibility is pushed down on to local authorities but local authorities have not been given the means to fulfil their responsibilities. One result of the financial provisions now being negotiated is that less and less money is available centrally for local authorities to fulfil their responsibilities under the special educational needs agenda, and that makes it more difficult for them to be responsible.
</p>

<a name="50118-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a>My instinctive reaction to this matter is to ask: why on earth are we putting it back to the Secretary of State? That is not what I would wish because, again, it is something that on the whole must be met at a local level. As I said, it is clear here that the Government have willed the ends by their legislation but they have   not willed the means. Therefore, by putting the responsibility on to the Secretary of State, one is, in effect, putting the baby back in his lap and I feel that currently that is the appropriate thing to do.
</p>




<p><a name="st_160"></a>
<a name="50118-19_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I, too, welcome a debate on this subject but I do not particularly welcome having it in the middle of the debate on this Bill, which does not have much to do with it. However, I welcome it because it is one of the issues for which I have a specific ministerial responsibility. Therefore it is close to my heart and actively on my agenda. I shall say a little more about that in a minute.
</p>

<a name="50118-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>Initially, I shall say why we think that the specifics of the amendment are not appropriate and then I shall speak a little&#151;not too much because this is not the place for it, although there will be opportunities before too long&#151;about our perspective on how the special educational needs of children can be better met in the future.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_708"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 708</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a>Obviously, we are keen to ensure that adequate provision is in place for children and young people with special educational needs. Last February we published the strategy, <i>Removing Barriers to Achievement</i>. Local authorities have a statutory duty to provide sufficient schools in number and character to ensure appropriate education for pupils with special educational needs. That can be in maintained special schools and supported mainstream schools, both in and out of the authority, and by taking up places in non-maintained and independent schools.
</p>

<a name="50118-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>We are clear on this matter, and it is strange how throughout debate on the Bill, even when dealing with closely connected clauses, the parties opposite have hopped between being centralisers and decentralisers. But local authorities are best placed to respond to the needs of pupils within their particular areas. That is why we strengthened local participation in decisions on patterns of provision.
</p>

<a name="50118-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>Local authorities are also charged under the Education Act and the Children Act to get better outcomes for all their children. We have talked at length about the fact that every child matters. It is a fundamental responsibility not simply to raise the educational and life opportunities for children of ordinary or good ability but to raise the educational attainment of those who have a particular challenge. We have reason, as do local authorities at present, not to be complacent about that.
</p>

<a name="50118-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>However, the question is: what is the best way of achieving that? I cannot for the life of me think that centralising the decisions will help the process. To begin with, there is already in place a proper process, with adequate checks and balances, for ensuring that local authorities cannot close special schools willy-nilly. Before deciding to close a special school there has to be an established process for formal consultation before publishing proposals. Following publication of proposals there must be a two-month objection period during which anyone can submit a formal objection. Any such statutory objection must then be sent to the school organisation committee, or in Wales to the National Assembly.
</p>

<a name="50118-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>If a proposal put to a school organisation committee is agreed unanimously, it may be implemented. But if it is not unanimous it has to go to the independent adjudicator for determination. Therefore the office of the schools&#039; adjudicator has to look afresh at all cases referred to it, considering each case on its merits and taking account of the reasons for disagreement.
</p>

<a name="50118-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>I am very well aware of the turbulence around special educational needs at present. Let me give myself no more than about three minutes to highlight it. We are concerned about the extent of parents not feeling that the system meets their needs fast enough and responsively enough without their having to go through a statementing ritual. We are concerned about how some other parents, children and teachers feel in some schools that the problem of the school adequately coping with the child with special educational needs leads to disturbance, which then leads to a concern about the ability of the rest of the school to learn.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_709"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 709</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-19_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>Often, if not always, that is the product of a failure of early enough intervention with a child with special educational needs, which has led to some of the behaviours and difficulties in the first place. But these are not easy issues.
</p>

<a name="50118-19_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>We are also aware of the controversy around closure and opening of special schools. Some people are fundamentalist on this agenda. They think that there should never be any special schools whatever. They argue that everybody can be educated in mainstream schools. That is not sensible. There are clearly some children and young people whose needs are so severe and intense&#151;increasingly as a product of advances in medical science&#151;that there is no possibility of them being educated in a mainstream setting as part of their normal schooling. But that number is often smaller than has been assumed in the past.
</p>

<a name="50118-19_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>It is extremely important that local authorities making their decisions about the pattern of special educational needs think seriously about the role of special schools and how they relate to mainstream schools. There has tended to be too much of a distinction in terms of putting a special school in one place and seeing it almost&#151;how shall I put it?&#151;as a <i>gulag</i> where some children are educated, and having a   mainstream school in another place. Instead we see a picture of special and mainstream schools working much more in partnership, whereby some of the expertise in teaching in the special school is helped to support the mainstream, and where there is also a movement of pupils between the two according to the curriculum or their special needs or time, so that you have much more a network of provision rather than a separation of it. We are actively looking at how we stimulate the development of a better system of that type, but now is not the time or place to go into that. It is extremely important for local authorities, schools and the Government to make it work better.
</p>

<a name="50118-19_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>I do not believe&#151;nor in my heart do I think that the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, does either&#151;that sending those decisions to the Secretary of State is the answer to those problems. Further development is undoubtedly necessary, which we will make clear before too long over the coming months. I am sorry if my response resembles a Second Reading response to a Second Reading debate, but perhaps I could not resist the temptation.

I have had some recent exposure to it with regard to the school that to my knowledge is not going to be closed. It is a well regarded school that deals with autistic children, but the rumours are that it might be closed. I visited it. It is a very popular school.

</p>

<a name="50118-20_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a>One of the problems is that I do not see the issue as the Minister does. I do not see a special school in one place and a mainstream school in another place. Particularly in counties, special schools cover large geographical areas. They do not relate to a separate secondary school at all. Two or three special schools cover the whole of the north of Essex, while there are 20 or 30 secondary schools. The parents very much value those special schools, including the school I visited recently. When you visit, you see what a wonderful job they do.
</p>

<a name="50118-20_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, was right when she suggested that this amendment was tabled because someone had to recognise the responsibility. One of the problems with special education&#151;as I have seen throughout my political career&#151;is that professionals get fashionable; there is one fashion or another. I have nothing against professionals but we need to make certain that we get it right for these very vulnerable children.
</p>

<a name="50118-20_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a>Parents greatly value what the system does for them. When you meet a group of parents who have children in a special school you cannot meet a more dedicated group of people who support that school. We must dismiss lightly a threat of closure.
</p>

<a name="50118-20_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a>I raise this issue today in order to highlight it. I am not sure that the Minister was right because a special school has a very wide catchment area; it does not always relate to one secondary school. That needs considerable thought. I referred to the Secretary of State in the amendment because someone needs to think about how we deal with this problem. I agree with the Minister that we are not having a Second Reading debate but it is a crucial issue that the Government and all of us must address in the coming months. I leave beg to withdraw the amendment.

   &quot;ABOLITION OF GRAMMAR SCHOOL BALLOTS

<br>

<p><a name="st_163"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment may be slightly more controversial; I do not think I shall get   quite the support from the noble Baroness, Lady   Sharp, as on the previous amendment.
</p>

<a name="50118-20_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a>This amendment concerns the future of grammar schools, which is sometimes dismissed by the Government and other parties as a sideshow or irrelevance these days. It is deeply important not only for the schools concerned, which are doing an excellent job, but because of what it tells us about the nature of education and how education systems can be run most effectively for all our children. We all agree&#151;or most people agree&#151;that there has to be a variety of schools and choice.

</p>

<a name="50118-20_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a>However, one of the earliest steps taken by the new Government, in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, was to introduce measures that placed the remaining grammar schools in peril.
</p>

<a name="50118-20_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a>The Government implemented a one-way ratchet that allows the removal of grammar schools, but not the potential introduction of grammar schools. Members of the Minister&#039;s party claim that the issue is one of parental choice, but that is not true. Parents are free to choose not to have a grammar school, but they are not free to choose if they want one. The ballot question is loaded because it does not even refer to grammar schools or the intention to abolish them.

</p>

<a name="50118-20_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a>The balloting and petitioning system leaves many disenfranchised voters. Parents with pre-school children or children at private schools are not able to vote in the ballot, although they can go to the trouble of registering for the purposes of the ballot.
</p>

<a name="50118-20_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a>The petition provides for no mechanism to check whether signatures are genuine. The signatures will simply be checked against the list of eligible voters. The Government have not contacted the Electoral Reform Society to engage in any proper check or scrutiny of whether those people who appear to have signed the petition have in fact done so.
</p>

<a name="50118-20_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a>The debate on the government side has been dominated, tragically, by the ideas of an education system that the Labour Party saw or experienced in the 1950s, not the reality of selective education as it is today.

</p>

<a name="50118-20_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a>The success of grammar schools is well known and easy to identify. Year after year, half the top 200 places in the A-level league table are occupied by selective schools, as are nearly half the top 300 GCSE league table places. Noble Lords opposite may say that such results are surely inevitable, given that the most academically able children have been selected to go to those schools. However, I invite them to look at the overall achievements of the local education authorities, as that evidence lays to rest the myth about the selective system. Of the 149 LEAs in England, 29 have a significant element of selection; and 23 of the 29 fully or partially selective LEAs achieved above the LEA average for the country as a whole.
</p>

<a name="50118-20_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a>Strikingly, the success of selective LEAs becomes even more marked when like-for-like comparisons of areas&#039; socio-economic profiles are made. A comparison between 22 LEAs that offer similar numbers of free school meals shows that selective LEA areas come top in 16 instances. The evidence speaks for itself. In my own town, Chelmsford, we have two selective schools within the top four state schools in the whole country; yet we also have three comprehensives in the very top league as well. So it shows that comprehensives and selective schools go side by side.

</p>

<a name="50118-20_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a>Moving on, abandoning grammar schools would also have serious repercussions for the educational opportunities of those pupils currently taught in such   establishments. Any change would require reorganisation in many education authority areas. Again, we face wasted opportunities for ordinary children and wasted money in LEAs that seek to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_712"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 712</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

amalgamate or close schools or rationalise school estates. In Kent, education officers estimate that that would cost &#163;150 million. Replicate that sum across all the areas that have grammar schools and the cost would be &#163;0.5 billion&#151;money that would be wasted on destroying good education rather than trying to improve bad education.
</p>

<a name="50118-20_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>We have been left with a poor set of regulations that will influence the future of the grammar schools. Indeed, they were criticised by this House in May 1998 when concern was expressed at how the proposals had been put in place through regulations rather than primary legislation. We are stuck with a flawed procedure, loaded against the remaining grammar schools.
</p>

<a name="50118-20_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>At the very least, parents around the country have a right to expect that those regulations will be observed and policed by Ministers. The Minister will be well aware that one of the regulations requires a prohibition on the use of public funds.
</p>

<a name="50118-20_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>There have been reports of other abuses around the country. It has been reported that anti-grammar school campaigners have booked council chambers as if for union meetings and so not paid for the facilities. There have been reports of children signing the petitions. If they are signed in the name of their parents, the situation would not be covered because the Government made no provision for verifying whether signatures are genuine. There are reports of trade union funding of the anti-grammar campaign, which results in an unfair imbalance of resources. There are also reports of names being transferred to petitions directly from the list of electors <i>en bloc</i>, which   again would not be discovered because the Government did not take the trouble to contract the Electoral Reform Society to check whether people have really expressed their wishes in the petition process.
</p>

<a name="50118-20_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>It is time for the Government to admit the truth: some selection works. It works for pupils in grammar schools but it also works for those in high schools, who achieve better results under a selective system than they would if they went to other schools. It works for low and middle-income families who cannot afford to go elsewhere for their education and for the ethnic minorities, who have a route out of problem areas and a chance to achieve according to their abilities.
</p>

<a name="50118-20_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>It is time for Ministers to get a grip on the situation and to declare the process in the 1998 Act unworkable and unnecessary. It does not provide for a fair question to be asked and/or for a proper decision to be reached.
</p>

<a name="50118-20_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>We cannot proceed with an unfair campaign in breach of the rules that could destroy the very best education in this country. That would harm the interests not of a few children in grammar schools today but of millions of children all over the country for many years to come. I beg to move.

<a name="50118-21_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>The effect of the amendment would be to remove the provisions for parental petitions and ballots to decide the future admission arrangements of existing grammar schools. It would take power away from parents and place it back into the hands of the local authority. We believe that that would be wrong.
</p>

<a name="50118-21_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>We have made our position clear many times. We do not support selection by ability at 11. We do not wish to see it extended. We continue to believe that parents, rather than Ministers or local government, are best placed to decide whether grammar schools should continue to select their pupils by ability. I want to make it clear that we think that is the right thing to do and we have no plans to abolish grammar schools.
</p>

<a name="50118-21_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>The noble Lord talks about standards rising. We want to see, and are seeing year on year, higher standards and higher achievement in all our schools.

<a name="50118-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>If shall answer some of the noble Lord&#039;s questions if I can, but let me remind the Committee that parents were first given the right to ballot on whether schools should opt out of their local education authority and be grant-maintained. That is very much a plank of the party opposite. We have to ask, in terms of the amendment, why should parents be denied the right to ballot on the future of selective admissions?
</p>

<a name="50118-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>Before any ballot is held it must be demonstrated that there is local support. There must be a petition and 20 per cent of eligible parents must indicate that they want a ballot to go ahead.
</p>

<a name="50118-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a>On the question of eligibility, I believe that local authorities do check whether they are eligible. I shall write to the noble Lord if that will help.

They could be properly conducted under better rules than the current procedure, which gives rise to the anomalies that I instanced and which could lead to abuses of the system. It might be better to have fairly orthodox and well regulated ballots.
</p>




<p><a name="st_166"></a>
<a name="50118-21_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   The Electoral Reform Society is involved at a very early stage. Once 10 or more people notify the Electoral Reform Society that they intend to raise the petition, the ERS must set the threshold for that petition&#151;the number of parents who must sign the petition in favour of a ballot to form the 20 per cent required for the ballot to be held. That is a very important safeguard. We recognise that raising a petition is a significant task. It is only right that it is established that there is a genuine desire for a ballot among a significant proportion of parents. That brings with it costs. We understand that and are prepared to support the costs in that sense.

<a name="50118-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>The noble Lord asked specifically about the nature of the question asked. We believe that the question is straightforward. We do not believe that it needs changing. It is a straightforward question: should the schools cease to admit on academic ability? Obviously, the implications of ending academic selection in grammar schools would be different in each area, but legislation allows any area or school to produce fairly presented factual information on the implications. Guidance on that is available in the ballot information code and in our guidance. So again we believe that safeguards are built in.
</p>

<a name="50118-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>I do not want to say very much more because I believe that we have addressed the issues raised.

The amendment would remove that right. We do not believe that that is right, and we hope that the noble Lord will be able to withdraw his amendment.

<p><a name="st_171"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment brings us back to foundation status and school organisation.

<a name="column_715"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 715</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

amendments required to earlier education Acts. This amendment fits in with that rather splendidly by requiring an element to Schedule 8 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.

</p>

<a name="50118-21_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a>I have raised the issue previously: we are considering the whole question of changing school category&#151;in particular, changing from community schools to foundation schools. As I spoke at some length last time, I do not want to do so this time. Currently, the rules governing a change of school category are found in secondary legislation. As has been demonstrated by recent government consultation on fast-tracking of foundation school status, it is possible for a community or voluntary-controlled school to grant itself foundation school status without wider community approval of the change.

</p>

<a name="50118-21_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>We propose in the amendment that the change should be subject to approval by the school organisation committee. As we also know from our earlier debates, that committee was established under the 1998 Act to take a community view of the local development of the school system. It is wrong that the Government have now decided to bypass that body for no apparent benefit. As I explained earlier, we have grave reservations about the acceleration of that process of consultation over the establishment of foundation status. We are by no means convinced that what are now community schools benefit from becoming foundation schools. We are worried about the knock-on effect of that on democratic accountability.
</p>

<a name="50118-21_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>The principles behind changing category were described by the then Minister of State for School Standards back in 1998 as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a>&quot;the Government took the view that while they&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>

</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"></a>community schools considering becoming foundation schools&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a>&quot;are community schools, the community of interest is the LEA, because there is that link between them. If a school wants to become voluntary aided or a foundation school, it will be for the school organisation committee to agree or disagree with that change of character&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee A, 5/2/98.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-21_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>The amendment provides the Government with an opportunity to put that commitment into legislation. I beg to move.

</p>

<a name="50118-21_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>In short, we do not think that the amendment has anything to do with the subject of the Bill or of Schedule 12. The change of category regulations have already been made. Rather, we feel that the amendment is designed effectively to frustrate the intention set out in the Government&#039;s five-year strategy to allow schools to become foundation schools by a simple vote of their governing body, followed by a short consultation. We consulted widely on those proposals, including local authorities and dioceses, and are currently considering the responses.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 716</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-21_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a>In our view, the change in category of the school is not always so significant a change that it requires an external decision-maker. The school itself will be the same size and cover the same age range, so I cannot see how it significantly alters the pattern of supply and demand in the area such that the school organisation committee could be engaged. If that is the case, what criteria will the school organisation committee apply? Presumably, it will be whether it thinks that foundation schools are a good or bad idea.
</p>

<a name="50118-21_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>With the greatest respect, Parliament has&#151;the Government have&#151;established a policy position on that. So it would be a sham for the school organisation committee to be engaged in that, when it has plenty of other extremely important and challenging business to do, without undertaking that bureaucratic process.
</p>

<a name="50118-21_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>Foundation status may not affect the size or age range of the school, but we hope that it will have a significant impact on the attitude and ethos of the school. We want schools to take responsibility for their own character and future and, as I said, have more of the levers of control and resources under their governance better to get excellent outcomes for their children. They own their land and buildings; they employ their own staff; they may have a foundation, and we are consulting on whether that foundation may have a majority of governors on the governing body, as voluntary-aided schools do.
</p>

<a name="50118-21_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>We think that those responsibilities will make it easier for schools to develop a distinctive ethos and make them more responsive to changing demands, but there are proper safeguards in place. Admissions will be governed by existing legislation and guided by the school admissions code of practice. The governing body of the foundation school may make changes to the school&#039;s admission arrangements only after consulting in accordance with regulation. If there is disagreement, the local authority or any other school can object to the schools adjudicator about the admission arrangements. The buildings are not owned in the sense that they can be sold off and the money spent; disposal would require the consent of the Secretary of State and proceeds would normally return to the local authority.
</p>

<a name="50118-21_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>Let me underline the point about admissions and the importance of effective arrangements. The former Secretary of State, my right honourable friend Charles Clarke, in a speech that he made in November, set out the position extremely clearly. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a>&quot;By September 2005, every Admissions Forum should develop and agree a protocol covering their area for the admission of hard to place children. We will issue guidance and examples of good local agreements and will make consequent changes to the School Admissions Code of Practice&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-21_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>So the school admissions code of practice, buttressed by a protocol signed up to by schools, gives strong mechanisms for motivating agreement on how place hard to place children. He continued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a>&quot;I expect all schools  . . . to be part of these protocols and I will if necessary legislate to achieve this&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-21_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>We doubt that that will be necessary, because we think that there will be a proper response.

<a name="50118-22_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>The reason why we on these Benches are worried about the issue is that although it probably has surprisingly little impact on the organisation of the school itself, it has a major impact on the governance of the school, as I pointed out previously. There is a significant change in the balance of appointments among the governors: a shift away from those who are elected, especially elected parent governors, towards those who are appointed. We are worried about the issue because education is one of the largest spenders of government money. Schools are expensive institutions. A great deal of money is being spent here and we feel that some element of democratic accountability in the governance of those organisations is appropriate.
</p>

<a name="50118-22_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>We are worried by the shift away from democratic accountability to relatively undemocratic accountability. As I pointed out previously, it does not apply only to foundation schools. One sees it occurring across a raft of institutions which the Government are setting up&#151;whether it applies to regional assemblies, development agencies or foundation trusts. There is no doubt that those are all good local burghers, local citizens. Nevertheless, they are appointed, not elected. We believe that the proposition that there shall be no taxation without representation is correct. We are worried by that tendency.
</p>

<a name="50118-22_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>I can see that I shall not move the Minister in any sense&#151;however eloquent I may be on the issue. We shall return to this fundamental issue time and again&#151;the tendency to move from democratic means to the Government&#039;s appointees, their cronies. There are great dangers in that. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>




<p><a name="st_174"></a>
<a name="50118-22_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield </b>   moved Amendment No. 132A:
</p>

<a name="50118-22_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>Page 41, line 7, at end insert &quot;by developing productive partnerships with other providers of continuing professional development&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>




<p><a name="st_175"></a>The noble Lord said: With Amendments Nos. 132A and 136B, I come to what I think is probably the biggest issue concerning the training of the school workforce. As <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_718"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 718</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

noble Lords will see from the amendments, it is my contention that the Government have neglected to say, at least in the Bill, how the new agency will operate in relating to other agencies and bodies which have overlapping responsibilities.
</p>

<a name="50118-22_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>Before detailing that neglect, I should say that I am in favour of the Government&#039;s general approach to teacher training. Bringing together initial teacher training, continuous professional development and career promotion indicates a coherent strategic approach and potentially will give the Government the ability to steer and influence all-through teacher development. This should be a boon to standards and teachers&#039; aspirations for ongoing development opportunities.
</p>

<a name="50118-22_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a>However, as I have mentioned, the nature of the agency&#039;s wider-ranging remit in engaging in productive partnerships with other bodies that also operate in the area of teacher training, development and advocacy has been left unclear by the Government, and it would be helpful to all concerned if the Minister could say a little about how he expects the new arrangements to operate.

</p>

<a name="50118-22_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>For example, it seems to me that there is a particular issue with regard to the General Teaching Council in England and Wales. The General Teaching Council is   the teachers&#039; professional body and has led a lot of   important work on continuous professional development, particularly early career development. It has produced the GTC professional learning framework, which informed the recently revised Department for Education and Skills continuous professional development strategic priorities, and has established a teaching learning academy to provide national recognition of teachers&#039; professional learning. The GTC successfully piloted with nine LEAs innovative approaches to CPD development in schools and is now extending that to 21 further LEAs supported by the General Teaching Council&#039;s link advisers. The DfES has also established regional CPD advisers who are working with local authorities on the review of CPD strategy in the light of the DfES priorities. They do this by working closely with the GTC link advisers.
</p>

<a name="50118-22_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>The important point is that the Bill makes no mention of the need for the Training and Development Agency for Schools to consult the GTC on standards for teaching and continuous professional development, even though in law the GTC is charged with raising standards of teaching and quality of learning. The absence of that provision from the Bill strikes me as either an oversight that the Government must now address as a matter of urgency or a mistake that could lead to incoherent outcomes.
</p>

<a name="50118-22_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>Can the Minister tell the Committee whether he thinks that the agency&#039;s extended responsibilities could jeopardise the coherent, professional role of the   General Teaching Council? If not, what are the implications for the extended role of the agency, particularly relating to the CPD, and other bodies leading and working in that area? Finally, does not the noble Lord agree that there should be some requirement for the Training and Development Agency for Schools to consult the GTC, if not other bodies such as the QCA, on the statutory functions that they seem to share? I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_176"></a>
<a name="50118-22_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   We move to a new part; let us hope we make good progress on it. At Second Reading, we stated how important is training and development of the whole school workforce as part of improving educational attainment and the mechanism for helping to deliver the goals of the Children Act. Therefore, I shall not develop that.
</p>

<a name="50118-22_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>The Committee will also know why we have chosen the Teacher Training Agency to be the foundation for reform and development and to do that function. Its record of success over recent years has been impressive, remarkable and well recognised by many, both its success in raising the status, numbers, confidence and skill of the teaching profession and its success at developing, in partnership with other bodies, teaching assistants into the schools system to the considerable benefit of children in our schools.
</p>

<a name="50118-22_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>Therefore, we think it important that the Training and Development Agency for Schools should work closely with, and have consistency between, its future activities and other bodies with an interest in raising standards of teaching and learning. Those bodies include the General Teaching Council for England and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. In Wales, where the agency may also act at the request of the Assembly, they also include the General Teaching Council for Wales. The agency itself recognises that. The TTA&#039;s record of achieving this synergy is good. We are determined that it will continue to be the case. None the less, it is important that, in encouraging the agency to take an inclusive and participative approach to its business, we do not encumber it with bureaucratic procedures. Amendments Nos. 132A and 136B would risk that.
</p>

<a name="50118-22_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>Clause 72(2)(b) stipulates that one of the agency&#039;s objectives shall be to promote careers in the school workforce. This re-enacts and extends the TTA&#039;s existing objective to promote teaching as a career under Section 1 of the Education Act 1994.
</p>

<a name="50118-22_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>Encouraging and enabling adults to work in school is not wholly about providing them with continuing training opportunities. It is much more fundamentally a question of prompting people to consider joining the school workforce, advising them about the most suitable route into the profession and ensuring that they have the initial training opportunities. Those are three areas in which the TTA has achieved outstanding success and on which the TDA will build.
</p>

<a name="50118-22_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>For example, the TTA has run a series of high-profile, extremely successful, advertising campaigns to promote careers in teaching. Secondly, every year the TTA&#039;s teaching information line deals with numbers of inquiries from prospective trainee teachers that are well into six figures, and the advice and guidance the callers receive is of the utmost importance in steering them towards a suitable route. I think that there will probably be broad consensus on that, so let me not labour the point. None of that means that the TDA should or will shun partnerships with other bodies which have an interest in this field.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_720"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 720</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-22_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>The promotion of continuous professional development for teachers generally would invariably include working with and discussing with the General   Teaching Council for England. The TTA has in the past consulted and worked with key stakeholders to produce frameworks of standards and professional qualifications, such as qualified teacher and higher-level teaching assistants, and additionally they work well with two partners to secure high-quality training provision and provide support and guidance to school staff and teachers. The agency has also had coherent dialogue with the QCA, and both are members of several existing forums including, particularly importantly, the school workforce development board, which is a partnership between government employers, unions and other bodies to lead the development of the school workforce in England. It has been remarkably successful as an exercise in social partnership about making some difficult, radical changes in how the school workforce works with the positive co-operation of most of the unions and local authority employers. Similarly, the agency and the GTCE are members of the School Workforce Strategy Group, which is committed to developing a highly skilled workforce in England. The governing boards of the TTA and the GTCE have for several years shared one member in common, although her tenure has now expired. I will argue that Amendment No. 136B would not usefully add value to the arrangements that I have described.
</p>

<a name="50118-22_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>When I met the chief executive of the GTCE recently to talk about the children&#039;s workforce reform agenda, those issues were not raised, so far as I recall. Those I met talked most thoughtfully about how the registration and regulation bodies such as the GTCE needed to reflect on the development of codes of practice and the professional registration issues regarding the school workforce. They   recognised that we are in a state of gradual evolution and development. I commended them for that   thoughtfulness in recognising how the world of professional disciplines had been carved up in the past and that it was not quite in a state of flux but certainly in one of development&#151;more strength to their arm on promoting those discussions with others. I do not think that there is a threat to such bodies through this proposal. The TDA must, and will, work in partnership with them. The more they do so, the more we will serve the needs of children in schools and the wider community. I hope that that has helped the noble Lord.

<a name="50118-23_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I thank the Minister for that reply. The other professional bodies have been concerned about the increased role of the GTCE.

</ul>
<p>



</p>




<p><a name="st_179"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 132C and 132D. All three amendments relate to Clause 72(2), which deals <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_721"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 721</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

with the objectives of the Training and Development Agency. Amendment No. 132C would delete from paragraph (c) the term &quot;and efficiency&quot; from the phrase,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;to improve the quality and efficiency of all routes into the school workforce&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>Amendments Nos. 132C and 132D are important little amendments. If the former were agreed, paragraph (d) would read:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a>&quot;to secure the involvement of schools in all courses and programmes for the initial and continuing professional development  . . . of school teachers&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50118-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>That would very much fulfil the Government&#039;s objectives. Amendment No. 132D provides the objective applies to the training of teachers,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a>&quot;and other members of the school workforce&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>Given the role now played by other members of the school workforce, it is important that what I know to be the Government&#039;s objectives should be reflected in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50118-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>I must confess that these are probing amendments. In his letter, dated 17 December, to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and me, the Minister said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a>&quot;much of what the Government were expecting from the TTA&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>in its transformation to the TDA&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a>&quot;will require co-ordination work&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>with no extra funding. He stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a>&quot;for example, the remit for continuing professional development of teachers is not about funding of such provision, because money for this is already in the school budgets&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50118-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>By that, does he mean that schools will now get additional funding to meet the training and development needs of support staff as well as teachers? The DfES no longer provides ring-fenced grants for teacher continuing professional development. On the one hand, that may allow schools and LEAs greater flexibility to provide accessible professional development that better meets their teachers&#039; needs and aspirations, but it does not ensure entitlement to CPD.
</p>

<a name="50118-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>The GTCE for England survey published in July 2004 found that 24 per cent of teachers felt that their professional development needs went unmet. If almost a quarter of teachers do not have access or opportunity for meaningful professional development, what guarantees are there for the school workforce more generally? Without a properly funded entitlement, we see teachers having to pay for their own training. The GTCE survey found that almost one in five&#151;17 per cent of respondents&#151;had either wholly or in part personally funded their professional development in the past 12 months. Is there, therefore, an expectation that teaching staff will have to pay for some element of their training?
</p>

<a name="50118-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>At the north of England conference, in Manchester, Ralph Tabberer, the current chief executive of the TTA, said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a>&quot;we ought to raise our expectations significantly about every member of staff being engaged in continuous professional development within the fabric of every school day. This we have circled for years but have not yet achieved&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_722"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 722</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>He then argued:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a>&quot;What is coming over already is the fact that, outside of the National Strategies, which I think should be classified as government change programmes rather than CPD, a lot of training and development in this country has become fragmented: teachers taking up bits and pieces rather than being directed to more targeted and sustained activities. If we let this go on, it will be a big waste. Research is categorical that, organised properly, training and development programmes give schools the best &#039;bangs for their bucks&#039; in terms of impact on school and improvement and pupil outcomes, better than reductions in class size, better than ICT initiatives, better even than the use of more classroom assistants. But if the training and development is in bits and pieces, research is equally clear that the effects simply disappear&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-23_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>How far will those aspirations for continuous professional training and development be met? Will there be resources to meet those aspirations? To what extent are they just pie in the sky? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_180"></a>
<a name="50118-23_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I shall explain why the probing amendments, which I must not take too literally, would make an unwelcome addition. I do not mean to dismiss them, but I recognise the literalism involved. Such amendments are sometimes a peg on which to hang an argument.
</p>

<a name="50118-23_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>Clause 72(2)(c) provides the TDA with an objective to improve the quality and efficiency of routes into the school workforce, based on Section 1 of the 1994 Act. The amendment would mean that one of the TDA&#039;s objectives would continue to be improvement of the quality of routes into the school workforce, but it would no longer be a stated objective that it should improve their efficiency. I cannot believe that that is literally what was intended, because, clearly, the TDA ought to be concerned about such issues as reducing the dropout rate between following a training course and entering the school workforce, or ensuring that the   content of training corresponds more closely to the needs of those being trained and their eventual employers. The TTA has had success in both those areas. Such outcomes are clearly highly desirable and must continue to be part of the TDA&#039;s objectives.
</p>

<a name="50118-23_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, also proposes changes to subsection (2)(d), which provides the TDA with an objective to secure schools&#039; involvement in all forms of initial teacher training. As drafted, the provision reproduces exactly the wording of the 1994 Act. Although the TDA&#039;s new remit will encompass the wider school workforce as well as teachers, and continuing as well as initial training, we reflected carefully before deciding to confine the provision to the initial training of teachers.
</p>

<a name="50118-23_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>Schools are already involved in all initial teacher training courses. In some forms of training, such as employment-based programmes, they can be training providers. But even more conventional routes must have heavy school involvement.
</p>

<a name="50118-23_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>Why, then, should we not, as the noble Baroness proposes, extend this to the initial and continuing training of the whole school workforce? I assure the Committee straightaway that schools will be directly involved in many of the activities undertaken as part of the TDA&#039;s new remit. For example, a teacher&#039;s annual performance appraisal is already geared towards <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_723"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 723</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

identifying development needs, as it should be. This will be further reinforced when the teaching and learning reviews for teachers are introduced from September.

</p>

<a name="50118-23_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>I would also draw the attention of noble Lords to the contrast between this sort of activity and the training of a school bursar. This almost entirely involves issues concerned with financial management and need not necessarily involve a school directly. Likewise, several thousand qualified teachers are already engaged in continuing professional development activities which do not have direct school involvement.
</p>

<a name="50118-23_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>I am in no doubt of the good intentions behind the amendments, but the new agency will promote the development of a high-quality, well-trained school workforce just as vigorously as has the old. The wording of Clause 72(2) is designed to set a framework for the agency to do just that.
</p>

<a name="50118-23_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>I turn to the issue of resources. There has been a substantial delegation of funding into schools for teacher development so that they themselves have the appropriate resources. As regards the resources going into the TDA itself, if I recollect correctly it is to have an increase of 13 per cent to its budget from next April to take account of the expanded responsibilities we are placing on it. Again from recollection, that increase will provide a budget for the TDA in the order of some &#163;650   million. This is a powerful and well-resourced organisation which has a track record of success. We are confident that, working in partnership with other organisations, the TDA is the right vehicle to deliver the improvements to the school workforce which are absolutely crucial if we are to achieve the objectives set out in <i>Every Child Matters</i>.
</p>

<a name="50118-23_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>I hope that my response is helpful to the noble Baroness.

<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>I am slightly surprised at the speed with which the noble Lord has turned down the two subsequent amendments, Amendments Nos. 132C and 132D, both of which reflect the Government&#039;s stated aspirations for what they want to do with the TDA.

</p>

<a name="50118-24_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>On the issue of resources, the question is not so much the resources provided to the TDA, although that is part of it, but the fact that there are pressures on schools. Will sufficient resources be available within school budgets to make provision for the continuing and expanding professional development envisaged here, in which schools are to take an active role? The problem is that when budgets are squeezed, provision for training is usually the first to go out of the window. It would be nice to think that that is not going to be the case here. As the noble Lord rightly points out, there is a direct link between training and performance, which is a point worth pursuing.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a>&quot;We must make sure that [the United Nations&#039;] work is fruitful. That it is a reality and not a sham.

<a name="50118-24_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>I wish to recognise some of the achievements of the UN, to identify some problems and failures, and to suggest some ways forward.

</p>

<a name="50118-24_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>First, I pay tribute to those such as the Canadian General Romeo Dallaire, commander of the UN force in Rwanda. He continually warned the UN of the impending massacres, only to be ignored, with the horrendous consequences recorded in history. I also deeply admire UNICEF&#039;s James Grant and the successful immunisation programme of 25 million children around the world. I should declare an interest in the support that UNICEF has given to our programmes promoting foster family care for orphaned and abandoned children in Russia.
</p>

<a name="50118-24_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>But I have less happy experiences of situations where UN aid agencies have been seriously out of touch with local needs. One example arose during a visit to war-devastated areas in southern Sudan. We <br>&nbsp;<br>

were surrounded by ghost villages in which people were dying like flies of disease and starvation. I was encouraged to see, at the end of the airstrip, a large pile of cartons with a UN logo. But hope turned rapidly to disappointment and anger. The crates were full of blackboard chalk. What cruelty in an area where mothers were suffering the anguish of seeing their children dying of starvation or treatable disease. Their hearts must have leapt for joy as an aid plane landed with what they thought would be life-saving supplies. Instead they had only useless blackboard chalk, in an area with no blackboards and where, if the children were able to attend school, they learnt to write with sticks in the sand. When the rainy season came and the cardboard dissolved, there remained a whited sepulchre to the inappropriateness of too much UN aid.

</p>

<a name="50118-24_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>In recent weeks, UN agencies have clearly played a significant role in response to the horrors of the tsunami. However, the most rapid response was made by the Australian and American military, able to mobilise resources quickly and effectively&#151;considerably quicker than any UN deployment. The United States, so often the target of severe criticism and even hostility within the UN and from many of its members, continues to provide 24 per cent of its funding.
</p>

<a name="50118-24_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>Many questions need to be asked about cost-effectiveness and extravagance. NGOs working alongside the UN argue convincingly that they could achieve far more results with far fewer resources, particularly since 70 per cent of the UN budget goes on   staff costs. Enlightened governments like the Netherlands, Sweden and Canada now give their overseas aid budgets directly to independent NGOs; others might do well to follow suit.
</p>

<a name="50118-24_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a>But far more serious in terms of the massive scale of human suffering are the numerous failures of the UN in conflict prevention and peacekeeping. One insider comments:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a>&quot;I cannot think of a single successful UN peacekeeping mission. Either the soldiers have no power to stop genocide, as in Bosnia and Rwanda, or they are too late, as in Kosovo and Cambodia&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-24_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>Sudan is the latest in this catalogue of failure. When the National Islamic Front regime took power by military coup in 1989, it declared militaristic <i>jihad</i> against all who opposed it, with military offences against innocent civilians. It simultaneously declared many areas as &quot;No Go&quot; to United Nations Operation Lifeline Sudan, and all the aid organisations under its aegis.
</p>

<a name="50118-24_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>Returning from an area devastated by bombardment and massacres of civilians by NIF troops, I was told by pilots who flew UN planes that they witnessed this scorched earth policy throughout an area of 100 miles radius from where I was&#151;but they were not allowed to tell anyone. Such compromise by the UN with that murderous regime helped to contribute to the toll of 2 million dead and 4 million displaced before Darfur hit the headlines. Now, while some Sudanese hope for some respite after the recent peace agreement between the SPLM/A and the NIF, the regime continues its genocidal policies in Darfur. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_726"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 726</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Nearly 400,000 have already been killed, with a projected figure of 100,000 dying every month for months ahead. The UN Security Council&#039;s failure to intervene effectively is not only culpably condoning avoidable suffering on a catastrophic scale, it is further proof of the need for radical change.
</p>

<a name="50118-24_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>Another disastrous example of UN incompetence is its Commission on Human Rights. Its cast of characters would be a bad joke if the issues were not so deadly serious. It is almost unbelievable that the UN&#039;s guardians of human rights include Algeria, Libya, Sudan, Syria, Zimbabwe, China and Cuba. Moreover, the UN has shown systematic bias against Israel in comparison with relatively uncritical and massive support for Palestine.
</p>

<a name="50118-24_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>Therefore the recommendations by the Secretary-General&#039;s experts for reform of the UNHCR are comparably bizarre. Instead of limiting membership to states committed to democracy and human rights, they recommend expansion from the current 53 to all UN member states. Thus current members such as Sudan and Saudi Arabia will be delighted to be joined by Burma and Iran.

</p>

<a name="50118-24_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>I will not dwell on recent scandals such as those described in the article in the <i>Independent</i> on 11 January, graphically entitled:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a>&quot;Sex and the UN: when peacemakers became predators&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-24_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>detailing scandals of sexual exploitation, abuse and rape, or the corruption of the Oil for Food programme. Instead, I will suggest some possible solutions to the UN&#039;s undeniable problems.
</p>

<a name="50118-24_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>The recent internal report on proposals for reform by the group of <i>&#233;minences grises</i> fails to address these most fundamental problems.
</p>

<a name="50118-24_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a>One of them stems from expanding membership, resulting in a clash of ideologies. It is estimated that now only 75 member states are free democracies and many of the new member states want international rules suiting dictatorships rather than democracies.
</p>

<a name="50118-24_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_450"></a>One proposal for reforms, suggested by James Mawdsley and Benedict Rogers in &quot;New Ground&quot;, would be to downgrade the status and influence of member states according to their unwillingness to abide by the UN&#039;s founding principles. For example, states which violate fundamental human rights could lose the right to sit on committees, to table or sign motions, to speak in debates or vote.
</p>

<a name="50118-24_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a>The UN General Assembly would be far more effective if regimes which wilfully undermine its charter were excluded or expelled from UN bodies, and sanctions could be used also against states which fail to recognise the rights of women as enshrined in the UDHR.
</p>

<a name="50118-24_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a>Many oppressive regimes also use the concepts of territorial integrity and non-interference to perpetuate gross violations of human rights. Many of today&#039;s conflicts are the result of minorities trapped behind closed borders fighting for cultural or physical survival against ruling regimes committed to their destruction.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_727"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 727</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-24_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_453"></a>There is an urgent need to re-evaluate the balance between the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty&#151;perhaps with a new definition of sovereignty based on the will of the people rather than the &quot;might is right&quot; legitimation of many brutal regimes, such as those in Sudan or Burma, which seize power by military force against the wishes of the vast majority of their people.
</p>

<a name="50118-24_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_454"></a>Finally, treaty agreements and funding could be linked to respect for and protection of the fundamental human rights enshrined in the UDHR. This was done successfully in Basket 3 of the Helsinki disarmament agreement in 1977 and in the Jackson/Vanik amendment in the United States for emigration from the former Soviet Union&#151;but both those initiatives outside the UN.
</p>

<a name="50118-24_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_455"></a>In July 2003, I believe that Tony Blair, addressing Congress, called for continuing American leadership to protect world order. He stated that UN members must be told:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a>&quot;If you engage in the systematic and gross abuse of human rights in defiance of the UN Charter, you cannot expect to enjoy the same privileges as those who conform to it&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-24_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_456"></a>I believe the Prime Minister was right when he urged Americans not ever to apologise for their values&#151;for those values were precisely those which underpin the UN&#039;s charter and which it is supposed to defend. If the vast majority of its members do not choose to promote and protect those values, or to penalise those who do not do so, there will be no hope for its future, and those nations which feel passionately committed to those values may feel forced to consider a radical alternative, such as a community of democracies.

</p>

<a name="50118-24_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_457"></a>But if the UN can undertake the reforms necessary to purge corruption, become cost effective and accountable in the fulfilment of its humanitarian remit, successful in protecting human rights and promoting peace, then&#151;and only then&#151;will the people in every member state be able to say truly, &quot;The United Nations: it&#039;s our world&quot;. I passionately hope that that day will come.

<p><a name="st_185"></a>
<a name="50118-25_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </b>   My Lords, after that speech by the noble Baroness, I have a difficult act to follow. As the full debate of the noble Lord, Lord   Hannay, on the UN&#039;s high-level panel report includes in its agenda the causes of conflict in Africa, I shall be brief today.
</p>

<a name="50118-25_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_458"></a>The UN was set up as an act of faith intended to protect the world against more wars and against injustice. Unfortunately, its structure and the practices it has developed over the years have left us with a deeply flawed and ineffective organisation, whose own staff were reported in November last year to be considering a vote of no confidence in senior management. One draft resolution said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a>&quot;The senior management no longer display the levels of integrity expected of all employees of the organisation&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-25_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_459"></a>That rebellion coincided with the allegations of corruption in the UN&#039;s Oil for Food programme, on which a separate report has now been made. Two of the major charges appear to be that the UN allowed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_728"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 728</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Saddam Hussein to manipulate the oil sales and that many of the medicines delivered, which should have been monitored by the UN, were past their sell-by date. The children were not well served. To corruption, therefore, we must add&#151;not for the first time in the UN&#039;s history&#151;gross mismanagement.
</p>

<a name="50118-25_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_460"></a>I know, moreover, of at least one case of gross injustice to a staff member, for whom representations were made in vain, even at governmental level, over several years. These were arrogantly rejected by the secretariat.
</p>

<a name="50118-25_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a>The UN&#039;s record in Africa is hardly encouraging. Spurred on by its appalling failure in Rwanda, the UN initially, after a slow start, reported fully on what was happening in Darfur. The UNHCR, the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Secretary-General were all active and effective in reporting what was happening, helped and urged on by the NGOs, as early as 2003. There was one powerful UN report followed by another.
</p>

<a name="50118-25_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_462"></a>Only in June 2004, however, did the Security Council act under Chapter 7 and give the Khartoum Government 30 days to disarm the militia&#151;it proved an empty gesture&#151;to allow humanitarian access and to punish human rights violations. Seven months on, there have been no sanctions, and the reason is that China and Russia are major arms suppliers to the Sudan. Russia sold MiGs as recently as July 2004; China has been selling helicopters and jet aircraft; and China is also a major investor in oil in the Sudan. Thanks to the veto of those two countries, economic sanctions were blocked, as was any effective pressure on the Sudan. The countries of the Arab League were also a factor in this.
</p>

<a name="50118-25_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_463"></a>The lack of any effective action against Khartoum is only one example of the way in which the organisation has proved unable to do more than apply the poultice of humanitarian aid and of verbal denunciation to a series of suffering countries. There is, for instance, no word that I have heard of the UN co-ordinated effort in the Far East being directed to Burma after the tsunami. The UN appears to accept that.
</p>

<a name="50118-25_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_464"></a>It cannot even denounce the barbarous behaviour of the Zimbabwe Government to their own people because that would be blocked in the Security Council by China and Russia, in deference, no doubt, to the African Union. There can be no debate on any motion on Zimbabwe in the General Assembly because the African Union prevents it. Even in the UNHCR meeting in Geneva, chaired by Libya, when motions on gross violations of human rights in Zimbabwe have been put forward&#151;not by us but by other concerned countries&#151;the African Union acts as a block, year after year, preventing any debate.
</p>

<a name="50118-25_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_465"></a>Meanwhile, Mr Mugabe was able to spend several comfortable days in Geneva, at UN expense, for a UNHCR meeting, and more recently to attend Mr   Mbeki&#039;s reception in New York. He was never called to account by the UN, which is supposed to be the advocate of the poor and the oppressed. Sadly, the UNHCR representative in Zimbabwe stays silent and is acquiescent, and the Secretary-General has said nothing.

<a name="column_729"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 729</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-25_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_466"></a>Meanwhile, the UN is both a profligate spender and a wholly ineffective protector of the people against violence and murder. By the end of 2003, it had spent more than 544 million US dollars on the international crime tribunal in Rwanda. After nine years of operation, nearly 30 per cent of those indicted still await trial, despite a UN investigation in 1996.
</p>

<a name="50118-25_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_467"></a>The Sierra Leone special court is funded by donations, chiefly from the US, the UK and the Netherlands. The Security Council refuses to fund this modest affair, despite&#151;or perhaps because&#151;it has spent more than 2 billion US dollars as at 2004 on keeping 17,500 troops in Sierra Leone since 1999, who failed completely to oust the rebels. On the contrary, the latter captured a number of UN troops and held them to ransom. It took about 1,500 British troops, I think, to end the insurgency in about a week.
</p>

<a name="50118-25_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_468"></a>I could go on. Eight hundred French troops and a few British in the EU mission, Artemis, who replaced UN troops for some two months in the Congo in 2004, did more to protect the people and begin to restore a safe environment in that time than 5,000 or more UN troops had done, not least because the UN mandate did not allow those troops to intervene. They were simply a presence. Eventually, they were totally disorganised and lost all command of the situation.
</p>

<a name="50118-25_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_469"></a>I saw that for myself in the Congo in 1960 when, after a day of unbridled violence against the white population of Stanleyville, the UN sent its daily telegram, which read, &quot;All quiet, nothing to report&quot;. As I was there that day and happened to be one of the people who were beaten, I had a rather strong view on that and so, I am glad to say, did Her Majesty&#039;s Government. It was not unusual for men to be beaten severely under the eyes of the UN guards outside the UN headquarters; they had no mandate to intervene. When people were put in prison, the UN did nothing to protect them.
</p>

<a name="50118-25_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_470"></a>What emerges from all this is a flawed organisation which gives the world a false sense of a positive, international entity. We need that entity. Most of its employees, particularly in the many UN agencies, work hard and wish to do a good job, but the whole thing seizes up, thanks to the veto and other pressures, when serious action is required. There are too many   examples of corruption, incompetence and extravagance. I hope that the UN&#039;s panel report will not be concerned with rearranging the chairs rather than taking a radical look at what is wrong with an organisation that should be the effective conscience of the world.

<p><a name="stpa_471"></a>I imagine that other noble Lords may have been struck, as I was, by much of the coverage from the BBC&#151; that bastion of political correctitude&#151;soon after the recent tsunami struck. The BBC reported, with considerable shock, that the wicked President Bush had set up a group of four nations&#151;the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand&#151;apparently in competition with its beloved United Nations, to bring aid to the stricken areas. There was a clear echo in this coverage of the trendy Left&#039;s anger with the liberation of Iraq by the United States and her allies, the implication being that the United States was again committing the irresponsible crime of acting outside the United Nations&#039; authority. After a few days, the BBC announced in triumph that the president had disbanded his group and was prepared to collaborate with the United Nations. So normality and decency were restored to the face of the planet.
</p>

<a name="50118-25_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_472"></a>I have not time in a short debate to detail much of what was really happening on the ground immediately after the disaster struck. A good account can be found in Christopher Booker&#039;s column in the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> on 9 January, entitled, &quot;Don&#039;t mention the navy&quot;. This reveals that within hours, a task force of more than 20 US Navy ships, led by the vast, nuclear-powered aircraft-carrier, the &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, carrying 90 helicopters, landing craft and hovercraft, was carrying out a round-the-clock relief operation, providing food, water and medical supplies to hundreds of thousands of survivors.
</p>

<a name="50118-25_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_473"></a>But where was the United Nations? What was this great paragon of international virtue up to while Americans, Australians and others from their coalition were saving thousands of people? I can do no better than place on the record an extract from the &quot;Diplomatic&quot; weblog, run undercover by members of the US State Department. It is entitled, &quot;The United Nations to the Rescue&quot; and goes as follows:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a>&quot;The local correspondent of the Guardian newspaper has called the Embassy in Jakarta. He is doing a negative story on the US relief effort based on &#039;information&#039; provided by the UN at a press conference this morning.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a>&quot;This Embassy has been running 24/7&quot;&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a>&quot;since the December 26th disaster. Along with my colleagues, I&#039;ve spent the past days dealing non-stop with the relief effort.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a>&quot;That work, unfortunately, has brought ever-increasing contact with the growing UN presence in this capital. In fact, we&#039;ve found that to avoid running into the UN, we must go out to where the quake and the tsunami actually hit. As we come up to two weeks since the disaster struck, the UN is still not to be seen where it counts&#151;except when holding well-staged press events.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a>&quot;But the luxury hotels are full of UN assessment teams and visiting big shots from New York, Geneva and Vienna. The city sees a steady procession of UN Mercedes sedans and top-of-the-line four-wheeled drive vehicles&#151;a fully decked out Toyota Landcruiser is the UN vehicle of choice; it doesn&#039;t seem that concerns about &#039;global warming&#039; and preserving our tax dollars run too deep among the UNocrats.</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a>&quot;Sitting <i>very</i> late for two consecutive nights in interminable meetings with UN representatives, hearing them go on about &#039;taking the lead co-ordination role&#039;, pledges and the impending arrival of this or that UN big shot, or assessment/co-ordination team, for the millionth time I realized that if not for Australia and America, almost nobody in the tsunami-affected areas would have survived more than <br>&nbsp;<br>

But, fortunately, thanks to those retrograde racist war-mongers John Howard and George W. Bush, as we sat in air-conditioned meeting rooms with these UNocrats, young Americans and Australians were at that moment &#039;co-ordinating&#039;, without the UN, and saving the lives of tens of thousands of people&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-25_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_475"></a>I appreciate that this is only one instance of the United Nations&#039; failure, but I trust your Lordships will agree that it is a rather important one. I therefore ask the noble Baroness to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the rescue work of the United States, Australia and their colleagues immediately after the tsunami struck and before the United Nations ground into operation.

<a name="50118-25_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a>I hope, too, that the Government will honestly confront and answer the several serious questions put to them by my noble friend Lady Cox. Her record of international human rights work makes her uniquely qualified in your Lordships&#039; House to pose those questions. She started her international work by personally delivering many lorry loads of medical aid to Poland for several years before the wall came down. She then moved on to help in the defence of Ngorno Karabakh against Azeri invasion, making many visits to the battle zone, under fire, with medical supplies which otherwise did not exist.
</p>

<a name="50118-25_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a>My noble friend was perhaps the first person to penetrate southern Sudan and bring the terrible situation there to the world&#039;s attention, and to warn of the impending disaster in Darfur. She has run several missions to Burma and Nigeria, neither of them regimes which welcome those who reveal to the world what they are doing to some of their own people. She warned for several years, long before 9/11, of the growing problem of violent Islamist fundamentalists.


</p>

<a name="50118-25_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a>In short, she has huge experience at the front line on the international scene. I am sure that I speak for most of your Lordships when I suggest that the Government should address her concerns about the United Nations fully and openly.
</p>

<a name="50118-25_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a>I feel sure too, that the Government&#039;s laudable commitment to an ethical foreign policy demands nothing less and I look forward to the Minister&#039;s reply with much interest.

was to end the scourge of war but today it confronts a series of challenges that were unknown or not considered in 1945: mass poverty, AIDS, internal armed conflicts, failed states, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, natural disasters, and trans-national organised crime including people trafficking.
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a>The UN and its agencies may not have been adaptive enough to cope with these problems and to co-ordinate its activities with other actors such as regional groups of states and non-governmental humanitarian agencies. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, has pointed out in an article in the <i>Financial Times</i>, they are linked together and all require a collective response, which only the UN can deliver.
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a>I note the particular criticisms of the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, of the Commission on Human Rights and I sympathise with her remarks on the membership of the commission, although of course she will realise that all states are already members of the Third Committee which covers the same ground. I proposed to the Minister with responsibility for human rights, Mr Bill Rammell, that at least the chair of the commission should be in full compliance with the commission&#039;s mechanisms, which means an open invitation to the special procedures and if it is considered impractical to restrict the membership for political reasons, perhaps voting rights could be limited to those in full compliance with the procedures.
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a>We should note the sterling work done by many of the special rapporteurs and working groups in the face of impossible budgetary constraints; they are not mentioned at all by the panel and it is a scandal that they are not properly funded. Can the Minister assure us that Britain will do all it can to improve the funding of the commission and of its special procedures in particular? That is one of the recommendations made by the high-level panel.
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a>One of the most difficult problems the UN has faced in recent years is whether the charter allows for a right of intervention in man-made catastrophes, in spite of the prohibition in Article 2.7. The panel says,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a>&quot;genocidal acts and other atrocities, such as large scale violations of international humanitarian law or large-scale ethnic cleansing&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a>are threats to international security, and can therefore justify action by the Security Council under Chapter 7. Yet the Security Council has allowed humanitarian disasters to occur in Somalia, Bosnia, Rwanda, Kosovo and now Darfur, as acknowledged by the high-level panel.

</p>

<a name="50118-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a>When I suggested, after the first Gulf War in 1991, that we should attempt to generalise from Resolution 688, the   noble Lord, Lord Hurd, who was then Foreign Secretary, told me that it was better to proceed on a case-by-case basis. States had signed up to the charter precisely because of the protection it gave or appeared to give them against intervention even when they were committing atrocities against their own citizens.
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a>Today, according to the panel, there is an emerging international recognition that we have to protect the victims of large-scale killing, ethnic cleansing and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_733"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 733</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

serious violations of humanitarian law. Would it now be practicable to consider at least asking the Security Council to adopt a form of words similar to those used by the panel as criteria they would apply in deciding whether to exercise their authority under Article 42 of the charter?
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a>The panel refers to the need for better co-ordination between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and regional organisations, which they say could be   formalised in agreements covering, for instance, co-training of both civilian and military personnel and exchanges of personnel within peace operations. What was the outcome of the discussions the Security Council had with AU and IGAD representatives in Nairobi last November, and were they able to draft a protocol on co-operation and joint operations with those organisations?
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_489"></a>The existing AU mission in Darfur which the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, mentioned, is of course under a Security Council mandate. But co-operation there does not seem to have been very effective. Last week, three months after authorisation, the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, said that only 1,250 of the force of 3,300 had arrived because of logistical difficulties; and this after between 200,000 and 300,000 have died, 200,000 refugees have fled into Chad and an estimated 1.8   million people have fled from their homes in Darfur. But this is a political failure on the part of member states, not one of the United Nations as an organisation.
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_490"></a>There is a G8 commitment to ensure that up to 75,000 peacekeeping troops would be trained and ready to be deployed on peacekeeping operations in Africa by 2010 and the UK has volunteered to train, directly or indirectly, some 17,000 African troops in that period. Can the noble Baroness tell us if these forces to be deployed only in response to Security Council resolutions or will they act independently at the AU&#039;s volition? The panel suggests that regional operations should invariably be endorsed by the Security Council, even if in some cases of emergency, it has to be after the event.
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_491"></a>At the AU Peace and Security Council meeting in Libreville, a decision was made to send a force into eastern DRC to disarm and repatriate the FAR and Interahamwe remnants and this would be helpful. But how will the AU force relate to MONUC, the UN force responsible for peacekeeping in the region?
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_492"></a>President Obasanjo of Nigeria undertook, at the inauguration of President Abdullahi Yusuf of Somalia in Nairobi three months ago, that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a>&quot;The AU is ready to play a major role in restoring peace and security in Somalia&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_493"></a>He went on to say that the success of Africans in finding an African solution to the Somali problem would not be allowed to go to waste.

</p>

<a name="50118-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_494"></a>It was a hard slog to get to this point, and if the president and Parliament do not relocate to the country immediately, momentum will be lost and the peace deal may fall apart, as happened in 2001 with the previous transitional government. But President Yusuf was at one <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_734"></a>

point asking for 20,000 AU peacekeepers to accompany him back to Mogadishu. Whatever the number, will they operate under a purely AU mandate, or will it need a Security Council resolution?
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a>Finally, the idea of a peacebuilding commission, to prevent the failures of states and co-ordinate the international community&#039;s efforts in post-conflict peacebuilding, is an excellent one, and would apply directly to the case of Somalia today. I hope that the Government have had an opportunity of considering that proposal and that the Minister can give a preliminary response to it this evening.

<a name="50118-26_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Astor of Hever: </b>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, for initiating a most interesting and much needed debate. Indeed, I understand that it is this topic that will hold the attention of Members of the other place in Westminster Hall tomorrow. I would add my name to the tribute that the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, paid to the noble Baroness.

</p>

<a name="50118-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_496"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned some of the failures of the UN and the failure of the UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. As in Rwanda, Sudan and the Congo, the UN&#039;s involvement there will long be remembered as a shameful episode in the organisation&#039;s history. I know people whose family was murdered there while the UN stood by doing nothing despite its mandate. They would certainly agree with my noble friend Lady Park&#039;s description of the UN as a,

<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-26_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_497"></a>Since his appointment as Secretary-General, Kofi Annan has tried to institute reform at the UN. We on these Benches have supported the idea of,


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a>&quot;a leaner, more efficient and more effective&quot;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a>&quot;more realistic in its goals and commitments&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-26_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a>We need to ensure that the British taxpayer gets value for the &#163;623 million that it currently contributes to the United Nations.
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_500"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, rightly said,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a>&quot;as contributors to the UN coffers, we are entitled to accountability&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-26_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a>We need to ensure that any corruption is weeded out. That is an important issue to which I will turn later when I discuss the Oil for Food programme.
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_502"></a>In the meantime, I will nail my colours to the mast. Despite criticism&#151;and I agreed with everything that my noble friend Lady Park said about Zimbabwe&#151;the UN has been a force for good. We believe that it remains an important institution, but that it needs reform. We agree with the majority view in the high-level panel report. It is a compendium of conventional and sensible things that anyone wishing to give,

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-26_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a>would be compelled to endorse. However, there are three areas of the report with which I take issue: the use of force, Security Council reform and nuclear weapons.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_735"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 735</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-26_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a>The use of force in any situation is not to be taken lightly. We should always aim to use force as a last resort, and force which has as much support from the rest of the international community as possible. However, we should never give up our right to decide on such actions even if the Security Council does not fully concur. Although we must work towards the greater good of our globe, we must not forget that there may be times when it is our own national interest, or that of an   ally, to go to war without Security Council authorisation; for example, our action against genocide in Kosovo. Our public policy, the defence of this country, or a persecuted population at risk of genocide should not be held hostage to a bureaucratic assumption that the Security Council works in the interests of all its members. The UN is valuable, but it is not everything. It is not a world government and it is certainly not the sole source of international legitimacy.
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_505"></a>I shall briefly touch on the issue of Security Council reform and membership. We are willing to consider enlarging the Security Council provided no additional vetoes are handed out. We share the report&#039;s aim of making it more representative. But simply enlarging the council will not address the gridlock that has beset the   council since its inception. During the Cold War the council passed few resolutions. Since then, although it has passed many more, they have often been vague and   weak. In the case of Iraq, it failed to enforce its resolutions properly. It is vital that the Security Council should be reformed so that it is able to fulfil its mission to maintain international peace and security. Does the Minister agree that a lot more thinking must be done on how to make that happen?
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_506"></a>I must make it clear that we are completely opposed to the suggestion that the EU should have a seat at the UN. We would never give up our seat on the council to make way for an EU seat, not least because its voice would be muffled on major issues where the European nations have strongly differing views. Could the noble Baroness please inform the House of the Government&#039;s position on EU membership of the UN?
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_507"></a>The UN Report admits that, although the UN did not work properly during the Cold War due to superpower rivalry, the,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a>&quot;world has now changed and expectations about legal compliance are much higher&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-26_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_508"></a>Yet during the Iraq war and the ongoing post-war regeneration, many international commentators have discussed the relevance of the UN. The actions of the Security Council in particular raised significant questions. France, China and Russia&#039;s disagreement on the issues surrounding Iraq delayed any decisions. Meanwhile, until the Iraq regime was overthrown, it was necessary to keep sanctions on the country, which caused enormous hardship to Iraqi people, but not the elite. All other options had been exhausted; 12 years of rewards and threats, which had been subject to indefinite delay, did not work.
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_509"></a>Can preserving the global order really require unilateral preventive action to be absolutely forbidden? I do not believe that the world has changed in the way that the UN panel asserts. We may not be paralysed by the Cold War struggle, but it has yet to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_736"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 736</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

conform to legislative ideals. China&#039;s blocking of intervention in Darfur, mentioned by my noble friend Lady Park, is a tragic example.
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_510"></a>Nuclear weapons are always controversial. While the report&#039;s desire to be rid of them is laudable, they cannot be disinvented. We believe that these weapons are the ultimate guarantee of Britain&#039;s security. They mean that an attack on us is not rational, since the price could outweigh any possible gain. I would argue nuclear weapons have helped to preserve peace in Europe. At a time when there is proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the world at large, they remain essential for our own and NATO&#039;s security. We must retain a minimum but effective strategic nuclear force. Obviously, their use could only ever be contemplated in a supreme emergency, to overcome a mortal threat to the existence or independence of this country, or as a proportionate response to an attack using weapons of mass destruction. I hope that the Minister will agree with this stance.
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_511"></a>I now return to the issue of corruption and the problems surrounding the Oil for Food programme (OFF). A US Senate hearing that was investigating allegations of corruption surrounding this programme heard that the Iraqi regime made more than 21 billion dollars from illicit sales, the majority of which has been traced to various accounts in Jordanian banks. The interim report of the UN&#039;s Independent Inquiry Committee stated that this corruption was not just a hoodwinking of the system by the Iraqi regime, but malpractice within the UN itself&#151;evidence for which can be seen from the IIC&#039;s report into those areas of the OFFP that were audited by the UN&#039;s Internal Audit Division.
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_512"></a>However, there remain whole areas of the programme that have not been audited. It is believed that evidence of waste and misappropriation of funds has been covered up&#151;a practice that can only encourage greater corruption. The first audit reports were carried out in 1997. Can the Minister say whether the Government will call for a full audit of the OFFP and explain why they have not done so sooner?
</p>

<a name="50118-26_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_513"></a>I have limited myself to four questions in the hope that the Minister may provide some answers. Despite our criticism, we believe that the UN has been a force for good. It remains an important institution and we should support its reform, with caveats, and do all that we can to ensure that the organisation and its members are accountable for their actions.

<a name="50118-27_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Crawley: </b>   My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, on securing this debate on UN reform and thank all noble Lords on their reflective and, at times, spirited contributions. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, will accept that I may be on the left, but not the unthinking left&#151;perhaps the trendy left.

</p>

<a name="50118-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_514"></a>The debate could not be more timely. UN reform has an increasing profile within the international community and the UK. Indeed, there will be a debate in another place tomorrow. This follows the publication of two <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_737"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 737</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

reports on improving the UN, to which I will return later, in anticipation of the Millennium Review Summit in September, which will assess progress against the millennium development goals.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_515"></a>I should start by saying that the Government support the UN and fully support the UN Secretary-General, who is doing a fine job under difficult circumstances. But no organisation can stand still. I fully agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, who believes that the UN needs to reform if it is to meet the   challenges of the 21st century. The two recent examples of UN weakness that have received most attention are the Iraq Oil for Food programme, raised by the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, and other noble Lords, and, most recently, the allegations of widespread sexual exploitation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by members of the MONUC peacekeeping mission.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_516"></a>While we support the UN&#039;s action to date with the appointment of an independent inquiry into Oil for Food and a special adviser on sexual exploitation, we should not shy away from the lessons that will need to be learnt. The allegations in the DRC, if borne out, are a fundamental betrayal of the trust that is essential if peacekeeping missions are to succeed.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_517"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, highlighted allegations of corruption, waste and inefficiency within the UN system, as did the noble Baroness, Lady   Park of Monmouth. The UN has put in place the Office of Internal Oversight Services to tackle that problem. In the past 10 years, the OIOS has exposed 290 million dollars of fraud and waste. We have supported moves to ensure greater transparency in the work of the OIOS, but it would be wrong to imply that the UN is not attempting to resolve the issue.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_518"></a>On the tsunami, our minds have been focused recently on the terrible events in the Indian Ocean, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, and others. The UN is involved in a range of countries to provide vital humanitarian assistance. The UK Government are in daily contact with the UN to discuss issues that arise. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, overall we are satisfied with the job being undertaken by the UN. Of course I pay tribute to the work of the United States, Australia and many other countries in their individual responses to the tsunami.

</p>

<a name="50118-27_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_519"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, raised the issue of the misuse of funds at the Food and Agriculture Organisation, with funds going to the Palestine agriculture ministry. Palestine is not a member of the Food and Agriculture Organisation. The FAO undertakes some development projects in Palestine, funded through extra budgetary resources, but none of those funds goes to a Palestinian ministry of agriculture, nor to fund ministry employees.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_520"></a>On Sudan, the whole international community responded too slowly to the crisis there, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said in his excellent contribution. It was a low priority until the suffering appeared on television and that was compounded by the difficult <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_738"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 738</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

operating environment that humanitarian workers found there. The UN-led co-ordination in Sudan has not always been adequate. The lesson for the UN to learn from Darfur is that its response to humanitarian crises   requires much stronger leadership. However, humanitarian assistance is now getting through to the people who need it. In December last year, the World Food Programme, for example, provided food assistance to 1.3 million people in Darfur.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_521"></a>I know that human rights are a particular passion of the noble Baroness, Lady Cox. I salute the work that she does. We fully recognise that the Commission on Human Rights is not perfect&#151;its 53 members include some with poor human rights records&#151;but imperfect as the system is, we do not believe that excluding those whom it is designed to influence is the way forward. Instead, we would seek to press those who are members of the commission to commit to improving their human rights record during their time as members to try to improve the day-to-day lives of their own people.

</p>

<a name="50118-27_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_522"></a>The commission&#039;s work in expanding understanding of human rights, initiating negotiations on key issues such as torture and in appointing country-specific rapporteurs, for example, to Burma, should not be dismissed. One of our priorities is to place human rights at the heart of UN business, which is why we welcome the recent recommendation of the high-level panel that the High Commissioner for Human Rights should have a far more significant role in the work of the Security Council.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a>As regards peacekeeping, which was raised by several noble Lords, there is no doubt that there are weaknesses and difficulties associated with UN peacekeeping operations which need to be urgently addressed. Peacekeeping missions are based on the consent of the receiving nations following the signing of a comprehensive peace agreement and, if they are to be successful, the political will of parties to the conflict. If that political will is absent, a peacekeeping operation often becomes very difficult.

</p>

<a name="50118-27_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a>I disagree that there are no successful peacekeeping operations. We should look at the operations in East Timor and Sierra Leone which, although they have not had an easy path, are planning to end leaving behind a sustainable peace to build on. Similarly, the peacekeeping operations in Ethiopia and Eritrea have   been broadly successful, while that in the C&#244;te   d&#039;Ivoire has been robust in handling an extremely difficult situation. These examples of positive action by UN operations demonstrate their worth, but do not avoid the need to learn lessons from the past such as the terrible genocide in Rwanda and the steps needed to be taken to ensure that this kind of terrible event cannot happen in future.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_525"></a>I shall look for a moment at the current reform proposals for the UN. The discussion of peacekeeping leads towards an area where I fundamentally disagree with the noble Baroness; namely, the role of the current reform process, which she dismisses as being insufficiently radical. The high-level panel report referred to by noble Lords published in December and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_739"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 739</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the millennium project report published yesterday are   not panaceas. If their recommendations are implemented, the UN will be much more in line with that suggested by the noble Baroness. We welcome the high-level panel report and the millennium project report very much.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_526"></a>The high-level panel report is a radical document in many ways. Its recommendations for a peace-building commission will fundamentally change the approach to conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction. Although the idea of the commission is simple, its potential is enormous, as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, suggested.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_527"></a>Moreover, the panel specifically recognises that there is a responsibility to protect against genocide, ethnic cleansing and other violations of international humanitarian law, addressing directly the issue of non-interference in internal affairs of which the noble Baroness is rightly critical. I hope that the noble Baroness will take a full part in the upcoming debate on the high-level panel report in this House in February.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_528"></a>As well as that report, the UK Government have also welcomed the millennium project report published on 17 January. We look forward to working with others to consider the recommendations in more detail. The report demonstrates that aid works. We need significantly to scale up the resources available for countries that are committed to poverty reduction.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_529"></a>As regards the issue of expelling UN members, the noble Baroness suggests that the UN excludes members who are in clear breach of the charter. It is a superficially attractive argument, and it is allowed for under the current UN charter. However, it is both difficult to enforce in practice, requiring votes in both the Security Council and the General Assembly and arguably counter-productive as one of the great strengths of the UN is universal membership, in clear contrast with the failed League of Nations. Suspension has been used, for instance, in the case of South Africa.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_530"></a>I come to the specific questions put to me by noble Lords. The noble Baroness, Lady Park, raised the issue of Zimbabwe at the UN. We share her concern at the situation in Zimbabwe. We have raised it with both<i> </i>the Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly of the UN. We, like her, regret that a procedural resolution last autumn prevented a substantive resolution on Zimbabwe being discussed in the General Assembly.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_531"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, asked me to pay tribute to the United States and Australia for their actions after the tsunami disaster. Of course I pay tribute to those countries&#039; efforts in the early days of the crisis. It is also significant that they handed over to the UN, and the UN&#039;s response, though not perfect, has been a good job overall.

<p><a name="stpa_532"></a>In his questions to me, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, quoted the report from the panel. It stated that the emerging consensus is that the UN should be able to intervene in cases of large-scale killing, ethnic cleansing and violation of humanitarian law. He asked whether the form of words that the panel uses could be embodied in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_740"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 740</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the UN charter. We strongly welcome the proposals put forward by the panel in the area of a collective responsibility to protect. They are similar to longstanding UK policy. The panel has not suggested that these proposals are embodied in the UN charter, which might prove difficult to achieve. We should not underestimate the difficulties in getting agreement for the proposals, even as they currently stand.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_533"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, also asked how the African Union forces are to be deployed and whether they are always to be deployed in response to Security Council resolutions. Regional peacekeeping missions currently do not have to be under the auspices of the Security Council if the country concerned consents to regional group troops playing such a role on its territory. This is allowed for under Chapter VIII of the current UN charter. However, in practice, most regional peacekeeping missions are authorised by the UN and, indeed, are precursors for a UN mission. We anticipate that this will remain the case. We strongly welcome the suggestion by the panel of increased co-operation between the UN and regional organisations.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_534"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, also asked what the Government think about the proposed peacekeeping commission. We support the recommendation that a peacekeeping mission and an associated peace-building secretariat be created. He also asked about the request of President Yusuf of Somalia for 2,000 peacekeepers to guard him. Our understanding is that President Yusuf of Somalia has made such a request to the African Union and that the African Union is prepared to deploy only after Yusuf has returned and the government have been re-established.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_535"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, asked whether I agree that more thinking is needed about how to reform the Security Council to make it better able to maintain international peace and security. I agree that reforming the membership should go hand-in-hand with reforming the way that the council works. The noble Lord rightly raised Iraq as an example of where the council failed to enforce its resolutions. We shall build on successes such as Sierra Leone and East Timor.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_536"></a>The noble Lord also asked me about EU membership of the Security Council. The UN is an organisation of member states. EU membership of the Security Council is impossible under the charter. The EU is well represented on the council by the UK and France and, currently, by Greece and Denmark.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_537"></a>The noble Lord asked me about the maintenance of nuclear deterrence. The UK is committed under the non-proliferation treaty to work towards general nuclear disarmament. Until that day comes, the noble Lord&#039;s point must be of importance.
</p>

<a name="50118-27_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_538"></a>Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Astor, asked me about a full audit of the Oil for Food programme. The inquiry has published many documents, to which the noble Lord referred. We expect the interim report later this month and the full report later this year. We are co-operating fully with that inquiry.

<a name="50118-27_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_539"></a>To sum up, the noble Baroness asked for reassurance and I hope that I have given her some reassurance that this Government are not complacent about the UN or the agenda for reform. The year 2005 provides real opportunities to progress across the full range of UN reform through the high-level panel, the millennium project and the millennium review summit. Our position as the holder of the presidency of the G8 and, from July, the holder of the presidency of the EU gives us a unique opportunity to influence the current reform debate and to improve the UN&#039;s performance.

<a name="50118-28_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Education Bill [HL]</h3>
<a name="time_26"></a>
<a name="50118-28_time0"></a><h5></h5>
<p>
<a name="stpa_540"></a>House again in Committee on Clause 72.
</p>


<p><a name="st_190"></a>
<a name="50118-28_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Filkin </b>   moved Amendment No. 133:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a>Page 41, line 12, leave out &quot;and generally to secure&quot; and insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_11"></a><br>
&quot;(2A)   In the exercise of their functions the Agency shall have regard, in particular, to the desirability of securing&quot;

<p><a name="st_191"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No.   133, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 135, 135A and 136. These comprise a general policy statement about the objectives of the Training and Development Agency for Schools. In its current form, it already appears in the 1994 Act and is similarly worded in the national curriculum requirements.
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_541"></a>Amendments Nos. 133, 135 and 136 are government amendments and are intended to remove ambiguity in the wording of Clause 72 which might prevent the agency taking on the full range of activities that the   Government had intended. The combined effect of the amendments is to remove any doubt that the agency can take on work in relation to the whole of the school workforce and to affirm that, in doing so, it should have regard to the development of children and young people, whether they are educated in school or elsewhere.
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_542"></a>The amendments are intended to make clear that teachers of 14 to 19 year-olds in every institution are captured, along with those who deliver childcare to pre-school children. The changes that we propose are technical and do not alter the policy intention of creating a framework that allows the TDA to operate effectively within a broader remit.
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_543"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 135A and shall respond in anticipation of what the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, might say. Members of the Committee will already appreciate that the Government believe it is critical that school staff have all the support that they need in addressing issues of pupil welfare in our schools. It is, of course, part and parcel of the overall responsibility of anyone who works with children to secure their safety and well-being.

</p>

<a name="50118-28_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_544"></a>At the same time, while it is important, this is just one of many desirable outcomes for our society to which a high-quality school workforce should contribute. Thus, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_742"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 742</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

we believe it is unnecessary to put in the Bill an exhaustive list of those outcomes because Clause 72 could be extended virtually indefinitely.
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_545"></a>Therefore, the Government cannot support Amendment No. 135A for the simple reason that it would add to the Bill needlessly, but they can support its intent in that we are fully aware of how important the agency work is to the promotion of child welfare. I say that, in particular, given that I have responsibility for vulnerable children and for safeguarding children who may be at risk. That work will continue and, as this is an integral element of the work of teachers and of many others in the school workforce, it will form part of the agency&#039;s objectives by virtue of subsection (2)(a) of the clause.

</p>

<a name="50118-28_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_546"></a>All qualified teachers already train to secure children&#039;s welfare as part of their initial training. Indeed, a requirement in awarding qualified teacher status provides, in particular, that candidates who wish to be awarded QTS must first show that they understand the statutory responsibilities, including in respect of children&#039;s welfare.
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_547"></a>But, of course, the Children Act, and the way in which children&#039;s trusts and local authorities address the responsibilities under the Act, will undoubtedly enrich&#151;as it will need to do&#151;the thinking in local authorities, in trusts and in the school workforce about how better to   address children&#039;s welfare in schools and the contribution that schools can make to safeguarding children and their wider welfare. That is part of the ongoing challenge that all those institutions face, and I am sure that the TDA will make an important contribution in supporting them in developing more effective ways of addressing children&#039;s welfare. It is important that they do that, but I do not think that it will be necessary to place a statutory exhortation in the Bill. I hope that that has been helpful. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_192"></a>
<a name="50118-28_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I have to confess that I have been caught slightly short on this one as I had not noticed that one of our amendments had been included in this group. In addition, I do not think that I have any briefing for Amendment No. 135A, which I believe came from the NSPCC.
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_548"></a>The amendment reflects our slight disquiet about the Bill in that we do not feel that it fully reflects the   children&#039;s agenda. We made that point fairly substantially when we talked about the inspection aspects of the Bill. This amendment injects the same element into the training and development of teachers that we were anxious about as regards children and young people in the Children Act; that is, our constant debates on whether it should involve just children or children and young people. In the end the Act reflected the consensus that it needed to be both children and young people and preparing children and young people for adult life. The amendment goes back to those debates.
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_549"></a>I hear what the Minister said. My noble friend Lady   Walmsley, who is on a Select Committee visit to Washington, probably has stronger views than I have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_743"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 743</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

about it. But we will look at the amendment and perhaps have further words with the Minister about it.
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_550"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.
</p>




<p><a name="st_193"></a>
<a name="50118-28_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield </b>   moved Amendment No. 134:
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_551"></a>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74"></a>Page 41, line 13, after &quot;the&quot; insert &quot;behavioural,&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_194"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 134 would include as a duty on the Teacher and Development Agency a requirement to ensure that the school workforce was well fitted and trained to promote the behavioural development of pupils.
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_552"></a>This amendment returns us to a similar theme to one that we discussed at some length in our first day in Committee. However, the difference is that in this instance it would put the emphasis on the agency to prepare future teachers and indeed non-teachers with the ability to handle bad behaviour and promote and enforce expected levels of discipline.
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_553"></a>As my noble friend Lady Morris pointed out during our earlier deliberations today, good discipline is one of the key determinants in producing a successful and conducive environment in which pupils are able to learn and teachers are able to teach. Therefore I believe that it is important that as part of the training process prospective teachers are schooled in the necessary techniques and ways in which good discipline and order can be maintained both in the classroom and in the general school environment.
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_554"></a>Furthermore, it is important that teachers and other support staff are educated in techniques that can be employed to deal with unruly behaviour. Again, this could be incorporated in the training provided by the agency.
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_555"></a>The Minister may, I suspect, tell the Committee that such activities are already in place. If that is the case I see no harm in incorporating such a requirement into the Bill. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_195"></a>
<a name="50118-28_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   I will be brief. We earlier heard the argument that looking at the behavioural performance of children should be included explicitly in the duty of the inspectorate. The Minister argued that that was not necessary. He may well be right. But it would be helpful&#151;as has been proposed here&#151;to include it as one of the major points in which would-be teachers have to be skilled before they are set loose in the classroom. It is a major requirement nowadays. I welcome the noble Lord&#039;s initiative in tabling the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_196"></a>
<a name="50118-28_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   Yes, perhaps surprisingly, I do too, while, not surprisingly, not necessarily thinking it needs to go into the Bill. I welcome it because we had a good debate on earlier clauses about how important getting an even stronger grip on behaviour in our schools is in terms of attainment for all pupils. That is not to belittle the considerable progress that has been made by the Government in this respect, nor to over-dramatise the extent of the problem.

</p>

<a name="50118-28_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_556"></a>There is plenty of evidence that shows that many teachers think that behaviour in their schools is reasonable and not a major source of problem. But <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_744"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 744</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

there is also evidence that a proportion of them think there are problems, or that there are problems from time to time. Therefore, I do not think that for a second we take this as, &quot;It is all all right then, we do not need to worry about doing anything else&quot;. That is not the Government&#039;s stance.
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_557"></a>I want to signal that this has been part of the TTA&#039;s brief. I shall briefly touch on some of the things it has done. It is essential that the strategy is part of the TTA&#039;s future role in giving the best possible thought to trainee teachers, leaders in schools, teachers at different stages of their careers and all the school workforce. It is relevant to addressing behaviour issues. We would be foolish if we thought that we wanted to stay where we are. We want to go further on the issue.
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_558"></a>Let me give a little flavour on the matter. The behaviour and attendance strand of the national key stage 3 strategy already helps schools to create and sustain a positive environment for teaching and learning. The key stage 3 behaviour and attendance strand represents a commitment to every secondary and middle school to support behaviour and attendance issues. One of its key aims is to reduce teachers&#039; stress over the management of behaviour and develop schools and institutions that consistently manage behaviour attendance well. This is achieved by providing school staff with the skills to manage behaviour and attendance.
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_559"></a>All qualified teachers are already trained to deal with poor pupil behaviour as part of their initial training. But to what extent do they exit with the confidence and skill to do it well, and can we go further? The legal requirement of QTS requires that candidates must demonstrate and promote the positive values, attitudes and behaviour that they expect of pupils. The award must demonstrate that they have a range of strategies to promote good behaviour. So, again, that element of the architecture is in place; the challenge is, can it go further?
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_560"></a>The TTA will, through its development of CPD, continue to develop strategies for achieving the high standards for the school workforce generally. It has already done that successfully in respect of the standards for both teachers and higher-level teaching assistants. So the TTA has had a range of roles in initial teacher training on behaviour, in newly qualified teacher induction, in postgraduate professional development for teachers, in the national programme for specialist leaders in behaviour and attendance and in the standards of support staff remodelling and training for support staff.
</p>

<a name="50118-28_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_561"></a>I have absolutely no doubt that my Secretary of State will expect the clearest focus by the TDA for the future on how its working in partnership with the schools and other parts of the educational system can go further and faster on this agenda, because, without wanting to overplay it, we know it matters massively to improve it. I do not necessarily promise that I will be able to bring noble Lords added richness at a latter stage of our <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_745"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 745</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

discussions in terms of the specific chapter and verse. If I can, I will. But I would not want the Committee to be in the slightest doubt about how essentially important this is to the Government, as it is to many parents. If noble Lords have any doubt on that, just read my new Secretary of State&#039;s speech to the northern schools conference a few weeks or so ago. So I agree with the spirit while still not thinking that putting it into the statute is needed.

<a name="50118-29_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   I should like to thank the noble Lord for those words. As I said in my introductory remarks, this was a big issue at the time we were discussing Part 1 of the Bill and what Ofsted was required to inspect the school for. We are back to the subject in the training of teachers. It is a fundamental issue in the improvement of our schools. I was pleased to hear the Minister acknowledge that.

</p>

<a name="50118-29_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_562"></a>I was very tempted to vote on the matter tonight. I certainly would not win a vote now, so it might be better to leave it to the next stage, when I probably would win it. The Minister said at the end of his comments that he will reflect on the matter. So we will expect the Government to do that, particularly if they want to see this legislation through before a potential general election. Given the strong words of the Minister, perhaps before the Report stage the Government could reflect on both areas of the Committee&#039;s concern and come back with their own suggestion or support some suggestion that we put forward. I hope that the Minister might reflect on that and perhaps even communicate with us on it before the Report stage.
</p>

<a name="50118-29_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_563"></a>In view of what the Minister said to me just before we came back after dinner&#151;I think that we would all like to get Part 3 finished tonight, and we are certainly going to finish at ten o&#039;clock&#151;I shall not press for a vote now.
</p>




<p><a name="st_198"></a>
<a name="50118-29_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Dearing: </b>   Given the choice between the two parts of the Bill, I am convinced that Ofsted are considering the matter seriously, so the amendment would be my preferred choice, if there was an issue of choice. If the lads and lasses who are teachers can do it, it solves the problem. The inspectors cannot solve it.

<p><a name="st_204"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a probing amendment to explore the issue of training in relation to teachers in school and non-school environments. In particular, we hope to use the amendment as a way to explore the relationship between the Training and Development Agency for Schools and the training of teachers in the learning and skills sector, especially with regard to further education.
</p>

<a name="50118-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_568"></a>It seems to me&#151;I am sure that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;that Clause 72(3)(b) applies to FE college teachers. Schools do not employ them, but their work nevertheless consists of teaching. Does that mean that they are in fact included in the definition of the school workforce with their initial teacher training, therefore coming under the auspices of the agency? I would be interested to hear to what extent that affects the Further Education National Training Organisation, the Learning and Skills Council and further education colleges.
</p>

<a name="50118-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_569"></a>The Minister will be aware of the DfES consultation on the future of initial teacher education for the learning and skills sector last year, in which the then Higher Education Minister, Alan Johnson, stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_78"></a>&quot;although recruitment to the learning and skills sector must follow a different model reflecting the diversity of the sector, there are many lessons to be learnt from the success in the school sector&quot;.</p>

<p>



</p>

<a name="50118-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_570"></a>The Minister will also be aware of the clear view that came through in response to that consultation that the   learning and skills sector needed a TTA-type organisation to set and implement professional standards and improve funding arrangements. Given that background, I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify whether the agency will have a role in the training of teachers in the sector. If not, are teachers from the   sector to be excluded from the provisions under Clause 76 that would allow them access to financial support? I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_205"></a>
<a name="50118-29_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I should just like to say how important the amendment is. It is important for us to get clear precisely who is covered by the TDA and who is not. I also agree with the noble Baroness that we should be concerned with the training of teachers in the further education sector.
</p>




<p><a name="st_206"></a>
<a name="50118-29_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </b>   I speak from the Back Bench. I cannot speak from the Front Bench, as my noble friend has already spoken. As a former teacher in FE for 14 years, I think that the amendment is useful. I remember that in those days not all of my colleagues had the necessary skills&#151;that is being kind to them&#151;to deliver everything that was required up to the standard required. There were people who did not <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_747"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 747</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

have teacher training qualifications and would have benefited from them. That is very important in the FE sector, and I back the amendment all the way.
</p>




<p><a name="st_207"></a>
<a name="50118-29_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   Clause 73(3) enables the Training and Development Agency for Schools to engage in activities that may benefit not only persons who work in schools but those who teach elsewhere. We propose that the agency should have scope to cater for people working outside schools because some teachers are not simply based on school premises but nevertheless have a teaching function. For example, there are teachers who work in the museum service and others may be catering for special needs outside the school environment. Teachers are also employed in a variety of settings that offer outdoor and experiential learning. However, we have proposed that the agency&#039;s scope to cater for people working outside schools should be more limited than its ability to provide for those who work in schools. For example, the agency would not be able to fund the training of administrative support staff other than in schools. The TDA&#039;s objectives set the outside parameters on how it may exercise its function. They do not necessarily require the TDA to undertake work in relation to the whole school workforce as defined in the Bill. That the TDA will be able to undertake work which benefits people who teach but do not work in schools can be beneficial for the reasons I gave with regard to those two examples.
</p>

<a name="50118-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_571"></a>We believe that it would not be desirable to exclude such types of teachers from access to the activities for teachers that the new TDA will be undertaking. If the professional skills of a teacher employed by a museum can be developed through the same kind of continuous training that would be available to another teacher employed by the school, it would seem sensible to include them.
</p>

<a name="50118-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_572"></a>This power will also be of value at the interface of the school with other types of education. For example, in the field of 14-to-19 education, we should seek to dismantle the barriers which exist between what goes on in schools and what goes on in sixth form and FE colleges rather than erect new ones. However, I was emphasising the interface. I shall return to that point in a moment.
</p>

<a name="50118-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_573"></a>Without the ability to carry out activities in relation to people who teach outside schools, it is hard to see how the TDA would be able to make an effective contribution to this process and in particular to exercise some functions jointly with the agencies responsible for workforce training in the further education sector and other bodies in the way in which Clause 89 envisaged. But those words are the key ones&#151;to make a contribution to this process, in particular to exercise some functions with the other agencies responsible.
</p>

<a name="50118-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_574"></a>In response to the direct question about how it affects, for example, the Learning and Skills Council and colleges of further education, it does not directly legitimate the TDA to do teaching work in those <br>&nbsp;<br>

institutions: it legitimates them to work with FE training bodies. The White Paper, <i>Success for All</i>, set that out as the Government&#039;s policy and stance.
</p>

<a name="50118-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_575"></a>I should make clear that while we wish there to be scope for joint working between the TDA and its counterparts in the further education and children services spheres, the Government do not foresee a role for the TDA as the main funding agency for either of those sectors. That is important. I hope, therefore, that what I have said has been helpful in clarifying the probing amendment.

I would hope that most noble Lords would agree with me that this is an eminently sensible provision. The amendment would not compel the Secretary of State to appoint only those who are education professionals. It is simply a measure that will encourage the serious consideration of what constitutes the necessary qualifications for a successful appointment to membership of the agency. It recognises that expertise is important and that there must be very good reasons not to consider it as a fundamental criterion for the appointment of the agency&#039;s members. I look forward to the Minister&#039;s explanation of why the Government have left the provision out of the Bill. I beg to move.

<a name="50118-30_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   We have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_212"></a>
<a name="50118-30_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, indicated, the 1994 Act requires the Secretary of State to have regard to the desirability of including among the members of the TTA&#039;s governing body, a range of different types of person. They reflect the range of the TTA&#039;s functions when it was established.
</p>

<a name="50118-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_582"></a>The provisions have been excluded because, while they were sensible in 1994, in other respects the world has moved on. Even for teacher training alone, the range of providers nowadays goes far wider than the   university sector. In future, under its new remit, the Training and Development Agency for Schools will go much wider than teachers, to include other sorts of staff who work in schools. The variety of experience that could prove valuable among members of the agency will similarly be much wider.

</p>

<a name="50118-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_583"></a>The important question is not, therefore, whether schools and universities, and denominational and special-needs interests, should continue to have a strong voice in the TDA&#039;s activities. Clearly, they must; but the question is whether it would be right to accord a privilege to some of the parties who will have a close interest in the TDA&#039;s activities, at the expense of others. The removal of the requirement is not an attempt to disenfranchise those parties from consideration; it is a recognition that the agenda of skills and interests needs to be substantially wider.
</p>

<a name="50118-30_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_584"></a>Members of the TTA will continue to be selected through the normal public appointments process. Those procedures offer important safeguards and a good degree of transparency. It is therefore right to leave future Secretaries of State enough latitude, in appointing members of the TDA, to ensure that membership is appropriate for the width of interests necessary. One might well ask why we do not put the whole list of interests on to the statute book. It would be long; it would be difficult to be comprehensive; and, in five years&#039; time, the list would probably have <br>&nbsp;<br>

changed. Therefore, it is important that the TDA&#039;s membership reflects as far as is practicable, consistent with being able to make good-quality appointments, the width of its interests. That undertaking will govern the Secretary of State in making those appointments. I hope that that response is helpful.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80"></a>After Clause 74, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_13"></a><br>
   &quot;ANNUAL REPORT TO PARLIAMENT

<br>
   The Agency shall produce an annual report that shall be laid by the Secretary of State before both Houses of Parliament for approval by affirmative resolution.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_215"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment need not detain us very long. Its purpose is to give a higher profile to the Training and Development Agency for Schools&#039; annual report, laid before both Houses of Parliament by the Secretary of State. I say &quot;higher profile&quot; because avid readers of the Bill will be aware that such a provision is tucked away in paragraph 18 of Schedule 13.
</p>

<a name="50118-30_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_587"></a>The annual report is a standard tool for assessing and communicating the progress of government agencies to the executive and legislature. It is important to realise that the annual report will often represent the only opportunity for Members of this House and another place to hold the Government and the Training and Development Agency for Schools to account for their performance. Given that it concerns the vital issue of the quality and quantity of our teacher training, that should be recognised as such by having this provision as a standard clause in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50118-30_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_588"></a>In deciding to &quot;promote&quot; this provision from Schedule 13 to a new Clause 75, I have also taken the opportunity to leave out sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 18. It states that the agency,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81"></a>&quot;may arrange for the report to be published in such manner as the Agency consider appropriate&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_589"></a>That seems an example of superfluous drafting. As the arrangements for the publication of the report are entirely up to the agency&#151;something that it would surely have taken upon itself under Clause 80(1) or paragraph 1 of Schedule 13&#151;I cannot see why the provision is necessary. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_216"></a>
<a name="50118-30_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I shall attempt to be as commendably brief as the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, while not avoiding the issue. At the end of each financial year, the TTA has laid before Parliament an annual report of its activities, together with its audited accounts. It has done so and, indeed, it should do so. The report and accounts outline the agency&#039;s main activities and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_751"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 751</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

performance during the previous year. It also indicates the extent to which the main objectives and targets set out in the agency&#039;s corporate plan have been achieved.
</p>

<a name="50118-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_590"></a>In addition, both the chief executive of the agency and the Permanent Secretary in the department are accounting officers and thus directly accountable to Parliament for the taxpayers&#039; money that the agency spends. These procedures will continue to apply after the Training and Development Agency takes over. To put it clearly, it will continue to present its annual report and accounts to Parliament, as well as being at large to be summoned by the Education and Skills Select Committee to give evidence and to be cross-questioned on its report and accounts as well as its achievements. Again, that is as it should be. Having given that undertaking, I hope that it will not be necessary for the noble Baroness to press the amendment.
</p>

<a name="50118-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_591"></a>However, where I would differ is on the assertion that this should be subject to affirmative resolution of both Houses. I think that that would cloud the constitutional relationship. Essentially the TDA has a budget and agenda set by the Secretary of State. If the Secretary of State has set its direction and priorities, the TDA, or the TTA as now, has the duty to fulfil those requirements and is accountable to Parliament for whether it has been effective and efficient in the fulfilment of those objectives. But, without in any way being disrespectful, it is not for Parliament to set its priorities and directions; that is a matter for the Secretary of State. The Select Committee can say that it thinks that those priorities and directions are wrong and debate that with the Minister, the Permanent Secretary or the chief executive, but I do not think that it is for Parliament to agree to what the agency is doing. It is for Parliament to cross-question, to challenge and to say that it could be done better.
</p>

<a name="50118-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_592"></a>None of that takes away from the importance of parliamentary scrutiny, not only because that is what democracy is about, but also because it contributes to the performance of agencies if they are challenged effectively. I hope that, with those rather long-winded explanations, the noble Baroness will be sufficiently comforted not to press her amendment.

<p><a name="st_217"></a>
<a name="50118-31_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   I thank the Minister for that reply. He gave a very similar response to an earlier amendment I pressed that sought affirmative resolution of a report, but I thought I would have another go. Again, I shall read with interest what he has said, although I take his point. Part of the impetus for the proposal was to seek greater visibility in the Bill.

<p><a name="st_218"></a>
<a name="50118-31_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </b>   I thank the noble Baroness for giving way. I should like to get in a brief word before she withdraws her amendment.

</p>

<a name="50118-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_593"></a>Earlier in Committee we considered the role of the chief inspector. Provisions for the inspector to present his annual report to the Secretary of State, who must lay it before Parliament, are set out in Clause 3. The procedures are exactly the same. The report is then submitted for detailed scrutiny by the Select Committee. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_752"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 752</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Equally, however, those provisions are set out in the main body of the Bill as distinct from being part of a schedule. Is there a particular reason why, as the noble Baroness pointed out, the provisions covering the annual report of the TDA are hidden at the back of Schedule 13 while the provisions for the chief inspector are set out in the Bill itself?
</p>




<p><a name="st_219"></a>
<a name="50118-31_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I will take a closer look to see whether the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has caught us out in an incongruity, although I hope she has not done so. I have no idea why this provision is set out in a schedule, which may well annoy the noble Baroness, Lady   Morris. I am told that the provisions for the TDA follow the 1994 Act.

<a name="50118-31_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Morris of Bolton: </b>   I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp.

</p>




<p><a name="st_222"></a>The noble Baroness said: I was struggling tiredly through the dense undergrowth of Schedule 13, ticking off the rather sensible provisions so beloved of parliamentary draftsmen, when I was jolted from my stupor by the well documented&#151;I have to be very careful how I say this&#151;&quot;Treasury tentacles&quot; and their manifestation in paragraph 5(4). This basically states that the Chancellor must sanction any direction by the Education Secretary on the payment of salaries and expenses to members of the agency.
</p>

<a name="50118-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_596"></a>I might understand such a provision in respect of, say, pensions, but surely the members&#039; salaries come from the DfES budget. I hope the Minister can enlighten me on the purpose of the spending round, where the Chancellor agrees the DfES budget, if the department then has to go back to the Treasury for permission on how to spend its budget.

<a name="50118-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_598"></a>The effect of the amendment essentially would be to remove the statutory obligation on the Secretary of State to seek Treasury approval before setting any salaries, fees, pensions and allowances payable to members of the agency&#039;s board; before setting the allowances for members of the agency&#039;s committee; and before directing the agency to pay compensation. This obligation has been in place for the past decade by <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_753"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 753</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

virtue of paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 to the Education Act 1994. I should add for absolute clarity that members of the TTA do not receive remuneration at present.
</p>

<a name="50118-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_599"></a>The Committee may be aware that the practice of requiring in primary legislation that the Secretary of   State obtain Treasury approval for these kinds of payments in relation to non-departmental public bodies has changed since the TTA was established in 1994. Even so, it remains the case that Treasury approval should be obtained in certain circumstances. This is supported by government accounting requirements and guidance.
</p>

<a name="50118-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_600"></a>So when we came to design the Bill we had nevertheless intended to retain the requirement for Treasury approval for the remuneration of members of the Training and Development Agency for Schools. We also envisaged retaining the same requirement in respect of pay and conditions of the staff, as outlined in paragraph 6(4) of Schedule 13.
</p>

<a name="50118-31_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_601"></a>However, the amendment so eloquently proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, has prompted us to reconsider this view and to ask whether the retention of these statutory requirements is really necessary. We have concluded that there may well be a good case for removing this restriction from the face of the Bill. We should like to examine the issue in more detail before reaching a final view. Were this change to be made, it would have no effect on the applicability of the government accounting rules, including any future modification.
</p>

<a name="50118-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_602"></a>I crave the indulgence of the Committee to leave the question in abeyance for the moment in the expectation that I will return with firm proposals at Report.

</p>

<a name="50118-31_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_606"></a>It is clear that the noble Baroness also believes that the activities of the TDA should concentrate to the exclusion of all else on furthering the statutory objectives laid down in Clause 72(2). In that she is also right, and again, we agree. The TDA has a large and challenging agenda, and all its time and effort should be bent towards it.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_607"></a>Sadly, having said all that, we cannot support the amendment not, as I hope I have made clear, because it is wrong-headed but because it is unnecessary. The agency&#039;s objectives clearly constrain the substantive activities it may undertake by virtue of the specific wording of its functions in Clauses 75 and 80. It does not make sense to suggest in the Bill that the agency would establish a committee unrelated to activities that it can lawfully undertake.
</p>

<a name="50118-31_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_608"></a>Paragraph 18 of Schedule 13 reproduces exactly the   corresponding provision in Schedule 1 to the Education Act 1994, including the seemingly loose words that the agency may establish a committee &quot;for any purpose&quot;. The noble Baroness gave two examples; I shall give another two. The wording does not mean that a committee may be set up on the state of North Sea fish stocks or the performance of the England cricket team. Incidentally, this is a good opportunity to congratulate it, on behalf of the House, on its excellent performance yesterday. All the agency&#039;s substantive activities are bound by its objectives, and it will only establish committees designed to contribute towards its achievement.

<p><a name="stpa_614"></a>Amendments Nos. 137C and 137D are simple probing amendments designed to elicit from the Minister an explanation and further details of the conditions under which the Training and Development Agency is able to provide financial support.

<a name="50118-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_615"></a>Given that the agency is extending its remit to provide support to all members of the school work force, I would be interested to learn a little more of how the operation will work in practice. We have learnt that, despite this extension of the agency&#039;s remit, it will receive no additional financial support. Therefore, it is important for the Minister to provide an assurance that the new reformed agency will have sufficient resources to carry out its existing and new functions.
</p>

<a name="50118-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_616"></a>Furthermore, how will the agency judge the criteria for making any financial award available? How will the agency decide whether to award a grant or a loan? Furthermore, what is meant by &quot;other payments&quot;, as specified in Clause 76(1)? How many individuals, does the Minister envisage, will the agency assist on an annual basis, and what will be the percentage breakdown between individuals who are teachers receiving support and other members of the school workforce? Is it likely that teachers will still receive the lion&#039;s share of any support?
</p>

<a name="50118-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_617"></a>Amendment No. 137D is designed to elicit from the Minister an explanation of the rate of interest at which the agency will be able to make available any financial support.

<a name="50118-32_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   Before I address the questions that the noble Baroness has raised&#151;some of which I cannot answer in any detail, so I shall have to write to her&#151;let me explain what will be achieved by the amendment. It is extremely important.
</p>

<a name="50118-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_619"></a>The amendment would remove two provisions which feature in the corresponding sections of the Education Act 1994. They would make it extremely difficult for the new agency to exercise its funding functions effectively. If passed, the amendments would <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_756"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 756</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

make Part 3 of the Bill virtually impossible to operate. I am sure that noble Lords would not want that to happen. It would be especially unfortunate in view of the warm welcome that the government proposals have received.
</p>

<a name="50118-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_620"></a>Amendment No.137 would delete subsection (2) of the clause. The subsection allows the agency to make financial support available under such terms and conditions as it thinks fit, subject to the subsequent provisions of the clause and to the general duty that falls on all public bodies to act in a reasonable and rational way.
</p>

<a name="50118-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_621"></a>At the very least, that change would limit the terms and conditions which it was able to set to those described in subsections (3) to (6) inclusive. It would make it near-impossible for the agency to carry out its business.
</p>

<a name="50118-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_622"></a>I will give an example. Since 2000, the TTA has administered the teacher training bursary scheme. If this Bill were enacted, it would continue to do so by virtue of the power in Clause 75. Payments to training providers in respect of the scheme comprise a principal sum of &#163;6,000 per eligible student plus a handling fee for the provider. Under the conditions of the grant, the   provider is required to pass on the &#163;6,000 in full to the eligible student.
</p>

<a name="50118-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_623"></a>The amendment would make a wholly desirable condition of that sort unlawful. Among other things, it would make unworkable a scheme that last year gave us the largest intake of new trainees in 30 years.
</p>

<a name="50118-32_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_624"></a>The effects of the second amendment would not be so drastic, but they would still be undesirable. By deleting subsection (3)(b), the amendment would prevent the agency charging interest on any grant that it had paid out but which was due for repayment as a result of a condition of the grant not having been met.
</p>

<a name="50118-32_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_625"></a>There are several circumstances which might call that provision into play. For instance, payments to training providers are mainly made on the basis of student numbers. Sometimes, those numbers are based on estimates of future recruitment. Some students drop out of their course before the payments fall due. It is clearly right that any payments made in respect of students who turn out not to be there at all should be reclaimed and the sums involved put to other uses. Without the ability to charge interest on such sums, the   agency would be unable to incentivise prompt repayment. There would be a strong incentive&#151;a perverse incentive&#151;not to repay. We do not want that state of affairs. It has also been a remarkably effective deterrent. In recent years, TTA officials are unable to recall a single instance of the payment of interest being demanded from any of its grant recipients.
</p>

<a name="50118-32_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_626"></a>Taken in a different way, the amendments would do serious&#151;in the first case, possibly terminal&#151;damage to the TTA&#039;s ability to function effectively. That is why we cannot accept the amendments.

</p>

<a name="50118-32_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_627"></a>The TTA is getting an extra &#163;71 million in 2005&#150;06. How it awards its grants will be a matter for it to determine according to its own criteria. The proportion that goes to teachers&#151;as opposed to non-teachers&#151;is not yet fixed but teachers will still get the lion&#039;s share.

<p><a name="stpa_628"></a>The noble Baroness asked what was meant by &quot;other payments&quot; as well as grants and loans. These are payments which will sweep up and catch other forms of funding and will allow for flexibility&#151;for example, if the TTA has to pay a debt under a contract owed by the training provider.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_85"></a>Page 42, line 25, leave out subsection (5).</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>




<p><a name="st_235"></a>The noble Baroness said: I move this amendment on behalf of my noble friend Lord Hanningfield. We have tabled it because we hope that the Minister will be able to explain what exactly would be lost from the Bill if the amendment were accepted. As far as I can understand it, subsection (5) provides that when the Training and Development Agency for Schools makes any type of payment to a training provider under the conditions of Clause 76(4) and the training provider uses a subcontracted training provider, the subcontractor&#039;s fees are regarded as the training provider&#039;s fees.

</p>

<a name="50118-32_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_632"></a>I am sure that it is a simple matter, but will the Minister give me an example of when this provision might be invoked? I certainly understand the principle&#151;that this provision gives the Training and Development Agency for Schools a measure of control over the use of its financial support so that subcontracting arrangements are not allowed to become unaccountable&#151;but I am curious how this provision might be implemented. For example, if a person has a serious accident preventing him continuing his training with the subcontractor and he seeks a reimbursement of his fees, will the original training provider be liable for that reimbursement? I do not wish to suggest that this provision is unnecessary, but I would welcome some clarification from the Minister on its exact purpose and implications.

</p>

<a name="50118-32_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_633"></a>Amendment No. 139 is very similar to Amendment No. 138 in that it is designed to test the Government&#039;s thinking behind the provision. If there is an excellent training provider that for one reason or another has a precarious financial position, would Clause 76(6) preclude the Training and Development Agency for Schools from sensible measures that might avoid the closure of that provider? For example, it seems to rule out any notion of match-funding and so on. That seems a fairly rigid approach. However, I expect again that there may be a simple reason for it, of propriety or some such <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_758"></a>

reason which I have missed. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten me on the reasoning behind the two provisions and why they are necessary. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_236"></a>
<a name="50118-33_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   I am extremely pleased to be able to do that. I hope that I can give the noble Baroness the examples which she requested of how the provisions will operate. She is right that the reasoning is a mixture of propriety, financial accountability, transparency and good financial management. If we removed these provisions from the Bill it would certainly have a number of unwelcome effects, notably on individual trainees and serving members of the school workforce undertaking continuing professional development&#151;CPD&#151;activities.
</p>

<a name="50118-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_634"></a>Clause 76(4) gives the TDA power to control or prohibit the levying of fees or charges by training providers by condition of grant. It is a necessary power. It means, for example, that a body providing a CPD activity for a particular school or individual teacher may be prevented from charging the person or the school involved. That power might be invoked, for example, where the level of the grant that the training provider received from the TDA was already set at a level calculated to cover all the provider&#039;s costs. So there would be no question of getting something extra. Funding for many existing TTA schemes, including subject knowledge enhancement courses and refresher courses for returners to teaching, is already calculated in that way.
</p>

<a name="50118-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_635"></a>Amendment No. 138 would remove Clause 76(5) which provides an important adjunct to this basic fee-control power. Noble Lords are right that the provision is designed to operate where one training provider acts as a banker in respect of TDA grants which are eventually destined for two or more training providers. In such cases the clause gives power to the TDA to control or prohibit the charging of fees by the other training providers as well as by the banker.
</p>

<a name="50118-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_636"></a>I shall give an example. Since 2002, the Graduate Teacher Programme has been administered through a network of training providers called designated recommending bodies. The designated recommending bodies place trainees in the schools where they will actually be trained and will oversee the quality of their training. They are currently funded for this task by grants of up to &#163;4,500 per trainee, which they can divide by agreement with the individual schools&#151;those that relate to training, depending on what costs fall to whom.

</p>

<a name="50118-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_637"></a>A designated recommending body could be prohibited under subsection (4) from levying any charge on either of the schools on whose behalf it acts, or the trainees that it places in them. However, it is also important that the prohibition should bite the schools themselves and that they should not be allowed to charge any fee to individual trainees whom they employ as unqualified teachers, subject to terms set out in the school teachers&#039; pay and conditions document.
</p>

<a name="50118-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_638"></a>One effect of subsection (5) prevents them doing that. There have been a few cases where a school has paid a trainee the unqualified teacher&#039;s salary, to which he is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_759"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 759</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

legally entitled, only to attempt to claw it back through a fee of this kind. We believe that that is wrong. Other instances where similar considerations could arise will occur to your Lordships, particularly when continuous professional development for teachers is provided on school premises.
</p>

<a name="50118-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_639"></a>The example given by the noble Baroness was the repayment of fees by a subcontractor in the event of an accident. We will have to look into that, because I do not know whether it is analogous to this matter. I am talking about some specific instances.

</p>

<a name="50118-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_640"></a>It is vital that the TTA should retain an unambiguous power to prevent this sort of abuse of individuals, alongside the power to regulate fee charging in general. I have been talking about one threat, so I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<a name="50118-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_641"></a>Amendment No. 139 seeks to delete Clause 76(6). The subsection re-enacts some changes relating to fee controls under Section 5(3) of the Education Act 1994. Those changes take account of the new powers to control fee charging, for which subsections (4) and (5) of Clause 76 provide. For the past decade, Section 5 of the 1994 Act has prohibited the TTA from attaching terms and conditions with regard to moneys received elsewhere than from the agency. This has meant that the TTA has not been able to stipulate that to qualify for TTA funding&#151;perhaps for a refresher course for returners to teaching&#151;a university must first agree also to spend some of its HEFCE grant on that course.

</p>

<a name="50118-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_642"></a>I should make it clear that the TTA has never sought to act in that way in the past and I can think of no circumstances in which it would wish to do so in the future. Addressing the point made by the noble Baroness, I should also make it clear that this provision is not designed to prevent providers in receipt of TTA grants operating matched fund arrangements.
</p>

<a name="50118-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_643"></a>The conditions of accountability that are reflected in these arrangements are important. I hope that I have been able to reassure the noble Baroness. It will probably repay us to read it in <i>Hansard</i>, because there is a mass of detail, clause and counter-clause. If there are matters which I have not answered I shall write to the noble Baroness.

</p>

<a name="50118-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_649"></a>In particular, we would be interested to learn under what terms any grants will be made available. Will the grant be made by the Secretary of State on an annual basis? Furthermore, what mechanisms are there to ensure that the agency provides value for money and is meeting its prescribed duties, as set out under Part 3? There appears to be no way for Parliament to scrutinise the work of the agency. That is an omission about which we on these Benches are rightly concerned and on which we would again welcome assurances from the Minister. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_240"></a>
<a name="50118-33_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   The changes proposed by the noble Lord would certainly remove the power of the Secretary of State to set terms and conditions in relation to the grant that should be paid to the agency. I am afraid that that may well leave my right honourable friend unable to give the agency any guidance in the use of taxpayers&#039; money that it received. The agency will receive, for example, &#163;0.75   billion for the next financial year. That money will be devoted to particular activities including the agency&#039;s staffing and administrative costs.
</p>

<a name="50118-33_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_650"></a>To answer the noble Lord&#039;s question about inference, the amendment would mean that the Secretary of State could not indicate what proportion should be devoted to particular activities. At the moment she is able to indicate how the broad definitions of spending can be delineated. To remove that power would be inconsistent with the principles of democratic accountability and public sector efficiency.

</p>

<a name="50118-33_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_651"></a>I should add that the ability to set conditions of grant in no way implies any unreasonable power or purpose to restrict the agency&#039;s ability to manage its own affairs. Indeed, the agency&#039;s grant letter for the next financial year expressly provides that the agency may make its own decisions about how to distribute the funding in support of the objectives set out in the letter and the TTA&#039;s corporate plan goes on to offer an indicative breakdown of resources by policy areas as guidance. It might be helpful if I provided Members of the Committee with copies of the full grant letter which will answer, in detail, the questions put by noble Lords.

</p>

<a name="50118-33_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_652"></a>On value for money, earlier we talked about parliamentary scrutiny of TTA funding. The chief executive is the accounting officer. However, I ask noble Lords to reflect on the fact that this amendment would do serious damage to the TTA&#039;s ability to function effectively as a funding agency, responsible for a significant amount of taxpayers&#039; money each year. It would also disrupt the chain of accountability that connects the agency, the Secretary of State and Parliament, which is not what the noble Lord intended. With a copy of the grant letter in front of them, noble Lords will have a very clear idea of the relationship with the Secretary of State, the criteria and the determination of the way that the money will be provided and funded.

<p><a name="stpa_658"></a>This is a probing amendment. We are asking the Minister to explain more about the respective roles of the TTA and the GTC in relation to England and Wales. According to paragraph 164 of the Explanatory Notes to the Bill:

<p><a name="stpa_660"></a>This is a probing amendment which seeks a guarantee that this provision does not overlap with the functions of the GTCs. The Teacher Training Agency is seen by the GTC for England as a key stakeholder. Contact and joint working take place at a number of levels between chief executives and senior staff from the policy, teaching qualifications, registration and professional standards teams. The TTA collaboration is central to the effectiveness of the GTCs&#039; procedures for awarding qualified teacher status. We assume that this collaboration will continue under the new arrangements.
</p>

<a name="50118-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_661"></a>In Wales the TTA currently does not have as important a role in relation to teacher training and professional development.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_91"></a>&quot;However, the Agency must not do anything in Wales (except where the functions have been given to them by regulations made under the Education Act 2002) unless they have been requested to do so by the Assembly and the Agency have given notice that they have agreed to such a request&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_665"></a>In its <i>Corporate Plan 2004&#150;2007</i>, the GTC sets out an argument for the need for further consideration of the GTC&#039;s remit in relation to the regulations of the wider school workforce. It says,

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_94"></a>&quot;serious consideration must be given to assuring the quality and competence of the whole of the children&#039;s workforce.

We will initiate and contribute actively to a debate about registration and regulation&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="st_244"></a>
<a name="50118-34_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Hanningfield: </b>   Amendment No. 139C is grouped with this amendment. Clause 80 provides the agency with a new broad power to do anything it thinks fit in furtherance of its objectives. The Explanatory Notes tell us that this will allow the agency to undertake functions such as setting standards for the award of qualifications and the administration of schemes. Subsection (2), which Amendment No. 139C would leave out, provides that the agency will be able to provide information, advice and other services to persons outside England and Wales.
</p>

<a name="50118-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_667"></a>There are a number of pertinent questions that relate to subsection(2). But before I mention our specific concerns, can the Minister explain how he envisages such a scheme would work in practice?
</p>

<a name="50118-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_668"></a>If my interpretation of the Bill is correct, this will allow the agency to carry out any of its functions outside the country including attracting, training and providing financial support to teaching recruits. Presumably, this is intended to allow the agency to recruit and attract teachers from overseas in order to fill gaps in the existing workforce.
</p>

<a name="50118-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_669"></a>If my reading of the Bill is correct perhaps the Minister could comment on whether such an approach is official government policy and it is felt that such a power had to be included on the face of the Bill. Furthermore, I believe that such a step raises a number of serious questions, not least how the agency will carry out such a duty in practice. Will the agency, for example, be able actively to seek to recruit new teachers in Poland with national advertisements in the press or media there? Will we recruit school caretakers in other parts of the world?

</p>

<a name="50118-34_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_670"></a>Why is it necessary to adopt such an approach? In how many and in what particular subject areas is there a shortage of teachers? Is the existing teacher recruitment campaign failing to attract the necessary recruits? Will such a power be confined to the recruitment of teachers or is it intended to cover all members of the school workforce, as I have mentioned before? What percentage of the agency&#039;s time and its financial resources will be spent in activities outside England? Will such activities be confined to other countries in the European Union, or is it likely to be global in its application? Furthermore, what impact will the agency have on the resident teaching workforce in the country in which it operates?
</p>

<a name="50118-34_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_671"></a>As I have tried to highlight, such an approach raises practical concerns, as well as wider concerns about whether such an approach should be welcomed and whether it is justifiable in the first place.

<a name="50118-34_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Filkin: </b>   I shall start with the question from the   noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, about whether collaboration will continue between the TDA and the General Teaching Council. The answer is that it will and must continue. The Government have leverage to ensure that it collaborates in the future because the grant letter, which my noble friend promised will be circulated, enjoins collaboration with all other TTA stakeholders.
</p>

<a name="50118-34_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_672"></a>This is clearly a probing amendment. It would prevent the agency providing information and advice outside England and Wales, or exercising any function carried out by the GTC. It is not the Government&#039;s intention that the TDA should, at some stage, assume the responsibility of the GTC. I hope that the GTC is clear on that. The only area in which there is significant overlap between the roles of the TDA and the GTCE in England is in offering advice to the Secretary of State on matters relating to teachers, including their recruitment, training, career development and performance management. Both organisations have those areas of interest. The Secretary of State wants advice from both of them. The nature of their advice is likely to be different, so there is no duplication. It will be advice in similar areas from different experiences and perspectives.
</p>

<a name="50118-34_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_673"></a>In Wales, the TDA may exercise no functions at all, except at the request of the National Assembly. In general terms, the TDA&#039;s main functions, whether exercised in England, Wales or both, will be those of a funding agency. The GTCs in England and Wales are not principally funding bodies, but are primarily advisory and representative bodies, along the same lines as the General Medical Council. At the same time, the GTCE exercises key functions in England. It has the power to award QTS, to impose disciplinary sanctions on teachers and to maintain a register of qualified teachers. In exercising those functions from their different perspectives, each organisation has a distinct and valuable role. The Government see no overlap or conflict.

</p>

<a name="50118-34_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_674"></a>I can best deal with the issue of providing advice, information and other services to anyone outside England and Wales by drawing attention to the department&#039;s international strategy, which was discussed in a recent Question. Essentially, an element of the strategy is to benchmark ourselves against best practice elsewhere internationally, in the same way as we talk about schools benchmarking themselves, to see whether we should be raising our ambition or whether we can learn from others to do things better. The second element of it is helping other countries to achieve their goals. A particular focus of that would be Africa, where a body such as the TDA, at a low cost to itself, has enormous potential to offer to some African countries to help them to understand effective strategies for teaching and workforce development in schools. As a society, we would not want to handicap it in doing so.
</p>

<a name="50118-34_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_675"></a>I do not think that the thrust of the amendment is about the substantial recruitment of large elements of the school workforce from abroad. However, I may have to write to the noble Lord because I am getting blank stares from the Box on this one, so I do not know whether the answer is &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. I think that the answer must be &quot;No&quot;, but I shall write to the noble Lord.
</p>

<a name="50118-34_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_676"></a>I hope that my remarks have been helpful. There are one or two other points that I should touch on. Clause   73 opens a potential role for the TDA to do more in Wales, but it does not restrict it and, as now, the TDA cannot do anything unless the Welsh Assembly requests it. I hope that that has been helpful and that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_95"></a>Page 45, line 27, at end insert &quot;and professional development&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_251"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment to raise funding issues relating to continuous professional development provision in Wales. Since April 2004, the General Teaching Council for Wales has administered a CPD funding programme that seeks to provide teachers in Wales with an opportunity to receive funding to meet their individual professional development needs. The funding programme is intended to give teachers the opportunity to identify their own professional development needs and to control the funding of those activities.
</p>

<a name="50118-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_684"></a>The Welsh Assembly Government have so far made &#163;1.35 million available to support the programme. That provision includes funding for professional development bursaries, teacher research scholarships and teacher sabbaticals. Teachers in Wales value the role of the GTC in relation to awarding CPD grants and would be very concerned if the extended remit for the TTA or the provisions relating to HEFCW undermined the existing teacher CPD. We would be very grateful for some reassurances on that in order to allay teachers&#039; fears if this went in a direction which they felt was undesirable. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_252"></a>
<a name="50118-35_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Andrews: </b>   Because of the noble Lord&#039;s experience in this field, I am very grateful to him for contributing to this debate, and I hope that I can give him the assurance that he seeks.
</p>

<a name="50118-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_685"></a>I begin by explaining what the amendment would do and why we have a problem with it. Essentially, it would add another layer of administration within the existing system for funding teachers&#039; professional development. Clause 82 re-enacts an existing provision from the Education Act 1994 which enables HEFCW to fund the higher education institutions that provide initial teacher training in Wales. It is an established mechanism and it works very well.
</p>

<a name="50118-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_686"></a>As the noble Lord knows, continuing professional development for teachers is funded through a number of mechanisms in Wales. They include the General Teaching Council for Wales administering funds to meet the individual development needs of teachers, and those are very much the teachers&#039; own needs. The LEAs provide training and development opportunities for whole schools and school staff. They also include <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_766"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 766</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the schools&#039; own budgets, which are used to fund teachers&#039; development, supporting them in school and in their aspirations, and the Welsh Assembly Government&#039;s Better Schools Fund, which can also be used for development in new initiatives and priority areas. I assure the noble Lord that nothing in the Bill will affect the amount given for individually focused CPD from the General Teaching Council. I think that that was the essential question he was asking.
</p>

<a name="50118-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_687"></a>Essentially, these mechanisms enable the training to be provided by the most appropriate and most flexible route, whether it is development by collaboration through the LEAs or whether it is provided by an HE or FE institution.
</p>

<a name="50118-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_688"></a>HEFCW currently funds accredited HE institutions to provide courses of initial teacher training. Those enable trainees to reach the standard of qualified teacher status, which is required to start a career in teaching. It is a very specific remit. It is the remit undertaken by the TTA in England.
</p>

<a name="50118-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_689"></a>The systems in Wales are quite different. They are from full ITT to the more targeted and flexible approach which is needed to fund and arrange professional development opportunities for serving teachers, which is what we have. One could argue that we have the best of both worlds. Teachers know where to go: there is no confusion, there are no complaints about the system, and we do not want to change that.
</p>

<a name="50118-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_690"></a>So to put an additional function on HEFCW would essentially require new and different mechanisms to be established. It could create a degree of confusion; it would certainly create a degree of duplication and we do not believe that it would be appropriate. With the assurances that I have given I hope that the noble Lord will feel that he can withdraw his amendment.

<p><a name="st_255"></a>
<a name="50118-35_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Rowlands: </b>   I intervene briefly because I was puzzled by the nature of this amendment. The powers that were sought and conferred upon the then Secretary of State in 1994 are simply being re-enacted. Originally a Conservative administration sought such powers and now they have been transferred&#151;as I understand it&#151;under the transfer of powers order laid under the Government of Wales Act on to the Assembly after devolution. This is purely a re-enactment of those original powers.
</p>

<a name="50118-35_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_702"></a>While I am happy to listen to the questions of the noble Baroness, I do not think that she or any of us would want to deny the Assembly the powers that a succession of Secretaries of State have had since 1994. Like the noble Baroness, I would be grateful if the Minister could explain how these powers have been used to date. But, more importantly, why should they be denied to a national assembly? These orders would be scrutinised in detail there, in a way that this House and the other House do not scrutinise, under the provisions that have been laid down for dealing with subordinate legislation. I strongly urge that we maintain these powers for the Assembly&#151;the same powers once belonged to a Secretary of State.

<a name="column_768"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column 768</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

such a critical role in the development of these agencies over the years. So I am very grateful to my noble friend for his contribution.

</p>

<a name="50118-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_703"></a>Perhaps I may just answer the basic question: what does the clause do in relation to HEFCW&#039;s functions under the Bill? Essentially, the clause enables the Assembly to make an order adding to HEFCW&#039;s functions. The Assembly can add to HEFCW&#039;s functions only following such consultation as it considers appropriate. On the question of consultation, I should say that if it were necessary to have consultation the Assembly would have to consult, for example, the unions, the LEAs and the educational bodies. It would publish consultation documents and there would usually be an eight to 12-week period for consultation.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_704"></a>To answer the question of the noble Baroness on parliamentary scrutiny, it is very much the Assembly rather than Parliament that would scrutinise HEFCW in all its functions. So the Assembly can add to such functions only following such consultations as it considers appropriate, and it can only add a function which is related to a function of the Assembly under any enactment and if it relates to the functions of an institution that HEFCW can fund under this part of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_705"></a>Those are obviously very important caveats. They ensure that under the clause the Assembly can ask HEFCW to carry out additional functions only for the purposes of the Assembly&#039;s own functions which are linked to an institution offering teacher training. So it is not a power which will give <i>carte blanche</i> to extend the powers of HEFCW.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_706"></a>The provisions ensure that the funding council can discharge its functions in relation to the Bill effectively. It ensures that if the Assembly, following appropriate consultation, determines that the delivery of teacher training in Wales can be enhanced by giving HEFCW additional functions it is able to do so.

</p>

<a name="50118-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_707"></a>The clause places a parallel duty on HEFCW to carry out such ancillary functions as the Assembly may direct under this part. As my noble friend said, it is very much a re-enactment of provisions in the Education Act 1984 in its application to Wales. It is not a power which the Assembly envisages using frequently, but it is an important provision. It might, for example, be used in connection with changes to ITT provision, although HEFCW does not at present fund&#151;and we have just had this debate&#151;employment-based courses or school-centred ITT providers.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_708"></a>The Welsh Assembly has announced a review of ITT provision in Wales. The review&#039;s terms of reference include looking at the availability and potential for more flexible or different types of ITT provision, including school-centred ITT and employment-based training.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_709"></a>So, although HEFCW has powers to provide funding for these sorts of courses, there is a range of ancillary functions in this area, such as providing advice or information to prospective trainees. Provision therefore needs to be made in HEFCW&#039;s functions to cover a possible future role.

<p><a name="stpa_710"></a>Noble Lords asked me whether the powers had been used since the Assembly&#039;s inception. The answer is, no. But, as I have just explained, the Assembly is currently working on a review of ITT provision. If it were to decide to use HEFCW to fund employment-based training in the way I have described, it will be able to do so. The Assembly at the same time may well wish to make an order to enable HEFCW to undertake a number of administrative functions&#151;for example, the provision of information and advice.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_711"></a>This is a common feature of legislation relating to educational bodies in Wales. For example, the Assembly has the power to confer additional functions on the General Teaching Council for Wales, the National Council for Education and Training for Wales and so on.

<p><a name="st_5"></a>The noble Lord said: The Inquiries Bill, in our submission, manifests two unacceptable changes in the balance of constitutional power. The first change is a shift of power away from Parliament to the Executive, and the second a shift of power away from chairmen of committees of inquiry to the Minister who sets them up.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a>The first group of amendments deals with the first of those two shifts in constitutional power; that is the shift away from Parliament to the Executive. As I observed in the Second Reading debate on the Floor of the House, this shift is consistent with a number of others engineered by the Government over the past seven years.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a>The amendments in this first group are principally driven by Amendments Nos. 1 and 2. The key to the intention that lies behind the amendments is to, in a slightly modified form, re-insert the substance of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a>The 1921 Act could come into effect only as a consequence of a resolution of both Houses of Parliament. Why do we regard this as being a crucial ingredient in the new Bill? The system set up in the new Inquiries Bill may work very well for investigating issues that do not relate to the responsibilities either of Ministers in their personal capacity, or of Ministers as heads of a department and therefore responsible for actions of their civil servants. However, the Bill does <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC192"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC192</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

not help when it is a Minister himself, or a civil servant in a Minister&#039;s department, who is alleged to have committed some form of wrongful act, or to have fallen below the constitutional standards that we expect of Ministers and civil servants. It is plainly ludicrous, if your Lordships reflect on it for no more than a few seconds, that a Minister should investigate his own conduct or that of any other Minister who is in the Government of the day.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a>Therefore, Parliament is the proper forum to initiate an inquiry into ministerial misdemeanours. There are two ways in which this can be done. One is through the mechanism of the 1921 Act; and that Act still has relevance to those situations where an inquiry requires a full-scale judicial investigation, with the judge having all the powers that he would have were he sitting in the High Court, both in relation to witnesses and legal representation.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a>There is a second reason why we are raising the relationship between Parliament and Ministers in this first group of amendments. As a last resort, constitutionally it is to Parliament that Ministers are accountable. Until the Marconi inquiry just before the First World War, the standard way in which a Minister or his department was investigated was by means of a parliamentary Select Committee. As Members of the Committee are aware, this process became discredited after Marconi when the committee divided on strict party lines, and led, I think, directly to the passage of the 1921 Act.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a>However, there is no reason why your Lordships could not devise a new scheme of parliamentary investigations in the form either of a reconstituted Select Committee or some other named committee which would put Parliament back in the driving seat without at the same time incurring the disadvantages of party divisions that were so manifest in the committees that met just before the First World War. The most obvious way of doing this would be to use your Lordships&#039; House as the forum for such a committee investigation. The reason why I say that is because your Lordships&#039; House has the great advantage, which another place does not, of non-party affiliated Cross-Benchers. Why should not future investigations be based in your Lordships&#039; House with a minimum of three and a maximum of five noble Lords sitting as committee members, the majority of whom would come from the Cross Benches? That seems to be an eminently suitable way to employ the immense talents of Cross-Bench Members of your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a>I readily admit that this aspect of investigation could not be dealt with under the Bill. However, there is absolutely no reason why your Lordships&#039; House should not, in another forum, look carefully at your Lordships&#039; current Standing Orders to see whether or not they are suitable to support such an investigatory committee system.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a>I am&#151;perhaps I am alone in that&#151;immensely impressed by the way the United States Senate conducts investigations. There are three ingredients that have made those inquiries particularly effective: <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC193"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC193</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

first, the ability to hear evidence on oath; secondly, the capacity to require the person they want to investigate to be there; and, thirdly, the use of standing counsel to drive the work of the committee forward. I regard those three ingredients as essential to the success of any future investigatory committee set up in your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a>As far as hearing evidence on oath is concerned, that is a matter which should provide no barrier to my future ambitions, anyway, for such investigatory inquiries. It is clear, from glancing at <i>Erskine May</i>, that either House can, if it wishes, make an order allowing Select Committees, or other committees, to hear witnesses on oath. The most recent footnote in the current edition of <i>Erskine May</i> refers to an inquiry by the Commons Trade and Industry Committee in the Session of 1987 to 1988. The power was also used twice in the 1970s.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a>In your Lordships&#039; House, administering an oath to a witness before a Select Committee has not occurred since the 1930s; but there is no reason for your Lordships to think that it could not be resuscitated in that form when an investigatory committee was set up. Habitually in the conduct of opposed Private Bills, which do not pass so frequently through your Lordships&#039; House as they used to, the proceedings are regarded as quasi judicial in character and witnesses are required to take an oath before giving evidence.

</p>

<a name="50118-36_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a>The power of another place to administer oaths was codified in the Parliamentary Witnesses Oaths Act 1871, which provides that another place can administer an oath to witnesses. A similar power for committees of   your Lordships&#039; House was codified in the Parliamentary Witnesses Act 1858. The Perjury Act 1911 applies to evidence given under both sets of legislation. In short, there should be no difficulty about hearing evidence on oath.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a>Although there is no statutory power or basis for either House to request papers in connection with committee inquiries, I understand that the power to send for persons is an inherent power of both Houses. This is an area that is less clear cut than a question of oaths. There have been occasions in recent years when the committees of both another place and your Lordships&#039; House have requested the presence of senior Cabinet Ministers to appear in front of them. On a few of those occasions&#151;not many&#151;the request has not been granted and no further action has been taken by either House in the face of that refusal. I have no ready answer to how we would handle the situation; but it seems appropriate, in the case of your Lordships&#039; House, to put it to the Government that, given the well entrenched parliamentary convention of ministerial accountability, it would be shocking for a Minister&#151;whatever his or her rank in the Government or the Cabinet&#151;to refuse to appear in front of a committee investigating an alleged demeanour, either by that Minister or another ministerial colleague.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a>I hope that your Lordships&#039; House will take this aspect of the spirit that lies behind this first line of amendments very seriously; although I underline that <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC194"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC194</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

there is nothing that Committee Members can do directly in the Bill to resuscitate the practice of parliamentary Select Committees.
</p>

<a name="50118-36_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a>In recent years, when Ministers are alleged to have committed some misdemeanour or to have been negligent in some area of their work, it has often been the practice of Prime Ministers not to invoke the 1921 legislation but, under the cover of the royal power of prerogative, to set up a bespoke committee to suit the particular requirements and pressures of the time. I referred to that in the Second Reading debate and I do not propose to go into it in detail again now. Suffice it to say that transparency in government requires all the investigating procedures that we have at our disposal as a political society to be set out clearly in either the Standing Orders of Parliament or in statute. The time has come to do that. To that extent, I applaud what the Government say they intend to do. However, the Government have fallen down because they have failed to deal with what I regard as constitutionally easily the most important investigations that we have to undertake. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="50118-37_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   The group includes two amendments&#151;Amendments Nos. 3 and 65&#151;to which my noble friend Lord Smith of Clifton and I have put our names. It also contains an amendment&#151;Amendment No. 66&#151;in our names.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a>We put our names to the amendments because there is a case to be made for keeping the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act in existence not as the sole method of instituting an inquiry, but as a reserve for inquiries of particular significance&#151;they need not be confined to allegations of misconduct by a government department or a Minister&#151;where it is thought that it would strengthen the inquiry to have the benefit of parliamentary approval to its establishment. There is no procedure under the Bill for parliamentary approval. We do not think that it ought to be the only method. Apart from anything else, the Bill authorises a large number of inquiries that would until now have been authorised by various individual statutes, none of which apart from the 1921 Act require parliamentary approval.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a>I note with interest what the noble Lord, Lord   Kingsland, said about Select Committees. He made an interesting suggestion, but I have some reservations about it. In particular, the idea that a Select Committee of your Lordships&#039; House might investigate misconduct of Ministers who are Members of the House of Commons would lead to an explosive confrontation with the House of Commons, and I have no wish to trigger that particular explosion.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a>Up till now, the use of Select Committees for carrying out what I might call forensic investigations has shown itself to be unsatisfactory. For example, the investigation by the Select Committee on Standards and Privileges into the Keith Vaz case particularly showed that its members were a wholly unsuitable group of people to carry out a prolonged cross-examination of a witness. Therefore, the noble Lord is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC195"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC195</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

quite right to say that such a scheme could work only if there were standing counsel to the Select Committee who would conduct all necessary cross-examinations. He is right to refer to the importance and effectiveness of the American congressional and senatorial committees, which employ standing counsel.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a>It is an interesting idea, so it is with some regret that I do not see any great likelihood of our proceeding down that route. I mentioned at Second Reading that there certainly is a role for what was suggested by the Committee on Standards in Public Life; namely, that there should be a small panel of people of political impartiality and highly regarded integrity, one of whom could be available to be called on by the Prime Minister if a case arose, such as the investigation into Mr Blunkett, or the investigation of the conduct or alleged misconduct of a government Minister.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>Having said that, therefore, the main point on which we support this group of amendments is that there is a good case for keeping the 1921 Act in reserve for cases where for special reasons it is desirable to have parliamentary endorsement of the setting up of a particular inquiry.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="50118-37_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   The noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Goodhart, raised most important matters very appropriate to the beginning of the Committee stage of our Bill. They raise the fundamentals as to what extent, if any, Parliament, or one House of Parliament, should conduct or be involved with inquiries of the sort that are otherwise intended to be the concern of the new-style inquiry of this Bill.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, fairly referred to the origins of the 1921 Act and the discredit into which House of Commons inquiries have got, particularly because of the likelihood that inquiries involving Ministers who, inevitably, came from one party rather than another would divide probably on party lines.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has made the interesting point that whereas&#151;nowadays at any rate, with a few exceptions&#151;almost every Member is a member of one party or another, occasionally there is   a Martin Bell. In this House, there are lots of Martin Bells, and thank goodness for that: one of them on my immediate right has conducted an inquiry. The appropriateness of Cross-Benchers and their certain freedom from party obligations is, of course, well known.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>However, although I thought that was&#151;I suppose I mean this slightly in a pejorative sense&#151;a clever idea from the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, I do not really regard it as very helpful, if only partly for the reasons put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. In this day and age, the great majority of Ministers and Cabinet Ministers are Members of the House of Commons. The accountability of all Ministers is more to the House of Commons than to the House of Lords. Without the House of Commons, accountability would mean far less than it does in terms of policy and the integrity of Ministers, and so on. It would not be worn in this day and age, as it were&#151;let alone in the 1920s&#151;for the House of Lords to be the regular body that conducted inquiries, albeit that the inquiry is <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC196"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC196</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

being done by non-party Members in the House of Lords. I do not think that that would be appropriate at all.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>Then one comes to the point about Parliament&#151;either or both Houses&#151;being involved in some way at least in approving the setting up of an inquiry, which, after all, was a key feature of the 1921 Act. I am not sure that that requirement of the 1921 Act has much usefulness in this day. I know that there is some difference between the two parties opposite on that matter, but there is some degree of enthusiasm for the idea that the 1921 Act should be kept for some inquiries of great significance or something of the sort.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a>Let us examine what difference that would make compared with the sort of inquiry envisaged and proposed by this legislation. In both cases, Ministers will initiate and have, under the 1921 Act, initiated the notion that there should be a tribunal of inquiry. As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said very fairly at the beginning, there is no question, either under the 1921 Act or this Bill, of Ministers investigating themselves. The idea under this Bill, as with the 1921 Act, is that the inquiry will be conducted by a judge or other appropriate independent person, possibly with other panel members who comprise part of the inquiry team. There will no doubt be, as there has been so frequently with actual tribunals of inquiry under the 1921 Act, a counsel representing the inquiry who will be the main individual asking the questions and probing matters on behalf of the inquiry to get at the truth, which is what the inquiry is all about. Frankly, I do not see any particular advantage, in terms of either constitutional propriety or practicality, whether the inquiry is set up with the approval of both Houses of Parliament or by the Minister, who, because of the normal rules of accountability, is accountable to Parliament anyway for what he does in setting up the inquiry.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a>Without wanting to overstretch the point, I am not sure that I have heard as yet any real case for there being a continuation of, or reprieve for, the 1921 Act, instead of letting it go the way of history and replacing it with the processes proposed by this Bill, which we may amend or improve but which in any case will cover independent impartial inquiries when matters of public concern suggest that something should be looked into.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="50118-37_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Howe of Aberavon: </b>   I make one preliminary comment on a point suggested by the noble Lord, Lord   Goodhart. Of course, I have seen the advocacy for establishing a panel of potential chairman, but I do not have much enthusiasm for that suggestion. It would mean a group of people waiting in the wings for an indefinite period. One must very often make a specific choice of a chairman attuned to the need of the particular inquiry. It would be a rather unnecessary, though benevolent, idea.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a>On the more substantial topic of the debate, the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, closed by saying that he   could see no justification for a &quot;reprieve&quot; of the 1921 Act. A reprieve is normally something available to a miscreant who has done something wrong and who is going to be allowed, justly, to get away with a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC197"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC197</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

suspended sentence. I have heard nothing at all to suggest why the Act should be repealed. That is the first proposition in the Bill, and it is for the Government to justify their conclusion.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a>I agree with the remarks of my noble and learned friend and my noble friend Lord Kingsland, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, about the inadequacy of House of Commons inquiries of the kind that my noble friend would like to see happening. That inadequacy is through no fault of the Commons; it may not be an incorrigible shortcoming, and it may be possible to work out a way in which to do it. But at the moment the Commons committee that attempts a disciplinary inquiry suffers from the faults that tend to bedevil such inquiries.

</p>

<a name="50118-37_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The fact is that the questioning in Commons committees is done by a <i>gal&#232;re</i> of would-be grandstanders and not by a counsel sustaining a cross-examination, in which very often the most important question that you can put is, &quot;Now would you be kind enough to answer the question I put originally?&quot;. That never happens in a Select Committee, because someone else is always waiting to break in with some different question before you can reach that point.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>There was a period, which happened just within my experience, when Commons committees, certainly the Privileges Committee, which I had the privilege of chairing on a couple of occasions in my time as Leader of the Commons, investigated the conduct of parliamentarians. In those days that was conducted with the Attorney-General acting as the counsel to the committee, in the happy far-off days when there were enough counsel in the House of Commons to allow the Attorney-General to be appointed in that House rather than in our own. So in those days, when conventions were more clearly established, and the balance was better than it is today, that could be done. But my noble friend would have to work quite hard to resurrect that atmosphere along the lines that he would hope for.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>I believe that there is still a need for the 1921 Act, for two reasons. This is why the burden of proof is on the Government as to why we should contemplate abolishing it. The first reason is that, as I understand it, the appointment of a 1921 Act tribunal does not require the initiative of a Minister of the Crown, but could be established on the initiative of a Back-Bencher of any party. I may be wrong about that; one may need Crown consent or such form that I have half-forgotten. Certainly, there are circumstances in which Parliament might well wish to establish an inquiry without much enthusiasm on the part of the Government. For this Government now to deprive Parliament of whatever initiative it has under the 1921 Act without good cause seems a gratuitous and unjustifiable step.
<a name="time_1"></a>
<a name="50118-37_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50118-37_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>The other reason adds to the weight of the first. Let us look at the occasions on which a 1921 Act inquiry has been established. It is not easy to detect a very logical line <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC198"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC198</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

of distinction between them and the rest in every case, but I can remember two that were clearly established under the 1921 Act. One was the Londonderry Bloody Sunday inquiry. The tragedy happened on 28 January, and Parliament acted on 1 February to establish the commission. It was Parliament acting with a sense of urgency, representing the national shock to that catastrophe at parliamentary level.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>The other one that I have in mind is the Aberfan inquiry. The origin was different, of course, but the events were comparably catastrophic and tragic. That too was appointed under the 1921 Act, symbolising the attention that Parliament paid to those two inquiries at times of national mourning, in effect. When everyone was rallying round the local community to try to relieve the suffering following the disaster, the engagement of Parliament was important and showed that it cared about what was going on.
</p>

<a name="50118-37_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>I can see no justification for removing the power whatever. I know that the Minister has a remarkably tidy mind. It ought to stop short of this.

<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="50118-38_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that for a Minister to have total discretion on whether an inquiry should be set up to inquire into his own misconduct or that of his department, or the misconduct of a colleague or his department, is, frankly, ludicrous. On the other hand, I am afraid that I am so far unconvinced that either remedy&#151;that suggested in his amendment or the alternative that formed the major part of his speech&#151;solved the problem.
</p>

<a name="50118-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a>For there to be an inquiry under the 1921 Act, there has to be a vote of both Houses. There will not be a vote in the other place unless the Government agree. If they disagree, the inquiry will not be set up. In every case when an inquiry is set up into ministerial default, it is set up because there is a sufficient disquiet in the other place, as well as here and in the country generally, that the Minister or the Government feel that it would be rash of them or untenable for them to decline to set it up. If that is the position, an inquiry will be set up under the Bill as much as it would be under the 1921 Act. However, if the Government take the resolute view that the matter is not one for an inquiry, there will be neither an inquiry under the Bill, nor an inquiry if the 1921 Act were in place.
</p>

<a name="50118-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a>A possible remedy occurred to me during the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. He referred to the Committee on Standards in Public Life. If a strong convention could be established that the Government were bound to set up an inquiry if that committee said that something seemed very worrying and to merit inquiry, there genuinely would be an independent outside body that could trigger an inquiry, although technically it did not have the power to set it up.
</p>

convey to his right honourable friend, his Leader, who seems to be somewhat less impressed by them, being wrong-minded on this issue&#151;I do not believe that it is   practical to suggest that even the independent Members of this House could be allowed by the Commons to investigate the misdemeanours of Members of another place to summon before them those Members to demand that they answer questions on oath and to be censured by Members of this House on a matter where, in the view of the House of Commons or of the Government, it was not desirable to have an inquiry.
</p>

<a name="50118-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a>I hope that before the next stage of the Bill, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, will be able to find a remedy for the point he made, but I doubt that he has yet done so.

<a name="50118-38_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Laming: </b>   I rise with some diffidence as I am surrounded by distinguished lawyers in front and behind. Not being a lawyer, that is slightly inhibiting, not least because I greatly admire what lawyers bring to inquiries. Long may it continue.
</p>

<a name="50118-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a>I welcome the Inquiries Bill in general. I hope that if it is passed it will replace the 1921 Act. I see no reason why a new Act of Parliament should not be adequate to meet today&#039;s needs and those of the future. The 1921 Act has been on the statute book a long time. During that period there has been a large number of inquiries into a wide variety of subjects. It is not unreasonable to assume that lessons have been learnt from them which can be brought to bear on current legislation.
</p>

<a name="50118-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a>I hesitate to make the next point because I may be entirely wrong. If my memory serves me right, under the 1921 Act, a judge must chair an inquiry. If that is right, I have real concerns. But apparently that is not the case, so I shall not make the point!

</p>

<a name="50118-38_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that the Bill places too great an emphasis on the Executive at the   expense of Parliament and gives too much power to the Minister as opposed to the chair of an inquiry. I am certain that anyone who takes on the chairmanship of an inquiry ought to be seen to have the necessary authority to command the confidence of the general public. Their authority ought to be reinforced by their independence. Some of the amendments will go a long way to ensuring that a better balance will be struck between the Executive and Parliament and between the Minister and the chair of a committee.
</p>

<a name="50118-38_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>However, Ministers are accountable to Parliament and the vast majority of inquiries will be on matters in which there is a ministerial interest. I can think of no inquiry in which there is not a ministerial interest of one kind or another. And of course all inquiries operate under legislation passed by Parliament, and it is right that they should be established by Parliament and report fully to Parliament.
</p>

<a name="50118-38_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>I respect the work of Select Committees, but in my experience they should be seen as part of the parliamentary process and be entirely separate from the conduct of an inquiry. Inquiries should be seen to be independent of the parliamentary process. If I have one overriding concern about the Bill it is that it does not sufficiently support the independence of inquiries. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC200"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC200</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I believe that there is an important place for inquiries in our society as part of the checks and balances on power, the way in which decisions are made and the impact of those decisions on people. Members of the public value greatly the independence of inquiries and we should devise machinery which is separate from Parliament to conduct matters of this kind. Therefore I support the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="50118-38_spnew2"></a><b> Viscount Goschen: </b>   I am not a lawyer and I have never chaired an inquiry. Therefore I am at a double disadvantage. However, I have had involvement of one kind or another with inquiries in the maritime field when in government.
</p>

<a name="50118-38_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>I support the sentiments expressed by my noble friend Lord Kingsland concerning the importance of involving Parliament. He put his finger on what I believe to be the central problem with inquiries and the fact that the Bill will set in stone the involvement of the Executive&#151;of Ministers&#151;in setting up an inquiry to inquire into their own conduct.
</p>

<a name="50118-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>In other aspects of life and in the judicial process, on which I am the least qualified person in the Moses Room to speak, it would seem extraordinary if a defendant were allowed to choose his own judge and go on to choose others&#151;perhaps prosecuting counsel. I do not believe that that would be acceptable. Similarly, it is not acceptable for the Government to be able to choose their own judge and, more importantly, to set the terms of an inquiry.
</p>

<a name="50118-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>Within the past year or two, we have seen a plethora of inquiries and they are almost all instantly attacked for the fact that the Minister, or various arms of the Government, draw up the terms of reference. They are almost always attacked for being too narrow. That is a significant problem and at the outset it weakens the strength of the inquiry and its conclusions. Those attacks have been made thick and fast on inquiries of recent years.

</p>

<a name="50118-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>I do not have the instant answer to that problem. We have heard that there are real problems with Parliament running inquiries, but is see no reason why there should not be a Standing Committee of one kind or another&#151;we can pursue this matter further at later stages of the Bill&#151;which could at least be involved in the selection of the judge or chair of the inquiry and to set the terms of reference. My real emphasis would go on the latter point rather than on the former. The setting of the terms of reference is important and if that could be approved by Parliament more strength would be given to the government who set up an inquiry in demonstrating that that has been done at arm&#039;s length.
</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="50118-38_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </b>   For almost exactly the same reasons as advanced by my noble friend Lord Goschen, I would come to the contrary conclusion. I consider that one of the least attractive features of the plethora of inquiries to which he referred has been the unseemly argument that proceeded the establishment of the inquiry determining what form it should take. What should its terms of reference be? Should a judicial person head it? That has taken place <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="50118-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>My concern would be that if the 1921 Act were to be left in place, it would still be seen as the Rolls Royce or the grand-daddy of all inquiries. It would not matter whether the Government sought to establish an inquiry under this new Bill; there would be an endless argument to the effect that what the Government should have done was establish an inquiry under the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921. That will provoke something of a muddle, which is to be avoided at all costs.
</p>

<a name="50118-38_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>I am sorry to say that I am far too cynical about resolutions of both Houses. I have no doubt that in this House there might be an occasion, particularly with Cross-Benchers, when a resolution could be pushed through to attack Ministers for this or that, but I have no confidence that that could be done in the House of Commons unless the government of the day were settled in their determination that there should be an inquiry and they concurred with the establishment of it. Not least, it is not difficult to see how, if that was the point at issue, if the conduct of a senior Minister was in question, if he had not already resigned or been forced from office, it seems to me that what the House of Commons would do would be to put it to a test of confidence in the Government. In such circumstances, even though it looked like a resolution was about to be passed, once the Government Whips of the day had the chance to tell their troops that this was to be regarded as a matter of confidence, I have no doubt whatever what the outcome of that resolution would be; it would be defeated.
</p>

<a name="50118-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>This Bill is not perfect, as the Minister knows, although I share the view that it is a significant improvement on what we have at the moment. However, I do not think that it has any real chance of becoming the model for the type of inquiries that we want unless the 1921 Act goes.

<a name="50118-39_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </b>  I am grateful to noble Lords who have given me the benefit of their views, not least   in the exchange between the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord   Fraser, about the terms of reference, which I will not address at the moment, because we will have amendments later looking precisely at the issues that both noble Lords feel are important. It would take far too much of the Committee&#039;s time to do that now, but they are important issues. I only mention that because they will come up later.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, began by talking about the two shifts that concern him, from Parliament to the Executive and from chairmen to Ministers. I will try to address some of the issues that have been raised in that context. We have had three different parts of the debate: one about the role of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC202"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC202</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Parliament; the other about the relationship between the Chairman and the Minister, which will come up in later amendments; and one about the specific issues surrounding ministerial misconduct.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>Let me begin my remarks by making it absolutely clear what the 1921 Act does and does not do. There were quite a number of misconceptions about that in what noble Lords said. I hope that once I have explained it, it will lead people in the direction of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser, in saying that the Act should not continue.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="50118-39_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Ackner: </b>   Can I be forgiven for saying that we are having some difficulty in hearing at this end of the Room? The acoustics in this Room are terrible. Will the Minister bear that in mind?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="50118-39_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I certainly will bear it in mind, although I do not have the faintest idea what to do about it, other than to turn the volume up. Should I try to move the microphone nearer to me?
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="50118-39_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Ackner: </b>   Yes, that would be an advantage.
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="50118-39_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I will go with that, although if I put it on my notes, I cannot possibly see what I have to say. This shall be a novelty. This is my first day in the Moses Room. My Bills are normally so controversial that they must be debated on the Floor of the House.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>I was describing three debates, and the third is about ministerial misconduct. I was talking about what the 1921 Act does and does not do. Crucially, it does not give Parliament a power to set up a statutory inquiry. A Back-Bencher could not use the 1921 Act to do that. It says that where parliamentary resolutions are passed, and an inquiry is appointed by the Secretary of State or the monarch, the inquiry can be given the powers and privileges of the 1921 Act. My submission is initially therefore that preserving the Act does not achieve what Members of the Committee seek to achieve, in terms of either the involvement of Parliament or the ambitions in other ways.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>Frankly, the provision does not oblige the Secretary of State to do anything other than&#151;as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, described&#151;in moral pressure, what is right and proper in times of great concern. He mentioned Bloody Sunday and Aberfan as two such instances. It is also true that many other inquiries born of terrible tragedies, not least that chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Laming, into the death of Victoria Climbi&#233;, were not set up under that Act. We must take away the misconception that the Bill is replacing something that was better. It was not. It would not have done what Members of the Committee believe that it would have done.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a>As I indicated at Second Reading, a lot of other legislation has grown up over the years that has overtaken the 1921 Act, which is used very rarely. We talked about the 30 inquiries that have taken place over the past 14 or 15 years, of which only four were set up under the 1921 Act. Some inquiries&#151;again, the Climbi&#233; inquiry is an example&#151;were set up using more than one Act. The purpose that lies behind the Bill <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC203"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC203</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

above everything else is to simplify a very complicated existing framework, and to create a single effective framework. What we are setting out to achieve will not only do the job of the 1921 Act, but&#151;in relation to some issues to do with the choosing of a panel or with costs&#151;do so in a more effective way.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a>The powers and privileges given to inquiries under the 1921 Act are all available in some comparable form to inquiries under the Bill. The only notable difference&#151;it deals with the question&#151;is around resolutions in Parliament. I indicated that those resolutions do not do what Members of the Committee thought that they might. I undertook at Second Reading, and shall be interested during Committee, to listen very carefully to noble Lords. I want to consider further ways to strengthen parliamentary involvement in the process, and look forward to debates in Committee on that. I make a commitment to consider that very carefully. I have heard the strength of feeling and recognise what Members of the Committee are saying to me.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a>My first submission is that the 1921 Act should go because it does not do what the Committee is looking for. I commit to considering that the critical point about the role of Parliament be looked at again, both in Committee and beyond.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a>With Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, was trying to retain the procedure on the misconduct of a government department or Minister. I hope that he will accept that it would not do what he wanted. As I said, the 1921 Act does not do what Members of the Committee want it to do, so we would not be giving additional powers to Parliament or Ministers. It would only allow some inquiries to carry on as they were before. That would be less effective than the way that we are considering for the future.
</p>




<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="50118-39_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   If the Minister is right about that, how will we investigate ministerial misconduct? Clearly the procedures in the Bill do not help us, because those are initiated by Ministers. A Minister is highly unlikely to initiate a procedure to investigate himself; and most unlikely to initiate a procedure to investigate his Cabinet colleagues. Where is the procedure in the Bill, in terms of both initiation and substance, that will enable the country to investigate ministerial misdemeanours?
</p>




<p><a name="st_19"></a>
<a name="50118-39_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I shall address the points but, so far as this Government are concerned, if there have been any allegations of misconduct, inquiries of one kind or another have been undertaken. The noble Lord may not like them or their outcome; none the less, the Government have striven to make sure that there is proper conduct by Ministers. Nothing in the Bill prevents Parliament wishing to introduce additional procedures if it so wished.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a>If I might, I will continue with the issues around what the noble Lord is proposing. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, can then consider whether he wants to propose alternative suggestions or proposals, or pursue those that he has. The purpose of this Bill, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC204"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC204</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

which is set out clearly in Clause 1, which comes from the 1921 Act background, is to allow inquiries into events. Events are different to issues. It is specifically designed to look at what might happen and to investigate how best we ensure that we gain public confidence that those events could not happen again. It is possible that in the work of an inquiry that along the way one might discover misconduct by a person, a department or a Minister, but we should not prejudge it.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a>One of the issues with what the noble Lord, Lord   Kingsland, seeks to do in his submission to the Committee is quite difficult, because if one looks at some of the big inquiries that have taken place, it is difficult on occasion to say that a department has been guilty of misconduct, but it is possible that that conclusion might be reached in the course of an inquiry. It is important that noble Lords are aware that the purpose of an inquiry is to look at the event and to look at the process that led to the event, and not to assume that the event is around misconduct. That is important in this context.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a>It is also difficult, when one looks at the events, to consider what might be misconduct. It might be by omission, perhaps by not giving an organisation or agency funded by the department sufficient resources. Is that misconduct by omission? Also, looking at some of the issues that have arisen, for example, around foot-and-mouth disease or BSE, it is important that we do not prejudge. There is a question mark generally around inquiries into events about whether one is able to distinguish at the outset that the issue is about misconduct. Most times that is not possible at the outset. Very often, the circumstances might not fall into that.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>Noble Lords have talked about the processes available and how Parliament operates. I agree with much of what has been said in Committee today about the proposal put forward by the noble Lord, Lord   Kingsland, about the use of Cross-Benchers. With the best will in the world, and with all respect to our noble and very eminent Cross-Benchers, this is not the role for them. They play an important part in the legislative life of Parliament and in enforcing and enhancing our debates. It is not their role to be put in a position of cross-examining and determining the conduct of elected Ministers in another place.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>This morning, I appeared before a Select Committee, so my view of Select Committees is substantially different to all those that have been put forward thus far. As a Minister, appearing before a Select Committee is one of the most important and critical things that I undertake, and I do so with enormous gravity. I work very hard; it is like doing a PhD on your feet. I feel extraordinarily held to account by the Select Committee process. I am mindful&#151;I have appeared twice before this Select Committee and several times before others&#151;and I wait with bated breath for their reports on whether I am able to do my job as efficiently and effectively as I might.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>I put a plea in to noble Lords who perhaps have not appeared before a Select Committee recently, or ever, that Ministers take the work of the Select Committees <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC205"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC205</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

incredibly seriously. They do, as I understand it, have powers equivalent to those of the US Senate. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, feels passionately about the issue of misconduct, and it is important to remember that procedures are in place already that could be invoked if Parliament so chose.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>Other noble Lords have talked about trying to get parliamentary resolution in both Houses on misconduct issues. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser, is not cynical; I think he is accurate that there is an inevitability about the Government of the day having a majority in the House of Commons, but not, certainly in this Government&#039;s case, in the House of Lords. I am not sure where that takes us in terms of a rational and sensible way to approach this. One looks at the code of conduct for Ministers, and all the issues around how Ministers are expected to behave, which is taken seriously. The confidence of the Prime Minister and the country are important and are not to be considered lightly.
<a name="time_3"></a>
<a name="50118-39_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50118-39_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>As I have indicated, within this Bill there is nothing to stop Parliament, if it so wished, looking at additional procedures. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, put forward an interesting idea. I think it is unworkable but that is not to say I do not understand the point that the noble Lord seeks to reach.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>I touch on Amendments Nos. 3, 65 and 66. As I have already indicated, there is an issue about the role of Parliament. I indicated why we think the 1921 Act does not achieve what noble Lords would hope it did. I hope that noble Lords, in thinking about this, will be mindful of what I have already indicated about the role of Parliament. I hope that, as we continue to debate the Bill today and tomorrow, we have the opportunity to think through how that might operate to ensure that those issues are effectively dealt with.
</p>

<a name="50118-39_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>On the issue of ministerial misconduct, the Bill is concerned with events and, in looking at events, one cannot necessarily indicate at the beginning that ministerial or government departmental misconduct is involved, although that might emerge in the course of an inquiry. I am reconciled to considering what the parliamentary issues might be. It is for Parliament to consider whether additional procedures are needed. However, with the greatest respect to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, I urge great caution regarding the proposals that have been put forward thus far. I hope that on that basis the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
</p>

<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="50118-40_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Laming: </b>   Is the noble Baroness willing to say a little more about not the detail but the principle of the ministerial code, because I am rather disturbed by the use of the phrase &quot;ministerial misconduct&quot;? It seems to me that inquiries are established to examine either the validity or the reasonableness of decisions or actions taken. They are not established to impose disciplinary standards on individuals, be they in government, local authorities, the National Health Service or any other body. Those matters must be dealt with through <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC206"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC206</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

proper disciplinary procedures that are designed to deal with them. I have always assumed that in respect of Ministers there is a rather precise ministerial code, and that misconduct in the general use of the word would not be dealt with in an inquiry but by Parliament. If I am right in that&#151;and I hope that I am&#151;it is very important that we are clear what is the distinctive role of an inquiry and what are the proper procedures for dealing with all other matters, including matters that I generally assume constitute misconduct.
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="50118-40_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I do not have a copy of the ministerial code to hand but I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Laming, that it sets out the standards that the Prime Minister expects his Ministers to uphold. The Prime Minister remains the ultimate judge of behaviour and any breach of those standards. I believe that resolutions were introduced in March 1997 under the previous administration, which are reproduced on   the first page of the code, and which make clear that the constitutional position is that Ministers stay in office as long as they retain the confidence of the Prime Minister, and that Ministers have a duty to be accountable to Parliament. There is no suggestion in that resolution that Parliament should inquire into, or investigate, ministerial behaviour in any structured way akin to an inquiry. The code was set out to do what I hope it does very well.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="50118-40_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I would like to thank the Minister for her very full and, if I may say so, frank response to what not only I had the privilege of saying but what many noble Lords said. I think the noble Baroness very fairly accepted that the contents of the Bill are not intended to deal with the issue of ministerial misdemeanour. The noble Baroness quite rightly said that, in the course of an investigation under the Bill, issues about ministerial misdemeanour or departmental negligence might arise, but that would not be the primary target that was aimed at by the inquiry.

</p>

<a name="50118-40_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>In that sense I respectfully suggest to the Minister that the Bill is a step back from the current situation. Whatever the defects of the 1921 Act, it seeks to and is capable of dealing with ministerial misdemeanours or departmental negligence. So something that is currently in our legislation and which assists us in dealing with that constitutional problem is going to be taken away.
</p>

<a name="50118-40_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>The Minister very fairly said that there is nothing to stop Parliament setting up its own procedures to investigate ministerial conduct. In effect, she is saying, &quot;We are removing the 1921 Act from the statute book but there is nothing to prevent your Lordships&#039; House or another place setting up a series of procedures to substitute for it&quot;. That is essentially the message.
</p>

<a name="50118-40_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>I have two responses to that suggestion. First, if that is the case, surely it would be an important function of the procedure under the Bill for noble Lords in Committee, on Report and at Third Reading to consider what parliamentary procedures should be set up to replace the 1921 Act&#151;because a constitutional gap has now emerged. The essence of ministerial responsibility in a democratic society is accountability <br>&nbsp;<br>

to Parliament. I have suggested one approach to the problem&#151;that is, reviving the parliamentary Select Committee, which I call an &quot;investigatory committee&quot;, shaped along the lines of the investigations that are most successfully conducted in the United States Senate.
</p>

<a name="50118-40_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>It has been put to me that the House of Commons would not wear your Lordships&#039; House conducting such investigations. It is, of course, plain that another place cannot conduct the investigations itself because we all know that whatever committee was set up would divide on party lines. That was the disease for which the remedy was the 1921 Act. If Ministers are ultimately accountable to Parliament, and another place is incapable of conducting investigations that enforce ministerial accountability, surely the only other forum for conducting those investigations is your Lordships&#039; House.

</p>

<a name="50118-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>It was put to me, most notably by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, that such a proposal would be deeply resented by another place. I say to him, in turn, that it would be very dog-in-the-manger of another place, not being able to conduct the investigations itself&#151;because we know that Members would divide on party lines&#151;not to allow your Lordships&#039; House to conduct them simply because this House is one with which another place feels in some way in competition. If the House of Commons cannot conduct these investigations, yet it is desirable to make Ministers accountable to Parliament, surely it must follow that the only arm of Parliament that can conduct the investigations is your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="50118-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>It occurred to me, while I was listening to the many splendid speeches delivered by Members of the Committee in the course of the debate on this first amendment, that one compromise approach might be to have a joint investigatory committee with another place, on which there was one Member representing each of the three political strains in another place, but with an equal number of Cross-Benchers from your Lordships&#039; House. That way another place would be involved in the investigation but the party political element would not have a dominant role. I have not thought that through; it may well have other flaws. But it would at least seek to grapple with the issue that seemed to be troubling the noble Lord, Lord Borrie.
</p>

<a name="50118-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>At all events, in my submission, it would be grossly negligent&#151;knowing that the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 was being removed from the statute book, thereby eliminating the one power that Parliament has to control the conduct of Ministers in respect of particular decisions that they have taken which are alleged to amount to misconduct&#151;wrong, and a derogation from the responsibilities of all Members of the Committee, not to grapple with this issue and try to find a more successful procedure than the 1921 Act as a way of dealing with this important constitutional problem.
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="50118-40_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   Before the noble Lord sits down, will he respond to this point? He has made a major assumption, which I do not fully understand, that the 1921 Act enabled the inquiry to go into matters of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC208"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC208</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

misbehaviour, misdemeanour and misconduct, or whatever you like to call it, and the new inquiry under the Bill would not.
</p>

<a name="50118-40_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a>Surely there is no difference on that score between the way in which the old tribunals of inquiry operated and how the present inquiries are likely to operate so far as examining events, looking into facts and investigating to discover the true facts. I say with respect to the Minister that I think that she indicated that of course a matter of misconduct might emerge, but the inquiry is not into the misconduct, nor was it under the old Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act. I am sorry&#151;I am being premature in calling it the old Act, but I mean the one that is meant to be replaced by this Bill.
</p>

<a name="50118-40_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has made a major assumption in the speech that he is just concluding that there is some difference on the score of investigating ministerial misconduct between the tribunals of inquiry Act and the present Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>
<a name="50118-40_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   I am not saying that the 1921 Act was necessarily a good vehicle for investigating ministerial misconduct. But it was certainly a vehicle capable of investigating ministerial misconduct.
</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="50118-40_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord, but so is this Bill: there is no constitutional difference between the provisions. The wording in the 1921 Act is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;inquiring into a definite matter&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>



</p>

<a name="50118-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a>while the wording of this Bill is, &quot;inquiring into events&quot;. There is no constitutional change. In reality, the 1921 Act has not been used. Certainly, for considerable time we cannot find any evidence of it to look at ministerial misconduct. That could be so for this Bill, too. There is no change.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="50118-40_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   My response to that is twofold. First, I had thought, in an earlier reply to me, that the Minister had accepted that this Bill was not an appropriate vehicle to investigate ministerial misconduct. Secondly, it is quite clear that if she were to glance at the debates that took place in Parliament between the conclusion of the proceedings of the Marconi committee and the 1921 tribunal, she would conclude that the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 was intended as a substitute procedure for the procedure that was previously used in parliamentary Select Committees. So, with respect to the noble Baroness, I do not accept that the two are on all fours with each other.
</p>

<a name="50118-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a>It may be that my concerns about this are not widely shared in your Lordships&#039; House. But if they are not, it seems to me that your Lordships would rest content with a situation where inquiries into ministerial demeanours, that go to the heart of government, are subject simply to the prerogative decision of the Prime Minister of the day who sets up an inquiry which seems to him to best suit the political circumstances. These are bespoke inquiries. They do not respect any statutory or parliamentary procedure. The chairman is named, certain powers are created and the chairman gets on with what he has to get on with under those <br>&nbsp;<br>

powers. In my submission, to leave the way in which a Minister is made accountable to Parliament solely to the prerogative powers of the Prime Minister of the day is wholly wrong. I am seeking a parliamentary substitute for that procedure. In the end, it may be impossible to find such a procedure under our constitution but I would be shaken if I thought that your Lordships were not prepared to seek it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="50118-41_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Howe of Aberavon </b>   moved Amendment No. 4:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a>Page 2, line 3, leave out paragraphs (a) and (b) and insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_0"></a><br>
&quot;(a)   by a chairman with one or more other members, or

<br>
(b)   by a chairman alone.


<br>
(   )   In deciding whether or not an inquiry can acceptably be conducted by a chairman alone, the Minister must have regard to the considerations specified in section 7.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_28"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: This is one of three amendments that are grouped together. As Committee Members will see, they are all directed to the same central purpose. Basically, the objective is that the establishment of an inquiry with a chairman sitting on his own should be the exception rather than the rule. For the most part, an inquiry should include wingmen, as they are called&#151;or wingwomen, for that matter&#151;or assessors, or in certain cases both. Amendment No.   4 refers to the criteria already spelt out in relation to assessors in Clause 7, which is a convenient way of combining those two purposes, but it could be supplemented by Amendments Nos. 5 or 6, if necessary.
</p>

<a name="50118-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>It may also be helpful if I explain the relationship between the three areas in which I have so far designed appraisals or amendments to the Bill. This group is in relation to Clause 3. An amendment to Clause 10 relates to the control of expenditure and one to Clause 16 relates to the right to legal representations. All three are concerned with the four objectives of an inquiry of the kind that we are discussing, which were well spelt out in the report produced by the Council on Tribunals in 1996 in response to the invitation by the then Lord Chancellor, my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern.
</p>

<a name="50118-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>I expect that your Lordships are familiar with that report. It was referred to by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, when he presented it to Parliament as &quot;authoritative advice&quot; and it spelt out in paragraphs 2.3 to 2.8 the four factors with which inquires of this kind are concerned. I hesitate to conclude in that phrase the balance between those factors, because they do not necessarily compete with each other. The four factors are effectiveness, fairness, speed and economy. Ideally, they should really all <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC210"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC210</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

march together although there is bound to be some relationship between them. The most important sentence from that report of Council on Tribunals is in paragraph 2.9. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a>&quot;The objectives of effectiveness and fairness should not, as a matter of principle, be sacrificed to the interests of speed and economy&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>This group of amendments is concerned in that general context with the risks that are inherent in having a solo appointment of the chairman alone. I certainly do not say that a solo chairman is bound to go wrong or is bound, in all circumstances, to be the wrong answer. However, to have an inquiry with a chairman on his own is bound to involve a risk-taking element and shortcomings are more likely with only one head than if there were two or three heads conducting the inquiry in partnership.
</p>

<a name="50118-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>Certainly, some solo inquiries have survived public scrutiny. One can think of one or two inquiries conducted in years gone by by Lord Scarman and more recently by the noble and learned Lord, Lord   Cullen. Both were judges with very wide experience before they embarked on inquiries. On the other hand, some inquiries have attracted, for whatever reason, controversy of a kind that I do not like. I do not relish the idea of inquiries being the subject of slamming front page headlines because there can be nothing worse for the conductor of the inquiry than that, nothing worse for the judiciary who have committed themselves to their task and nothing worse for the balance of authority in our society. Of those that have attracted that reaction, most if not all have been solo inquiries.
</p>

<a name="50118-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>I hope that I may be forgiven for offering two or three examples. The first that I cite was the inquiry under the chairmanship of the late Lord Widgery into the original Bloody Sunday disaster. In retrospect, that inquiry had an air of panic about it. As I have already said, the shooting took place on 30 January and the appointment was made only two days later. The sittings ran through to the 21 February. The report was signed on 10 April and published on 18   April. So, in 11 weeks and 17 sitting days, 114   witnesses were examined with only three teams of counsel representing them. Although one can have a great deal of sympathy with the task that faced Lord   Widgery and a great deal of understanding of the difficulties that he may have faced, the sense of urgency may have overwhelmed the inquiry and certainly led to an unsatisfactory outcome.
</p>

<a name="50118-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>Then I must refer to the inquiry&#151;in which I took a somewhat self-assertive role in criticising&#151;under our colleague, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scott. One could hardly say that that noble and learned Lord was out of touch with a broad range of opinion. He was a former chairman of the Bar Council and notable huntsman, which brings one in contact with humanity of a different kind from the Bar Council. However, for whatever reason, he was left to make his own choice of the procedures followed.

</p>

<a name="50118-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>As I understand it, there was no discussion between him and those who appointed him of the composition of the tribunal nor of the method of the tribunal. Indeed, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC211"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC211</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the government of the day deliberately abstained and restricted themselves thereafter from criticising any of the procedure. When a number of us, including the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, led criticisms of his proceedings on behalf of the Association of First Division Civil Servants, the Government declined to take up the cudgels on our behalf. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Scott, was truly on a solo flight from beginning to end.
</p>

<a name="50118-41_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>It may be that a judge the bulk of whose experience&#151;for all the other qualities of the noble and learned Lord&#151;was focused on the Chancery Division, would have had less of an intuitive feel for the procedures that should have been followed in that case. He did admit at some point in the inquiry&#151;I cannot remember when&#151;that he felt that his introduction to the procedures of government had been his exposure in the course of the inquiry. That led the one-time noble parliamentarian Anthony Wedgwood Benn&#151;Tony Benn, as he was then known&#151;to express the view, when the Scott report was debated in the Commons, that it was entirely wrong that such political matters should be entrusted to a judge who knew nothing about administration.
</p>

<a name="50118-41_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>I hope that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scott, will forgive me for resurrecting the criticisms that I have launched at him in our friendly exchanges over the years, but they are important to understand. That was an example where the chairman could and should have been helped by wingmen and/or by assessors.
</p>

<a name="50118-41_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>The third example&#151;another that I regret having to raise in today&#039;s company&#151;is that presided over much more recently by the noble and learned Lord, Lord   Hutton. Again, I think I am right in saying that in evidence to the Public Administration Committee, either he or the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, said that there was no discussion at the outset of the desirability of wingmen. It was another case where, for all the meticulous care with which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, conducted the proceedings, the formation of judgments may have been easier had he had the benefit of advice from others.
</p>

<a name="50118-41_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>At a very humble level, I am reminded, going back years, of my experience sitting as a chairman or deputy chairman of Glamorgan quarter sessions. With limited experience in the criminal courts compared to my civil practice, sitting in the appeals committee there I benefited enormously, even on the simplest cases, from the presence of justices of the peace other than myself. Another area in which that general point has been well illustrated is in the composition of what was the National Industrial Relations Court and became the Employment Appeal Tribunal. Again, by definition, the chairman of the court has wingmen drawn from&#151;in the old-fashioned phrase&#151;both sides of industry to help and advise him.

</p>

<a name="50118-41_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>By contrast in the wider area about which we are talking, where there has been little, if any, criticism, I cite the formidable Aberfan inquiry. I appeared before it, and it was conducted by the late Lord Edmund-Davies. He had the benefit of having a former clerk of Monmouthshire County Council to steer him on governmental matters, and also a very well qualified civil <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC212"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC212</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

engineer. He went out of his way more than once to praise the input that they made to his proceedings. Again at the risk of immodesty, the Ely hospital inquiry, which I conducted in 1967 and 1968, was a relatively modest affair, although it had surprisingly significant consequences. I should have been completely lost without the presence alongside me of a member of the regional hospital board, a consultant psychiatrist and a very senior former nurse.
</p>

<a name="50118-41_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>&quot;BCCI&quot; is a set of initials to daunt anyone except the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, who had the pleasure of conducting the BCCI inquiry&#151;completing it within 12 months, incidentally. He had an accountant and a banker as assessors, and paid tribute to them most warmly. The much more recent example under the noble and learned Lord, Lord Phillips, was into BSE. He had the benefit of the presence of a retired senior civil servant, June Bridgman, and a geneticist, Mr Malcolm Smith.
</p>

<a name="50118-41_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>If one draws all that together, the most important general consideration of the broad question, apart from documents from the department itself, was the post-Scott post-mortem of all the procedural questions by the Council on Tribunals, whose report I have already cited. At paragraph 5.16 of that report, it had this to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a>&quot;Wing members can provide a breadth of experience which can be brought to bear on the subject matter of the inquiry. They can also enhance public confidence in the fairness of the process and in the inquiry&#039;s conclusions. They can afford the inquiry chairman helpful support and some protection against errors of judgment, in matters of both substance and procedure  . . . As discussed in paragraph 5.2 above, if the inquiry involves consideration of broad policy issues, a spread of expertise will almost always be desirable&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-41_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>That is most clearly evidenced by the words of one of the former judicial chairmen. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, spoke about the value of his assessors in the BCCI inquiry. He expressed the benefit of,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a>&quot;drawing on their experience and expertise. They have contributed invaluable insights and guidance&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-41_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>But, almost more importantly, he said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a>&quot;I have also found their judgments on more mundane factual issues consistently shrewd and realistic.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-41_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>It is important to appreciate that it is not simply expertise that I was looking for; it is the availability of two additional minds to supplement one&#039;s own judgment.
<a name="time_5"></a>
<a name="50118-41_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50118-41_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>I come back again to my experience in the Ely Hospital inquiry. The character of a large number of people was under scrutiny there. A number of councillors came before us and two trade union officials on behalf of some of the members. Apart from the benefit of the advice that I received from my wingmen&#151;or my two wingwomen and one wingman&#151;I followed the procedure of convening two or three times during the   proceedings, over an informal buffet supper, the representatives who were appearing before me and discussing with them how we were getting on. I would ask them whether they would agree that certain issues <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC213"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC213</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

could be set to one side and whether we could agree on certain premises at the next stage. This informality, drawing on the advice not just of those who were sitting alongside me, but also of those who were sitting in front of me, enabled us to complete the inquiry in two or three sitting weeks. There was a very large number of differences.
</p>

<a name="50118-41_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>My own feeling&#151;I have often been criticised for having too collegiate a style of government&#151;is that I do not apologise for collegiality. Wisdom is often to be derived from seeking the advice of other people openly and publicly in that way.
</p>

<a name="50118-41_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a>It is interesting that these arguments are specifically recognised in Clause 7. Subsection 1(a) states that in considering whether assessors are necessary, the Minister must have regard,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a>&quot;to the need to ensure that the inquiry panel . . .  has the necessary expertise&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-41_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a>Subsection 1(b) states that he should have regard also to,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a>&quot;the need for balance  . . . in the composition of the panel&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-41_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a>Both are important and must be taken into account in deciding on the composition of the panel. It is for those reasons that the composition of the panel deserves to reflect the factors that I have been emphasising at least as much as the availability of assessors.
</p>

<a name="50118-41_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>I would like to say a word at this stage on one related topic; that is, the question, which was raised at Second Reading, whether judges can properly or sensibly be   drawn on to undertake these tasks. It will be considered later in these proceedings. One should not forget the alternative, which the Council on Tribunals discusses specifically, of the availability of &quot;an eminent senior lawyer&quot; or,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a>&quot;an eminent non-lawyer of manifest independence and integrity&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-41_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>There are advantages in that. One that is increasingly recognised is that it avoids the risk of our judiciary, particularly our senior judiciary, being devalued or even contaminated&#151;if that is not too offensive a word&#151;by its apparent involvement, for all its best endeavours, in extremely difficult political issues. It leaves open the question where one is to get the legally qualified judicial figure to preside over these matters, if one is not to go to the judiciary, but I have already referred to examples. The noble Lord, Lord Laming, is nodding his head modestly enough. <i>Exemple gratia</i> there he sits.

</p>

<a name="50118-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>There is one other aspect of going for the senior lawyer rather than the judge, which has only recently been occurring to me; that is&#151;and this is a rather impertinent observation&#151;it may relate to the importance the inquiry attaches to the avoidance of undue cost. I mentioned this at Second Reading in rather a frivolous fashion when I talked about Mr <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC214"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC214</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Jenkin Jones, of great fame from long ago. If a senior lawyer is engaged for one of these tasks, at least in my day, he is paid on a <i>per diem</i> basis. In those days, it was a modest <i>per diem</i> basis. He has to fight very hard to receive additional payment for the time in which he has to write his report. He knows also that the longer he sits locked up in Ely Hospital, or wherever the inquiry may be taking place, the faster his regular clients are forgetting about him. So he has a financial incentive and a professional incentive to proceed with as much speed as he can. He also has the opportunity of proving his judicial worth if he gets it right. So there are real attractions from the point of view of effectiveness and economy, leave aside the high quality of the lawyer involved, in going outside the judiciary.
</p>

<a name="50118-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>I have said enough about the central purpose behind my amendment. I just remind your Lordships of that crucial sentence from the report of the Council on Tribunals in paragraph 2.9. It states:

It is pretty well accepted in the legal profession that both practice and study of those who have practised indicate that a chairman plus, to use the same phrase as the noble and learned Lord, two &quot;wingmen&quot; are most helpful in the exchange of views. The fact that one has someone with whom one can discuss things before coming to firm conclusions, and all kinds of other reasons, suggest that that is the better composition as a general rule.

<a name="50118-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>It is, however, a general rule. I would accept that there have been instances, and that there will be instances, where the appointment of a single person is sufficient. I am not sure that the amendments of the noble and learned Lord get us very far. I thought that perhaps a psychologist had drafted Amendment No. 4, because it contains exactly the same words except in a different order. Perhaps, psychologically, if one puts &quot;chairman with one or more other members&quot; before &quot;chairman alone&quot;, one starts to consider the first possibility rather than the second and there is a greater chance of the conclusion being the first possibility; that is, the chairman being appointed with one or other members.
</p>

<a name="50118-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>Amendment No. 4 states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a>&quot;In deciding whether or not an inquiry can acceptably be conducted by a chairman alone, the Minister must have regard to the considerations specified in section 7&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC215</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>I am not sure that that adds very much because Clause   3(2) tells us that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>&quot;References in this Act to an inquiry panel are to the chairman and any other member or members&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a>It seems that the appointing Minister will already consider those matters in Clause 7 in determining whether there should be a chairman or a chairman sitting with other members.
</p>

<a name="50118-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a>Amendment No. 6 states that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a>&quot;special attention must be paid to the need for the appointment of one or more assessors, as specified in section 10&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a>That seems to be unexceptional, but I should have thought that it may be possible for the Minister to reply that attention would be paid to that. Whether &quot;special&quot; adds anything, I do not know.
</p>

<a name="50118-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a>Where there is a difference with the Bill is in Amendment No. 5, which states that &quot;there shall be a   presumption&quot;. I find the use of the word &quot;presumption&quot; there, which cannot be a presumption in law&#151;I do not know quite what it is&#151;rather curious. I do not know whether there are any precedents for the word &quot;presumption&quot; being used in such a way. How it makes more definitive the choice being in favour of a chairman and members rather than just the chairman alone, I am not sure. Clearly, as and when Clause 3 becomes law&#151;let us suppose that it is as it stands&#151;as usual, what the Minister says in explanation of the clause and what she will say in few moments&#039; time will be part of the background to what Ministers will in future do under Clause 3. I very much doubt, and I find it a little odd to put into statutory provision, something like Amendment No. 5.
</p>

<a name="50118-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a>Those are merely detailed and trivial points because I accept that all the principled and practical points that the noble and learned Lord has made in favour of a chairman being appointed together with one or other members are very persuasive indeed. I would hope that they would be persuasive to any Minister, except in a rare instance, in future.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="50118-42_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Howe of Aberavon: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for letting me intervene because I appreciate his comments very much. I am, in this area, a novice. It is a very long time indeed since I attempted to draft an amendment to a Bill, let alone a Bill, and he is a much wiser man in that respect. If he is saying that he supports the case that I have made, but that he can certainly express it more elegantly, forcefully and effectively, I would be only too glad to accept his improvements and advice. We both would like to hear the Minister saying that my ideas and his language together make a marvellously harmonious proposition that she would like to accept.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="50118-42_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </b>   I rise briefly in support of the amendment that my noble friend has put forward. I think it is perfectly obvious what &quot;presumption&quot; means in this context. It means that Parliament expects you to appoint a chairman and two other persons and if the Minister fails to do that, he will have to explain why. It is as simple as that. I do not find it difficult at all and it seems to be desirable. As the Minister knows, there are other points later in the Bill, where I think <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC216"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC216</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

that we should comparably introduce the idea that Parliament is indicating to Ministers who are setting up inquiries that there is a series of presumptions. They do not have to follow them. If they do not like them or if they are not apposite for the circumstances, they need not follow them through. However, they will be under an obligation to explain. That seems to be a perfectly desirable public objective that Parliament should follow through.
</p>

<a name="50118-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>My other point is rather more trivial and I would be grateful if the Minister could answer it. Can you be chairman of one? I can see how you can be a chairman of a body. If there are three of you, one of you is chairman, but if you are sitting alone, are you the chairman? I have some difficulty with that idea. I shall pose that question to the Minister.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="50118-42_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   If I can help the noble and learned Lord, I will try. You are chairman of the inquiry.
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="50118-42_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Laming: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, expressed himself so splendidly that there is nothing that I can add. However, I was provoked by the comment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser, in that we are trying to achieve a piece of legislation which will cover a wide range of possibilities where it might be considered that an inquiry should be established. Whereas I agree with the thrust of the comments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, especially about the collegiate approach, it is not appropriate to put on the face of the Bill a presumption. I do not think that Ministers should have to explain to Parliament why one kind of arrangement is chosen as opposed to another. Ministers have to explain to Parliament why there is to be an inquiry, what the terms of reference will be and by whom it will be conducted. It is for Parliament and everyone else to determine whether that has a sense of logic and credibility about it.
</p>

<a name="50118-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>I do not think that it is right to put in legislation that there should be a presumption of one pattern or another. We should create a situation where there is scope for all possibilities to be relevant to a particular issue, although I very much support the thrust of the contribution made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe.

<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="50118-43_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hutton: </b>   I have no doubt that there are inquiries where it is desirable that a chairman should not sit alone, but that there should be additional members of the panel, or that if there is a chairman sitting alone he should be assisted by assessors.
</p>

<a name="50118-43_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>But because the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, supported this amendment by reference to the inquiry that I conducted into the death of Dr   David Kelly, I would like to make a number of brief observations about that inquiry in so far as it bears on the matters that have been discussed in relation to this amendment.
</p>

<a name="50118-43_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>The discovery of the body of Dr Kelly gave rise to wide public concern. My terms of reference, which appeared to me to be appropriate, were urgently to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC217"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC217</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

conduct an investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death. It appeared to me also that there were three primary questions that I should address in the course of that inquiry. First, how did Dr   Kelly meet his death? Did he take his own life or had third persons intervened in causing the death? That was a question which it seemed to me was an entirely appropriate one for a chairman with legal experience to decide.
</p>

<a name="50118-43_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>The report that set in train the chain of events which led to Dr Kelly coming into the public eye and subjected him to strains and pressures was the report in the BBC Today programme that the Government probably knew that the 45-minutes claim in the dossier in relation to weapons of mass destruction was wrong. That was a very grave allegation and because of the consequences of that report for Dr Kelly, I considered that I should deal with that issue in my report, and a great deal of evidence was given in relation to it.
</p>

<a name="50118-43_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>The question whether the Government knew that the intelligence was wrong was one that I also considered a single judge could properly decide. I was given express and specific evidence by Sir Richard Dearlove, the chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, that the report in relation to the readiness of weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes was a piece of intelligence coming from an established and reliable source.
</p>

<a name="50118-43_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>In addition, not only Mr John Scarlett, but also the chief of the Defence Intelligence Staff, Sir Joe French, the deputy chief of the Defence Intelligence Staff, Mr   Tony Cragge, and Sir David Omand, the security adviser at No. 10, all gave evidence to me that the Joint   Intelligence Committee gave its approval to the 45-minutes claim set out in the dossier.
</p>

<a name="50118-43_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a>I therefore decided that the allegation that the Government knew that the 45-minutes claim was wrong was unfounded. In the light of that strong evidence from the leading figures in the intelligence world, I consider that even if other members had been sitting with me on the panel or if I had had assessors, I would have been advised that the conclusion should have been the same. That was a finding also supported by the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Butler, when it later sat. It also came to the same conclusion that the Government had not advanced a claim which it knew to be false.
</p>

<a name="50118-43_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a>There is of course a further question that is of very great importance; that is, whether the intelligence supplied to the Government by the intelligence services was flawed and unreliable, whether it was overstated or whether caveats were omitted. At the commencement of my report, I recognised in express terms that this was a very important question, but I made it clear that it did not fall within my terms of reference.
</p>

<a name="50118-43_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a>I considered that it would have been quite inappropriate for a single judge without experience in intelligence matters to embark on such a question because, among other reasons, it would have greatly extended the length of my inquiry. I was concerned to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC218"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC218</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

report urgently to quieten public concerns about how Dr Kelly had met his death. Such an inquiry by me would also have involved me sitting in private, which was something that I did not wish to do. I was anxious that all the evidence relating to Dr Kelly&#039;s death should be given in public and that all the documents should be made available to the public, as they were.

</p>

<a name="50118-43_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a>The committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord   Butler, hearing evidence in private and with different and much wider terms of reference directed expressly to the reliability of the intelligence, considered such questions. It was entirely right that his committee should have done so. But it also seems to me that in the very unusual circumstances relating to Dr Kelly&#039;s death, it was in no way inappropriate that a judge sitting in public should consider the issues relating to Dr Kelly&#039;s death and that a committee of Privy Counsellors, hearing evidence in private, as they had to do in relation to intelligence matters, should consider the vitally important issue of the reliability of the intelligence that was provided to the Government.
</p>

<a name="50118-43_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>The third important question that I considered should be dealt with in the inquiry and in my report was whether the Government had embarked on an underhand and dishonourable strategy to leak covertly Dr Kelly&#039;s name to the media, without appearing to do so. Again, I considered that that was a proper question for a single judge to decide. Having heard a large volume of evidence, I came to the clear conclusion that there was no such strategy and that fearing that Dr Kelly&#039;s name was about to become public at any time because the press were pursuing constant inquiries as to the identity of Mr   Gilligan&#039;s source, the Government considered that they had no alternative but to issue a statement that a civil servant had come forward, lest they be charged with a cover-up.

</p>

<a name="50118-43_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>But I did criticise the Government for failing to take proper steps to help and protect Dr Kelly in the difficult position in which he found himself, although I observed that that criticism was subject to a number of mitigating circumstances.
</p>

<a name="50118-43_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>My noble and learned friend Lord Howe has referred to critical headlines and to criticism from the media. I fear the reality is that if there is an inquiry into a matter in which some sections of the media hope that there will be a report that will be highly critical of the government, then notwithstanding that the report does not so report on the basis of evidence given to it, there will still be sections of the media that will allege a whitewash. I fear that that is simply a fact of life in this country today. However, that is not a reason why such an inquiry should not be conducted. I also incline to the view that in such inquiries, even if there were a panel of those inquiring into the matter, if the report does not slam the Government in the terms which some media commentators hope for, there will still be allegations of a whitewash. Therefore, I consider that the inquiry, which I conducted within my terms of reference, was a proper one for a single judge, although I fully recognise that there are other reasons that can be advanced in support of this amendment.

<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="50118-43_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   It seems to me that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, has made an overwhelming case for the principles for which he has spoken. I have every confidence that because the noble   Baroness, Lady Ashton, is the essence of reasonableness and co-operation, she will shortly tell us so and tell us that in due course amendments will come forward to give effect to that.

</p>

<a name="50118-43_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>That does not mean that reports done by chairmen alone&#151;for example, the report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scott, or that of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton&#151;were wrong; it does not begin to mean that. It does perhaps mean that they would have received some lesser degree of media hostility if they had been done by a panel. However, I entirely agree with the point made by the noble and learned Lord that if you do not come up with the answer that the media think will be fun to slam across their papers, you will be slated anyhow, but probably you will be slated slightly less if you have two colleagues. However, I do not think that alters the principle that for matters to be inquired into, as opposed to being adjudged upon by a judge, three is normally better than one.
</p>

<a name="50118-43_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>Nor do I accept the criticism made by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, that these amendments are superfluous because the provision is already there. It seems to me that one of the things achieved by the amendments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord   Howe, is that the chairman can be appointed or chosen first. He can then be consulted and his views can be taken into account in deciding whether there are to be two wingmen and so on, rather than the whole thing being announced and then appointed&#151;as would currently have to happen under Clause 7&#151;as one would have to have decided whether the chairman was going to sit alone before you could appoint him, as Clause 7 now stands.
</p>

<a name="50118-43_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>I share some of the slight doubts about the presumption, and am slightly worried that if the Minister gave reasons that were not convincing to someone it might lead to judicial review of the decision not to have two wingmen. However, it seems to me that if, as I hope, the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, accepts Amendment No. 15, or its principle, there should be a statement about the terms of reference. That would be a suitable place for the Minister to explain why he had not appointed wingmen, if that was his decision, without putting that matter on the face of the statute with the possible risk, as I say, of judicial challenge. However, I very much hope that we are about to hear that these amendments are in principle on the right lines and will be implemented by the Government.

<a name="50118-44_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   The noble Lord, Lord Laming, was worried about being inhibited by so many lawyers. I am always in danger of being flattered by certain Members of your Lordships&#039; House.

<a name="column_GC220"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC220</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

interested in the whole question of the involvement of Parliament and the appropriateness of that. Therefore, I look forward to our discussions on that.
</p>

<a name="50118-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>I have learnt the new word &quot;wingmen&quot; or &quot;wingwomen&quot; in the course of my involvement with this Bill. I have to say that I have never heard of the word before. It is extremely exciting to learn new terminology.
</p>

<a name="50118-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, in eloquently introducing his amendments, talked about the advice that was given in 1996 to the Lord Chancellor of the day, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, from the Council on Tribunals in the wake of the Scott inquiry. The recommendations, to which noble Lords have referred, were very important. The advice indicated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a>&quot;The desirability of having wing members will depend to a great extent on the breadth of an inquiry&#039;s terms of reference&quot;.</p>

</p>

<a name="50118-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a>We are not going to be as helpful as the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, would like us to be, not because we do not understand the intention of the amendments but because our contention is that within large measure what the amendments intend is already achieved by the Bill. I shall briefly go though the points that have been raised.
</p>

<a name="50118-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a>We have drafted Clause 3 to give us the flexibility that we believe is needed to appoint what is appropriate to the events under investigation. As the noble Lord, Lord Laming, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton, said, very eloquently and vividly in describing their own experiences, in certain circumstances it may be best to appoint a single chairman, notwithstanding what was said in the evidence of the Council on Tribunals about the four points mentioned by the noble and learned Lord, Lord   Howe: effectiveness, fairness, speed and economy. Indeed, to address those very points it might be appropriate to have a single chairman operating with experts and assessors to facilitate an outcome with economy, speed, effectiveness and fairness. We believe that it is right to have the flexibility so that a Minister would be able to come forward with a proposal best fitting the circumstances around the event&#151;which may be a tragic event.
</p>

<a name="50118-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, referred to Clauses 7 and 8, which require the Minister to consider the balance, expertise and impartiality needed to undertake the inquiry. Whether the Minister chooses to have a panel or appoint a chairman to sit alone, he is obliged by Clause 7 to ensure that the skills and expertise are available to undertake the inquiry. That might be enabled by providing assessors to assist in the course of the work. That is set down in detail in Clause 10.
</p>

<a name="50118-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a>I agree with the principle behind Amendment No. 4, but my submission is that we do not need it to achieve what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, seeks to do, as it is already implicit in the obligations stated in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC221"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC221</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Clause 7. The Minister must have regard to the consideration of that clause when deciding how many members to appoint and who they should be.
</p>

<a name="50118-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a>In Amendment No. 6, the noble and learned Lord rightly highlights the need for &quot;special attention&quot; to the potential assistance that assessors provide to a lone chairman. I agree that that can be very important. But, again, Clauses 7 and 10 already ensure that due attention will be given to the point. There is no point of disagreement between us, but I contend that the provision is already covered in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="50118-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a>As the noble and learned Lord said, the role of an assessor will vary depending upon the needs of the panel and the subject matter of the inquiry. However, an assessor does not have any formal powers, nor does he share responsibility for deciding what will go into the inquiry&#039;s report. So the Minister would not take assessors into account when considering the balance of the panel, if a panel were chosen in relation to the terms of reference. If the Minister appoints a lone chairman then, under Clause 8, he must be satisfied that the chairman meets the requirements; he cannot meet the requirement for balance by appointing assessors. That is very important. Assessors are there to give necessary skills and experience, and if the chairman needs additional expertise, he can acquire it by appointing assessors.
</p>

<a name="50118-44_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a>Notwithstanding what the noble and learned Lord and other noble Lords have said, there is an issue about the presumption, to which the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, alluded. Three might be better than one, but so might four or five; there is an issue about the presumptions that are made when inquiries are set up, and the implications that might lead on from them.

</p>

<a name="50118-44_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a>We have had outstanding contributions, not least from the noble and learned Lords, Lord Hutton and Lord Cullen, Dame Janet Smith and the noble Lord, Lord Laming&#151;not all of whom are lawyers&#151;with regard to sitting alone to conduct inquiries. I believe that they demonstrate that in the correct circumstances a single chairman, appropriately supported, can run a very effective inquiry. My nervousness about the presumption comes from the fact that if you move away from that presumption, you risk public confidence&#151;and public confidence in inquiries is crucial. It is perhaps the biggest driver of an inquiry, and it is certainly not something that we would wish to see damaged in any way, particularly at the outset. Quite often inquiries are born of tragedies and of very difficult circumstances, particularly for the individuals who may have been directly or indirectly affected. It is very important that those people, along with the general public, feel that they can trust the inquiry and feel confident about what it will do.
</p>

<a name="50118-44_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a>I appreciate what noble Lords are seeking to achieve, but if one has a presumption, to move away from that presumption would run the risk of giving the impression that the inquiry was a lesser one. It is also an issue if one considers only inquiries with a judicial element to them; many inquiries are not conducted by senior lawyers or judges. I take the point about the value of using eminent legal professionals in that context&#151;but not always, would be my view. To have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC222"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC222</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

any presumption is to move away from the principles of this Bill, which says that it is best to appoint the right person or persons to achieve the objectives. I bear in mind the 1996 Council on Tribunals objectives when making that point.

</p>

<a name="50118-44_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a>It is for that reason that I would not move in the direction that has been proposed. I believe that the   points made by noble Lords when speaking to the amendments are fully covered in the Bill, and I ask the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="50118-44_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Howe of Aberavon: </b>   Before pronouncing my verdict on that invitation, and encouraging the Minister towards rather more mobility in the language that finally finds its place in the Bill, I should like to express my deep respect for the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton. That respect is in no way diminished by the fact that I have had to make comments on the conduct of his inquiry.
</p>

<a name="50118-44_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a>I wish to amplify one of the points that the noble and learned Lord made, which in turn amplifies the case that we seek to make. I refer to his comment on the changing character of the media. The reactions that one expects to the publication of reports of the kind that he conducted with such meticulous care and integrity&#151;and which he has been good enough to explain to us&#151;are becoming less and less predictable and more and more likely to jeopardise the very institutions that we are here trying to enhance and stabilise.
</p>

<a name="50118-44_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a>In Second Reading, I gave an example of the way in which the local press in Cardiff totally misrepresented what we tried to do. In shaping our judgments on the many individuals involved, we took great care to formulate them with restraint&#151;we had to criticise some. But that care was not reflected in the press coverage at all. The leading articles took us seriously and were sensible, but the headlines did exactly the opposite, and the hospital was called &quot;the horror hospital&quot;. Pictures of barbed wire on the wall appeared in the local press, and local bus crews were persuaded not to allow people working at the hospital to get on their buses. That is what happened 30 or 40 years ago&#151;so long ago that I can hardly remember.

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a>In that light, I can quite understand the unpredictability of the storm that greeted the publication of the noble and learned Lord&#039;s report. However meticulously he endeavoured to address the questions in the rational pattern set out, as he explained, did he not deserve the protection, support and wisdom that might or might not have influenced decisions that he took&#151;the support of the public knowing that he was not alone in his task? I used the word &quot;protection&quot;, but that is a very condescending or patronising way in which to put it. But all such inquiries are exposed to such hazards now, and we need to reflect how often we will be able to get a man or woman to take an inquiry on single-handedly. He or she might want the buttresses that I have described.
</p>

<a name="50118-44_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a>I turn to the last question, to which the noble and learned Lord referred, and the wisdom of responding to the dripfeed or non-dripfeed question and the handling of the media in the context of the question. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC223"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC223</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

I am reminded of a quite different episode, that of the Westland inquiry, in our time in government. The trigger that set that off was a decision, for which the responsibility has never really been made clear, to leak to the press a letter of advice from either the Solicitor-General or the Attorney-General. The whole hubbub developed around the question of handling the media. Was it Leon Brittan, was it Colette Bowe or was it Bernard Ingham&#151;who was it? That question was at the heart of the storm that then broke. Perhaps that is the kind of factor that was not as vividly present in the noble and learned Lord&#039;s mind then as I am sure that it is now.
</p>

<a name="50118-44_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a>Without any condescension whatever I respond with utmost sympathy to the points that the noble and learned Lord made. But I still believe that the wise reaction to his experience&#151;and this is a very arrogant thing to say&#151;is to hearken to the advice that we offer to the Minister. About the form of words that the amendment takes, I am more modest than my noble friend Lord Kingsland. He proclaims that the presumption proposition is right; I am not quite happy about that, but I want the Government to consider very seriously the need to think in that direction and along those lines.
</p>

<a name="50118-44_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>I understand the good faith with which the Minister advances her arguments, but we are in dangerous country. We want to see the concept of the inquiry properly founded, with as many resources as possible, and so established that it diminishes the hazards that had such an impact on the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hutton. I hope that the Minister will accept that my response to her invitation to withdraw the amendment is one founded on my immense optimism about the wisdom of her later reply. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="50118-45_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart </b>   moved Amendment No. 7:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a>Page 2, line 6, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_1"></a><br>
&quot;(   )   An inquiry panel is a public authority for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (c. 36).&quot;

<p><a name="st_43"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 7, I shall with the leave of the Committee speak also to Amendments Nos. 33, 54, 58 and 59. This group of amendments is designed to bring inquiries under the Bill into the net of the Freedom of Information Act   2000. We believe that information acquired by an inquiry should be subject to the freedom of information regime. That cannot be so at present because Section 32 gives absolute exemption to information obtained for the purposes of court proceedings, arbitration or inquiries. Subsection (2) states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;Information held by a public authority is exempt information if it is held only by virtue of being contained in</p>
</ul>
<p>




</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>a) any document placed in the custody of a person conducting an inquiry or arbitration, for the purposes of the inquiry or arbitration, or,</p>
</ul>
<p>


<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC224"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC224</b><br>&nbsp;<br>



</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a>b) any document created by a person conducting an inquiry or arbitration, for the purposes of the inquiry or arbitration&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-45_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a>I can see justification for the exemption provided by Section 32 for court proceedings and, indeed, for arbitration, as referred to in subsection (2). After all, litigants are justifiably entitled to privacy for documents that have not been disclosed in open court. But an inquiry is an entirely different situation. The whole purpose of the inquiry is the investigation of matters of public concern. It follows from that that the public should have right of access, in principle, to information that comes into the possession of the inquiry panel. It would be inappropriate, in principle, to keep that information secret. Refusing a right of access is, in effect, saying, &quot;We have been investigating your concerns, but we can&#039;t tell you what we have found out about it&quot;.
</p>

<a name="50118-45_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>Of course, a right of access under the Freedom of Information Act would be subject to the exemptions contained in that Act, which would, I believe, give adequate protection when there is a public interest in seeing that that information is not disclosed. There are grounds, for instance, for refusing disclosure on issues such as the danger of harm to national security, to defence, to the economy, to law enforcement and the risk of damage to the health of an individual. There is an exemption for personal data and for damage to commercial interests.
<a name="time_8"></a>
<a name="50118-45_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50118-45_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>Most of those exemptions are conditional, not absolute, and therefore someone who applies for the information and has the application refused can go to the Information Commissioner for an order that the information should be disclosed because the public interest in disclosure is not outweighed by the public interest in maintaining the exemption. I see no good reason why, for example, journalists should not see all the information in the possession of the inquiry panel unless that information is covered by one of the exemptions provided by the Freedom of Information Act. There is a good reason why the media should have access, because public concern is not allayed if the public believe that the inquiry is keeping relevant information back.
</p>

<a name="50118-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>Two amendments in the group are needed to bring the inquiry within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act. Amendment No. 7 provides for the inquiry panel to be a public authority for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act. Of course, the Act applies only to public authorities. Amendment No. 59 removes inquiries from the scope of the absolute exemption in Section 32, the relevant part of which I have already read out.
</p>

<a name="50118-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>We then have to deal with the interaction between the Freedom of Information Act and the other provisions of the Bill. The first amendment which deals with that is Amendment No. 33. That is an amendment to Clause 17. Subsection (1)(a) authorises the imposition of the restriction on attendance at an inquiry. That does not engage the Freedom of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC225"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC225</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Information Act, so I will not look at that any further. However, Clause 17(1)(b) does overlap the Freedom of Information Act because it states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a>&quot;Restrictions may, in accordance with this section, be imposed on  . . . disclosure or publication of any evidence or documents given, produced or provided to an inquiry&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-45_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>Subsections (3) to (5) impose limits on restriction orders or notices.
</p>

<a name="50118-45_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>What is provided there is similar to some of the exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act. Crucially, if restrictions are imposed under Clause 17, there is no recourse to the Information Commission. The decision of the Minister or chairman to impose restrictions would be subject to judicial review, but in those cases it would be necessary for it to be shown that the decision of the Minister or the chairman was irrational and it would be a far harder test than would be the case if it went to the Information Commissioner.

</p>

<a name="50118-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>I therefore believe that a restriction notice or order should not override the Freedom of Information Act. Where disclosure of evidence is subject to a restriction order or notice, a member of the public should be able to challenge the operation of that order or notice by using the procedures under the Freedom of Information Act. That gives the final decision on disclosure to an independent person&#151;the Information Commissioner&#151;subject to appeal to the tribunal and ultimately to the ministerial override.
</p>

<a name="50118-45_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>Amendment No. 58 applies the Freedom of Information Act to the withholding of material from the report. It provides, first, that material in the report can be withheld only if it is material which is covered by an exemption under the Freedom of Information Act. The decision to withhold that information can then be challenged under the Freedom of Information Act procedure.
</p>

<a name="50118-45_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>We believe that it is wrong for the Bill to set up a separate system for the imposition of restrictions and for the withholding of part of the report.
</p>

<a name="50118-45_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>We have a Freedom of Information Act which has been in force since 1 January this year. It is plainly appropriate that we would use it and therefore I hope that the Government will accept that the provisions of this Bill should be brought into line with it. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="50118-45_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for explaining so concisely the purpose behind the amendment. I declare my interest because I am responsible for the Freedom of Information Act within the department and have long looked forward to it arriving. I believe it is a most important piece of legislation that will lead to better government.

</p>

<a name="50118-45_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, the authorities under the Inquiries Bill are not public authorities. The information they hold while the inquiry is in progress is therefore not required to be released under that legislation. Members of the Committee will know that the Freedom of Information Act covers information held by government departments or the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC226"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC226</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

other 100,000 public authorities. That information supplied as evidence to the inquiry in the form of copies is covered because it is held by bodies subject to the Act.
</p>

<a name="50118-45_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>However, the Act does not extend to information supplied to the inquiry by bodies that are not public authorities&#151;private individuals&#151;or to the internal documents which are created by the inquiry panel during the course of its deliberations. That is the position in the Bill.

</p>

<a name="50118-45_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>I am interested in what the noble Lord, Lord   Goodhart, is saying about why inquiries ought to be covered by the Freedom of Information Act and I shall certainly think carefully about that. However, I want to raise a number of issues that concern me in the amendments tabled and where I would need quite a bit of convincing that it would be the right approach. It might inform the debates that we shall continue to have on the subject.
</p>

<a name="50118-45_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>Members of the Committee know that an inquiry is usually of a serious nature where the public may well have lost confidence in a vital public service and there is a real fear that such a situation could arise again. These inquiries are therefore set up with a strong public interest to see the problem investigated as fully as possible and often as quickly as possible.

</p>

<a name="50118-45_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>The way an inquiry works is gathering its evidence, assessing it, reaching its conclusions and publishing its report. I submit that the right time for the relevant information to be made public is at the end of an inquiry presented in a full and coherent way, with all the appropriate analysis in the report. I would be worried about a situation in which people can request parts of an inquiry&#039;s evidence and analysis prematurely while the inquiry is ongoing.
</p>

<a name="50118-45_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>Of course the panel will want to look at all the evidence and explore all the possibilities, and if parts of the material are disclosed in a piecemeal fashion, we enter the debate raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, about the role of the media if that were to happen. Presenting the evidence in a piecemeal rather than a coherent way at the end of the inquiry runs the risk of significantly weakening public acceptance of and confidence in an inquiry&#039;s findings, as well as potentially distracting the inquiry from its work while it has to rush off and chase what is happening.
</p>

<a name="50118-45_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a>The noble Lord raised the question of journalists having a right of access. There is within Clause 17(6) the provision that, subject to any restrictions, the chairman must give public access to all hearings and evidence. I do not therefore suggest that we are trying to restrict the access of the public, except in the exemptions we discuss, but I am concerned about information released in dribs and drabs. Indeed, a section of the Freedom of Information Act provides that if a department is about to publish something in the course of its normal publications, it should not be required to bring forward parts of that under the Bill. Although that is not covered by the Bill, the same analysis applies. I am therefore a little worried about the suggestion and would want to explore the issues around it.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC227"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC227</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-45_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a>I am concerned, too, about Amendment No. 33 and the impact it could have on the candour of some witnesses. Members of the Committee recognise that some inquiries are held in private because there is the opportunity to achieve better, fuller and franker testimony. The Royal Liverpool Children&#039;s Hospital inquiry, with the groups who represented the people affected by those events, requested the private format because it believed that it would make the inquiry work better. That request was acceded to.
</p>

<a name="50118-45_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a>Inquiries, by their investigative nature, rely very much on people volunteering evidence. Of course they have the powers to ensure that witnesses speak truthfully and provide particular information, but I wonder whether they would be less effective if there were a deterrent to witnesses volunteering information and opinions.
</p>

<a name="50118-45_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a>As I said, the Freedom of Information Act has exemptions to protect sensitive information. However, I am not sure that every witness appearing before an inquiry would know the detail of those exemptions. It might lead to inhibitions, and I would want to consider that carefully as we debate the issues. Perhaps the noble Lord might reflect on those points.
</p>

<a name="50118-45_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a>Amendments Nos. 54 and 58 seem to present an interesting suggestion. However, it is unlikely that either an inquiry chairman or a Minister would attempt to withhold information that a member of the public would have the right to request under the Freedom of Information Act. The power to withhold information from an inquiry is restricted. It allows a person under the Bill to withhold material if required to do so by law, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, in the public interest; because it would cause harm or damage; or because it was acquired on a confidential basis. I believe that that would mean small redactions of particular pieces of information.
</p>

<a name="50118-45_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a>However, I understand what the noble Lord is saying and the concern that powers could be abused. I can see that a provision along the lines proposed in those two amendments might offer some reassurance. I ask him to allow me to give further thought to how that might work and to discuss the matter with colleagues. According to the drafting of the Bill, the chairman is not a public authority for the purposes of the Act, but the sponsoring department is. I will take away the idea in those two amendments. I hope that in the light of my concerns on the earlier amendments, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, will reflect on them and perhaps we can discuss them beyond the Committee. I recognise the importance of the other two amendments, and I am willing to take them away and consult with the noble Lord before coming forward with any ideas. I hope that on that basis the noble Lord will withdraw his amendments.

<a name="50118-46_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I am grateful to the Minister for giving a sympathetic reply, if not one which concedes the amendments that I tabled. It does not satisfy all my concerns by any means. I agree that it would not be satisfactory to allow evidence to be looked at in drips and drabs in the lead-up to the publication of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

inquiry. Indeed, it is likely that such information would be covered by Section 22 of the Freedom of Information Act.

</p>

<a name="50118-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a>However, I am concerned that information which   would be disclosable under the Freedom of Information Act if it is applied would remain subject to restrictions after the publication of the report. A restriction notice or order under Clause 17 does not come to an end when the report is published. Indeed, it continues for a period of 30 years following the date on which the inquiry comes to an end, under Clause 18(6). There is a strong case for saying that information, which is not contained in the report but may be part of the background, should be subject to publication at that point.
<a name="time_9"></a>
<a name="50118-46_time0"></a><h5></h5>

</p>

<a name="50118-46_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a>I accept that there are problems with people wishing to give information in confidence, for instance, which is personal to them. Again, that would be covered by the exemptions. For instance, personal information is covered by the exemption under Section 40. In those circumstances, I cannot see that any adverse consequences are likely to follow. One cannot rely on the ignorance of the people who are asked to supply information, who are in fact adequately protected, as being grounds for saying that information generally should not be subject to the Freedom of Information Act.
</p>

<a name="50118-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a>In those circumstances, I wait with interest to hear further from the Minister. This is an important issue, which, in some ways, is the most important raised by all the amendments. Unless we are able to reach satisfactory agreement here, I am likely to raise it again on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_47"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 8 would ensure that the Minister consults the chairman before appointing anyone else to the inquiry panel. Amendment No. 16, also in my name, makes it obligatory for the Minister to consult the chairman on any further appointments under Clause 6.
</p>

<a name="50118-46_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a>As I understand it, the amendment tabled by the Liberal Democrats proposes that the Minister must consult with any outside bodies or persons that he considers appropriate before appointing anyone else to the panel. The issues here are both obvious and straightforward, dare I say it. The chairman needs to have full confidence in the panel, and therefore it must follow that he should have the opportunity to express any reservations that he has about the other members who the Minister proposes to appoint.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="50118-46_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a>Equally, it is right that a duty to consult before making appointments should be imposed on the Minister, because this would give the public more confidence in the members of the panel who are conducting the inquiry. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_48"></a>
<a name="50118-46_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Laming: </b>   In his opening comments, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, referred to his concerns about the shift of power from the chairmen to Ministers. It seems to me that Amendments Nos. 8 and 16 address those concerns in an important way. I support both those amendments because it is important that the chairman of an inquiry is seen to be responsible for the conduct of the inquiry in every respect. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, earlier referred to the collegiate approach. It is important that there is a genuine sense of teamwork between the chairman and any assessors that sit with him. It is important that the chairman is seen to be in control of the inquiry. I support Amendments Nos. 8 and 16.
</p>




<p><a name="st_49"></a>
<a name="50118-46_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   I wonder whether the noble Lord, Lord   Smith, wishes to intervene, since his amendment is grouped with this one.

<a name="50118-46_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Smith of Clifton: </b>   I thank the noble Lord for that prompting. I was just looking at my notes. Amendment No. 9 is really to ensure, in a belt and braces way, that the Minister will take due endeavours to see that he takes appropriate advice in setting up an inquiry.
</p>




<p><a name="st_51"></a>
<a name="50118-46_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   I strongly support the basis of what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said, in suggesting that it is most important that if there are wingmen, the chairman should have the fullest confidence in those wingmen. It would be most inappropriate and most unwise for the Minister to appoint as members of the panel someone who was not fully approved by the chairman. Consultation would be appropriate.
</p>

<a name="50118-46_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a>In a legalistic way&#151;but as the noble Lord is a well-known lawyer, he will not mind me putting it this way&#151;I wonder that in Clause 3(2) it says:

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a>&quot;References  . . . to an inquiry panel are to the chairman and any other members of the panel&quot;.</p>

<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-46_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a>One might read his amendment to Clause 4 as suggesting that the Minister must consult the chairman before appointing the chairman. That seems a bit of a nonsense, but I wonder whether the drafting is correct. I am not at all in favour of Amendment No.   9, if only because of the time factor, which several of your Lordships have mentioned in relation to inquiries in the past, and the great need for a rapid appointment. It may be that in the case of&#151;let me use the example of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe,&#151;the Widgery Committee, in the original inquiry into Bloody Sunday, was almost too rapidly appointed. None the less, there is a need for speed, and speed was one of the four points quoted by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, put by the report of the Council on Tribunals in 1996. Some speed in appointment and speed in dealing with the inquiry is of some importance, but not all-important.

The number of people who may feel themselves to be appropriate to be consulted may be different to the number who the Minister or the chairman feel appropriate to be consulted.

<a name="50118-46_spnew8"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I, too, would have raised with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, the slight difficulty in the technical language that would have led to that problem in his amendment. Anyone who thinks that the eloquence with which the case is put does not affect Ministers has only to look at my notes, which have changed from &quot;resist&quot; to &quot;consider&quot; in the course of the past three or four minutes.
</p>

<a name="50118-46_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a>I appreciate the sentiment behind the amendment. It is my belief that in practice consultation would take place between the Minister and the chairman. In reality, in any practical situation when an inquiry is beginning, the chairman has the option of walking away from his task if he is not content with who else might be panel members if he does not feel that they can contribute in the right way, or if he is not content with any proposals to appoint further panel members under Clause 5(1)(b)(ii). If noble Lords feel that this should be said more clearly, I am happy to give it some consideration and to change what I was going to say on that basis. I cannot accept the amendment, because as the noble Lord recognised, it is technically incorrect anyway. I need to go back and consult on that to make sure that my initial view is held by others.
</p>

<a name="50118-46_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a>I agree with the noble Lords, Lord Borrie and Lord   Laming, about the issue around Amendment No. 9. It is sensible to understand and expect that there will be consultation where Ministers feel there are people who should be consulted, but requiring <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC231"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column GC231</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

someone to consult does not necessarily ensure that those consulted will be at all satisfied with who is chosen. The purpose of an inquiry is to restore public confidence and in a sense to serve the interests of the public rather that the interests of particular groups or individuals, however important and personal the issues that have been raised by the need for the inquiry are. We should not lose sight of that wider public interest in what we do.
</p>

<a name="50118-46_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a>There is the potential, possibly, for judicial review, as the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said. More arguably, the experience of those who have chaired inquiries, and Ministers who have been involved in them, has been that there can be a clamour from all sorts of organisations which believe that they should be consulted. I want to be cautious about putting that in the Bill for that reason. That does not in any way denigrate the sentiment behind the amendment, which is a desire to see that there is consultation. We would expect it, but in an appropriate manner. For the reasons that I have outlined, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, tabled an amendment that is somewhat stronger than ours because it requires not only consultation with the chairman but also his or her consent. That seems to us an acceptable alternative. In practice, of course, no chairman is likely to proceed with an inquiry unless he or she is happy with the terms of reference which they are asked to undertake. It seems a useful alternative to put on the face of the Bill. One or other of these amendments would be welcome. I beg to move.

On mature reflection, the noble Lord is right and I am wrong. My amendment would give the chairman a power which I think in the circumstances is inappropriate. Therefore, unabashed, I might add, I shall withdraw the amendment and put all my weight, such as it is, behind the noble Lord.
</p>




<p><a name="st_60"></a>
<a name="50118-47_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Laming: </b>   I support the first part of Amendment No. 10, but I invite the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, to bear in mind the comments that have just been made about consulting bodies. I do not disagree with the principle, but I am concerned about the practice and the difficulties that it could lead to. It is absolutely essential that the chairman should be consulted about the terms of reference.
</p>




<p><a name="st_61"></a>
<a name="50118-47_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   It is interesting to have amendments withdrawn as we speak. I had a very nice line about the noble Lord&#039;s amendment which I shall have to leave for another day.
</p>

<a name="50118-47_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>As the noble Lord indicated, the joined-up amendment, if I may describe it as such, seeks to ensure that the Minister consults the chairman, and any others he considers appropriate. The noble Lord, Lord   Laming, has already raised the question that we dealt with on the previous group of amendments concerning the openness of that, and those who have expectations that cannot be met.
</p>

<a name="50118-47_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>No clause within the Bill specifically precludes the Minister from having any prior discussions with the chairman or with any other interested parties before setting up the terms of reference. It is my view that in practice the Minister will consult the chairman, because no chairman will accept the job unless he or she is happy with the proposed terms of reference and with other aspects of how the inquiry is to be conducted. All noble Lords who have spoken from personal experience of inquiries know that the task of chairing an inquiry is an onerous one, not one to be undertaken lightly and for which there is not usually a rush of volunteers. I suspect that some noble Lords would never chair an inquiry again due to the workload that is involved.

case for a period of time before announcing an inquiry and the name of its chairman and settling the terms of reference, and during this period some consultation on draft terms of reference might be appropriate. That view was supported in responses and, indeed, we have reflected that in the way in which we have structured Clauses 4 and 5. We anticipate, therefore, that there will be opportunities for the Minister and the chairman to discuss the terms of reference and, as I have already indicated, for the Minister to talk to others where appropriate to discuss what the terms of reference might be.
</p>

<a name="50118-47_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>I again go back to what I said earlier; that is, the purpose of an inquiry is to serve the public interest. The terms of reference must reflect that and must be concerned with restoring public confidence, if that is an essential part of what the inquiry is meant to do. I am worried that this provision might create an expectation among those directly affected that an inquiry would be conducted in a way that would serve their purposes. Valid though they might be for them, I am not entirely sure that they would be valid for the inquiry. That is why I am not keen to accept this amendment. I am concerned that we position the role of the chairman and the role of the Minister appropriately.
</p>

<a name="50118-47_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>As regards the consent sought by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, I am concerned that would put the onus on the chairman, who needs to be protected, as it were, from those who might approach him regarding the terms of reference. He would be protected from such approaches if the terms of reference were already set and must be followed. That is an important matter and one that we shall discuss when we consider variation regarding terms of reference. We believe that Clauses 4 and 5 provide an appropriate period of time to enable consultation to take place. However, I am not keen to include the provision on the face of the Bill for the reasons that I have indicated. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.

inquiries will very rarely be set up under that Act. The setting up of an inquiry will generally therefore be an executive act. That is understandable. However, if the Government are using powers under this Bill, the relevant Minister should keep Parliament informed of what he or she is doing. Amendment No. 11 would achieve this by requiring the terms of reference to be laid before Parliament. The amendment goes no further than that; they do not have to be approved.
</p>

<a name="50118-47_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>Amendment No. 15, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, goes further. It would require approval of terms of reference by Parliament. I have not yet heard the noble Lord speak to that amendment, but I am less than entirely sympathetic. We support the retention of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act for exceptional cases, but requiring parliamentary approval of all inquiries under this Bill would be likely to mean that Ministers would set up non-statutory inquiries whenever possible. That is not a good idea. I beg to move.

We are very clear that it is for Ministers to be responsible for setting up inquiries, because they are responsible for ensuring that any situation that necessitates such an inquiry is thoroughly investigated and that any possibility of a recurrence of such an event is prevented, if that is what we seek to do. They must be responsible for deciding the terms of reference. That is why I would not have supported the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. Ministers are accountable to Parliament for the decision, which brings in the question of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart.
</p>

<a name="50118-48_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>I recognise the concern about the lack of parliamentary involvement in the establishment of inquiries, and I have already promised that I will look at that. What the noble Lord said had a great deal of merit. It has been the practice, for many years and many past inquiries, that Ministers make statements to Parliament doing just that. I will take the specific proposal away and think more fully about it. I am very interested in whether it would allay the concerns about making sure that Parliament played a role.
</p>

<a name="50118-48_para1"></a>

Parliament could be in recess when something happens and there is the question of moving to an inquiry. Any provision would have to be framed in a way to accept that as a fact.

<p><a name="st_70"></a>The noble Lord said: I am sorry to come back yet again. The amendment is designed to simplify procedure. The Bill makes no provision for altering the terms of reference after an inquiry has been set up. Investigations will often disclose, after an inquiry panel has started its work, that the original terms of reference are not wide enough, and that it is apparent that new matters need to be looked at. When I raised the matter earlier, we were told by the Minister that an inquiry could in those circumstances be terminated and restarted as a new inquiry with new terms of reference. That seems to be a wholly unnecessarily clumsy way of dealing with what should be a simple matter. If the Minister and the panel agree that the terms of reference need changing, they should be able to change them without having to go through the process of terminating one inquiry, serving notice of termination and so forth and starting up a new one. Of course, the system should need the agreement of both the Minister and the panel. The panel should certainly not be able to force new terms on the Minister or the Minister force new terms on the panel.

<a name="50118-48_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   Substantially, our Amendment No.   14 mirrors that of Amendment No. 13 moved by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, so once again, I find myself broadly <i>ad idem</i> with the noble Lord.

<a name="column_GC236"></a>

and his relates to the question of new evidence. Where there is no new evidence, I doubt that it would be appropriate to permit a change in the terms of reference. If the terms of reference were changed in the middle of an inquiry, just because the Minister had an afterthought, that would prejudice the whole way in which the earlier part of the inquiry was undertaken. It might lead to individuals who had originally not chosen to give evidence then clamouring to give evidence on matters that had already been heard.
</p>

<a name="50118-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a>Therefore, I would be reluctant to allow the provision to be triggered unless something fresh and unforeseeable came to light at the beginning of the inquiry. Having said that, I agree entirely with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that the solution furnished by the Bill seems to be &quot;unduly bureaucratic&quot;. In my submission, the approach of the draft moved by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and our draft get the balance about right between the role of the chairman, the role of the Minister and the degree of flexibility that ought to be built into the Bill.

<a name="50118-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a>Thirdly, surely it is wrong, if there is a panel of three, that the chairman and the Minister can agree to alter the terms of reference in spite of the two wingmen? Surely, the panel must agree, not the two wingmen? Finally, surely this is not only relevant if new evidence emerges. Suppose a new issue emerges? Suppose that one of the participants early on raises a totally different issue on the evidence, perhaps of bad faith or something, which requires consideration. Surely the terms of reference must be changeable then, not merely when there is new factual evidence which has emerged?

<a name="50118-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>Having said that, it is enormously preferable to have this power in the Bill rather than have this ridiculous farce of scrapping the inquiry and starting again. Nobody in the public could possibly understand that because they would think that somehow the thing had been shut. It might mean that some difficult party insisted that the thing was started again from scratch and that all the evidence that had been heard was re-heard.

<a name="50118-48_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Neill of Bladen: </b>   I make one observation and utter a word of warning.

If we create this power and put it in the Bill, which I <br>&nbsp;<br>

support, Committee Members should be aware that we are creating a political football. We are opening the door to the pressures that have been media pressures in the past turning into pressures applied to the Government, the Minister and so forth. That is a quite likely&#151;indeed, almost certain&#151;consequence if there are half a dozen future inquiries using a Bill amended in this form.
</p>

<a name="50118-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>I am not saying that I am against the Bill: it is absurd to have to cancel the inquiry and set up a second one and then consolidate&#151;that would be ridiculous. The power should be there.
</p>

<a name="50118-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>On the other point, I entirely agree with the Committee Members who have already spoken. If we are going to have this power it should be wide open and not limited to new evidence. Those who have had experience of litigation and trying to persuade a Court of Appeal that something is or is not new evidence will know that one gets into great difficulties if fetters are imposed on a power. It is much better to leave it wide open as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, proposed.

<a name="50118-48_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Borrie: </b>   I had in mind to make a somewhat similar point to that made by the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladon, but with a different conclusion. Yes, indeed, a provision of this sort may well encourage a &quot;clamour&quot; and frequently a clamour that would rightly be opposed by the Government. However, it could cause great difficulty. When people can point to a power in the Bill to alter the terms of reference at any time, that power surely must be exercised because of this reason or that reason. What has been suggested as a silly or damaging thing&#151;for the Government actually to close down an inquiry and start another one&#151;could have merit. It would be done only in the rarest circumstances and that may be the right thing. Otherwise, with a provision of this sort, a clamour could result in a change in the terms of reference, which could happen frequently at more or less every inquiry.

<a name="50118-49_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I find this debate extremely interesting, but I am not persuaded at all. At Second Reading I undertook to obtain advice from officials concerning whether closing down and restarting an inquiry would be a cumbersome process. It could be done in a matter of hours. There would be no reason to rehear evidence if an inquiry was continuing along the same path. Therefore, some of the objections that have been made about the bureaucracy involved fall away.
</p>

<a name="50118-49_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>What is really important is that one should not underestimate the importance of the step that has been taken in order to move the terms of reference. The terms of reference are not based on evidence. There is no evidence at the beginning of an inquiry. An event or events have taken place and the terms of reference are determined around those events. If there is substantial change in the information that comes forward, I submit that that means that it is a different inquiry.

What gives certainty in the public mind and what is in the public interest is being absolutely clear about what an inquiry sets out do and then seeing that the inquiry has achieved that. The noble and learned Lord, Lord   Howe, described the role of the media. The media do not necessarily like the outcome from the terms of reference, but none the less, there is great clarity in understanding what the inquiry was set up to do.

Any change should be considered only in serious circumstances. At best it could create confusion. At worst, it could encourage changes to be made that may be inappropriate.
</p>

<a name="50118-49_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>We have set out to be very clear that the terms of reference are set, taking on board what we have said about the consultation with chairmen and others who might appropriately be consulted, and what I have said about previous amendments. It must be clear what the inquiry seeks to do and if&#151;and only if&#151;it is clear that those terms of reference are inappropriate, there is a definite step. That step is non-bureaucratic and does not require a lengthy time&#151;such a change could be made in an evening and there would be no loss of sitting days. However, it is none the less a very important step that should not be treated with anything other than gravity. Because the process is not bureaucratic and because it is a brave thing to do, I hope that Committee Members will see that what we have created is the right way forward in this particular case and withdraw the amendment.

<a name="50118-49_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   I am disappointed by that response, which is illogical. Of course, I take the point about the clamour for changing the terms of reference. No doubt that would happen, but I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladon, that that is not a reason for not inserting the power to alter the terms of reference. Clamour is something that governments have to put up with and learn to live with. If it is as easy and straightforward as the Minister says to terminate an inquiry and substitute a new one with different terms of reference there will be just as much clamour.

And on what basis should a Minister make up his mind as to whether the interest or association might prove prejudicial? It is as simple as that. I beg to move.

It must be self-evident law that, if you are to appoint someone to chair such a tribunal or inquiry, he will be impartial. In recent times in the courts, we have had repeated instances of such eminent lawyers and judges as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, spelling out exactly the circumstances in which a person should recognise whether he has a conflict of interests or his impartiality is in any way to be impugned.
</p>

<a name="50118-49_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a>I do not object to any part of the clause, but my concern is that it seems only a partial attempt at codification of the law. It is most interesting to see that one provision is not included. I understood the noble <br>&nbsp;<br>

and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, to be making the very good point that there might be circumstances in which people should not disqualify themselves from taking part of an inquiry because someone had alleged that there was an interest on their part. It has to be substantial. If I recollect accurately, he said something to the effect that it is as much a breach of your public duty to withdraw too readily when objection is made as it would be to carry on when it is quite obvious that there is something partial in the way you approached a matter.
</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a>The Minister may know the person that he is appointing so well that he is totally confident that he will not influence his decision&#151;but surely he must, under common law, take into account the fact that in the eyes of many of the public, who do not have that close acquaintance with the nominee in question, it will seem highly likely to influence his decision. Surely the clause must go and be replaced by the position under common law.

As the clause stands, it more or less says that it is all right to be partial so long as you are only a little bit partial. I know that an inquiry is not strictly a court, but the same standards of independence and impartiality are appropriate as would be under Article 6 in the case of court proceedings.

</p>

<a name="50118-50_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a>I am conscious of not being a lawyer in dealing with some eminent lawyers in terms of the codification of what is in the common law.

that we have is appropriate. The rationale for putting in what we have done is that we think that the issues are critical in the view of the public; namely, that it is very important in terms of the theme that I have tried to expound about public confidence and that people believe that those conducting the inquiry will do so without a vested interest in it.
</p>

<a name="50118-50_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a>By &quot;a close association&quot;, we mean links that would be likely to cause concerns or&#151;to deal with the issue of public concern&#151;that people would feel were strong. It might be involvement, however vague, in a company being investigated, and so on. I am sure that Members of the Committee would recognise that. &quot;A direct interest&quot; is having been involved in specific events.

</p>

<a name="50118-50_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a>I differ slightly from the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, on the idea of a bit of an interest. One has only to look at the health service, where one may put together a panel of inquiry to examine a question about the work of a major hospital trust. Having someone who knows the hospital well&#151;perhaps an eminent surgeon or someone who was involved in the trust some years ago&#151;may be of relevance. In some areas of public life, people know each other. In the law, there are sometimes allegations that it is because of X knowing Y that such a person has been appointed to such a position.

<a name="50118-50_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Neill of Bladen: </b>   Before the noble Baroness concludes her observations, as she talked about public perception perhaps she will take away the thought that subsection (4) puts the matter on a different basis from subsection (1), because:

<p>


</p>

<a name="50118-50_para3"></a>

<a name="50118-50_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for that observation. The point that I seek to make is that we will take away the comments about codification and the common law. I hope that Members of the Committee understand why we are where we are on the specific importance. However, when one is looking for expertise and experience, as long as one recognises the connection and can see that it would not influence in an adverse way, there can be public confidence in someone who still has a connection. One would not wish to rule that out completely, because one would not get the result in terms of a positive inquiry that one would wish.

<p><a name="st_91"></a>The noble Lord said: The effect of this amendment is to require the consent of the senior Law Lord to the appointment of a Law Lord to conduct an inquiry and   the consent of the Lord Chief Justice to the appointment of a judge of the Court of Appeal or the High Court or a circuit judge to conduct an inquiry. There are corresponding provisions relating to Scotland and Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="50118-50_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>The Bill as drafted requires only consultation, not consent. The amendment would meet concerns which have been expressed by the Lord Chief Justice and which I believe are reasonable. Only a limited number of judges is available for judicial work. Inquiries can be extremely demanding and long-lasting. I have in mind particularly the Bloody Sunday inquiry, which has resulted in the removal of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Saville of Newdigate, who is undoubtedly one of our ablest judges, from the membership of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords for years. The Lord Chief Justice is of course responsible for judicial deployment in the Court of Appeal, the High Court and the Crown Court and it is entirely reasonable that he should give his consent before a judge of those courts is seconded for duty on an inquiry.
</p>

<a name="50118-50_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>Amendment No. 19 is of course different in wording, but identical in meaning. I hope that the Government will consider this, because the number of eligible chairs of inquiries is by no means limited to judges and it should be possible, where appropriate, to find a senior member of the legal profession or somebody who is not a member of the legal profession at all. No doubt, where there is a genuine justification for asking for a judge, as there sometimes will be, there <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="50118-50_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </b>   There have been two instances in recent years when distinguished judges from Scotland have been invited by Ministers of the United Kingdom Government to head inquiries; first the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cullen, who is now the Lord President of the Court of Session, was invited to look into the Paddington disaster, and more recently Lord Penrose was invited&#151;I am not sure by which Minister&#151;to carry out the inquiry into the Equitable Life fiasco.
</p>

<a name="50118-50_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>It may or may not be the case in England&#151;I would not presume to offer an opinion on it&#151;but the Scottish Bar and Bench is a pretty small one. To have at any one time two members of the Scottish Bench conducting inquiries in England on behalf of United Kingdom Ministers could impose a considerable strain on the resources of that small Bench, which is 25-strong. If you take off some 10 per cent at any time, there must be a real risk that the strain imposed will be too great for the jurisdiction to handle. Accordingly, in such circumstances there is some force in the remark made by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that the consent of the President of the Court of Session should be obtained. In such circumstances, he looks not only to see whether the person is of suitable qualification to head up such an inquiry, but looks to his own resources to see whether he can afford the time. In the case of Lord Penrose, I think he was removed from the courts in Scotland for something like 18 months to carry out his extensive inquiry.
</p>

<a name="50118-50_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>The difficulty here is that those who will allow for pay and rations for the Scottish Bench are those Members of the Scottish Parliament on the Scottish Executive team, and not the English Minister who might want to appoint such a judge. There has been a long tradition, which I do not at all resist, of Scottish judges being invited to take on such tasks. I go back to the last discussion that we had, that Scottish judges are often seen as very skilled and experienced outsiders who will come with no issues of partiality attached.

</p>

<a name="50118-50_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>I support the idea that the noble Lord, Lord   Goodhart, has advanced, that in such circumstances, it is not just consultation that is desirable, but consent as well.

<a name="50118-51_spnew0"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   When someone is normally invited to be a member of a panel, obviously he or she must consent. Does that also apply to a judge, or is it implicit that because a judge is a paid public servant, provided the head of his division will send him off, he is bound to take on the inquiry? Or is he entitled to say, &quot;No, I came here to try commercial cases, I do not want to spend three years discussing past affairs in Ireland&quot;?

inquiries that we are talking about. None the less, the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, made some important points.

</p>

<a name="50118-51_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>He has not raised, but I suppose it is relevant to the question generally, the argument that is sometimes put that judges, as distinct from people from other categories of life, are over-used for inquiries, sometimes on matters of considerable public and political controversy. There is a risk that the judiciary as a group are prejudiced by being dragged into issues that can be politically controversial.

</p>

<a name="50118-51_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>The amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord   Goodhart, does not raise that, but he raised an important point as to the use of the judiciary, possibly against the wishes of the relevant judge who must be consulted under this clause; the senior Law Lord, or the Lord Chief Justice. Also, there is, of course, at any one time a statutory limit to the number of judges at any particular level that can be appointed. There is a need for statutory alteration if the maximum is to be raised. If out of the limited number of Law Lords, whatever it is&#151;say, 12 at the moment&#151;two are engaged on very lengthy inquiries, and the Government cannot increase the number of Law Lords by two because the maximum is already reached, that is, in addition to the point that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, makes, a serious problem.
</p>

<a name="50118-51_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>The only query I have about whether we should support this amendment, or a similar one, concerns the following. Do consultation, and the consent of the individual being asked to conduct the inquiry, mean&#151;this is rather similar to the question asked by the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe&#151;that the individual will almost certainly ask the head of his division and the relevant senior judge, so that in practice consent arises out of the consultation? The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, raised the matter. It should help to get greater clarity from the Minister regarding what is involved.
</p>




<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="50118-51_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Kingsland: </b>   Our amendment approaches this matter from a slightly different angle. As your Lordships are well aware, it was, I believe, on 12 June 2003 that the Government decided overnight, literally not metaphorically, that the separation of powers was a crucial doctrine in our constitution. One of the immediate consequences of that is that Lords of Appeal in Ordinary are to be removed from your Lordships&#039; House and placed in a separate building somewhere else in London, lest they be contaminated by the political process.
</p>

<a name="50118-51_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>If that principle applies to Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, surely it also ought to apply to certain classes of public inquiry. By that I do not mean that there will not remain issues in public inquiries into which it will be appropriate for judges to inquire. But if the Government are to be true to the principle they have been advancing for the past year and a half, they ought to exclude judges in future from presiding over any public inquiry that has either a direct political content or which is likely to have party political implications.

</p>

<a name="50118-51_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>I would have thought it follows logically from the Government&#039;s endorsement of the crucial role that the separation of powers plays in our constitution that it would no longer be possible for a judge to preside over an inquiry which raised issues like those of the Hutton inquiry or the Scott inquiry. It is indisputable that both those judges were engaged to make decisions about the conduct of Ministers who were responsible for crucial aspects of political decision-making. I would be most interested to hear from the Minister whether, in the light of the doctrine of the separation of powers, the Government see a much more limited role for the judiciary in presiding over public inquiries in future.
</p>

<a name="50118-51_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>I was very struck by the earlier intervention of my noble and learned friend Lord Howe when he advanced the cause of senior members of the legal profession. There may be issues which, on the one hand, merit a judicial chairman, but on the other, go to the heart of the political management of our country. In those circumstances might it not be appropriate for the appointing person, who is likely to be the Prime Minister exercising his powers under the prerogative, to consider appointing a senior practising professional rather than a judge?

<a name="50118-51_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </b>   I am sure that the Prime Minister will take note of what the noble Lord has said. I would argue that there are two reasons why this amendment is not one that I would be keen to accept.

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>I am very clear that it is important that we consult the Lord Chief Justice or the appropriate colleague as in the list in the Bill before the appointment of a judge. That clear need to consult brings with it a requirement to take into account any issues that are raised in that deliberation. The issue of workload, in terms of the numbers of the judiciary and the particular judge, would need to be factored into that. So I am very clear that that is important.

</p>

<a name="50118-51_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>As the Lord Chief Justice said to the Public Administration Select Committee last month, in practice there is never any difficulty with that. It is almost inconceivable, I believe, that the Lord Chief Justice took the view that a government would appoint a judge against the wishes of the Lord Chief Justice. I am sure that the Lord Chief Justice is correct in that.
</p>

<a name="50118-51_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>There are two reasons why it is very important that this is a consultation and not a power of veto. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, said to the Public Administration Select Committee that he recognised that the question of whether the appointment of a judge to an inquiry is in the wider public interest will depend on many factors outside the remit of the Lord Chief Justice. That would include the level of public concern and the nature of the problem that the inquiry is investigating.

</p>

<a name="50118-51_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>My first contention is that, on the basis that the Lord Chief Justice recognises that there are other considerations&#151;indeed, many Members of the Committee in talking about inquiries today have almost exclusively indicated that they would expect a judge to be in charge, while recognising the eminence of others&#151;there has been a kind of general view that judges play an important role. Not everyone, but many Members of the Committee, have felt that that is appropriate.
</p>

<a name="50118-51_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>Although I accept what the noble and learned Lord,   Lord Howe, said, and what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has just said in reference to what the noble and learned Lord said about senior legal practitioners being able to play an important role, there are and there will be occasions when perhaps those involved in looking at who best might chair or conduct an inquiry would look to the judiciary. On the basis of what the Lord Chief Justice has said, the situation is, &quot;yes, consultation, but not power of veto&quot;.

</p>

<a name="50118-51_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>The second and important point raised by the noble   Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, and my noble friend Lord Borrie, is about the role of the individual judge. The   noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, talked about the Government&#039;s desire, as enshrined in the Constitutional Reform Bill, which now I hope will gallop through another place, that there be that independence. We would recognise that independence in the fact that the member of the judiciary who was being asked to do the inquiry does have and always will have the power to say &quot;no&quot;. It is for the individual to decide if they wish to do the inquiry. That is where judicial independence in this context properly lies.
</p>

<a name="50118-51_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>If the Lord Chief Justice has strong views about other issues, I am sure that there will be a general dialogue. I would not seek to inhibit that in any way. But, ultimately, our view is that the person approached to chair the inquiry or to be a member of the inquiry should be the one who exercises that independence to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. We believe that it is right to consult with the Lord Chief Justice or the others named within this list, but not to offer them a power of veto. On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_99"></a>
<a name="50118-51_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Goodhart: </b>   We have had an interesting debate on this. Of course, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, although he put down an amendment which was exactly to the same effect as mine, is really raising an argument that is somewhat different from any that I have raised; namely, that there may be grounds for saying that judges should not act as part of an inquiry panel or as sole members of an inquiry panel in cases that are actively political. Certainly the investigation conducted by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scott of Foscote, was very much political. I am not certain about that myself. I recognise that, particularly when the Lord Chief Justice has become head of the judiciary&#151;if and when the Constitutional Reform Bill comes into force&#151;it will be quite difficult to imagine a judge finding it easy to accept an invitation from the Government if the Lord Chief Justice told him or her that the Lord Chief Justice did not believe that it was the right thing to do.

<a name="50118-52_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Parental Separation</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="50118-52_spmin0"></a><b>The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor  (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </b>  This Statement is being made on a joint basis, together with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills and my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and Minister for Women and Equality.
</p>

<a name="50118-52_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a>I am pleased to report that <i>Parental Separation: Children&#039;s Needs and Parents&#039; Responsibilities: Next Steps </i>is today being presented to Parliament, and sets out the Government&#039;s response to the consultation on   the proposals set out in <i>Parental Separation: Children&#039;s Needs and Parents&#039; Responsibilities </i>which was published on 21 July 2004.
</p>

<a name="50118-52_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a>Parental separation is potentially damaging for children involved, especially where the separation is acrimonious. Each separation occurs in different circumstances and parents are, of course, best placed to decide the arrangements that are most likely to meet the needs of their own children. The Government&#039;s role is to provide and improve the legislative framework and related services, also working with others to make available advice and support.

</p>

<a name="50118-52_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a>We received over 250 responses to the consultation and I am grateful for respondents&#039; comments and suggestions. While opinions about individual proposals differed, the overwhelming majority of respondents welcomed the general thrust of the Green Paper. Each of the actions set out in the <i>Next Steps </i>response, informed by the consultation responses, will be taken forward in a timely way, with new legislation being pursued as soon as parliamentary time allows.
</p>

<a name="50118-52_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a>A topic that was frequently raised in the consultation responses was whether, and what kind, of legislative change was needed to reinforce the proposals. Some respondents called for a presumption of equal contact after separation to be introduced, while many others were supportive of the current legal position. The Government are not persuaded that any legislative change to introduce a presumption of equal contact would benefit children. New legislation will be introduced in the areas of facilitation of contact and enforcement of contact orders.
</p>

<a name="50118-52_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a>In addition to the launch of the response document, I am also pleased to announce that we are investing &#163;3   million and &#163;4.5 million in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 respectively to develop services to support child contact, including those delivered through child contact centres. We will be working over the coming months to develop specific plans for the use of these new resources. In addition, we are today launching a revised version of the Parenting Plans, which will be subject to consultation.

<a name="50118-52_head1"></a><h3 align=center>Bosnia and Herzegovina: Export Licence Application</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="50118-52_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </b>  In December 2004 the Government issued four licences for the export of armoured jackets to the Ministry of Security in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Ministry of Security required the vests for the State Information and Protection Agency (SIPA). SIPA is responsible for, inter alia, diplomatic protection, which includes the British Embassy in Sarajevo as well as the missions of EU partners and other allies; tackling organised crime; and investigating war crimes.

</p>

<a name="50118-52_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a>An EU arms embargo has been in place against Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1996. The purpose of the embargo was to aid the establishment of peace and stability for the people of the region, taking into account in particular the need to ensure the safety of international troops and civilian personnel deployed. The embargo was amended in 1999 to exclude demining equipment and the transfer of small arms to the police.
</p>

<a name="50118-52_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a>We fully support the EU embargo. However, we are, in limited circumstances, prepared to make exceptions where denying an export would frustrate the purposes of the embargo. The UK has been active in encouraging Bosnia and Herzegovina to take greater responsibility for maintaining the rule of law and strengthening civilian policing. I am confident that granting this exception is fully consistent with this responsible approach of supporting the development of civilian policing while respecting the aims of the embargo.

<a name="50118-52_head3"></a><h3 align=center>Defence Dental Agency: Disestablishment</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="50118-52_spmin2"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Bach): </b>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS21"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column WS21</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="50118-52_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a>As part of my strategy for improving the management and delivery of health services across defence, the Defence Dental Agency will be disestablished as an agency with effect from 1 April 2005. On that date responsibility for delivering defence dental services will transfer to the<i> </i>Director General<i> </i>Healthcare. The renamed Defence Dental Services organisation will become a component of his &quot;managed military health system for force generation&quot;.
</p>

<a name="50118-52_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a>This decision follows a full review of the DDA&#039;s status in line with the recommendations of the Landscape Review and in recognition of the changes that have taken place since the Medical Quinquennial Review of 2001, most notably the appointment of a Director General Healthcare to develop and implement coherent end-to-end processes for the delivery of health services to military personnel and entitled dependants. The review concluded that the important work of the DDA in promoting oral health, providing a primary dental treatment service and providing deployable dental personnel to support operations should be streamlined and rationalised within DG Healthcare&#039;s managed military health system in support of force generation. I am confident that this arrangement will preserve the benefits that have accrued as a result of agency status (improved tri-service working, professionalism and customer focus) while delivering real business benefits&#151;contributing to a stronger emphasis on the health needs of service personnel to ensure that they are fit and healthy to deploy when needed.

<a name="50118-52_head4"></a><h3 align=center>Trident Programme: Acquisition Cost Estimate</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="50118-52_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Bach: </b>   My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Geoffrey Hoon) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="50118-52_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a>The current estimate of the total acquisition cost of the Trident programme, with payments already made expressed at the prices and exchange rates actually incurred and future spend at the current financial year   exchange rate (the hybrid) estimate, is now &#163;9,804 million. Leaving aside the effects of price inflation and exchange rate variation there has been a cost increase of &#163;3 million which reflects adjustments to the final outturn costs in the submarine area. Expenditure on the Trident acquisition programme to 30 September 2003 represented over 99 per cent of the total estimate. If all expenditure, past and projected, is   brought up to this current year&#039;s economic conditions (the non-hybrid estimate) the estimate is &#163;14,893 million.
</p>

<a name="50118-52_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a>The programme continues to show an overall reduction in real terms on its original 1982 estimate. This reduction, including the savings resulting from the decision to process missiles at the United States facility at Kings Bay, Georgia, now stands at over &#163;3.6   billion at current prices.
</p>

<a name="50118-52_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a>The proportion of the estimate for work undertaken in the United Kingdom continues to be around 70 per cent.

<a name="50118-53_head0"></a><h3 align=center>British Energy plc: Restructuring</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_6"></a>
<a name="50118-53_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Hewitt) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.

</p>

<a name="50118-53_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a>British Energy plc announced on 14 January 2005 that it had successfully implemented the restructuring plan it announced on 28 November 2002.

</p>

<a name="50118-53_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a>The Government&#039;s overriding objectives in supporting British Energy were nuclear safety and security of electricity supplies. The successful completion of the restructuring has secured these objectives while safeguarding the interests of the taxpayer.

</p>

<a name="50118-53_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a>I would remind the House that, as part of the restructuring and in addition to the significant contribution being made by British Energy&#039;s other financial stakeholders, government are taking financial responsibility for the company&#039;s historic spent nuclear fuel liabilities. The estimated cost to government remains as set out in my Statement to the House on 28 November 2002, i.e. &#163;150 million to &#163;200 million a year on average for the next 10 years, falling thereafter. British Energy will also be making new and enhanced payments, including 65 per cent of its annual free cash-flow, to the Nuclear Liabilities <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column WS23</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Fund (NLF) which will be used to pay for the costs of decommissioning the company&#039;s nuclear power stations and certain other nuclear liabilities. The Government are underwriting the NLF to ensure safety and environmental protection. The Government&#039;s support for British Energy has been approved by the European Commission, subject to certain conditions.
</p>

<a name="50118-53_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a>British Energy has relisted its shares and will continue as a public limited company managed by its board of directors and subject to the normal private sector disciplines and requirements. The company will have the freedom to run its business, in terms of corporate, operational and financial policies, subject both to the measures the Government have taken in the restructuring agreements, including monitoring arrangements, to manage its financial exposure to British Energy&#039;s liabilities, and to conditions attached to the European Commission&#039;s approval of the restructuring aid. The restructuring agreements strike a balance between protecting taxpayers&#039; interests and ensuring these private sector disciplines maximise the company&#039;s contributions to its liabilities.
</p>

<a name="50118-53_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a>The Government Restructuring Agreement signed on 1 October 2003 has now been fulfilled. It committed the Government to entering into certain legally binding agreements on the Restructuring Effective Date (14 January 2005) and these have now come fully into effect. The principal agreements were set out in my Statement to the House of 14 October 2003 (<i>Official Report</i>, col. <i>11WS</i>). I will be placing copies of the final versions of these agreements on my department&#039;s website and in the Libraries of both Houses shortly.

<a name="50118-53_spmin1"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health has made the following Written Ministerial Statement today.
</p>

<a name="50118-53_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a>I have today placed in the Library a list of National Health Service trusts that submitted a preliminary application for NHS foundation trust status in late November 2004, as part of wave 2, and that have been successful in the preliminary application phase. All 32   trusts, including for the first time eight mental health trusts, will now enter the preparatory phase of the application process for NHS foundation trust status.
</p>

<a name="50118-53_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a>Applicants must satisfy the requirements of the preparatory phase and retain a three star rating this summer in order to receive my support to make an application to Monitor (whose statutory name is the Independent Regulator of NHS foundation trusts) for consideration for authorisation as a NHS foundation trust. The objective of the preparatory phase is to help applicants to develop the arrangements and systems that they will need to have in place to be established as NHS foundation trusts and operate successfully. The preparatory phase will therefore include developing <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS24"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column WS24</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

new governance arrangements, a five year business strategy and a human resources strategy. Applicants will also be required to undergo an independent financial review and hold a public consultation where they must demonstrate that they have consulted staff, local NHS partners and the public on their proposals and that their proposals fit with the local vision for health services.
</p>

<a name="50118-53_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a>I expect to make decisions on preparatory phase applications in autumn 2005 only after I have had the opportunity to consider fully the outcome of the review into the policy by the Healthcare Commission (whose statutory name is the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection). This is due to be published in summer 2005. Applicants will begin their public consultation only after the outcome of the review is known, which will allow them to take into consideration issues arising from the review when finalising their preparatory phase proposals. Once applicants have received my support, decisions on authorisations will strictly be for Monitor after having satisfied itself of an applicant&#039;s preparedness and viability for foundation status.

<p><a name="wms_st_8"></a>
<a name="50118-53_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Warner: </b>   I am today notifying Parliament of the Government&#039;s proposals to amend the requirements of the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 for consent in emergency situations.
</p>

<a name="50118-53_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a>The Clinical Trials Directive(1) requires that before an incapacitated person is entered into a clinical trial his or her legal representative must give consent. Our implementing regulations include specific provision for establishing who should act as the legal representative. Since the implementing regulations came into force on 1 May 2004, researchers conducting a large international trial in cardiac arrest (the TROICA trial) have concluded that the scheme for establishing the legal representative and obtaining his or her consent is unworkable for clinical trials set in the context of emergency medicine. Thus, it would prove impossible to include United Kingdom patients in such trials unless the UK&#039;s requirements were amended.
</p>

<a name="50118-53_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a>The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency will consult on a proposal to amend the regulations so that an incapacitated person can be entered into a clinical trial involving emergency treatment prior to consent being obtained from his or her legal representative. This exception to the requirement for prior consent would be subject to strict safeguards. The proposed approach would be consistent with the accepted international standards for conducting clinical trials in emergency situations as    set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines(2) on good clinical practice, and with the approach for research envisaged in the Mental Capacity Bill.

<a name="50118w01_sbhd0"></a><h3 align=center>Northern Ireland: Disabled Facilities Grant</h3>


<p><a name="wa_qn_0"></a>
<a name="50118w01_wqn0"></a><b> Lord Maginnis of Drumglass </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>What backlog there is in the number of applications from ill or elderly and infirm householders who have applied to the Housing Executive for adaption grants and dealt with by occupational therapists (a) in terms of average time to complete their enquiries; and (b) in respect of the number of current applications over three months old in the following areas&#151;




<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_0"></a>(i) Cookstown;




<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_1"></a>(ii) Dungannon;




<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_2"></a>(iii) Fermanagh; and




<p class="tabletext"><a name="wa_brev_3"></a>(iv) Omagh Council.  [HL474]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="50118w01_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  Fermanagh council area is covered by the Housing Executive&#039;s Fermanagh Grants Office. Cookstown, Dungannon and Omagh council areas are covered by the Omagh Grants Office.

</p>

<a name="50118w01_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a>All applications to the Housing Executive for disabled facilities grants must be supported by a recommendation from an occupational therapist (OT).
</p>

<a name="50118w01_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a>Once a recommendation has been received, the grants office can issue the schedule of works, listing those items of work for which grant aid may be available. The applicant then has six months to complete a statutory application, which includes obtaining any necessary statutory approvals, getting estimates from builders and getting working drawings prepared. Once the statutory application has been completed, the Housing Executive is required to issue the formal approval within six months.
</p>

<a name="50118w01_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a>The Fermanagh and Omagh Grants Offices are currently issuing approvals for disabled facilities grant within the six month timescale. In the Fermanagh office area, approvals for disabled facilities grant are being issued, on average, within 25 weeks and in the Omagh office area the average time is 22 weeks.
</p>

<a name="50118w01_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a>At the end of November 2004, the Fermanagh office had 74 OT requests outstanding for more than three months and the Omagh office had 137 OT requests outstanding for more than three months.
</p>

<a name="50118w01_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a>The Housing Executive is currently carrying out a review of the disabled facilities grant process and hopes to speed up the process during 2005.

<p><a name="wa_qn_1"></a>
<a name="50118w01_wqn1"></a><b> Lord Hylton </b>  asked Her Majesty&#039;s Government:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_1"></a>What funds they are allocating in the current financial year and the coming two years, through the Department for International Development or <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_WA96"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column WA96</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>otherwise, for the direct benefit of orphans and street children; and how grants will be divided between the five continents.  [HL507]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_2"></a>
<a name="50118w01_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   The Government&#039;s international development policy is focused on achieving the internationally agreed millennium development goals (MDGs). DfID links the classification of its expenditure to the MDGs, not to expenditure on particular groups. It is therefore not possible at present to identify the total amount spent on programmes for the direct benefit of orphans and street children.
</p>

<a name="50118w01_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a>In the UK strategy on HIV and AIDS, launched in July 2004, the Government committed themselves to fund action that prioritises women, young people and vulnerable groups. DfID will ensure that it spends at least &#163;150 million over three years from 2005&#150;08 on programmes to meet the needs of orphans and other children, particularly those in Africa, made vulnerable by HIV and AIDS. DfID is adjusting its statistical systems to enable it to monitor expenditure against the &#163;150 million target.
</p>

<a name="50118w01_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a>Africa is the first priority, as it is the region of the world worst affected and most at risk of HIV and AIDS. Over the next three years some &#163;123 million will go to countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
</p>

<a name="50118w01_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_7"></a>DfID will step up its support in Asia too. It is currently in the process of developing its response at country and regional levels and expects to spend at least &#163;4 million through its country programmes and &#163;1 million through a regional approach through the United Nations Children&#039;s Fund (UNICEF).
</p>

<a name="50118w01_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_8"></a>DfID will be allocating resources to research on vulnerable children. It has just agreed &#163;2.4 million support for a five-year programme of research into ways<i> </i>of providing anti-retroviral treatment to children with HIV where resources are limited. This will be undertaken in a number of countries in Africa.

</p>

<a name="50118w01_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_9"></a>Children and young people are frequently vulnerable because of poverty in their communities. DfID takes the view that we also have to tackle the wider economic and social problems that make them vulnerable to ending up on the street or at risk of exploitation and abuse. DfID&#039;s goal is the eradication of poverty and most of the programmes it supports are intended to contribute to improving the livelihoods of poor people and helping them realise their rights. Working with overseas partners, both international organisations and the governments of developing countries themselves, to eliminate poverty is in the long run likely to be more effective than individual small projects. Much of DfID&#039;s other expenditure, for example on increased access to safe water and sanitation, improving slum dwellers&#039; lives and promoting environmental sustainability, will also benefit vulnerable children directly or indirectly.

</p>

<a name="50118w01_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a>DfID has also provided support through multilateral agencies; for example, the UK contributed a total of &#163;64 million to the United Nations Children&#039;s Fund (UNICEF) in 2003. DfID has also supported the International Labour Organisation&#039;s work to combat child labour and child trafficking. For example, DfID has committed some &#163;8.9 million in total over the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WA97"></a>

decade   1999&#150;08 to the ILO&#039;s International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) for work in the Greater Mekong region (parts of Cambodia, China, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam).
</p>

<a name="50118w01_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_11"></a>DfID also provides support through civil society organisations: a four-year Partnership Programme Agreement (PPA) was agreed between DfID and Save the Children Fund in 2001 to support their work on eliminating poverty and advocating for children&#039;s rights and greater equity. The PPA is worth &#163;20.72 million. DfID is also contributing &#163;1.7 million from 2003&#150;05 to the Greater Mekong Child Trafficking project through Save the Children. This is linked to the IPEC programme and to a World Vision project to reduce the number of women, young people and children trafficked for sex work or other forms of exploitative labour within Burma and from Burma to Thailand. DfID is contributing &#163;235,000 to the World Vision project from 2002&#150;06.

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_2"></a>What proportion of the Global Pool on Conflict Resolution has been devoted to work on small arms issues in each of the past five years; what proportion will be so devoted in each of the next five years; and within these global figures, what percentage the funding has been or will be devoted to Africa.  [HL514]</p></ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_3"></a>
<a name="50118w01_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Amos: </b>   The Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) strategy was established in 2001 with the creation of the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP). The recent Spending Review (SR) 2004 provided the allocation of funding for 2005&#150;06 to 2007&#150;08 (please see the table below).
</p>

<a name="50118w01_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_12"></a>Funding for the GCPP beyond 2007&#150;08 will be determined by the next SR in 2006. The allocation of funds for individual strategies within the GCPP for 2007&#150;08 and 2008&#150;09 will also take place in 2006.

</p>

<a name="50118w01_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_13"></a>Over the four years in which the pool has been in existence, approximately 20 per cent of SALW projects have been exclusively dedicated to work in <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WA98"></a>

<b>18 Jan 2005 : Column WA98</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Africa. However, a further 70 per cent of funds have been used to support projects with a global reach. This makes it difficult to give precise figures for the extent to which the SALW strategy has funded work in Africa.

</p>

<a name="50118w01_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_14"></a>For example, the Global Pool Strategy funds the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA) and has committed &#163;l.3 million to date. IANSA works with approximately 550 civil society organisations worldwide. The purpose of their project is to increase political commitment, raise public awareness and co-ordinate global action to effect policy change in tackling small arms proliferation and misuse.
</p>

<a name="50118w01_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_15"></a>Although the SALW strategy has been allocated funds for the financial years 2005&#150;06 and 2006&#150;07, those funds have not yet been allocated to specific projects in Africa or elsewhere.

</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_8"></a>Whether they have dropped their plans to give foundation bodies the power to establish new secondary schools.  [HL616]</p></ul>
