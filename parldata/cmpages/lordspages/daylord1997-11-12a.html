<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "71112-01_para3"></a>What is their policy with regard to the protocol on the application of nuclear safeguards approved by the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in May 1997.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="71112-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Clinton-Davis): </B>  My Lords, Her Majesty's Government strongly support the measures contained in the model protocol which was approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency board of governors on 15th May this year. The protocols based on this model will be additional to existing agreements between states and the IAEA for the application of safeguards. These protocols, once adopted, will support the twin objectives of increasing the agency's ability to detect clandestine nuclear activities in non-nuclear weapon states and increasing the effectiveness of the application of existing safeguards measures.

<FONT SIZE=3>which the UK intends to implement and a copy of the model protocol itself, will be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Chalfont: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that full Answer. Does he agree that the illicit traffic in nuclear materials is one of the greatest existing threats to international security, and that the additional protocol could do much to prevent the threat if it were brought fully into effect? Will Her Majesty's Government do all that they can and use every endeavour to ensure that other countries, especially those which have nuclear weapons, sign the protocol so that it becomes universal and effective?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree with the noble Lord's propositions. Of course, illicit traffic is a threat to the entire globe. We will use our best endeavours to ensure that as many countries as possible adopt the procedures because that would be enormously helpful.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, is it the case that the best example that nuclear states can give to non-nuclear states is to become non-nuclear themselves?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, as ever, my noble friend extends the Question. I do not agree with the proposition he has advanced. We are seeking to ensure that non-proliferation succeeds and that the powers which are available to the IAEA inspectors are enhanced. That advance is important and, as was said by the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, we must ensure that it can be extended as widely as possible.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister assure us that co-operation and intelligence between nuclear states are full and proper?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, the significance of this protocol is to enhance the powers of the inspectors in important ways. That is the best way to gain the assurances, rather than to rely necessarily on information which is passed from one country to another.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Carver: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister accept that his comments will receive strong support from everyone who believes that the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a danger? Will the Government continue to support any strengthening of the investigative and enforcement powers of the IAEA?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and gallant Lord. His question reflects what this is all about, which is strengthening the enforcement powers. We are ensuring that there are greater powers to investigate situations in order to avoid the problem which he identified.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, does the extension of the powers of the IAEA allow it to deal with the enormous problems of redundant nuclear reactors and material <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>such as the Russians have stored following the dismantling of their North Sea fleet? In view of the IAEA's adoption of greater transparency, will representations be made to the Russians that they should drop the charges against Dr. Alexander Nikitin who performed a great service to the world in revealing the dangers of the redundant reactors and the North Sea fleet?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, with respect, I believe that the noble Lord should table a specific Question on that matter. I would then be able to give him an informed Answer.

<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew11"></A><B> The Earl of Clancarty </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "71112-01_para5"></a>Whether they will intervene to ensure that the National Museums of Scotland do not introduce the admission charge to their sites which is planned to take effect on 5th January 1998.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="71112-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office   (Lord Sewel): </B>  My Lords, the Board of Trustees of the National Museums of Scotland has powers under the National Heritage (Scotland) Act 1985 to impose charges for admission to its premises. It is entirely a matter for the trustees; they do not require the approval of the Secretary of State. The Government are already reviewing their position on access to the national collections, including the implications of admission charges, and expect to announce the outcome of the review early in December.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew12"></A><B> The Earl of Clancarty: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. Will he acknowledge that the National Museums of Scotland will be able to claim back almost &#163;3 million in VAT in the current tax year only if, completely against their will, they take the option of introducing admission charges? Will the Minister review the situation and change the VAT rules so that all national museums are not penalised in such a manner?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I am aware that the VAT issue is one of the driving concerns in the trustees' decision to introduce charges. It is true that the issue will be taken up in the review.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, taking into account the noble Earl's interesting Question, is the Minister aware that for some years during the late 1980s I was a trustee of the National Museums of Scotland and that I argued long and hard, but unsuccessfully, for limited flexible entrance fees? Does the Minister agree with me that, if people pay, curators and other staff feel more answerable to the public they serve? Would it not <P>


<a name="column_148"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 148</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be better if the museum in Chambers Street had proper turnstiles, rather than manual clickers, so that it could properly ascertain the popularity of its offering?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I am indeed aware of the noble Baroness's contribution to this issue. She may have advocated charges for nearly 20 years and is only now seeing them materialise, but I have been advocating a Scottish Parliament for more than 20 years and that is just coming about, too. I am not sure that I can go down the precise road suggested by the noble Baroness as regards the value of charges and the worth that it gives to curating staff. However, the whole issue of charges, the contribution that they can make and their impact on access is properly being examined in the context of the review.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Hutchinson of Lullington: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that on two occasions the Minister for Culture, Media and Sport has publicly committed himself to the principle of universal access, and therefore opposition to charging in all national museums, or is that merely a restatement of the well known principle that justice is open to all, as is the Ritz Hotel?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I believe that on this occasion the noble Lord has not accurately represented the comments of my right honourable friend in another place. However, I fully accept that access is an important issue which is recognised on all sides of the House and which is currently engaging active interest and concern.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Strabolgi: </B>   My Lords, with regard to VAT, would my noble friend, in the government review, consider anomalies whereby free national museums have to pay VAT while local free museums and charging national museums do not pay it? Would it not be better to free the lot?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-01_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of a number of anomalies in the VAT area. I had to deal with one on a different subject a few months ago. That taught me the lesson that it is incredibly difficult to sort out even what appear on the surface to be glaring anomalies.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Freyberg: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister acknowledge that there has been a considerable drop in visitor numbers when admission charges have been introduced in some of our national museums?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I must draw the attention of the noble Lord to a piece of research at which I happened to glance this morning in one of the public prints to the effect that there is no consistent evidence that admission levels fall when charges are introduced. To give authority to that research, I should point out that it was carried out by Glasgow Caledonian University.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that that piece of research is nonsense? All <P>


<a name="column_149"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 149</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>experience shows that admission charges are an absolute disaster and the sooner they are abolished for good the better.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I shall not tangle with the noble Lord on that particular matter. I advise him to look at the research and weigh it on the basis of its quality.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister give an assurance that he will not follow the Government's racist policy of allowing Scotsmen in free and charging the English?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, that is a little bit naughty.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister remind the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Putney, that you do not assess research as good only if it agrees with your predetermined conclusions? Will the Minister accept from me that the research from Glasgow Caledonian University is very interesting? It suggests that people are not deterred by charges. Will he further agree that, if trustees of galleries and so on believe that charges would add to their income, that must be to the benefit of the galleries and to those who genuinely wish to visit them?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, as usual, the noble Lord makes a good and strong point. The issue really boils down to the need to generate income in difficult circumstances and in a tight public expenditure context on the one side and the need to ensure access for all groups within society on the other. That is very much a balancing act, and that is what the review will address.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend pay a visit to Glasgow some day, particularly on a Sunday, and visit the art gallery, the Museum of Transport and the Burrell Collection? If he does so, he will see the families who visit those establishments. I hope that we shall never extend the possibility of charges to municipal museums because those families with a number of children who are obviously very interested in what they are seeing could never afford to visit them.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord makes a good point. The difficulty is that from the particular part of Scotland where I live it is not a matter of wishing to go to Glasgow; it is always a matter of needing to go there. The substantive point which my noble friend makes is a strong one. Indeed, it is at the heart of the nature of the review: to try to resolve the issue of access for all groups while at least enabling the galleries to generate as much income as is reasonably possible.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mowbray and Stourton: </B>   My Lords, is it not the case that the trustees of those museums will not help their case if they do not encourage people to leave the contents of their collections as they intend? If they do <P>


<a name="column_150"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 150</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not do that, that will merely diminish the increase in the museums' accretion of goodies which would otherwise come to them.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, indeed, but I believe that the noble Lord is almost tempting me to make reference to another item of interest which has been before us from time to time.

<A NAME="71112-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "71112-02_para0"></a>Whether student nurses enrolled at colleges of nursing attached to a university will be required to pay student fees under their proposals to charge such fees.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="71112-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Health   (Baroness Jay of Paddington): </B>  My Lords, the simple answer to my noble friend is "No". On 23rd September, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health announced changes to the funding arrangements for healthcare professional student funding in England from September 1998. The new arrangements mean that nurses and midwives will not be required to make a contribution to tuition fees and will have access to NHS bursaries. Similar arrangements have been announced for healthcare professional students in Scotland, and it is hoped that the same will apply to students in Wales and Northern Ireland where negotiations still continue.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, I now understand the enthusiasm and keenness of my noble friend to answer the Question even almost before it was asked. Will my noble friend accept my warm and sincere thanks for that unqualified assurance that nurses and those allied to medicine will be exempt from those tuition fees?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for his thanks and also for noticing my rapidness in reply.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that there are academic nursing courses such as the B.Sc nursing course run by the Anglia Polytechnic University which has been funded hitherto through the normal academic route as opposed to the health service route? The continuation of those courses will depend upon adequate funding being transferred from the DfEE to the Department of Health. It will then depend on that being distributed to the health trusts and the health trusts continuing to back those courses by supplying students for them. Will the Minister assure the House that all those transfers will take place and adequate support for those very important courses will continue?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to give that assurance. I am afraid that I cannot comment on the specific course to which the noble Lord referred. <P>


<a name="column_151"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 151</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, the detailed discussions during the summer between the Department for Education and Employment and the Department of Health resulted in those precise arrangements being put in place.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Molloy: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that her attitude will be greatly welcomed by the nursing profession? Thank goodness that proposal is not to be carried out because it could have damaged the morale of nurses and, much more serious, could have had a deleterious effect on our entire National Health Service. Such issues sometimes grow and grow and get out of hand. I congratulate my noble friend on her direct answer which indicates that that will not be allowed to take place.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend. It was precisely because of the potential threat to the adequate level of skilled employees--nurses and other professions supplementary to medicine--that the department was extremely keen to ensure that those arrangements were made for transferring the funding. I am glad that we succeeded.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew19"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, following on what the Minister said, does she agree with me--I am sure she does--that recruitment and retention of nurses are vital to the wellbeing of the NHS? Given that nurses on diploma courses are not eligible for the various loans and benefit which nurse degree students will be able to apply for as from next September, does she not agree also that the impact of that two-tier treatment needs to be reviewed regularly, perhaps annually, to ensure that it does not have an adverse impact on recruitment and retention?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, those nurses in training who are subject to the diploma arrangements, who remain a majority of those student nurses not on higher education courses, remain in the care, as it were, of the NHS for funding. The NHS has always met their tuition costs and provides them with non-means tested bursaries which will continue.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew21"></A><B> Baroness Young: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her Answer. But may we be quite clear as to what is being said? Nurses undertaking courses in universities will not, as I understand it, be required to pay student fees. I accept entirely the case for that. But will that apply to those taking, for example, B.Ed courses, because there is, of course, also a shortage of teachers; or do medical students have something which other students have been unable to achieve?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew22"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I hesitate to answer a question which I believe should be directed more properly to my colleagues at the Department for Education and Employment who have responsibility for teacher training. As I said in answer to my noble friend Lord Molloy, it was our great concern about the potential threat to NHS employment which enabled my <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew23"></A><B> Baroness Cumberlege: </B>   My Lords, bearing in mind this Government's abhorrence of a two-tier service within the NHS, will the Minister state whether she supports an all-degree nursing profession?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-02_spnew24"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, the present arrangements seem to work quite well. As I said in reply to the previous question, there are still many more nurses who wish to follow the diploma rather than the degree course. I am glad to say that since there is no discrepancy in the way they are funded, I hope that they will be able to work together very well.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "71112-03_para0"></a>What are the future plans for the A.40 and adjacent buildings from the White City to the Hanger Lane underpass.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="71112-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  My Lords, following the cancellation of the A.40 Western Approach (Design, Build, Finance and Operate scheme), which included the schemes at Western Circus and Gypsy Corner, a study is currently being undertaken to identify the best sustainable solution to the problems which exist on the A.40 between Hangar Lane and White City. Once a decision has been taken on the form of an alternative scheme, the future of surplus land and properties acquired can be determined.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Macleod of Borve: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her Answer. However, perhaps I may point out to her that a great many people will be very disappointed that the proposed alteration and widening of that road is not to go ahead. I should declare an interest in the matter in that I drive up and down that road every day, as, I believe, do other noble Lords. My main interest and worry concerns not only the number of people who had homes on the A.40 and were persuaded to sell them, but also the other people who are now trying to sell their homes, as I understand the "for sale" boards and notices have been erected. Those people do not understand or know what the future will hold for them. Can the Minister help me in that respect?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-03_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I very much understand the points made by the noble Baroness. I also understand her concerns, which are indeed shared by other Members of this House. I am very well aware of the problem for that very reason. Moreover, I realise that the scheme has a long history and reached the point of being very near to construction. However, I have to say that I believe the most responsible thing to do is to <P>


<a name="column_153"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>ensure that the scheme which is eventually implemented is one that is sustainable and one that addresses the needs of those who use the road, while assisting public transport, cyclists, disabled people and pedestrians as well as business and essential car users. A scheme which simply encouraged more single occupant car commuting, as the previous scheme would have done, would be doomed to failure.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Marsh: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell us what the position is with regards to compensation, if any, for the people in the area--and we all know the area that we are talking about--who are living in intolerable conditions as a direct result of government decision? I am not saying that it is a wrong decision in the transport context, but those people's homes are now completely valueless.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, some people were certainly affected and were eligible for, and received, compensation. There are two tasks that we need to undertake urgently: first, we need to deal with the environmental devastation which, frankly, exists along the side of the route at present; and, secondly, we need to address the other main issue about compensation--namely, those properties which are now badly affected by noise which were shielded in the past by the other properties that have been demolished. I can confirm that those properties will be eligible for compensation for noise insulation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Montagu of Beaulieu: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of the stunned disbelief with which this decision was received by people? Can the noble Baroness assure the House that it is not the policy of Her Majesty's Government to perpetuate and even design traffic jams at the end of motorways so that they cannot be used?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-03_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   No, my Lords; it is not this Government's policy to perpetuate traffic jams. That is why it is essential for us to reconsider some of the policies of the past. I am sure that noble Lords will recognise that simply "predict and provide" has failed in terms of congestion, pollution and traffic management. That is why the Government thought it right to step back in order to review all the roads in the roads programme and to undertake the work on an integrated transport policy which will actually provide sustainable solutions for the future. The present system is not sustainable.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-03_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I must also declare an interest as one who drives along that road rather more often than I would wish. Is the Minister aware that many people use their cars because it is not possible to count on getting a train back to London following an after-dinner meeting? Further, will the Minister attempt a cost-benefit analysis of traffic reduction by getting the trains to run a little later?

<FONT SIZE=3>transport alternatives. It is no good criticising people for using their cars if they have no real alternative. That is why we shall be looking very carefully at solutions which could, for example, enhance the speed and effectiveness of bus travel along that stretch of road. We shall also be studying the train services and considering park-and-ride schemes. Indeed, there are all sorts of ways in which we can help. In view of the widespread interest in your Lordships' House in the matter, perhaps we could have a car pooling scheme.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-03_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Montgomery of Alamein: </B>   Lords, the Minister mentioned the integrated transport policy programme which the Government are considering. However, can she give us some idea of the kind of time-scale for its implementation? It all sounds highly desirable.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-03_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I can tell the noble Lord that the consultation which was launched in August will finish on Friday of this week, 14th November. We will then be bringing together the submissions of which there have been a great number, including many from ordinary members of the public. I should point out to the House that there is a widespread agreement that we need to change and better integrate transport policies. We shall then be looking into the prospect of producing a White Paper in the spring. There is a great deal that can be done in the meantime. Individual schemes--such as, for example, a bus lane on the M.4 spur--can and are being implemented in the interim.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Bowness: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister tell the House what costs to the public exchequer were incurred, prior to the somewhat hasty cancellation of the scheme, on property acquisition, site clearance and other associated schemes? In other words, how much has already been spent?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-03_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the figure that the noble Lord seeks is &#163;27 million. In terms of hasty cancellation, I have to say that this scheme had a checkered history as regards being in and out of the programme and, indeed, had been going on for many years with some doubt surrounding it. That figure represents a lot of money, some of which will actually be recovered from land sales. As the scheme which was being proposed would have cost &#163;75 million, and we believe it to be the wrong scheme, I do not think that that was a justification for going ahead with it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Bowness: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister explain how we know that it is the wrong scheme when consultation is still going on, together with a study, to ascertain what should be done?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-03_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the study is of alternatives. In the accelerated review we looked at the schemes that were in urgent need of decision because of their contractual position, and this scheme was one of them. We then considered their viability and this scheme very clearly came forward as one which would simply <P>


<a name="column_155"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 155</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>encourage more car commuting into London without giving long-term and sustainable solutions. Therefore, we instituted a study to ascertain what would be the best alternative to a scheme that we viewed not to be viable.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Macleod of Borve: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister know how much land is still left derelict? That, in the view of the public, is obviously a waste of money and usage of land. Will the Minister try to use her best influences, which, as we know, are very sound and strong, to have the central reservation cleaned? It is in a disgusting state.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-03_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, there have certainly been problems in that respect, including fly-tipping in the area. I cannot give the House an exact acreage regarding the amount of derelict land or of the amount of land that can be returned and sold off. That depends a little on what scheme is eventually decided upon. Certainly, I have asked the Highways Agency to look very carefully at what it can do, both in terms of regular patrols and of putting up new fencing so that at least we will have some environmental improvements in the short term.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-03_spnew17"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, I understand what the Minister has said about integrated solutions, but does she nevertheless agree that the A.40 is one of the major trunk routes in and out of London and that, had the previous scheme been seen through to completion, it would have dramatically alleviated the number of severe traffic bottle-necks? Will the Minister confirm that the Government will at least ensure that any revised scheme will aim to relieve those bottle-necks and that the uncertainty for local residents is removed as soon as possible?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I can certainly give an undertaking that we will look at those particular bottle-necks. However, I have to point out to the noble Lord that we must consider the bottle-neck that would be created in the centre of London if we were to encourage traffic to come all the way in. Noble Lords are most interested in what we can do to alleviate the situation outside this House, in the squares about which we are all concerned. If all we do is provide wonderful roads right into the centre of London and thereby encourage people to use their cars in order to get here, we shall not be able to solve the traffic problems in the capital.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Beloff: </B>   My Lords, I begin by thanking the many noble Lords who have been good enough to put their names down for today's debate. I also thank the authorities who have enabled us to have a four-hour debate so that noble Lords' contributions will not be too limited. The House will look forward in particular to the two maiden speeches that we are to hear. We shall hear the maiden speech of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ely whose presence, along with a number of other figures from Cambridge, means that I do not need to mention Cambridge again in the course of my remarks!
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para3"></a>I wish particularly and personally to welcome the maiden speech of my noble friend Lord Baker of Dorking. I say "personally" because we were pupils of the same schoolmaster. I hasten to add that I was a pupil at the beginning of that schoolmaster's career whereas the noble Lord, Lord Baker, was a pupil at the end of that schoolmaster's career. The main objective in life of that schoolmaster, who was a considerable scholar, was to ensure that the boys in his care attained places at either Oxford or Cambridge. I say that because it is relevant to one of the features of the debate about the two universities; namely, the worry about whether access is wide enough. The example I have mentioned, and others I know of, show that the decision that is taken by a young person to apply to a particular university will depend more than anything on the advice he receives from whoever has taught him at the pre-university stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para4"></a>Both universities have made enormous efforts to change their patterns of admission, their examinations, their interviews and so forth, in order to make entry easier for people from schools which have not hitherto been providers of applicants. However, there is a limit to what can be done in that direction. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Plant, will be able to give us more detail on this. I know that many colleges send people out to schools, or bring school-children into the colleges, in order to encourage them. But if, as one hears occasionally, school-children are positively discouraged by certain schoolteachers, the chance of their getting to Oxford or Cambridge is limited.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para5"></a>Everyone declares an interest nowadays, even non-financial ones. I shall not depart from the pattern. I have an interest to declare. As an undergraduate I became a member of the University of Oxford 65 years ago. Sixty-five years is, I believe, the utmost limit of the life of the millennium dome, which puts the matter into perspective. But in the life of the University of Oxford 65 years is almost nothing when one thinks in terms of centuries.
<P>


<a name="column_157"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 157</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para6"></a>Those 65 years have seen major changes. Some of them, I believe, were changes for the better, but others which I shall not mention, I was critical of at the time. They can be summarised in two broad bands. First, the university has become much more conscious of the role and position of the natural sciences, and particularly medicine. It is, after all--as it was not 65 years ago--a recognised centre of medical excellence throughout the world. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Winston, will confirm that when he speaks. I merely remind noble Lords that the curative properties of penicillin were first tried by a team from the University of Oxford in the local hospital. Everyone who has benefited from treatment with antibiotics over the past half century is, whether he knows it or not, a direct beneficiary of the University of Oxford.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para7"></a>The second great change is the development of graduate studies and, with them, research in a number of fields, some of them already traditional in the university, such as archaeology and languages, some of them relatively new, and many of them with an important international aspect. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, who has recently retired from heading one of the two most important new graduate colleges--where, if I may say so, I was in at the beginning--will tell us more about that important aspect of the university's new life.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para8"></a>This is a constantly changing scene. I do not imagine that anyone taking part in this debate imagines that there will be no further change. What we are concerned with, as I understand it, is the need to safeguard the future of these two universities. What are the arguments for safeguarding them? The primary argument must be that in an age of competition it is important that any part of our national heritage which directly contributes to the standing of this country in the arts and the sciences is maintained. It is not difficult to find evidence for the fact that both these universities contribute in major ways.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para9"></a>It is also clearly important that we should consider what are the elements that attract bright young people to these universities and which retain bright scholars who might otherwise be tempted by the greater material rewards available to them across the Atlantic. One of those, I believe--this will no doubt be talked about by other speakers in this debate--to be the collegiate system. That is unique. Tutorials are part of the collegiate system, but you could have--and some institutions do have--tutorials without a collegiate system. The collegiate system which brings together both people at the beginning of their careers and hardened scholars--if one can put it like that--in a personal tutorial relationship is, I believe, the principal attraction, and the principal reason the universities retain this attraction.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para10"></a>One does not need to look far for examples of the attraction. The President of the United States of America and his current ambassador to the Court of St. James are both former Rhodes scholars; so, I believe, is a certain judge in Massachusetts who has managed to hit our headlines in recent days. We attract a lot of people.
<P>


<a name="column_158"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 158</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para11"></a>The system is extraordinarily efficient--and this is where comparisons with other systems become inevitable. Its efficiency can be measured in a variety of ways. It is efficient in the sense that a very high proportion of students--far higher than in any other British university, let alone continental European universities, where most students never take a degree--take the degree which they came up to read. That means that the effort that is put into teaching them is not wasted. The comparison could be made in the job market at various levels; it could be made in all kinds of ways. But fundamentally, the system is efficient and cost-effective. That does not mean that it is not expensive. Indeed, much of the current interest arises from the problem caused by its expense, or the public share of that expense, to those examining the budget for higher education, which is under very considerable strain.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para12"></a>It is difficult, and it would be wrong, to make comparisons between universities in a single country. They have, or should have, their own methods and aspirations. However, there are some important cross-national comparisons which can be put in very crude terms. If we take France as an example (and we are always told that things are done better in France) the amount of money spent by the French state on each student attending the grande ecole--the ecole polytechnique, the ecole normale, and so on, which correspond roughly in their purpose and ethos to Oxford and Cambridge--is three times the amount that is spent on students in French universities. That is a far bigger differential than even the college fees add to the difference between expenditure on Oxford and expenditure on other British universities.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para13"></a>If we take, again, the institutions with which Oxford and Cambridge are most properly to be compared, the great research universities of the United States--Harvard, Yale and Princeton--the cost of sending a student to one of those institutions is something like three times the cost of educating someone in Oxford or Cambridge. Even if we allow for the greater wealth of the United States and other factors we still arrive at the fact that we seem to be able to do, on less, what Harvard, Yale and Princeton do admirably, on more.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para14"></a>To return to my point about the effectiveness of the college tutorial system, one comparison that can be made is that tutorial teaching in Oxford is still done by mature scholars. I remember as a schoolboy coming up in 1932 and discovering to my astonishment that the people whose books I had been asked to read at school were actual, living people, walking in the streets and sometimes condescending to give me a tutorial, to take me for a walk, or whatever the customary method of tutorial instruction was in those days; whereas, as we know, in the United States a great deal of that kind of teaching at undergraduate level is done by graduate students. That is a method which, on the whole, we ought not to welcome as a possible result of cutting down on college income. That is perhaps the most striking difference. Perhaps I may ram it home by means of an anecdote. Many years ago I was a colleague of Albert Einstein. We were both members of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. A number of hopeful <P>


<a name="column_159"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 159</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mothers sent their offspring to Princeton University--a different institution, a great one--in the hope that they would be tutored in their mathematical studies by Albert Einstein. I do not say that everyone who comes to Oxford is tutored by the equivalent of Einstein; but at least they receive tuition on which they can rely.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para15"></a>What has brought this matter to a head is clearly the controversy about college fees. Fees to colleges have always been paid. They date back to the foundation of colleges. Most colleges include the payment of fees by categories of students in their foundation documents. From decade to decade, and century to century, efforts have had to be made to see that whatever assistance was available for students should go to make sure that the payment of fees did not impede attendance by people from non-noble or non-gentry families. If we turn to the Oxford of the 17th century, a period of great growth before the decadence for which Gibbon's account is noted, we find exactly the same controversies in relation to fees as exist now--except that it was then charitable foundations for livery companies and not public money that was involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para16"></a>It is clearly not possible to change the system overnight. One has to realise that, if the subsidy for college fees were to be abolished over a year or so, it would mean a number of colleges going bankrupt and others being forced to part with members of staff; it would mean that places would have to be filled by those who could afford, out of their pockets or their parents' pockets, to pay the fees. The effect would be contrary to that which the proponents of this change seem to envisage.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para17"></a>Nor is it possible, as some people occasionally think, to meet the difficulty by the redistribution of money between colleges. It is true that some colleges are wealthy by comparison with others; but they are often obliged to spend their income on particular aspects. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Oxford, who will speak in the debate, will be aware that a great deal of Christ Church's money goes to the upkeep of his splendid cathedral, its services and its choir. That cannot be transferred, let us say, to a college such as Mansfield, of which I am an honorary fellow, which lives entirely on what it receives from the students whom it educates.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para18"></a>There are schemes by which, gradually, capital is being moved from richer to poorer colleges. However, that is a long drawn out process and we are talking not about capital but about income. Most people know the difference. I am not sure that everyone does, but most do. That is not a way out.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para19"></a>It is probable--here I speak not as the voice of the university, which I know is very divided on this matter--that in the long run, when there is a total recosting of the financing of British higher education--as it were, the post-Dearing years--Oxford and Cambridge will be obliged to rely more and more on private funds, whether through benefactions, endowment or the payment of higher fees, compensated for, as is done in American universities, by a generous scholarship system. I do not regard that as outrageous. All I think one can say this afternoon is that, if that is to be the future, time is needed to prepare for it. A sudden <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>upheaval, which would bankrupt a number of colleges, is no way to prepare for the future. My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Plant of Highfield: </B>   My Lords, first I must declare a direct interest as Master of St. Catherine's College in the University of Oxford. I wondered whether it was appropriate for me to speak in the debate in the light of that interest but I thought it might be useful for someone at the sharp end of these issues to comment upon them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para20"></a>It seems to me that there are two principles to be considered here. The first is that differential funding needs to be publicly justified and periodically reviewed, and I am sure that the Government are right to do that. Secondly, if there is to be differential public funding, there should be the highest degree of equality of opportunity to secure access to the benefits of such funding.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para21"></a>Before discussing the issues in terms of those two points, I should like to put the issue of college fees in context. I have to speak of Oxford but I am sure that most of what I say applies equally to Cambridge. In Oxford, college fees provide over 50 per cent. of the income for 18 colleges. In some cases that rises to 70 per cent. or more. There is no doubt that terminating the government payment of fees is a very serious matter which bears on the survival of some colleges in Oxford, and I am sure that the same is true for Cambridge.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para22"></a>What is the defence for differential funding? First, there is no doubt that Oxford and Cambridge are world-class universities in research terms. That is not to deny that there are others in the United Kingdom. That judgment is not based on Oxbridge self-regard or self-congratulation but on the funding council's own research assessment exercise which found that 92 per cent. of all academic full-time staff in Oxford were in the highest grade departments--that is to say, 5 or 5*.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para23"></a>The critic of college fees will say that, while that is true, it is wholly irrelevant because Oxford and Cambridge receive extra money from HEFCE because of their research excellence; college fees, in contrast, are about teaching. That is, however, a fallacy. Research in Oxford and Cambridge is embedded in a collegiate structure which is bound to be more expensive and will not survive if college fees disappear.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para24"></a>There are close links between college structure and research performance. Posts are jointly funded between the university and the colleges and involve shared facilities. Colleges pay a percentage of the cost of lecturers of various kinds in the university. In the case of CUF lecturers, colleges pay 60 per cent. of the cost of 400 academic posts and 16 per cent. of the costs of other university lecturers. Colleges fund research fellowships, junior research fellowships, graduate studentships and graduate scholarships from their own income. Those commitments to research will decline or disappear if fees are not to be reimbursed to colleges. In addition, colleges provide research funds for their own fellows, which in turn sustains or enhances the world-class performance of the universities. Colleges <P>


<a name="column_161"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 161</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>also play a significant role in providing facilities for visiting researchers from the United Kingdom and overseas to enable them to pursue their research. There is an intimate relationship between the research performance of Oxbridge and the collegiate system.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para25"></a>In addition, there is a defence to be made--as the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, has done--of the college tutorial structure. I would not want to say that the tutorial system is the only excellent way of teaching undergraduates since that would be a denial of my own teaching experience in other universities over 27 years. Nevertheless, I believe it produces a high standard and a very challenging academic environment which fits neatly into the Dearing Committee's concern for diversity. It obviously attracts high-calibre applicants in that our average A-level score of 29 points compares with an average of 18.8 points elsewhere. We have, as the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, said, a very low drop-out rate. We have a very good employment record, with only 2.6 per cent. of graduates unemployed six months after graduation compared to the national average of 8 per cent. Of the university professors listed in Who's Who, 67 per cent. were educated at Oxford or Cambridge. If I may be parochial for a moment to illustrate the benefits of the tutorial system--for which I do not make wholly exclusive claims--my own college, founded in 1962, has produced three Nobel prize winners and 12 Fellows of the Royal Society among its alumni. That is a fairly decent result for a young college based upon the tutorial system. Overall, in terms of both teaching and research, Oxford offers a very good public/private partnership: the Government put in &#163;19 million in fees and the colleges contribute &#163;43 million to academic purposes.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para26"></a>What will happen if the Government decide not to reimburse fees? I think it would be a very naive view to suggest that colleges would carry on more or less as before. By and large, individual colleges at the lower end of the scale do not have the resources to increase their income to the extent that would be necessary. My own college would have to produce about &#163;900,000 a year more. It cannot do that by taking more overseas students; it cannot do it by increasing conference attendance; it certainly cannot do it by increasing its endowment, which would have to double the size achieved over 35 years.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para27"></a>Where is the money to come from? The only way in which colleges as individual institutions could cover the costs would be to continue to charge fees to undergraduates even when they were no longer reimbursed by the state. I believe that that policy would be little short of disastrous in terms of access and it would be a very odd outcome for the Government that I support to produce. It has been suggested that the Government are contemplating legislation to prevent colleges from continuing to charge fees, which they have in many cases charged for centuries and which, as I understand it, they have a common law right to do as chartered corporations. I should like to ask my noble friend specifically whether she is contemplating introducing legislation to prevent colleges from charging fees. Like the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, I do not believe that there is a pot of gold in Oxford to rescue <P>


<a name="column_162"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 162</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the poorer colleges. The endowments for colleges were declared to HEFCE in the recent negotiations with them, and the university and the colleges have offered an independent audit of the endowment structure in Oxford to show that there is no such pot of gold.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para28"></a>I believe that any alternative to the existing system will make Oxford more socially exclusive. I am passionately concerned with equality of opportunity. I was brought up in a poor area; I failed my 11-plus; and I went to a secondary modern school. It was only because I lived in the 1960s, when there were plenty of opportunities available, that I was able to go to university and eventually make an academic career for myself. Any alternative to the existing system will cause Oxford and Cambridge to embody a denial of greater equality of access. The existing fees should be retained but they should be dependent upon Oxford and Cambridge, showing by a report to the funding council or the Department for Education and Employment that they are doing all that they can to increase access for the poorest groups of students.

<A NAME="71112-04_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I look forward warmly to the maiden speeches of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ely and the noble Lord, Lord Baker of Dorking. I also look forward warmly to the speech of my noble friend Lord Jenkins of Hillhead. The chancellorship of Oxford is an institution about a generation older than Parliament. It would not be easy to rank the chancellors in order of merit; but, were it possible to draw up a short list of chancellors since Robert Grosseteste, I think my noble friend would be high on the list.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para29"></a>Like others, I must declare a variety of interests, all of them non-pecuniary save for my ordinary and regular salary. I am a graduate of the University of Oxford; I am an honorary fellow of Merton, my old college, an honour in which I take great pride; I am a professor at King's College, London, and would not wish to imply by anything I say that my colleagues' standards in teaching and research are in any way lower than those at Oxford. My noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire, of the London School of Economics, is unable to take part in the debate because he is travelling to a meeting in Luxembourg, but he asked me to ensure that that message was heard from both sides of the Aldwych. I have also taught at Yale which, by any calculation, is Oxford's equal in standards of teaching and research. But despite attempts to create it, it does not have the Oxford college tutorial system and that makes a very considerable difference.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para30"></a>Sir Ron Dearing's tests for a higher level of provision for particular places are, first, an approved difference in the provision of education and, secondly, good use of resources. By "good use" Sir Ron, as I understand it, means value for money in comparative terms. Those are fair tests. It is my contention that Oxford and Cambridge pass them, but it is no part of the wording of this Motion to assert that nobody else passes them. The key difference as regards Oxford and Cambridge is the residential college system. Other places have colleges; other places, including my own college, have tutorials. <P>


<a name="column_163"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 163</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>What is unique is the combination of the two: the teaching inside the residential community which means that a better undergraduate education is provided irrespective of the quality of the teaching, because not all education happens inside tutorials or lectures. Education happens, as it did in Plato's Republic, whenever two or three people are gathered together with a glass of wine or a cup of coffee or whatever other liquid seems congruous. Education happens in conversation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para31"></a>In Oxford and Cambridge we have universities uniquely run according to the principle of subsidiarity--decisions are taken at the lowest possible suitable level. That is a good principle. Its excellence shows in the decisions taken inside the university appointments. It creates cross-subject communities. People often complain about the division of departments. My son, when he was three, used to refer to the "history compartment". I fear he was not quite as wrong as I would have liked to think. But in Oxford and Cambridge this does not happen. People regularly sit down to talk every day with people concerned with other subjects and from other countries. One of the biggest differences between Oxford and Yale is that Oxford is a genuinely international community. I never got over the shock at Yale academic ceremonies of watching a national flag flying. It seemed to me remarkably like a contradiction in terms. And when I go and address a meeting in Sri Lanka and find that the man in the chair, the chairman of the Sri Lanka Bar Council, is the man whom I used to address as "Mr. President, sir" in the union when I was an undergraduate, I feel that my point is confirmed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para32"></a>Also, of course, there is a vital interest here in research. The tutorial system takes a great deal of time, and although my experience is like that of the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, I was taught by those who had written the books. I was also taught by younger people, many of whom are now fellows of the British Academy. This was not second-rate teaching. The junior research fellowships in Oxford and Cambridge are something in which I believe there is a national interest. They are vital to a system of preferment in just the same way, if the right reverend Prelates will forgive me, as curacies are to the Church, because the best livings do not become vacant when the best candidates are ready for them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para33"></a>Were the junior research fellowships to disappear, it would be necessary to double the number of British Academy post-doctoral fellows, at the very least, and that would be a considerable extra charge on public funds.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para34"></a>Some say that the argument I have been putting forward is elitist. I think they should think through that argument. Nobody, so far as I know, is recommending a universal system of higher education up to the age of 21. We agree that there must be selection. Nobody, so far as I know, is suggesting that that selection should be done on anything other than merit. So if you defend those two propositions are you in any position to condemn elitism?

When I hear the phrase "the right reverend Prelate", I still look round to see who is being addressed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para36"></a>Participation in this debate is mandatory for someone who has spent the major part of his life in universities, and who for 19 years both learnt and taught in the University of Cambridge. Bishops of Ely are bound to confess a personal interest in view of the fact that ex-officio they hold visitorships in three of these colleges.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para37"></a>When I was a young don it was often said in the college that one had to be on one's guard against episcopal interference. Indeed, when a row broke out, I was assured by an older colleague that the mere threat of referring the matter to the visitor was sufficient to bring the fellows to their senses. I am happy to say that so far that unflattering maxim has remained true in my own case.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para38"></a>If I were to make a very brief and conventionally uncontroversial intervention in this important debate, I should like to draw upon my experience of having left the University of Cambridge for a chair in the University of Durham where I spent 11 very happy years. That journey taught me a great deal about the contrasts and comparisons between universities and it forced me to confront, in a rather sharp and personal way, the inequality of provision, especially at the collegiate level.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para39"></a>I left a St. John's College, which had a new building built, thanks to a wonderful benefaction, to several times UGC specifications, and I joined, in the University of Durham, a St. John's College where there was anxious debate about whether the college could afford new duvet covers.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para40"></a>My faith has a good deal to say on the subject of envy but during those 11 years, which became increasingly challenging as the university reforms of the early '80s took effect, I might have been forgiven for casting envious eyes at the funding arrangements further south.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para41"></a>In the faculty in Durham of which I was a member we actually did teach in small groups, and shortly after I left in the mid-80s that had to be abandoned because of the pressures of numbers. But in Cambridge, with the added protection of the college fee, that was and is still possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para42"></a>In singling out one or more institutions for special praise, one of course appears to be dispraising others. In my case I would find that quite simply impossible, all the more so because there are two universities in Cambridge which is also host to one of the sites of the Anglia Polytechnic University. I have learnt to respect, <P>


<a name="column_165"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 165</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>very deeply, the work of those who teach and encourage students not of top flight ability, or who take risks with people from unconventional backgrounds. There are simply too many places of excellence in the universities of this country for anyone to imagine that medieval foundations, centuries long benefaction, and a tradition of autonomy were the necessary conditions for first-rate achievement.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para43"></a>It is from that standpoint that I would like to pay my own tribute to the institutions of proven excellence which are the subject of our debate this afternoon. I would like to single out in particular, as other speakers have done, the contribution made by the colleges in particular, which my predecessors in the see took such pains to found and to endow. Were they places of backward-looking complacency, they would of course be quite indefensible. But in my experience they deploy their autonomy and their resources, in the main, responsibly and imaginatively.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para44"></a>I should like to refer especially to the encouragement the colleges are able to give to younger scholars on the brink of academic careers, in those very uncertain years between the completion of a Ph.D and taking their first academic appointment. The colleges compete vigorously with each other to attract and nurture the best talent they can find, and they offer them vital opportunities for small group teaching as well as support in research, scholarship and publication.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para45"></a>No former fellow of a Cambridge college or a visitor is likely to be unaware or completely innocent of at least two other of the deadly sins, those of pride and gluttony. But there are ways in which a traditional institution can be reminded, chivvied and goaded into virtuous behaviour; and continuous innovation has, as a matter of fact, been a characteristic of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. I am very proud that one of my predecessors saw fit to confer the title of "Universitas" on the society of scholars who fled from Oxford, for very good reasons, in the 13th century; and that another founded the first college in Cambridge later in that century, pro utilitate rei publice.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para46"></a>The test of the public good must surely be the key to this important debate. My hope would be that an appropriately non-partisan way can be found in the current review so that excellence can be encouraged to the benefit of the whole higher education system.

<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para48"></a>In my case this was not only Oxbridge. I graduated from the University of Leeds and have attended in various capacities other universities in this country and in the United States. I am deeply indebted to all of them. However, the benefit that I gained from my nine years in Cambridge, immediately after the war, as a student and later as a young don, stands out as the greatest good fortune in my life.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para49"></a>As has been emphasised many times, two of the special qualities of education at Oxbridge are the colleges and their associated tutorial and supervision systems. These do add to the cost of students' fees but the extra cost is very small compared with the value added. It would be a niggling false economy to eliminate a system that has proved itself such a success, provided always that we do our best to ensure that extra public funding for special education goes to the people most likely to contribute to the future of their university and the world, whether they are at Oxbridge or not.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para50"></a>The smaller unit of the college makes it possible for a member to participate in a very wide range of academic, social and sporting activities. In this respect the colleges provide a healthy antidote to the elitism of the big blues of the university teams while offering the opportunity for those with special talents in any field, probably unrecognised talents, to discover their potential.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para51"></a>In the academic sphere the college tutorial system was where I first obtained a real understanding of science, in a manner which is not always recognised as one of the virtues of the system. Education is a two-way process in which the teacher often learns as much as the taught.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para52"></a>The system would be even more expensive, or probably impossible, without employing research students and junior dons to carry out the supervision. Here I differ slightly perhaps from the noble Lord, Lord Beloff. In my case I gave six tutorials a week, for six years, with one or two students at a time. It was the hardest school of learning I ever entered, and undoubtedly the best.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para53"></a>Does the system work, and is it worth the expense? When our descendants in the next millennium are asked what permanent contributions did our 20th century generation make to the history of mankind, it will be difficult to find anything that surpasses the advances such as those in medicine referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, or in the physical and biological sciences, such as those that have flourished, and flourish still, in Cambridge. Nothing compares with the development of particle and nuclear physics at the Cavendish laboratory in the first half of this century, beginning exactly 100 years ago with J.J. Thomson's discovery of the electron. In the second half of this century, nothing compares with the development of molecular biology, which owed so much to Lawrence Bragg and his refugee collaborator Max Perutz, again at the Cavendish laboratory, and their colleagues Crick and Watson of the genetic code, Fred Sanger, who won two Nobel prizes, and the many who followed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para54"></a>What is the explanation of this phenomenal success at Cambridge? It is that excellence breeds excellence. No one questions the need for centres of excellence in <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>sport, music and the arts and few would wish to level out our sports teams by setting aside our fastest sprinters until the slow ones catch up. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, referred to this factor in another way. The encouragement of excellence in the sciences, and their applications, is at the heart of national achievement not only of our culture but of our health and wealth. If a precious asset such as Cambridge science is lost, it may never be recovered.

<A NAME="71112-04_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Baker of Dorking: </B>   My Lords, it is a great honour for me to be making my first speech in your Lordships' House, and particularly on a Motion moved by my noble friend Lord Beloff. As he said, we were both taught by the same history teacher. That teacher was a good deal more successful in instilling scholarly academic excellence in my noble friend than in me. I am particularly glad to be speaking on the question of Oxford and Cambridge fees.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para55"></a>Perhaps I may begin by saying that in 1988 it fell to me to bring before both Houses of Parliament what was then a very controversial education Bill. Fortunately, it is not controversial now. The different parties in our country have accepted virtually all the parts of it. That I welcome because I think that, on the whole, if one could drain party politics out of education, there would be a great benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para56"></a>That government had a large majority in the Commons, as this Government have a large majority in the Commons, and so one had no trouble getting the Bill through the House of Commons. The trouble was this House. I spent a great deal of time down this end of the corridor, particularly on the matters of higher education. I think it is fair to say that the only major changes in that Bill came about as a result of the debates and the views expressed in this House. So I hope that the noble Baroness will be as sympathetic and responsive as I was all those years ago because the collective wisdom in this House in higher education, some of which has already been displayed this afternoon, is remarkable and much better than in the House of Commons.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para57"></a>In a way I am surprised that this issue has become so prominent. The Dearing Report had 93 recommendations. This was not a particularly important recommendation from the Dearing Report. The Funding Council is asked by that report to address 19 different matters and suddenly this matter is catapulted to the head of the queue and one begins to wonder why. I suspect that it is probably because of the Treasury. It has an eagle eye for picking pockets and this is quite a good pocket to pick (&#163;35 million) particularly when the head of the Treasury, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has made some quite strong and adverse comments about Oxford and Cambridge. I am rather surprised that such a politician would do that. An equivalent politician in America would never criticise Yale, Princeton, Harvard, Chicago or Stanford. The land of the brave and the free has no trouble with elitism. The sum of &#163;35 million sounds a lot of money, but in relation to the full expenditure on higher education in our country each year, which is &#163;10 <P>


<a name="column_168"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 168</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>billion, it represents 0.35 per cent. If one were to spread &#163;35 million of college fees around the 181 institutions of higher education in our country, each would get &#163;193,000.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para58"></a>It would tax the imagination of even the most dedicated egalitarian to believe that by giving a new university &#163;193,000 one would transfer it by that act alone into a world-class institution. It would take much more; many years and many decades. So I hope that that will not happen. The latest proposal that has been leaked is that the money will not be spread so widely over the 181 institutions, but that a fund will be set up to which other institutions can bid for teaching excellence. I am not against that; it would be an admirable idea, but not at the expense of Oxford and Cambridge. I believe that teaching excellence should be recognised. There are other universities in our country which are world-class apart from Oxford and Cambridge. There are different departments in some other universities which are world-class. They should bid for it. I say to the noble Baroness that if she is going to set up such a scheme she should be very patient because a scheme to assess research excellence, which is much more objective, has taken nearly 10 years to settle down. If she were to devise a scheme which was to be very subjective as to which university taught better than another, she would have to make it very robust to sustain the bickering and in-fighting at which all universities excel. I have no doubt that the college fees should remain with Oxford and Cambridge.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para59"></a>Some mention has been made of the difficulties of the smaller colleges. I believe that some would become insolvent and some would go bankrupt. Again, I would not wish that on the noble Baroness. I had to deal with a university which almost went bankrupt. I can tell her that it is a very messy affair and that it is much more expensive at the end than at the beginning. So I encourage her not to pursue a policy which would lead to that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para60"></a>I believe that on the whole it would be better to leave well alone. Oxford and Cambridge are both widening access the entire time. I was the first member of my family to go to university and I went to Oxford. Since then access has been much wider and both universities are extending access each year. Therefore, I hope that the Government will rethink this policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para61"></a>At the moment they are setting great store on new Britain. It is a new approach. They are positioning Britain as a young, dynamic country. I find it a little strange that in this great desire to reposition Britain we are going to make ourselves the home of tobacco-sponsored Formula One racing while undermining Oxford and Cambridge.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para62"></a>Finally, I say this. If the Government decide to persist in this policy and they take away college fees from the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, they will have to provide some means for the colleges to raise that money themselves. Natural justice surely will lead us to accept that if one denies or takes away from an institution a certain amount of money to which it has been entitled, one should not deny it the chance by legislation to raise the money in other ways. It is like making someone <P>


<a name="column_169"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 169</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>walk the plank and then introducing legislation that they should not be thrown a lifeline. I am not particularly advocating top-up fees. In fact, as the noble Lord, Lord Plant, said, that would make Oxford even more elitist, as it were. But that may well be the policy that the colleges will have to follow. I say to the noble Baroness that the colleges are old corporate institutions and have rights which go back a long way. To take away their right to charge fees, particularly when the Government are incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into our own domestic legislation, will lead the Government into something of a mess. I hope very much that the Government will take cognisance of what has been said in this debate this afternoon and decide that, as we are fortunate enough in having great institutions like Oxford and Cambridge, built up by centuries of devotion and scholarship, we should not harm them. You do not improve the worst by hitting at the best.

<A NAME="71112-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Morris of Castle Morris: </B>   My Lords, on behalf of the whole House may I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Baker, on a brilliant maiden speech. I would of course have expected no less from someone who has occupied so many of the senior offices of state and who has even given his name to a day. Training days for staff in all our state schools are invariably known now as "Baker Days". So we look forward to hearing a great deal more from the Lord with a day to his name.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para63"></a>I now propose to do something that I have never done in your Lordships' House before. I propose to make a short speech slowly. Each Oxford and Cambridge college is autonomous. That is recognised by HEFCE's refusal to give full weight in the research assessment exercise to college-based researchers who were not also university employees. That was treating them like convicts in Dartmoor required to sew mailbags for nothing. But even if colleges themselves cease to receive money from the state, either through fees or otherwise, they will continue to benefit from the funds which the state provides to their two universities. Even apart from the payments for the services which a college provides for the university, most of the earned income of a typical college fellow is provided by the university. Colleges will therefore remain accountable to the country for their policies and in particular for their admissions policies.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para64"></a>Both Oxford and Cambridge admit more undergraduates from the independent sector than from the state sector, yet even among the school leavers with three "A"s at A-level, there are many more from the state sector than from the independent sector. Oxbridge colleges argue that they can only admit those who apply to them and many of the best students from state schools do not apply. That is true. The usual reason for that is that they believe that Oxbridge would not welcome them. Colleges must therefore make a greater effort to attract such students even if it means admitting fewer of those students who are photographed each summer staggering out of their final examinations clutching their Moet et Chandon or their Veuve Cliquot.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para65"></a>The cost of college fees at Oxford and Cambridge is presumably now a charge on the overall higher education budget and thus the fees are in direct competition with the other needs of higher education. It is therefore logical to place on the Higher Education Funding Council the responsibility for taking account of the collegiate structures of these two universities, whether through the college fees or otherwise. That would involve adding to the existing block grant to that council the &#163;35 million which college fees currently cost.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para66"></a>The University Grants Committee was set up after the First World War to ensure that while the government provided financial support to the university system, Ministers could not show favouritism between one university and another. In the legislation which transformed the UGC first into the UFC and then into the three higher education funding councils, one consistent theme has been that Ministers must not influence the distribution of block grant to individual universities. Indeed, their general power to give directions to the funding council specifically excludes any power to give directions about the level of funding of any individual university. That is a matter for the funding councils--and for the funding councils alone. Ministers can properly be concerned with the mode by which the two collegiate universities are funded, although I believe that even that would be better left to the funding council.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para67"></a>My noble friend the Minister responsible for higher education has asked the Higher Education Funding Council for England to report to her on the future funding of Oxford and Cambridge. It is hard to believe that that is simply idle curiosity. There is widespread concern that she may be about to breach the spirit of the legislation and perhaps even the letter of it. This House is entitled to expect from her an assurance that she will not seek to influence in any way the decisions of the funding council about the grants to individual universities, whether Oxford, Cambridge or any other.

<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para68"></a>Before discussing the topic under consideration, I fear that I must declare an interest. I have been the head of a Cambridge college for the past 23 years and a professor of chemistry at Cambridge for 25 years. My college, which is the most recent foundation in Cambridge, would certainly fall into the so-called "poor" class of college and we are heavily dependent on college fees to maintain teaching and research programmes. Like the noble Lord, Lord Porter of Luddenham, I have had experience of teaching at other universities. I have taught at five other universities in this country. I am not a graduate of either Oxford or Cambridge. As a chemist, I have had the opportunity to visit at least 35 chemistry departments as an external <P>


<a name="column_171"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 171</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>adviser, so I think that I can speak with a certain degree of expertise at least with regard to chemistry in this country.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para69"></a>What worries me in part about today's debate is that terrible misconceptions occur with regard to what really happens at Oxford and Cambridge. Indeed, those misconceptions almost verge on myths. Perhaps I may quote Claude Bernard:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is what we think we know that keeps us from knowing". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para70"></a>I am afraid that, in many instances, that is one of the problems facing us today.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para71"></a>I should like to become domestic and to focus my remarks on two areas: the relationship between the colleges and the position of postgraduate courses in the university at both the teaching and the research degree level--it is extremely easy to say that the colleges have little influence in that area--and on the position of overseas students, which has not yet been touched on in your Lordships' debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para72"></a>I turn first to the situation with regard to chemistry. The chemistry department in Cambridge is arguably one of the top three or four chemistry departments in the world. I am sure that others may disagree. When we make comparisons, it is with places such as Harvard, Berkeley and other such institutions. One of the strengths within the department is its close relationship with other science departments in the university and the degree of interdisciplinary work that is being carried out. The college system is one of the most effective mechanisms for facilitating interaction between the various workers. I have a group that works in part in chemistry and in part at the Cavendish physics laboratory on a topic. The generation of such interaction was very much due to collegiate sources.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para73"></a>Perhaps I should emphasise that in my other universities it was often difficult to interact with other departments. Indeed, professorial standing was required before I was allowed into other departments. That makes the possibility of discussion extremely difficult for young junior members of staff. Many university departments--although not all, by any means--are independent and often verge on being isolated empires. In Oxbridge, the collegiate system provides an effective mechanism to overcome that isolationism.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para74"></a>It is important to appreciate that today major advances in the sciences are occurring at the interface between different disciplines. In Cambridge that is not a new phenomenon, as the noble Lord, Lord Porter, explained. Perhaps I may repeat one of his examples and refer to the solving of the DNA problem by Watson and Crick--a problem of biology which was solved in the department of physics. That is a typical example of how the collegiate system works, with its facility for undergraduate teaching and awards of fellowships. That is not an insignificant point. There are about 300 research fellowships in the university, with another 150 associated stipends coming from the colleges.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para75"></a>I turn now to the important matter of overseas students. I must again declare an interest in as much as I am the executive chairman of the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust and the Cambridge Overseas <P>


<a name="column_172"></a>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para76"></a>The university receives about 9,500 applications per year for research or higher degrees through its Board of Graduate Studies, of which between 5,500 and 6,000--that is, two-thirds--come from overseas students. In total, about 2,500 are admitted each year. I do not want to confuse the matter with figures, but seek to give an indication of the highly selective operation that applies. The standard is normally very high and we have some extremely good students. Last year, excluding the European scene and the Ukraine and Russia, participants came from about 85 different countries. That is not an insignificant representation. About 750 of those applicants were able to obtain some partial funding with the aid of Dr. Seal. That money is often obtained via the college system--not all of it, but certainly a significant amount. The ORS award scheme is a mechanism whereby the Government have agreed to pay the difference between the fee for overseas students and that for UK students. We have about 175 such awards. In 1993 there were about 320, but that number has been reduced to reflect government funding policy and is based on a quota system. Therefore, we now doubly need to earn more money to try to find the extra money for such students.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para77"></a>The success of the university in attracting overseas students is of considerable importance. The spheres of influence of overseas students will spread for many years to come. I believe that that is of major importance for this country. The two main areas of attraction for them are Oxbridge, if I may use the generic term, and London.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-04_para78"></a>Finally--I hope that your Lordships will excuse me for taking a little longer than is allowed--perhaps I may point out that the position with regard to college fees is not a new one. We have been discussing this for the past 20 years in various--<FONT SIZE=3><P>

For the first time in 50 years I do not have to declare an interest in taking part in a debate on universities. I am not a student, professor, chancellor, vice-chancellor or head of house, but I have a certain amount of experience and one or two relevant memories. One vivid memory is that of the late Lord Robbins nearly 24 years ago luring me from the fleshpots of Brussels to the more frugal if also more <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>wholesome fare of the London School of Economics. His legendary charm was certainly one element in my decision. Another was my abiding love for LSE. But there was something else. Almost without exception continental European universities had seriously declined as a result of policies introduced in the 1960s, whereas British universities had not only kept up their traditional strength but had emerged as the best in Europe. Indeed, they were the only ones to hold their own in comparison with the great American schools of Harvard and MIT, Columbia, Yale and Princeton, Chicago and California. The reason can be put in one simple statement: expansion without differentiation. That was the problem of continental universities, and it continues to be their problem. British universities remained strong because there was differentiation and expansion--at least the first wave was absorbed by a differentiated system.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para0"></a>Alas, since then matters have changed. The second wave of expansion 20 years later was almost a copy of the continental mistake. There was expansion of the universities without adding resources or adjusting the system. Instead of differentiation, a levelling process began. It started with the classless society, introduced ironically by a Conservative government, and that classless society was applied to higher education. Instead of 45 universities 10 years ago, today 90 universities are governed by the same legislation and funding principles. There remain, to be sure, some of the justly famous old Scottish universities, the major colleges of the University of London and Oxford and Cambridge.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para1"></a>When, having spent 10 years as director of the LSE, I went to Oxford as warden of St. Antony's College in 1987 for another decade of academic responsibility, I had no doubt that my college was one of the world's great graduate schools of international studies which thrived on being part of one of the top 10 universities anywhere. I still have no doubt that that is the case. Such excellence is expensive. When all is said and done about the value of tutorials and the attractions of college life, the simple truth remains that Oxford and Cambridge assemble a large number of outstanding academics in an environment of discourse and exploration with a relatively small number of high quality students. Almost nowhere else in the world are the chances for students and teachers to meet and inspire each other as great as in the ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge. This has to do with colleges and the value placed on teaching, but not least with numbers; that is (to use the jargon), an extremely favourable staff/student ratio.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para2"></a>I do not find it difficult to make the case for public support of excellence. A civilised country should be proud to have such institutions and do everything to keep them going. It was always a puzzle to me that throughout my past 20 years, first, as director of the LSE and then as warden of St. Antony's, inevitably I had to defend the places for which I was responsible to Prime Ministers and their Ministers for higher education. If an appeal to the values of a civilised country is not enough another point suggested by a lifetime of experience is that a system of higher education is as good as the best in it. Access is important. I have always defended education as a civil <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>right. That right loses all meaning if the places to which it provides access decline to the same drab mediocrity. Rights which fail to offer opportunities for choice become a sham if not a fraud.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para3"></a>Students from many continental countries come here to escape mediocrity at home. I hope that they will continue to do so, but they will continue to do so only if Oxford and Cambridge, London and the great universities of the country keep their quality. I believe that state measures to prevent colleges from raising their own revenue would be an outrage and an attack on liberty, quite apart from the implicit denial of quality. Thus, the very least that we can expect, if publicly-funded college fees have to go, is active encouragement for our great universities to charge fees which enable them to continue their quality teaching and leave enough to provide a place for those who cannot afford it. I am beginning to doubt whether in my lifetime I shall also see a government which actually express proud support for institutions like Oxford, Cambridge and other universities--institutions which when the Spice Girls have become grey panthers and the millennium dome has long been consigned to the scrapheap will still add lustre to Britain's name and spread the achievements of the country far and wide.

<P>
<A NAME="71112-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, that is a hard act to follow. I speak as an Oxford graduate from a state school who became principal of my college. We are debating whether the Government intend to withhold a total of &#163;35 million of college fees annually from our two great collegiate universities. To do so will do significant damage to institutions that are universally recognised for their academic excellence and innovative research. According to the Dearing Committee, it should be assumed that legislation will prevent the charging of a top-up fee, so the choice is between huge redundancies--since the colleges pay a large percentage of the stipend of most tenured academics and the university the balance--and the immediate raising of massive further endowment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para4"></a>Perhaps I may tell the House what that decision would mean for my own college, Somerville, together with at least a third of the other undergraduate colleges, the graduate colleges and the private halls. The women's and former women's colleges in particular do not have land or inherited wealth. They are young. We are only 118 years old. They have very small endowments which are dedicated entirely to specific matters: teaching, student need, research or the library. Ours is one of the best undergraduate libraries in Oxford. Their pots of gold are tiny and hard won. The college fees represent one-third of Somerville's annual income and are spent entirely on academic and academic-related stipends. The withdrawal of the fees can only lead to redundancies with their associated capital payments in academic staff because endowment money is tied. That would hit teaching, research and the supervision of graduates. Our junior research fellowships are funded by dedicated endowments. It will be said that the colleges should raise more endowment to replace the public contribution. At a rough guess Somerville alone would <P>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 175</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>need to raise endowments of some &#163;4 million to &#163;5 million to generate that money. It has worked hard to raise substantial sums to increase its endowment and has to continue to do so to stay solvent. It is difficult and takes a long time to raise money. Somerville would not be alone. The other poor colleges would be fund-rasing at exactly the same time.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para5"></a>If some colleges have to take the path of redundancies they would be forced to reduce their admissions to maintain the quality of teaching, and there would of course be a significant brain-drain of excellent academics. If any had to close, it is worth noting that more than 90 per cent. of undergraduates in Oxford live in college accommodation built from charitable endowment funds. College and university are so inter-dependent in terms of libraries, laboratories and teaching, that the loss of colleges would be a severe blow to the whole institution.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para6"></a>But what Government in their senses are going to unravel an institution such as Oxford which generated &#163;105 million in income from research grants and contracts last year; which has long attracted major industrial support; which produces Nobel prize winners and young firms like Oxford Instruments, Oxford Molecular and Isis Innovation; which is, like Cambridge, at the forefront of the information technology revolution and attracts the best graduates from the US and Europe as well as employing more research staff than any other British university?
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para7"></a>There are those who regard Oxford as exclusive and class-ridden. That is not true, and I can testify to the immense efforts made to attract candidates from state schools and the north, through open days, teachers' dinners, summer schools, the access scheme and, above all, the efforts of the undergraduates themselves, for they are making these efforts and always have done. With college encouragement and support, they regularly go out to schools which are not sending candidates to Oxford. Somerville has always prided itself on the high proportion of undergraduates who come from state schools, on average very nearly half; on its intake of mature students, it is one of the few colleges with a creche; and on its disabled and ethnic minorities. Time does not allow me to give figures, but they are there.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para8"></a>In my time as principal, one of the problems was, sadly, the dogmatic attitude of some teachers who thought that Oxford was "not for their children". That is not true either, but the prejudice is there. One of our undergraduates, who went on to get a First and a tenured academic post, was pilloried in her school by her teachers as a class traitor for trying for Oxford.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para9"></a>We are not fighting for those already privileged but to preserve the possibility of access to excellence of a special kind for the less privileged. Damaging the collegiate structure is putting at risk a national asset which belongs to all and which is an essential element in the diversity which the Government rightly support.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para10"></a>Many speakers have listed the formidable research and teaching successes. I do not propose to add to that except to remind you that 92 per cent. of the academic staff in Oxford scored five star or five in the research <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>assessment exercise. I think also of the brilliant, enterprising young undergraduates among whom my life was spent for nine years--not statistics but real people, our future. They came from every class and quarter, and many are working now, not to enrich themselves but to serve in NGOs, in medicine and in many other caring professions. Somerville--until lately a single-sex women's college but now flourishing in its new status--has produced many distinguished women. I want it to be able to continue to produce graduates of quality.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para11"></a>I cannot believe that any Government which believe in education and in success at what is known as the cutting edge, can seriously consider damaging or destroying one of the nation's greatest assets and the envy of the world. The strikers in the 1968 students' revolution in France came to Oxford to seek support from their peers. They went away saying to the Oxford students: "You already have everything we want, but most of all you can talk to your teachers whenever you wish".

<A NAME="71112-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, there is nothing so edifying than to listen to the rich claiming to be poor. I have had a great time. I have been unwashed by British education; I have not studied at Oxford or Cambridge or anywhere else. I have only taught at the London School of Economics. I have not heard more fallacies in my life than I have heard this afternoon.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para13"></a>We are talking about &#163;35 million--the Oxford and Cambridge income is much larger--and we are told that if you take this away the entire edifice from medieval days onwards will collapse; it is so delicate. Take a penny away and they will be poor.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para14"></a>The reason we are discussing this matter is the Dearing Report. The Dearing Committee was appointed because, as the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, said, in the past 15 years the financing of higher education in this country has been savaged--and let us not forget which government were responsible. The people who claim elite privileges have badly treated British higher education. In my first 15 years of teaching I did not have to worry about money, even at the LSE. In the past 17 years not a day has gone by when we are not struggling every day to finance students, to think about research and worry about redundancies.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Baker, in a typically uncontroversial speech--probably one of the most uncontroversial speeches he will ever make in this House--used the standard argument that the wealthy use against redistribution: "We do not really have that much money. If you divide our wealth among everybody they will only get a penny each. So please do not take this seriously".
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para16"></a>It is only &#163;193,000 for the 93 universities. Every year, however, it is "Give me &#163;193,000. I will be grateful. I will finance something like 20 graduate students, perhaps 30 undergraduate students. I will be able to finance maybe 10 junior lectureships at sweated wages. <P>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 177</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>That is about all we can afford to pay nowadays. Hurry, that is an awful lot of money for us". It may be small beer for Oxford and Cambridge.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para17"></a>A lot has been made about the excellence of the college system. I have taught in an excellent place. We do not have tutorials, and we do not do that badly. Oxford came first in the RA exercise because it conveniently omitted ten of its dead-wood persons; it only submitted 90 per cent. We submitted 98.5 per cent. at the LSE and we came second. If corrected for numbers submitted, we did better than Oxford. All that money is not producing all that is great and outstanding. It is outstanding, but we do better without that much money.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para18"></a>Colleges obviously duplicate costs--separate admissions, separate administrations. Small may be beautiful, but it is extremely cost ineffective. The question is, are Oxford and Cambridge worth that extra little bit? And we are talking about a little bit. We are not taking everything away--no such luck--we are talking about &#163;35 million. If that money is taken away, would the damage be so great that Oxford and Cambridge would cease to be universities of excellence? Compare them with the London colleges which do not get that &#163;35 million. How do we manage? We do manage, you know. Imperial College, unfortunately, has not been represented this afternoon, but it is very good in natural sciences. As far as economics is concerned, we at the LSE have more Nobel prizes than do Oxford and Cambridge; we can be excellent.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para19"></a>The self-indulgence of the rich Oxford and Cambridge colleges is to pretend that they should go on having privileges because they have always had them. It is not value added if you take the best students from around the world and make them slightly better. Value added is in the polytechnics, where you take people who have very little and you add a lot of value.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para20"></a>Nor does the access argument work. Let me put it this way. Everybody thinks that the working classes do not go to British universities because the fees are so high. That is a fallacy. Even when higher education access was free, there were no working class students in British universities. Why not? It has nothing to do with the level of fees. It has to do with the state of our secondary school education and the high leaving rate of 15 and 16 year-olds from the working classes.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-05_para21"></a>The level of fees has nothing to do with access. That is a fallacious argument. If Oxford and Cambridge were to charge double fees access would not be affected as much as people predict. That is a fallacy. That will not do. I believe that the &#163;35 million should be put up for national competition for teaching excellence--universities which have a good teaching record. We are now being valued and ranked all the time. Let the 10 best universities share the &#163;35 million. Then let us see how Oxford and Cambridge survive. Some of the colleges may shut. Oh dear! After having argued the need for a lean and fit British industry, when we allowed all sorts of things to go to the wall, the little Oxford colleges are to be protected. How sweet! Many universities further down in the education system will <P>

He came to the Bench of Bishops after a distinguished academic career, and it is good that we shall now have the benefit of his judicious mind in this House. I should like also to express my appreciation for the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Baker of Dorking. With his long experience of public life, he clearly has a great deal to offer to the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para0"></a>Like other noble Lords, I have close connections with both Oxford and Cambridge, but my relationship to the University of London is no less close or fond. Furthermore, within the Diocese of Oxford there are six universities, not just one, all of which matter. I am concerned with higher education as a whole, and do not believe that maintaining the particular excellence of Oxford and Cambridge should detract from, or be seen to detract from, the distinctive ethos and excellence of those other universities.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para1"></a>My first concern, if the extra money that Oxford and Cambridge at present receive is taken away or drastically reduced, is that inevitably they will become the preserve of the wealthy. I listened with great attention to the noble Lord, Lord Desai. The arguments he put forward have to be attended to carefully. He seemed to imply that if that money were taken away Oxford and Cambridge would collapse or a good number of colleges would collapse. That is not true. What will happen is that sooner or later they will be allowed to charge more, and they will merely become a club for the wealthy. That would mean excluding those other students who are there now on academic ability alone, because their parents would not be able to afford to pay that extra.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para2"></a>It would be sad if, as a result of government legislation, Oxford and Cambridge became a club for the relatively well off, with all that that would imply for future jobs and careers, an accentuation of the worst kind of elitism.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para3"></a>Then there is the college system. Students in London often have to make a long journey from halls of residence and digs. Colleges at Oxford and Cambridge <P>


<a name="column_179"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 179</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are situated at the heart of the university: indeed, they are the heart of the university. Those colleges seek to be places of genuine community, not just providers of accommodation. Cardinal Newman's vision in The Idea of a University is as important today as when it was first formulated. That vision is of people of different academic disciplines interacting with one another, learning to live with one another, that their minds and capacity to make sound judgment might be trained and prepared for a whole range of future contexts.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para4"></a>Colleges provide an environment in which students studying different subjects can discuss easily with one another and their teachers in a community of learning. As the Dearing Report put it:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We do not believe that students will in the future see themselves simply as customers of higher education but as members of a learning community". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para5"></a>That is an ideal for all universities, but it already exists at Oxford and Cambridge, and we should do nothing to destroy something so fundamental to the learning process and the future good of the country. Again, to quote Dearing, that personal contact between teachers and students, as well as between students themselves:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"gives a vitality, originality and excitement that cannot be provided by machine based learning, however excellent". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para6"></a>The second aspect of the collegiate system that I should like to emphasise--it is not one that has been touched on previously--is the opportunities that it provides to contribute to the wider community. Staff do that, and so do the students. In Oxford, undergraduates can go to places such as Blackbird Leas to help in literacy programmes. They can become involved with housing and homeless issues. Of course students everywhere can do that, and many do, but in a college, being of the nature of a community, it is possible to build up an ethos in which wider concerns become part of the very air that people breathe. It is not just a question of good dinners.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para7"></a>For 800 years the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge were primarily training grounds for the Anglican clergy and for Anglican laymen to serve the state. That is no longer so of course, but wider concerns, very often encouraged by the college chaplain, remain a part of that milieu.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para8"></a>I end with the point with which I began--there are different kinds of excellence. We do not serve those other kinds by weakening the distinctive quality which Oxford and Cambridge have to offer: that distinctive quality integrally related to the college system. The noble Lord, Lord Desai, suggested that the money saved by that &#163;35 million could purchase a certain number of junior lecturers or research students. I should like to bet that were that &#163;35 million taken away it would not be redistributed in such a way. All of us, whichever universities we represent, should be fighting together to improve the quality of university education as a whole in this country. We should stand together on that. We do not serve the cause of all other universities by thinking that Oxford and Cambridge can lose with impunity &#163;35 million. It would be a highly retrograde step if, in the future, those colleges could be afforded only by the wealthy.

I also express my gratitude and that of the whole House to my noble friend Lord Beloff for having raised the subject at this time, before the Government's intentions reach concrete form. As yet, there have been only rude and rough warning noises off stage which are a cause of concern. Of course, people make strange speeches on windy days at the seaside in October, but the attitude of the Chancellor of the Exchequer at Brighton appeared to give cause for concern.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para10"></a>Your Lordships may be aware--I was not until recently--of a gem of a remark made by no less a person than the chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council. He said that colleges must learn,

<A NAME = "71112-06_para11"></a>It is sad to think that anyone who is remotely connected with education would lower himself to using such appalling language.

<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para12"></a>It has rightly been said that colleges are not mere halls of residence; they are places and institutions of teaching in which people grow up and receive all kinds of unknown and almost intangible benefits. It seems to me that they seek to provide the best for those whom a rigorous system of selection has indicated as being the best. That is said to be elitism. It seems to me that a nation which does not have an elite--and I do not refer to an elite of birth--and is unable to develop one will be very much the poorer for it. Perhaps without causing the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, any great offence I may say that from listening to her speak, observing the way in which she bears herself and the authority which she has developed she is obviously a member of the elite, although one which has surprisingly strayed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para13"></a>There are those who believe not only in fairness in the sense of equality for all, but who wish to go further and to have absolute equality in that if a good thing is not available to everyone nobody shall have it.

He made a practice of kidnapping people. Those who were too long for the bed were cut down to size and those who were too short were stretched until they achieved the necessary dimensions.

<A NAME = "71112-06_para14"></a>I wish to be reasonably careful in what I say. I have heard from sources both in Oxford and Cambridge that the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, is not regarded as an impartial judge in these matters; that on too many occasions she has declared her own hostility to Oxford and Cambridge and to the colleges therein. I hope that in winding up she will say that she has none of those feelings and I will gladly accept that denial.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para15"></a>Oxford and Cambridge colleges are not halls of residence, nor are they centres of wealth and privilege, despite what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Desai, and others. Some of them are very poor and I propose to conclude my remarks by quoting from a letter which I received from the Master of Fitzwilliam College, one of the poorer colleges of Cambridge. He pointed out that 70 per cent. of its students come from the state sector and that college fees amount to 40 per cent. of its income. He gave the interesting fact that 800 people were interviewed for 135 places for October this year. No government money goes to upkeep, maintenance or improvement of the buildings. That does not indicate any great excessive privilege.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para16"></a>I wish to quote two sentences from the master's letter. First, he stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We consider our students excellent, also they are an elite, but an academic elite, not a social elite as often implied by that much abused word.". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para17"></a>The second sentence states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is my belief that the Oxford and Cambridge colleges provide a unique and superlative tutorial system which, together with learning opportunities supplied in the two Universities, provide the best education available in the UK and, arguably, in the world". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para18"></a>I earnestly hope that the Government will not allow themselves to be swayed by the understandable prejudices and meannesses of those who would seek to take the guts out of venerable but useful and valuable institutions, which are the envy of the world. If they do so, they will be much blamed for a very long time to come.

<A NAME="71112-06_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Lockwood: </B>   My Lords, I usually enjoy very much the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, but I regret his personal attack on my noble friend the Minister, who has a reputation for looking at issues objectively. The issue that we are debating today is important and I hope that all of us can subscribe to the sentiment of safeguarding the future of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. But the debate must also be about diversity, quality and, I suggest, equity.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para19"></a>Diversity has been one of the strengths of our higher education system and one which I hope will continue. But there are a number of factors in that diversity. The collegiate system, with its individual tutorials, is one; no doubt the oldest and most valued, especially by those who have benefited from it. Others have developed in more recent times, but are no less valuable for that. As the higher education sector has expanded more centres of excellence have emerged, as was said by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ely in his most thoughtful and welcome maiden speech.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para20"></a>Some universities have specialised and excelled in particular subjects in both teaching and research, without the resources of Oxford and Cambridge. There has been emphasis on new technologies by the former CATs; innovation in new subjects of real relevance to today's world; and widening links abroad--Oxford and Cambridge are by no means the only universities which have important links abroad--either by students coming here or by taking our higher education system to other countries. There have been strengthened links with industry in general and with particular companies.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para21"></a>Most universities have their own strengths and specialities which are perceived by students in making their choice of institution, sometimes to the surprise of their parents. In all that, the strengths of Oxford and Cambridge are apparent in both research and in the best of the teaching in those institutions. They stand high by international standards of excellence and bring a prestige which reflects on the system as a whole.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para22"></a>Therefore, the question is: how can we safeguard that situation without prejudicing the fairness, universality and equity of the funding system? In putting their case, advocates of Oxford and Cambridge say that &#163;35 million is minuscule when compared with the total HE budget. Equally, it is minuscule when compared with the collective wealth of those two universities. Or, to put the matter in another way, it is equal, for example, to the total income from funding council grants for 1995-96 to the University of Durham, which also has a collegiate system.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para23"></a>I know that not all colleges are wealthy, especially the women's colleges, as the noble Baroness, Lady Park, reminded us. But we are discussing universities as an entity, and surely there is a responsibility on the central body to assist those which are not so wealthy. I was glad to learn from the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, in his opening remarks, that steps are being taken to do that. But in the light of that and in the light of the decline in the unit of resource by something like 40 per cent. and the pending introduction of the &#163;1,000 student tuition fee, the claims of Oxford and Cambridge must be balanced.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para24"></a>Dearing was aware of the complexity of the situation and recommended that the position of the two universities be reviewed by HEFCE in the light of the two principles set out in recommendation No. 74. The Government have done that, and in a press release dated 5th November, the funding council also signalled that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it would wish to consider, as one of its new initiatives, introducing a premium for teaching quality. This would be applied across the higher education sector in England, benefiting the two universities and other institutions offering excellent provision.". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para25"></a>That might go some way--I do not suggest it would go the whole way--to help to safeguard the position of Oxford and Cambridge and, at the same time, would address an important measure of quality in our system. The noble Lord, Lord Baker, whose maiden speech was robust and perhaps a little controversial, indicated that there could be problems in establishing an effective system of measuring quality. That may be so, but it is essential that we introduce such a system as soon as possible and all the partners in the higher education system are wedded to that concept.

<A NAME = "71112-06_para26"></a>Therefore, I hope that when the funding council brings its advice in the very near future, it will be possible to resolve the position of Oxford and Cambridge without breaking the principle of equity but without destroying the quality of those two universities.

<P>
<A NAME="71112-06_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Perry of Southwark: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Beloff for providing us with this opportunity to debate the future of the universities at Oxford and Cambridge. We have been privileged to hear two outstanding maiden speeches today.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para27"></a>Like other noble Lords, I must declare a personal interest both as graduate of the University of Cambridge and an honorary fellow of my old college, Girton, and now as president of Lucy Cavendish College in the University of Cambridge. Unlike some of my noble friends, I have total confidence that this Government, and in particular the Minister, are committed to sustaining excellence wherever it is found. The Minister's previous distinguished record in higher education puts that beyond doubt.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para28"></a>I see today in the newspapers headlines about the Oxbridge gold-plated towers. That is not the experience of my college. Lucy Cavendish College is dedicated wholly to increasing access for mature women. It was founded in 1965 and by a happy stroke of timing, it received its Royal Charter from Her Majesty yesterday, thus replacing the college of the noble Lord, Lord Lewis, as Cambridge's newest college. It has by far the single largest concentration of mature women within the university and that makes it an irreverent, vibrant and exciting place to work. We have no high table; the fellows are called by their first names and are indistinguishable in age from the students.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para29"></a>The students come from a variety of backgrounds and each has a powerful story to tell. It is an unusual woman who, at the age of 30, 40 or 50, can match the intellectual speech and academic sharpness of the bright and high-achieving 18 year-olds who make up the majority of student entrants to Cambridge. Persuading such women that they can hold their own in Cambridge and providing them with the confidence and support necessary for them to succeed is the job which the college admissions tutor, directors of studies and college lecturers perform with great skill and commitment every working day.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para30"></a>I should like to tell your Lordships the story of some of those students. The first is one of our first-year entrants this autumn. She is a woman in her late twenties who ran away from an abusing father when she was 16. She lived homeless on the streets of Liverpool for some years until the day when, in her own words, she felt there must be more to life. She enrolled in a sixth form college to take A-levels and worked in the evenings to make enough money for private tutoring to help her catch up.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para31"></a>As it so happened, the private tutor she found was a Cambridge graduate who quickly recognised her unusual intelligence and advised her that she should try <P>


<a name="column_184"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 184</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for a place at Cambridge. He told her that Lucy Cavendish was a college for mature women like herself. However, she then consulted her sixth-form tutor who said, "Cambridge, that is a place for snobs and rich kids. Give me a match and I'll burn the place down tomorrow". She returned to her tutor in great distress and said, "I don't think I could possibly fit in there. I am a scouser off the streets and my teacher tells me that Cambridge is for snobs and rich kids". Her tutor said, "Cambridge isn't like that any more. Go to Lucy Cavendish and see for yourself". She did; we offered her a place; she achieved three "A" grades at A-level; and I have every confidence that she will be an outstanding success in her career.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para32"></a>Another student came to us from the Armed Forces. She too was told by her friends, "Cambridge is a place for officers. You are only of the ranks. They will never take you and if they do, you will never fit in". She was recently able to tell a group of those same friends, "There is no elitism here. The only elitism is of highly motivated and intelligent women determined to succeed".
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para33"></a>A third student is now in the second year of her law degree. She says of her own experience, "I had lived and worked in Cambridge for several years in different jobs until I realised it was time to settle down and find a real career. I went to further education college and took two A-levels and achieved an A grade in them both. That gave me the courage to apply to Cambridge even though, as a mature, black woman, wanting to become a barrister, I knew the going would be tough. The workload is huge and challenging but I say to myself, 'If I can cope with the work here, I can cope with anything'" and, my Lords, she is coping very well indeed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para34"></a>The last student that I should like to tell your Lordships about is now studying for her Ph.D at Lucy Cavendish, having come to us four-and-a-half years ago to start her undergraduate degree. Our cockney sparrow, as she calls herself, lived all her life in the East End of London. She had worked for several years as a barmaid before she felt that she would like to take her newly discovered love of English literature into a more formal framework. She also registered at a further education college, taking three A-levels in one year and achieving three A grades, from a standing start with no formal O-levels or GCSEs in the whole of her previous life.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para35"></a>Again, in her own words she says, "My partner drove me up to an open day at Lucy Cavendish and I fell in love both with Cambridge and with the college which accepted mature women from any kind of background". That cockney sparrow achieved a Cambridge First and intends now, when she has finished her Ph.D, to pursue a full-time academic career.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para36"></a>I am proud of these women and proud of their achievements. I am also proud that Cambridge University has a place for them, and for a college like Lucy Cavendish. It distresses me greatly when I hear people say that Cambridge is only for the privileged, or the rich. It is of course elite in the sense that it accepts only the very bright and very motivated: but intellect and motivation are not the preserve of any one social class; we prove that every day.

<A NAME = "71112-06_para37"></a>I feel very privileged to be president of a college which succeeds in attracting, supporting, teaching and retraining women of the magnificent quality, humour, wit and courage which our students manifest in all aspects of their lives. Many of them are coping with family commitments of young children or elderly parents; many of them have mortgaged their homes, sold their cars, cashed in their insurance policies, borrowed from family and friends, in order to come to Cambridge to study there. The world would be a very much poorer place without them. Many have gone on to resounding success in business and in public life: all have gone forward into much changed careers and lives, providing themselves, their families, and this country with an intellectual wealth without which no civilised country could survive.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para38"></a>I have tried to give brief pen portraits of four Cambridge undergraduates who are personally known to me, and who form part of the fabric of Cambridge life. There is still an uninformed minority of critics who, like the sixth-form teacher of my first student, might say, "Give me a match and I'll burn the place down". But such people do not speak for anything except their own unhappy envy and resentment. The reality of Cambridge lies in the experience of students such as those I have described and hundreds of their fellows who have found, as one of my students said to me only the other day, that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"everybody can fit in here, provided they have the brains--and the sense to use them". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<A NAME="71112-06_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Weidenfeld: </B>   My Lords, I should like to speak briefly about a factor of growing importance to university finance--private sponsorship and, particularly, foreign sponsorship. The collegiate tradition and the tutorial system of Oxford and Cambridge are not only a determining attraction for many overseas students, they are also particularly interesting to foreign sponsors, the private sector, business companies, foundations and foreign governments.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para39"></a>I speak with some experience because during the past six or seven years I have been closely involved with the Oxford Development Programme, keeping in continuous contact with European and especially German benefactors. As one rather munificent foreign supporter of Oxford put it rather robustly, perhaps even indelicately:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We want to pay for our young people to have the benefit of a highly individual education that differs from our own impersonal knowledge factories". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para40"></a>He had in mind extended classrooms, the fact that students do not meet their teachers and that, at best, they learn to accumulate knowledge, not to argue in dissent or to discuss issues with their teachers. Those perceptions are borne out by the steep rise in applications and entries to Oxford. Applications from Germany and France have jumped by 50 per cent. in the past five years. In the current academic year there are now 354 students from Germany, a figure that is only exceeded by students from the United States.
<P>


<a name="column_186"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para41"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Beloff, mentioned cost effectiveness in his comparison of international costing. Oxford is not only less than half as expensive as MIT, Harvard or Stanford, but France, with its endorsement of intellectual meritocratic elitism, is much more generous than we are. The idea of more private universities springing up in places like Italy, Spain or even Germany is a very interesting new phenomenon. As the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, put it, there is a feeling of a downward spiralling of intellectual standards in the state-run universities.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para42"></a>It is generally recognised that the considerable intellectual resources of Oxford and Cambridge allow for a flexibility and variety of courses, curricular and extra-curricular, which benefit mid-career students and appeal to multinational corporations and foreign governments. A hampering and restricting of the methods of teaching of Oxford and Cambridge would not necessarily benefit other British universities so far as concerns private and foreign sponsors. It would most likely head them off into other directions abroad.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para43"></a>As a world class university in the lingua franca, overseas students, especially from the Far East, regard Oxford as a gateway to a wider Europe. It is noteworthy that Oxford, which has traditionally focused its efforts on the English-speaking world, has now opened itself up to a wider preoccupation with European postgraduate studies. It would be the height of paradox if we were now to jeopardise or at best reduce the status of Oxford and Cambridge as European world-class universities at the very time when our government make a strong claim to a leading role in Europe, a role which they can only justify by demonstrably backing academic centres of excellence.

<A NAME="71112-06_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede: </B>   My Lords, I should like, first, to thank the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, for giving us the opportunity to debate the funding of Oxford and Cambridge. The issue is that students at Oxford and Cambridge receive just under 50 per cent. more than average students at other universities. That is a big differential and is what we are really discussing this afternoon. It would have been quite wrong if the Government had not arranged for the review. After all, it was recommended in the Dearing Report and I believe it is an issue which should be addressed most thoroughly.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para44"></a>Special pleading is never an attractive argument, although we have heard some very eloquent special pleading today. I recognise much of what the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, said. In particular, I recognise much of what the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, said in her speech. It so happens that a friend of mine has just gone to her college as a mature student and I hope that she will make the best of the facilities available to her.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para45"></a>I speak as one of the very few speakers in today's debate who has no association with either Oxford or Cambridge. I went to red brick universities, including Imperial College, to which someone referred earlier. Nevertheless, I can say quite honestly that some of my closest friends did go to Oxford and Cambridge. I say <P>


<a name="column_187"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in all humility that I do recognise that they are of the higher standard; indeed, they are now making very distinguished contributions in their chosen professions. I took it upon myself to talk to many of my friends about their experiences at Oxford and Cambridge. To be honest, they defended the extra cash available to the universities, but they defended far more vigorously the tutorial system through which they had been educated. They were a little more reticent about defending the money.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para46"></a>The gist of what I want to say is simply that I wish to remind noble Lords that there are other elite institutions that can surpass Oxford and Cambridge in what they actually produce as opposed to what they actually cost. I believe that it is absolutely right that the HEFCE should reflect that in the recommendations that it makes. I must say that I was most attracted to the suggestion made by my noble friend Lord Desai that the top 10 universities should compete for the &#163;38 million. That seems to me to be fair.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para47"></a>What I really want to talk about is my perspective as an employer. I spend quite a lot of my time interviewing people. As I have said in previous debates in this House, I am an engineer and a manager in a small oil company. I recruit engineers, geologists and, occasionally, accountants to work as expatriates in Russia. I tend to look for people with about 15 years' experience. Just between noble Lords and myself, I can say that we pay them about &#163;100,000 a year. So we can reasonably expect to attract top quality candidates.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para48"></a>I spent this morning looking through the files of the CVs that I have received over the past four years. So far as concerns accountants, there is a complete spread with only a few from Oxford. If there is any preference, it tends to be towards the Scottish universities; indeed, we do seem to get quite a lot of accountants from them. As regards engineers, Imperial College comes top of the league quite easily. We have also had a number of applicants from Cambridge and also from Heriot-Watt and Leeds. It is not surprising that those universities are strongly represented because they have good mineral departments. I have to admit that I have never received a CV from an Oxford-educated engineer. I do not know where they all go, perhaps they all become accountants. They certainly do not apply to my firm for a job.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para49"></a>As regards geologists, Imperial again is well represented. Oxford and Cambridge are also well represented but, funnily enough, Kingston Polytechnic is also well represented. That polytechnic has a strong geology course. A couple of our current employees have taken that course. We have just recruited a sedimentologist from Birkbeck College. He managed to overcome much strong competition as a result of that sedimentology course. His qualifications were exactly what we were looking for.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para50"></a>As an employer I recognise that there are elite institutions and I believe that there is a compelling argument for preferential funding for them. There are some 10 or a dozen elite institutions. I spoke to my manager about this matter today. He used to be the chief <P>


<a name="column_188"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 188</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>engineer at Shell which, of course, is one of the largest recruiters in Britain. He told me that when he was chief engineer at Shell it recruited from about 12 universities across Britain, although he added that that might have changed in recent years. Oxford and Cambridge were included, of course, in those 12 universities, but Shell tried to recruit from a far wider net.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para51"></a>It is absolutely right that the HEFCE should recognise this breadth of excellence in our universities and should fund that accordingly. Special pleading is not the right way to proceed. Excellence needs to be demonstrated. I have no doubt that Oxbridge can demonstrate its excellence.

<P>
<A NAME="71112-06_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior: </B>   My Lords, first I wish to thank my noble friend Lord Beloff for introducing this debate on the future of Oxford and Cambridge. As an Emeritus professor of the University of Cambridge and an Emeritus fellow of one of the graduate colleges of Cambridge, I feel it would be rather presumptuous of me to claim that Oxford and Cambridge are superior to the rest of the universities in this country. Enough people have already done that this afternoon and have made comparisons, some of which have been objective and some of which have been subjective.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para52"></a>Many of the objections to the system at Oxford and Cambridge are the fruit of a complete misunderstanding or a lack of understanding of the collegiate system in these two universities. Sometimes it is difficult to understand what goes on in the university system when one is within it, let alone without it. I particularly wish to address an issue raised in the Dearing Report. Recommendation No. 74 asks: do college fees represent a good use of resources? A corollary to that is: would their elimination be detrimental to the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge? In particular I wish to refer to medical and veterinary education in the University of Cambridge. I have 15 years' experience of these subjects in an Ivy League university in North America and some 20 years in Cambridge.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para53"></a>As regards access to Cambridge, admissions are through the various colleges. It is a multi-portal system of entry compared with the single portal entry system of almost everywhere else that I know of. I have often been asked: how can you tolerate not being in charge of admissions to your school or department? However, it works well and certainly guards against narrow selection procedures that may be subtly introduced through the one portal system of entry. In Cambridge the ratio of independent school students to state school students in medicine is 50:50. In the veterinary course the ratio is 60:40 in favour of state school students.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para54"></a>However, these figures hide facts about the entry of mature students. My noble friend Lady Perry mentioned those students. Quite a number of students who apply to the graduate colleges are not part of the national assessment whether they come from the state or maintained system. Some make quite heroic efforts to gain entry to the University of Cambridge through a college and most usually show great distinction <P>


<a name="column_189"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 189</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>thereafter in their studies. They are provided with a second chance, having failed initially, to enter the colleges directly from school.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para55"></a>An overpowering influence and attribute of the multi-portal system to my mind is that the newly admitted student mixes immediately with people from many other disciplines. He mixes with philosophers, natural scientists, engineers and the like. He also mixes not only with junior members of the college but also senior members, right up to the master or the president. Such students participate in college society and activities, possibly at a level of achievement well below that demanded by the university teams or societies. The college system also enables a student to change his or her mind as regards the course that was initially undertaken. A number of people switch from natural sciences to medicine and from medicine to other subjects. That usually occurs in the first year but it also occurs in other years too. The completion rate of courses in Cambridge is high. In medicine and in veterinary medicine it is 98 per cent. People drop out usually only for medical reasons or simply because an individual has decided that a course is not for him or her.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para56"></a>My final comments concern the graduate colleges which were established largely after the Second World War to attend to the needs of graduate students and mature students. They cater for a substantial number of overseas graduate students, as well as home based students. They provide accommodation, study facilities, computer terminals and the rest for 52 weeks a year. They rely particularly on fees for about 50 per cent. of their income. Because they are recent foundations they have little endowment and because of the 52 weeks a year commitment to graduate students they have little opportunity to mount commercial enterprises such as conferences, as the other, older undergraduate colleges do.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para57"></a>I return to the question of Recommendation No. 74: are college fees a good use of resources? To my mind the answer must be unequivocally, "Yes, they are". Their abolition would do some colleges, particularly the graduate colleges, great harm. I echo the observation of my noble friend Lord Beloff that if Oxford and Cambridge have to go in the direction of increased private funding, with its obvious and well stated danger, it must be well supported by scholarship and sufficient time must be allowed to bring that about.

I am an honorary fellow of the college which gives me huge pleasure. I am the father of four sons who all graduated from Magdalen. Therefore noble Lords could be forgiven for thinking that I am in any way parti pris as regards the subject we are discussing today. I have no academic experience or particular qualifications to speak today. I can echo only what other noble Lords have said and give that my support. I shall do so as briefly as possible as I can introduce no new points.

<A NAME = "71112-06_para58"></a>Apart from the quality of the Oxford and Cambridge colleges as historic places--that historic fabric is, of course, extremely expensive to maintain--I feel (like nearly all noble Lords who have spoken so far this afternoon) that the college and tutorial experience is a unique one for undergraduates. It is certainly not the only way to educate the ablest; but it is a very good way simply because, at its best, it stretches students as perhaps no other system can. And, as was repeatedly said, college life is an education in itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para59"></a>The system is, no doubt, too expensive to be extended to all universities--even assuming that all universities would want it. Do we therefore think that what is available to only a few, most of whom are already advantaged in other ways, should be destroyed if it cannot be made available to all? Should public funds be distributed on so inequitable a basis?
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para60"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Beloff reminded us, France has a clear-cut reply to such a question. The noble Lord reminded us that it funds the grande ecole at three times the level of other schools. It does so because it believes that it needs an elite.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para61"></a>If the collegiate system is threatened, how much does that threaten the future of Oxford and Cambridge? Does their future depend on the collegiate and tutorial system? I suppose that, ultimately, good universities would emerge at Oxford and Cambridge after the destruction of their present mode of operation. However, for all the reasons so eloquently stated, I should regard such destruction, and the consequent change in the character of Oxbridge, as a humiliating national loss--even worse than the loss of one of our London opera houses, which now seems to be contemplated. The noble Lord, Lord Porter, said that no one questioned the need for artistic excellence. I assure the noble Lord that there are people who question it every day when it is paid for out of public funds. However, that is not the subject of our debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para62"></a>The loss of the special character of Oxbridge seems quite unnecessary. Surely we should try to find a fairer way to finance the retention of the system that has given Oxford and Cambridge their character and made them the national assets that they undoubtedly are. That can be done if all universities are allowed to determine their own fee and scholarship levels and charge in the way that Oxford and Cambridge always have. Why should the basic government subsidy not be available to all universities on the basis of that freedom? If the college and tutorial systems are essential to the function and character of Oxbridge, I have no doubt that the colleges could find the extra money that is needed to sustain them, given time and the freedom to charge.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para63"></a>Time is of the essence; it is crucial. If change is to come about, it must be introduced gradually. Although I realise that this view may not meet with favour in every quarter, it might be best to freeze the top-up grant at its present level and let time and inflation erode it gradually, as they have eroded the value of government grants in so many other areas. At 3 per cent. per annum, it would be gone in a generation. If that is too long for the egalitarians, let us agree a shorter period with the universities so that they can plan ahead to adapt and replace the top-up money.

<A NAME = "71112-06_para64"></a>If we want to ensure that what Oxford and Cambridge have to offer is available more widely to the population as a whole, surely that objective can be secured by a system of loans at inexpensive rates, as suggested by Professor Eric Ash in yesterday's Times. In short, they need time to adjust and freedom to charge extra for the extra that they offer. That is what Oxbridge needs, and what I hope it will be granted.

<A NAME="71112-06_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Winston: </B>   My Lords, we are all deeply grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, for introducing this important debate. It has been of a high standard, if, inevitably, somewhat repetitive. I attended the same school as the noble Lord, as did the noble Lord, Lord Baker. I suspect that I did not have the same history master for several reasons--one of which was undoubtedly the fact that I was in a less able stream than either the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, or the noble Lord, Lord Baker, whose maiden speech we greatly enjoyed. I must declare an interest in that I have spent 25 years in higher education or research, all of which was conducted outside Oxbridge. I come from one of those other institutions referred to--at least, I now come from one of them; namely, the Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para65"></a>Some years ago I was approached by either Oxford or Cambridge to throw my hat into the ring and apply for a chair. I considered the matter and decided that the university was arcane, inbred, self-satisfied, smug and no real place for me. After some 10 minutes, I decided not to send in my CV. The truth is, I suspected I should probably not be considered for the job anyway.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para66"></a>But that outside impression of Oxbridge is a very false one, as the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, so eloquently testified. We are talking about truly outstanding institutions which are models of university education, not merely in this country but throughout the world. If you visit Cambridge in Massachusetts, you are struck by the fact that there has been an attempt to model it on another Cambridge, closer to home--albeit somewhat colder, at least at this time of year. On virtually every assessment, both universities have a rating that is consistently excellent. I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Desai, in his criticism of the HEFCE ratings. They are not totally adequate, but they are the best that we can do. They are, after all, produced on an independent assessment, examining excellence throughout all universities. Quite how one establishes one's reputation as regards HEFCE may well vary. One can legitimately select what one wants to represent, as all institutions will have to do in order to receive their very high rating. Imperial College needs Oxford and Cambridge just so that from time to time we can say, "Look, we actually beat them and got a five-star rating in medicine".
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para67"></a>One point that was not mentioned is that Oxford and Cambridge contribute in a very real way to higher education outside, and that is very important. They are a paradigm, a model. The method of thinking that is bred in Cambridge and Oxford is very special. We apply <P>


<a name="column_192"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 192</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that model and try to achieve the same method with postgraduate students in my own institution. We attempt, in a very small way in one course that I run, to imitate the tutorial system. It is a very poor second best; nevertheless, it tries to some extent to model itself on the Oxbridge system.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para68"></a>Another point not previously mentioned is that academic institutions are extremely fragile and, as a result, when they are threatened, it has a very serious effect on the whole ethos--all the relationships within those institutions. In my time I have been in two institutions that were threatened and I have seen the serious effect on every aspect of the work: research, teaching and recruitment. If we are to examine the role and funding of Oxford and Cambridge, it is important to do it very carefully and with extreme caution. If there is a need for redistribution, which has yet to be proved, it has to be examined over a period of time. It should not be done suddenly.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para69"></a>We in this country believe implicitly in selectivity. It is the very core of our economic arguments. Our economy cannot be internationally competitive unless we continue to educate on a selective basis. Of course we want to be an equal society; of course we need to have that morality. But, in the long term, we must concern ourselves with the idea that we might damage something which, in turn, could damage our national economy.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para70"></a>One of the questions that must be asked is: would a greater spread of the &#163;38 million through more institutions undoubtedly benefit the education system as a whole? That has to be proved. Until we can clearly demonstrate that, we must be very cautious about damaging those institutions--as they undoubtedly would be damaged if the status quo were to be disturbed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para71"></a>I joined the Labour Party because I believe in a fair society. But a fair society does not mean that people are equal in every respect. I deprecate the rather personal remarks made to the Minister, a person whom I deeply respect and who has a most difficult job. She is trying to protect our higher education and to arrive at solutions to extremely complex problems. She is particularly able and highly intelligent--qualities which are the very essence of our education system. We select people for institutions and for other situations. Things are not entirely equal. In our efforts to be fair, we must not level down; we must find ways of levelling up in our education system. If this small sum of money is to be redistributed, we must ask ourselves whether we can demonstrate that it would serve to level up the system. Before we do that, we need to evaluate the evidence extremely carefully.

<A NAME="71112-06_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Renton of Mount Harry: </B>   My Lords, I agree with much of the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Winston, particularly his remark about the demoralising effect on a big university like Oxford or Cambridge that such a retrenchment--even if it is only &#163;18 million for one university and &#163;19 million for the other--would have on the affairs and running of those universities, possibly quite out of proportion to the size of the cut.

<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para72"></a>Perhaps I may quote from a letter which I received from the president of my old college at Oxford:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An internationally respected standard would be destroyed spectacularly--to the loss of our universities as a whole. Colleges which survived would have to retrench on research fellows and grants, thus removing a nursery of national and international academic talent". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para73"></a>This is perhaps particularly the noble Lord's point:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Oxford and Cambridge would be too 'overfull of self affairs' of the utmost urgency not to say too demoralised by widespread sackings, to play any part in the Secretary of State's educational strategies for our country". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para74"></a>There is a danger that those results could flow from a decision to cut back on the share of public funding that goes to college fees.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para75"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Gibson, and my noble friend and past colleague, Lord Baker of Dorking, I too went to Magdalen College, Oxford. Rather like my noble friend Lord Beloff, my family's connection with Magdalen stretches over 80 years, from 1910 to 1990, three generations and six members of the family having gone there. One was killed in the First World War, one obtained a First and another rowed for two years in the Oxford boat.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para76"></a>During that time Oxford underwent the kind of change that my noble friend Lord Beloff spoke of. When my elder uncle was there before the First World War it was certainly not incumbent on him to take a degree. The president of the college at the time was one Sir Herbert Warren. The Japanese ambassador approached him to see whether the college would be a suitable home for the son of the Japanese Emperor but was rather unimpressed by the amount of attention he was given by Sir Herbert, and said: "You do realise that in Japan the Emperor's son is regarded as the son of God?" Sir Herbert Warren replied: "We are quite accustomed to having distinguished undergraduates at Magdalen".
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para77"></a>By the time my youngest daughter went to Magdalen, she had to work hard to get there; she worked hard to get a 2:1 in languages, and when she left she was lucky enough to obtain fairly quickly a job with an international pharmaceutical company. She is now--perhaps slightly to her father's worry--working in television. I believe that shows, in a family context, the change that the college underwent in those years.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para78"></a>At this stage in this very interesting debate, I, like many others, face a dilemma. Those of us who went to Oxbridge want to see our colleges grow and prosper. In that context I pay enormous tribute to the present president of Magdalen, Tony Smith, for what he has done to raise money for new buildings, such as the Grove buildings in the deer park. But equally--and one feels this very strongly, listening to the debate--we want to share the privilege of the superb education that we enjoyed with as many as possible who would benefit from that kind of education. I stress the word "benefit". It would be a great mistake if Oxbridge were to lower their standards to make themselves more accessible.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para79"></a>Equally, we see the problems of other universities. I am sure that noble Lords will have seen the letters in The Times yesterday from the noble Lord, Lord Rix, chancellor of the University of East London, and Professor George Wedell, professor emeritus at the <P>


<a name="column_194"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 194</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>University of Manchester, pointing out fairly succinctly how much their universities would be helped if some of the &#163;35 million available to Oxbridge were instead to be made available to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para80"></a>Sussex University is on my doorstep; I am on its court. Its treasurer tells me that the university has a fund to help undergraduates in great financial difficulty and that at present there are so many calls on it that the average grant is of &#163;10.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para81"></a>To try to solve the problems by removing the &#163;35 million which the Government pays for university fees is like trying to move a mountain by moving a mouse. Dearing points out that the higher education budget will be underfunded by &#163;350 million next year and possibly by &#163;565 million the following year. Getting at Oxbridge in the way that has been suggested would not solve that problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para82"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Gibson, I suggest that other routes could be looked at. First, in the noble Lord's words, the colleges should have the freedom to charge extra. It would be wholly ridiculous if they were not given permission to top up fees.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para83"></a>Secondly, Oxbridge students are clearly very employable. Perhaps additional loan facilities could be made available to them at low interest rates which could be made possible by a guarantee from the university.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para84"></a>Thirdly, colleges could look at their methods. This is indeed a non-academic walking where angels fear to tread. Perhaps it is not necessary for every college to have quite so many tutors for every subject as they do at present.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para85"></a>Finally, I very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord Weidenfeld, that we need to look at the tax rules and make it more effective and easier for those who have a lot of money to give it to the university or college of their choice. We must all be struck by the ability of American universities, orchestras and theatres to raise substantial sums of money from the private sector. As Minister for the Arts, I was always conscious of how tremendously difficult our tax system was in that respect. I hope that the Government will look at that situation and improve it.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para86"></a>I very much want to see the best of both worlds for Oxford and Cambridge. I do not think we shall achieve that by removing the support for fees.

<A NAME="71112-06_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, I too must declare an interest, not as an academic but as a graduate of Cambridge and an honorary fellow of Newnham College, one of the three remaining single-sex colleges, Lucy Cavendish, of which the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, spoke, being another. I am therefore particularly interested in the situation of women at the university, which has changed dramatically during the past 25 years. There are now 7,087 women students at Cambridge--44 per cent. of the student population. In 1972-73 there were 1,823--16.2 per cent. of the total. That is a remarkable statistic and a remarkable improvement. It was then that the men's colleges, led by King's College, began to take in women students.
<P>


<a name="column_195"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 195</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para87"></a>I should like to comment on the vital issue of access to Cambridge. The Government are absolutely right to argue that everyone who has the talent to succeed at our best universities should have access to them, irrespective of their parents' financial means. That is not just the Government's position, it is the fundamental proposition underlying the admissions policies of the colleges in Cambridge. But the Cambridge colleges understand that they face a considerable problem given the high proportion of Cambridge students who were educated at independent schools. It is a myth that Cambridge students are all public school students. Forty-eight per cent. are from the state sector, 44 per cent. from the independent sector, the remaining 8 per cent. comprising overseas students and a few others. Oxford is much the same.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para88"></a>I want to ask my noble friend a question: would she confirm that the university with the highest proportion of British students who have been educated at independent schools is not Oxford, is not Cambridge, but the London School of Economics? I would be grateful if she would confirm that in her reply. I should make clear that this is not to criticise the LSE. The point is that the LSE is a totally meritocratic organisation admitting students on the basis of their A-level performance, and the best private schools are very good indeed at producing good A-level performance. But the LSE has limited resources to devote to interviewing students, to seek out those who have been less well prepared but have the ability, the potential, to compete for a place. That is probably why the proportion of privately educated students is higher than that of Cambridge, which interviews all students.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para89"></a>It is important to remember that independent schools have changed considerably in the past 20 years. Many offer academic scholarships to the most able students in the state schools, and the assisted places scheme, now mercifully being phased out, has meant that many more of the brightest students from the maintained sector have moved to independent schools. Remember, too, that 20 per cent. of sixth-formers in the whole country are at those independent schools. They start with a great advantage.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para90"></a>As my noble friend is, I am sure, aware, the major problem in ensuring access to Cambridge is persuading children from poorer backgrounds to apply. That is why the Cambridge colleges make strenuous efforts to encourage applicants from schools which have never sent pupils to Cambridge before, particularly by means of the Target Schools Scheme. I know that my own college, Newnham, organises visits not only by the staff, but by students, to schools. The students can explain better to sixth-formers what it is like to be at Cambridge and reassure them about the reception they would have and the help they would get. The college has open days when pupils can come to the college so that they can see the set-up, meet staff and students and learn about what the work and the life would be like. Teachers are invited to the college, sometimes for an evening, often for several days. The difficulty is often to persuade girls <P>


<a name="column_196"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 196</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>from families where no member of the family has ever gone to university before. Their confidence needs to be built up.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para91"></a>The principal of Newnham told me of a visit she made to a school in Clacton quite recently where the head of the lower-sixth told her how glad he was that she had come because the head of the school particularly discouraged girls from applying.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para92"></a>The fear of accumulating debt has to be dispelled. Girls are often uncertain and worried about their ability to repay. This is the case particularly if they may be involved in the longer courses--medicine or architecture, for instance--and this applies to women more than to men as their jobs are often less well paid and their careers may be interrupted by bringing up children.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para93"></a>In 1990 the Group To Encourage Ethnic Minorities, GEEMA, was established by a group of admission tutors and the black caucus students. It has been successful. In 1995 GEEMA received a gold award for innovation from the British Diversity Awards.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para94"></a>In the light of all these efforts, will the Minister accept that Cambridge University is open to everyone who has the talent to secure a place? The problem is to ensure that everyone who has the talent applies to Cambridge in the first place.

<A NAME="71112-06_spnew14"></A><B> The Earl of Carlisle: </B>   My Lords, it is a pleasure, as always, to follow the noble Baroness, Lady David. I entirely agree with her points about what I would call student loans and the difficulty of repaying once one has completed one's graduation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para95"></a>We owe the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, a great debt. I owe him a personal debt. I was an undergraduate at Balliol College, Oxford in 1968, at a time of student unrest. I was the holder of the university cadetship which at that time meant that the Ministry of Defence paid my tuition fees, my accommodation fees, and of course one had to serve eight years in Her Majesty's Armed Forces after graduation. That was fair.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para96"></a>During those years of student unrest the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, was the Gladstone Professor of Government. Lord Beloff, and his colleague, Professor Sir Michael Howard, held a seminar in All Souls College for graduates. He allowed any interested undergraduate to come and listen to the guest speakers discussing matters of international affairs and strategic studies. That, I suggest, is a very good example beyond the tutorial system where Oxford excelled. Ten years later it was necessary for me to take the staff college exam. I retained the notes that I took at the two professors' seminars and I owe them a debt as I passed the exam.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para97"></a>As I have said, I declare an interest in that I am a history graduate of Oxford University, but before I go further, I should like also to congratulate the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ely on his excellent maiden speech. He is a walking example of an Oxford graduate going to another university and then coming back and teaching in Oxford or elsewhere. There is an enormous interchange between all the universities. They <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>cross-fertilise each other, and although I believe it was necessary to have this debate, please let us not isolate Oxford and Cambridge, excellent as they may be; all other universities have much to contribute.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para98"></a>I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, went on to become the first vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, the Open University, from 1968 to 1970 where people from all walks of life, adult students, were able to obtain degrees. I recall, I think it was in Mr. Ben Pimlott's biography of the late Lord Wilson of Rievaulx, that towards the end of his life Lord Wilson said that his greatest achievement was founding the Open University. It would be a remarkable irony if Lord Wilson's successor in another place, the right honourable Member for Sedgefield, was responsible--and his government were responsible--for lowering the standards of university education which his predecessor, Lord Wilson of Rievaulx, did so much to raise.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para99"></a>What should we do at Oxford and Cambridge? I should like to pay tribute to two chancellors: one here today and one, alas, now dead. Between 1960 and today the two Chancellors of Oxford University have travelled round the world, long past the years of retirement, begging for money. That is a noble cause; but how sad that it has been necessary. I do not know exactly how many funds they have raised from the rest of the world but that money spent in Oxford, if it had not been raised from the rest of the world, would have been a charge on Her Majesty's Government, I suggest. Perhaps the noble Baroness will recall that former Governments and the Government today have had a let-off, and &#163;35 million is a small sum compared with what has been raised abroad.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para100"></a>There is, I fear, a lot of ill-will in Oxford. On Armistice Sunday I went to a church in Balliol College. Afterwards there was a Christian fellowship meeting. There were 50 to 70 undergraduates there. They came from all over Britain and from abroad. I asked them what effect the reduction of the &#163;35 million grant might have on them as individuals. The third year undergraduates said, "We are sorry because it will affect the second and first year undergraduates". The second year undergraduates said, "If it comes into effect, some of us will have to forsake our studies". The first year undergraduates, who had worked so hard to get there, said that many of them would probably have to give up their studies.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para101"></a>My noble friend Lord Jenkins of Hillhead has a predecessor, who was a Member of this House for 43 years. I shall offer advice to the noble Baroness which he always gave. I am of course referring to the Duke of Wellington, who never went to university. He said, "If I want to know what is going on on the other side of the hill, I get on my horse and I go and see". I do not suggest that the noble Baroness should mount a horse and charge off to Oxford or Cambridge, but perhaps she might board her ministerial car and go and talk not only to the dons but also to those undergraduates who will be affected by her legislation.

Most happily the association has extended to Oxford also, and, although perhaps historically more "Camford" than "Oxbridge", my loyalties would be well satisfied if every boat race were tied.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para102"></a>Spontaneously, and quite unsolicited, I am impelled to express a fear to your Lordships. If government funding of college fees for home students goes, the effect on college revenues will carry a serious knock-on risk for overseas students. Beyond question, the college system is the main attraction of Oxbridge for them. Take it away and most of the more gifted overseas postgraduate students will think first of North American universities.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para103"></a>No doubt overseas students from more affluent homes can afford the &#163;15,000 a year which Oxbridge may cost. But academic promise and wealth do not go hand in hand. Lord Rutherford, often called the greatest experimental scientist of the century, was born to modest circumstances in rural New Zealand, one of a family of 12 children. When the news came of a scholarship that would take him to Cambridge, he was digging potatoes. "I shall never dig another", he said.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para104"></a>College scholarships or bursary assistance are often a necessity and always a draw card for overseas students. In the last academic year the Vinerian Prize at Oxford for the top BCL graduate was won by a young woman from the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. The top graduate in the corresponding Cambridge course, the LL.M, was a young woman from the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. Long may the link flourish.

This debate, after all, has been triggered off by one recommendation out of 93 in the major inquiry into higher education represented by the Dearing Report, and a sentence of some 100 words out of a report of many thousands of words about the state of our higher education system and how it will meet the challenges of the future.

<A NAME = "71112-06_para106"></a>The Minister and the Government have the responsibility of seeing that higher education responds to the needs of our wider society and they are already involved in a process, one which was established by the previous Administration, of significant radical change. That is what our society has demanded. We have doubled the percentage of people in higher education in <P>


<a name="column_199"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 199</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the past decade. The present Government intend, quite rightly, to raise the cap on present student numbers in order to encourage more to attend our higher education institutions. They are doing so because we all know that our society can only survive, our economy can only prosper and the goods for our communities can only be provided--these are social, cultural and economic factors--if we are able to compete in the wider world. Highly trained, highly skilled and highly educated men and women will be needed. That is the challenge, and the different sectors of higher education have had to respond to it.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para107"></a>There has been a massive increase in the number of part-time students participating in higher education and a 40 per cent. reduction in the unit of resource. That is what other institutions are having to respond to in order to sustain their commitment to the necessary expansion of higher education opportunities.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para108"></a>The Government are proposing to introduce tuition fees for higher education students. Everyone in the Chamber will recognise that, all things being equal, if higher education could be afforded in any other way, the Government would not pursue that proposal. If all those sacrifices are being demanded by our society of all those who are going to participate in higher education, how is it suggested today that Oxford and Cambridge should make no contribution whatever? What contribution is being asked? I shall tell the House what Dearing actually suggested:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We recommend to the Government that variations in the levels of public funding for teaching outside modest margins should occur only where there is an approved difference in the provision or where society, through the Secretary of State or his or her agents, concludes after examining an exceptionally high level of funding that, in relation to other funding needs in HE, it represents a good use of resources". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para109"></a>That is exactly the point. What is being defended today is an exceptionally high level of resource allocation--40 per cent. for each and every student. In circumstances where many noble Lords speaking today have said that they are not casting aspersions on others in higher education and that they are aware of the excellent teaching going on elsewhere in the system, let us state that the excellent teaching in so many institutions is being provided under a unit of resource substantially below that which is available at Oxford and Cambridge.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para110"></a>Of course it is right that the Government should ask these questions and that HEFCE should be empowered to make some examination of the comparative advantages of such an allocation of resource. That is what has to be defended today. All of us would recognise that increment of advantage that may accrue from one-to-one tuition whether one speaks about primary school children, secondary education, further or higher education. Who would not see the value of one-to-one education or one-to-one teaching? But it cannot be afforded across all the other sectors of education. However, it is surely right at this stage that we ask the questions and look at the objective basis on which this allocation occurs.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para111"></a>It will not do just to talk in terms of past history and how these issues have developed. We now have a modern world which is making demands on our ageing institutions. They are not just demands. There is a wider community which has such a stake in the opportunities that have to be developed in higher education. Of course that community is going to make demands on any government that takes office. I emphasise that it is necessary for the evaluation to take place.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para112"></a>I also emphasise that if the wider community is to give any advantage to Oxford and Cambridge and their teaching--perhaps persuaded by some of the arguments that have been put today, but not to the extent that they have been put through special pleading in my view--and that society is to sustain the commitment, the universities have to demonstrate greater equity in the opportunities of access to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para113"></a>What is the basis on which, still at this stage, nearly 50 per cent. of students at the two older universities come from the private sector? What is being measured there? Is it not conceivable that people from deprived backgrounds who get three A-levels, with limited resources at their disposal and with teachers who have never been anywhere near Oxbridge and may not be overwhelmingly well qualified, may have achieved more than those students who have three A-levels from some of the most privileged and private institutions in the country with the vast resources that they command? On what basis should we seek further additional opportunity and public resources to be vouchsafed to those who have had all the privileges in the past? That is against the obvious background that people talk where their money goes. We know why people are prepared to spend &#163;12,000 a year on private education. It is significantly because it increases the opportunities for their children.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para114"></a>If we are to evaluate the position clearly and effectively we must recognise that there is an obligation on Oxford and Cambridge to respond to the necessary evaluation, in common with all other ageing institutions, of the effectiveness of their teaching. It is a question of whether that mark-up is justified. The Minister should be encouraged in pursuing that route and in addition the older universities should recognise that if they are to sustain public confidence in their roles they need to broaden their access and to see that equity obtains there also.

<A NAME="71112-06_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Hillhead: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, has spoken very eloquently. He is right to say that the question should be asked and it is also right that the answer should be listened to. In the limited time at my disposal I shall endeavour to give replies at any rate to some of the questions. I congratulate the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ely and the noble Lord, Lord Baker, on two outstanding maiden speeches.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para115"></a>I must obviously begin by declaring a very strong interest as Chancellor of Oxford. From that fact there arises a thought which may not be familiar to your Lordships. Sometimes--and it happened quite often this <P>


<a name="column_201"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 201</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>afternoon--Oxford is portrayed as a citadel of privileged exclusivity. I suppose that the Chancellorship is the greatest honour that the university can bestow. It is certainly the greatest honour that I have ever received. It is granted rather democratically. Ten thousand graduates voted in the election in 1987. There were three candidates and it so happens that of those three not a single one came from a really privileged school. Sir Edward Heath and I came from the most humble schools and the noble Lord, Lord Blake, came from an historic city grammar school. We were all products of the Oxford of the 1930s, let alone the Oxford of the post-war era. If Oxford is guilty of elitism--I do not know how one can have academic excellence without some form of elitism--it is a very open elitism.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para116"></a>We have heard a certain amount this afternoon of the phrase "world-class university", which I fear is becoming a little hackneyed. I wish that we could think of a better phrase. Also, it is not totally precise. Few would lay down with absolute certainty what was in and what was out. But few in the academic communities across the world would dispute that the total number, on the strictest criteria, is not more than eight or 10. In addition, few would dispute that in this double handful there is included Oxford and Cambridge and probably all the rest are in the United States. It would be a substantial pity for this country and for the world balance if every world-class university were to be in a single country, the United States of America.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para117"></a>Any university on the European continent would find it very hard to qualify for a number of reasons. First, in Germany the most serious research is done in special institutes. Secondly, in France the grandes ecoles cream off the brightest students. The other reason why they would find it difficult to qualify and perhaps the most important--and it was certainly touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, to whom we are grateful for this debate--is the vast, impersonal size of many of the European big city universities. That means a minimum contact between students and academic staff, one direct consequence of which is that there is a high, and in many cases a frighteningly high, drop-out rate. If the main scholastic activity is to sit at the back of a large lecture hall and take notes, it is only too likely to occur to some that no one will much notice if one is no longer there. The essence of the Oxbridge pattern is the tutorial and collegiate system which is a very good prophylactic against that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para118"></a>As a result, our drop-out rate is not much more than one quarter of even the UK average let alone the general European average. Furthermore, the emphasis of the tutorial collegiate system on talking, arguing and writing rather than on just listening and taking notes interspersed with some reading, is also good at producing finished products with initiative and interest in general ideas. Even at the most utilitarian level that shows itself in the Oxford graduate unemployment rate which, as has also been mentioned, is no more than one-third of the national university average.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para119"></a>For a university to possess world status I suggest that there are three tests that must be passed. The first test is whether its undergraduate teaching produces large numbers of alumni who make significant contributions <P>


<a name="column_202"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 202</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to the life of the nation and in our case at least, to the life and the governing of a great many other nations as well. The second test is whether it has good graduate schools and the third, but certainly not the least, concerns the quality of its research. To be a full university it must also cover the waterfront.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para120"></a>The institution, Imperial College, which educated the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, is, within its field, an example of excellence. The LSE is also a remarkable institution, too. But they do not cover the waterfront. Therefore they cannot stand equal to the greatest American universities. Oxford and Cambridge do. I obviously know more about Oxford than Cambridge. They are equally good by all these criteria. For instance, Oxford is a first-rate undergraduate university and better in many ways in that field than Harvard. However, it is not nearly as major, and perhaps not as good, with regard to graduate studies. It scores very highly in research, having in the past 50 years greatly widened its scope so that it is now, in contrast to the 100 years up to 1940, just as strong a scientific university as Cambridge--and possibly even stronger medically, but I would not want to get into an argument about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para121"></a>The quality of the physical surroundings also contributes to drawing power--another element in world status. Oxford is obviously well blessed in this respect, which means that many renowned scholars come, or return, to us at salaries much lower than those they have achieved or could achieve elsewhere. However, the enticement of such surroundings has its dangers as well as its advantages. Apart from the cost of keeping up the ambience--it would be a national disgrace if it were not maintained--there is the danger that Oxford's buildings could become intellectually empty shells, falling behind the more modern universities in the same country. Indeed, that may have happened to Salamanca in Spain and to Coimbra in Portugal. Oxford's architectural splendour would then become a faded mockery.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para122"></a>If I have a worst case nightmare for Oxford, it is to see it as a run-of-the-mill university, as just one of a "south Midlands group" of England's universities, rattling around in surroundings that are too grand for it, and which happens to have old and inconvenient buildings whose useful life might be thought to be running out. I fear Cambridge being in an equivalent position in East Anglia. I cannot believe that anyone who has spoken in this debate would wish to see that happen to those two great national institutions. The noble Lord, Lord Desai, whose style today I found slightly less generous than normal, perhaps came the nearest to saying that. The nightmare that I have described is emphatically not the style today. Those who doubt that should ask the other world-class universities which recognise Oxford and Cambridge as their co-equals.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para123"></a>Perhaps at this stage I may point out what we are up against financially when maintaining ourselves in that league even without any further financial cuts. Harvard--Yale, Stanford and Princeton, and many others, are not all that far behind--has an endowment of 9 billion US dollars and raises an additional 1 billion dollars each year. In Oxford, where we blazed a <P>


<a name="column_203"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 203</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cisatlantic trail in the raising of private money, we raised &#163;360 million--or half a billion US dollars--over six years by a great effort. Incidentally, when we set out on that course we were given absolute assurances by the previous government--I think that this Government should continue to give those undertakings--that money so raised would not count against us.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para124"></a>Britain, as a medium-sized country without too many recent successes to its credit, is peculiarly lucky to possess one-quarter of the small number of outstanding world universities. Deliberately--or even inadvertently--to throw away that asset would be a perverse act of national self-immolation. It would be regarded as on the borders of national sanity by countries which, as I discovered in China last winter, long to have a world-class university but do not know how to create one and hope that Oxford may be able to advise them in that direction.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para125"></a>The net cost to the Exchequer of Oxford colleges is &#163;19 million. It is strongly my view--not only as Chancellor of Oxford, but also as a former stony-hearted Chancellor of the Exchequer who nevertheless financed the beginning of the Open University which is not wholly dedicated to elitism--that this is a worthwhile and wholly justifiable national investment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para126"></a>It is not my purpose to suggest that everything is perfect in our ancient universities. We need to improve the organisation of our graduate studies. There could be greater financial transparency--although we have gone quite a long way in that direction recently. Above all, we need and want to improve access from state schools. One can exaggerate the extent to which people from non-state schools do too well at Oxford and Cambridge as opposed to anywhere else. There are more old Etonians at Edinburgh than at Oxford at present. I am not sure whether there are not more at Bristol also, but I am not quite sure of that fact. There are certainly a great number. Nevertheless, we want to improve access--not by discriminating against individuals of equal quality and promise, but by encouraging state schools and by improving our liaison with them, as the noble Baroness, Lady David, put it so clearly, so that we get rid of the inhibitions which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, mentioned, prevent many people who could greatly benefit from Oxford from applying.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-06_para127"></a>All that can and will be done but, for God's sake, do not let the advent of this Government, dedicated as they say to education, be marked by inflicting grave damage on two of the institutions which have given Britain a great part of its educational fame and respect throughout the world.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-07_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the expertise, enthusiasm, knowledge and experience contained in this great Chamber is unrivalled. However, in this debate my suspicions were roused by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham. There is emerging a theme running through the policies proposed by this Government, amounting to an attack on what is perceived by the Government as elitist and which, in the interests of all, should be destroyed. Old Labour, under the guise of New Labour, is alive and well. The philosophy of egalitarianism and the politics of envy are still in place. The dictum is, "If it is not possible for all to benefit, then no one shall benefit". In just a few short months so much has been threatened: grammar schools; selection; grant-maintained schools; Church schools; and now two great universities, Oxford and Cambridge and their colleges, which are truly world renowned.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para0"></a>We are, however, witnessing an interesting tension between No. 10 Downing Street and education Ministers. The Prime Minister has already intervened in respect of aided Church schools. We also understand from a number of representations that have already been made to the Prime Minister that he is likely to be sympathetic to the very strong case being put today for the retention of college fees for Oxford and Cambridge.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para1"></a>As the Prime Minister experiences at first hand the remarkable success of grant-maintained schools and the reasonable but sensible forms of selection at the schools being considered suitable, quite rightly, for his daughter, I believe that the case for intervention in policy will prove even greater for him. For what is indisputable is that allowing the best to flourish provides encouragement and incentives to raise standards throughout the educational system. Simply put, a policy of levelling up, not levelling down, is the key to raising standards for all.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para2"></a>There is no argument between us that additional resources need to be found for higher education. Indeed, the Dearing Report was commissioned with that in mind. It is deeply unfortunate therefore that the Government have moved away from Dearing's recommendation on tuition fees in favour of a proposal that will do so much to deter bright young people from poorer homes from entering higher education. That policy together with the loss of college fees at Oxbridge colleges will adversely affect the quality of provision for the very brightest of such young people. If that were not enough to exacerbate the issue of higher education funding, the Government have remained dogged in their <P>


<a name="column_205"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 205</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>determination not to give an undertaking that moneys raised from tuition fees and saved from maintenance grants will be dedicated to higher education.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para3"></a>The colleges of Oxford and Cambridge are not complacent about access. So much has been and continues to be done by Oxbridge colleges without compromising standards to improve access for students of ability from all backgrounds. In response to a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, college admissions tutors are very energetic and proactive in their efforts to widen access and seek out potential applicants, including among other things visiting and liaising with schools where there has not been a tradition of applying to Oxford and Cambridge, the running of summer schools, the holding of open days and the provision of additional funds to support needy students, scholarships and hardship funds.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para4"></a>My Lords, make no mistake: the loss of college fees will create serious problems for colleges. For some colleges at both Oxford and Cambridge those problems will be insuperable. The fees are not top-up fees as such; they replace in part the income once generated by charging at these independent free-standing institutions with their own Royal Charter. Any return to charging would benefit the wealthy and, in turn, affect access by able young people from poorer homes. As the noble Lord, Lord Plant, has said, Oxbridge would become more exclusive. Redundancies would be inevitable, as the collegiate tutorial system, which is key to the success of an Oxbridge education, would be very badly affected.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para5"></a>It may well be that the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, and Sir Christopher Ball--who, incidentally, made an outrageous accusation which is recorded in today's Guardian--believe that the loss of college fees of approximately &#163;35 million can be easily borne by Oxford and Cambridge. If so, the noble Baroness must explain how that can be done. I believe that, given that the fees represent between 30 per cent. and 50 per cent. of income to some colleges and over 50 per cent. to others, this loss would be irrecoverable. Any suggestion that income from endowments or investments by the two universities and colleges could produce annual revenue income on this scale year on year is fanciful. A redistribution scheme to support the poorer colleges already exists within both universities. However the idea that there is capacity to generate additional millions over and above the amounts already raised by the colleges is, as I have said, fanciful.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para6"></a>One cannot over-estimate what is at stake here: two universities which are among the best, if not the best, in the world, with an excellent reputation for the quality of their teaching and research and an extremely low drop-out rate, all underpinned by an unrivalled collegiate tutorial system. Any attempt to damage this would be myopic in the extreme. Whatever the Government decide eventually, any proposal that undermines the Oxford and Cambridge tutorial system which has proved so successful will not receive my support nor, I suspect, the support of this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para7"></a>What is being argued today is simply that there is a powerful case for continuing the long-established policy to support the unique and highly successful collegiate <P>


<a name="column_206"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 206</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tutorial system at Oxford and Cambridge and that, should the Government argue that moneys are needed elsewhere in the higher education sector, to destroy what has proved to be a world class provision by removing college fees to be dispersed elsewhere in the system is perverse, as has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead. I do not believe that any noble Lord who has supported my noble friend Lord Beloff today wishes to detract in any way from the needs of other universities and colleges. The thrust of the case that is put today is that to remove college fees and destroy something that works well is no way to resolve another problem elsewhere in the sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para8"></a>It is a much talked about prediction--it is even hinted at by the noble Baroness herself--that the noble Baroness may become the next chairman of the Arts Council. Should that come about perhaps I may in anticipation offer my warmest congratulations. Further, I implore the noble Baroness as a possible valedictory act to abandon any notion of removing the college fees from Oxford and Cambridge and to make a commitment, if possible today, that monies generated from tuition fees and saved from the abolition of the maintenance grant will be dedicated to the higher education sector. It is mean-spirited politics to see excellence as a form of unacceptable elitism. We should not only celebrate excellence but encourage and nurture it.

<A NAME = "71112-07_para9"></a>I welcome this opportunity to debate an issue that is attracting a great deal of interest, which has been reflected in the many contributions made by noble Lords in the House this afternoon.

Noble Lords will recall that when asked about priorities for the new Government the response of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister was "Education, education, education". The third and very important element of that trinity is higher education. I can assure this House that the Government are committed to a world-class higher education system based on high quality learning and teaching.
<P>


<a name="column_207"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 207</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para11"></a>The new Government have already taken decisive action to address the serious funding problems for higher education left by the previous government, to which the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, and my noble friend Lord Desai referred. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment announced on 23rd September a package of measures which will allow an extra &#163;165 million to be spent on higher education in 1998-99. Universities and colleges will have an extra &#163;125 million for that year to maintain and improve quality and standards and to make a start on the backlog of maintenance and equipment replacement left by the previous government. Four million pounds will be available for a limited start on growth, mainly through sub-degree courses, and &#163;36 million will be available to improve access, including measures to help part-time and disabled students. That is about the same amount of money that is currently spent on fees at Oxford and Cambridge. That is not a paltry sum, as some speakers in today's debate have claimed. The Government's total package ensures that universities do not face cut-backs at the level planned by the previous government.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para12"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, suggested that the Government had made no commitment about using the extra funding to be gained from the new system of student support for higher education. Perhaps I may correct her. The Government have, on more than one occasion--and in this House, and in another place--said that the additional funding will be used for further and higher education.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para13"></a>The noble Baroness suggested that the new system of charging a tuition fee, with changes to the maintenance system, would be unfair on many students and deter them from entering higher education. I would remind her that her right honourable friend Mr. Steven Dorrell said in another place on the 23rd July that he was passionately against tuition fees. She has now told us that she is in favour of tuition fees. Moreover, her right honourable friend, only a week ago, seems to have changed his mind. He now wants fees without the means-testing that the Government are introducing in order to help young people who come from low income families. The Opposition seem to be a little confused and are chopping and changing their minds about this.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para14"></a>We value excellence in all areas of our education system and we wish to encourage those universities which are renowned centres of excellence for their teaching or internationally known for the quality of their research. A number of noble Lords have referred to the outstanding quality of research conducted at Oxford and Cambridge and the need to safeguard that excellence. Oxford and Cambridge do indeed have an enviable international reputation for research across a wide range of disciplines, and we do not intend to jeopardise that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para15"></a>Unlike many other noble Lords who have spoken in the debate, I have no personal interest to declare. I am one of the small minority who have spoken today who is not a graduate of either Oxford or Cambridge, nor have I been directly employed in teaching or research at either university, although over the years I have collaborated with a number of people in both <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>universities and members of my family have attended them. My external examiner for my doctorate, whom I have always held in very high esteem and who has been an important influence on me, was from Oxbridge. Of course, I have many close friends in both universities, including past and present heads of houses.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para16"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, that it is always dangerous to listen to common-room gossip--perhaps even more dangerous than listening to gossip in the bars of the Palace of Westminster. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, that I have no intention of becoming the chairman of the Arts Council. She, too, should not read gossip which is sometimes found in the columns of our newspapers. I am very much enjoying my present job and I intend to continue with it and deliver a higher education system of which this country can be proud rather than the sort of system left behind by the previous government.

<A NAME = "71112-07_para17"></a>My noble friend Lord Plant, the right reverend Prelate and the noble Lord, Lord Baker, said that we should not forget that Oxford and Cambridge are not the only centres of excellence in the country. Indeed, it is disparaging of other universities who are doing work of the highest quality, which also have an international reputation, to suggest that there are only two excellent universities in this country. At least six other multi-faculty institutions, and a host of specialist institutions, have half or more of their research-active staff in departments rated five or five starred at the last research assessment exercise.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para18"></a>Take University College of London, for example, with 33 out of 47 departments rated five or five starred. Or Imperial College London, with 18 out of 24 departments rated five or five starred. Neither of them--or other institutions with very high research assessments, such as the LSE or Bath or Sussex or UMIST or Warwick or Lancaster--would take kindly to the notion that there are only two centres of excellence in this country.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para19"></a>Let me now set out the factual position on college fees. The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge--like other universities--receive support from public funds in the form of grant from the Higher Education Funding Council for England and tuition fees paid at present through mandatory awards. The Oxbridge colleges, constitutionally independent of the universities, are not funded by the Funding Council. Their only source of income from public funds is the college fee, which has been paid on behalf of students by local authorities under the Mandatory Awards Regulations since 1962. I hope this clarifies matters for my noble friend Lord Morris of Castle Morris and the noble Lord, Lord Gibson, both of whom seemed to slightly misunderstand the present system.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para20"></a>College fees for Oxbridge undergraduates currently range from &#163;2,500 to &#163;3,400. Incidentally, perhaps I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, that we are talking about undergraduates today, not postgraduate students.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para21"></a>The college fee represents the provision of a wide variety of services--tuition, libraries and other facilities--which in Oxford and Cambridge are provided <P>


<a name="column_209"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 209</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in addition to services provided by the central university. It also reflects the Oxbridge individual tutorial approach. In order to avoid double funding, the funding council adjusts the teaching grant to the two parent universities, effectively clawing back some 40 per cent. of college fee income. Once allowance has been made for the 40 per cent. abatement of HEFCE grant to the parent universities to take account of the college fees, the net extra cost to the taxpayer is, as many noble Lords have said, some &#163;35m. Once the adjustment has been made to avoid double funding, the level of funding per student is an average of &#163;5,800 compared with average funding of &#163;4,000 in other universities. As my noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham has said, this represents a 45 per cent. premium for Oxford and Cambridge.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para22"></a>Under the previous government, annual adjustments to the level of college fee were calculated according to a formula. I would explain to my noble friend Lord Morris of Castle Morris that the negotiations were conducted by the funding council, but the final decision rested with the Secretary of State.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para23"></a>As your Lordships know, the report of the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education, chaired by Sir Ron Dearing, was published on 23rd July. The national committee was set up by the previous government with cross-party support. The terms of reference asked it to take into account a number of principles, including that students should be able to choose between a diverse range of courses and institutions, and that value for money and cost effectiveness should be obtained in the use of resources.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para24"></a>The committee endorsed two further principles, one of which was that
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the various beneficiaries of higher education should share its costs, and public subsidies should be distributed equitably so that individuals are not denied access to higher education through lack of financial means". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para25"></a>Against the background of this latter principle the committee recommended that there should be no variations in the level of public funding for teaching--outside modest margins--without very good reasons.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para26"></a>It suggested that such good reasons might be that, first, there is an approved difference of provision and, secondly, society, through the Secretary of State or his or her agent, has concluded after examining an exceptionally high level of funding, that in relation to other funding needs in higher education it represents a good use of resources.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para27"></a>The committee recognised that college fees at Oxford and Cambridge represent a substantial addition to standard funding and proposed that the Government should review them. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, for accepting that it was right for the Government to respond to the Dearing Committee and ask for a review and for advice.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para28"></a>In August, we wrote to the funding council asking for its advice. We asked it to have regard to the points raised in the report of the Dearing Inquiry, and to its new funding method for teaching, which will be based on the principle of a standard price for each of four broad subject groups.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para29"></a>The funding council has been consulting the two universities and their colleges. We expect its advice later this month. There have been reports in the press of what the funding council is likely to say but I must stress that it has not yet submitted its advice to the department and I am not going to make presumptions about what that advice is likely to contain.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para30"></a>When we receive the funding council's advice we shall consider it carefully along with the arguments which have been advanced today, and in the wider more public debate that has been taking place. We recognise the need to maintain the very high quality of education offered at Oxford and Cambridge and to seek to ensure that, in any change, those colleges that do not have historic funds or legacies on which to draw are not disadvantaged seriously. I hope that that reassures my noble friend Lady David and the noble Baroness, Lady Park.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para31"></a>Mention has been made today of the scale of Oxbridge college assets. The colleges are private, autonomous institutions and my department does not have access to information about their net assets, though articles on the subject appear in the press from time to time. But we fully take the point that there is a considerable disparity in the wealth of individual institutions, depending on the age and nature of their endowments.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para32"></a>I am also fully seized of the need to respect the constitutional relationship between the universities and the colleges. That is clearly a complex area and I do not underestimate the difficulties that there would be in implementing any change.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para33"></a>Let me stress that the Government and the funding council are clear about the need, in the words of the Motion for today's debate, to safeguard the future of both universities. The funding council's commitment is already more than evident by the scale of funding which the two universities receive--some &#163;110 million a year each, taking account of income from college fees. Each of them will receive some &#163;50 million this academic year in research funding from the funding council alone. Together they will receive some &#163;100 million out of a total &#163;700 million: that means around 15 per cent. of all HEFCE research funds go to those two universities alone. If we ignore staff paid for from specific funds, each research active member of staff at those two universities is funded to the tune of some 80 per cent. above the average for other universities. I stress that that has nothing to do with college fees. A different sum is provided for research excellence, and it can be fully justified in terms of research excellence. It is already a great deal more than other universities receive.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para34"></a>It is clearly in no one's interest to undermine the reputation of Oxford and Cambridge, but we and the council must have proper concern about value for money. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, will accept that that is the job of government. We must always consider that matter. As I have already said, and as other noble Lords have pointed out, other universities of course achieve excellent ratings in teaching and research assessments. Some, as the right reverend <P>


<a name="column_211"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 211</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Prelate and other noble Lords have pointed out, have tutorial groups, even though they do not have the benefit of the substantial premium from college fees.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para35"></a>There is a proper balance to be struck and the funding council will, I am sure, take due account of the special features of Oxbridge in putting forward its advice. We for our part will bear those special features in mind in considering that advice.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para36"></a>Various points have been made by noble Lords today about particular aspects of expenditure by the colleges. Mention was made by my noble friend Lord Desai of duplication of administrative functions and the scope for rationalisation of college administration. Those are all points which we would expect the funding council to cover in its advice.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para37"></a>My noble friends Lord Morris of Castle Morris and Lord Davies of Oldham commented about the high proportion of Oxford entrants who come from private schools. Other noble Lords have pointed to the commendable steps--and they are commendable--some colleges are taking to widen access to admit more students educated at state schools. Some of them are clearly able to do that. I hope that more will be able to in future.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para38"></a>Oxford and Cambridge are, like all higher education institutions, responsible for their own admissions procedures and the Government have no locus in that area. So I cannot confirm the claim of my noble friend Lady David about the LSE. The review of college fees is not about admissions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para39"></a>Let me take the opportunity to reaffirm this Government's passionate commitment to widening access, and our determination to increase participation by those groups which are currently under represented in higher education. Let me stress the importance that we attach to the principle that access to particular institutions should be based on academic merit rather than ability to pay for private schools. Some noble Lords have urged that universities and colleges should have the power to charge top-up fees and let the market rule. As I have already said, we believe that access to particular institutions and courses should be based on academic merit rather than the ability to pay.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para40"></a>Choice of institution should not be distorted by the level of the fee charged. We agree with the Dearing Committee, that no able student should be denied access to an institution of his or her choice through lack of funds. We have already made it clear that top-up fees play no part in the Government's proposals for future funding arrangements for higher education. In answer to my noble friend Lord Plant, the Government are still considering whether they should take a reserve power to prevent universities or colleges charging a top-up fee for full-time undergraduates, charged up front, over and above the fee that is to be set by the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para41"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, that that does not mean that individual institutions cannot raise some of their own revenue. Universities, not just Oxford and Cambridge, raise their own revenue in a variety of respects. They have appeals. They raise money for particular research projects and funding from outside the <P>


<a name="column_212"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 212</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>public funding through the HEFCE. They raise money from letting their facilities during the vacation. There is no reason why any of that should not go on. The Government's concern is merely about charging a top-up fee over and above what is to be charged under the new system, which we think would deter students from going to the universities that decide to introduce them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para42"></a>In conclusion, having listened carefully to what has been said in the debate on both sides of the argument--and of course there have been two sides--I can assure the House that we shall consider carefully the funding council's advice in deciding the way forward. We shall do so, first, with a view to value for money, in a context where the university sector was left in a serious financial crisis by the previous Government; and, secondly, the preservation of high quality teaching and research at Oxford and Cambridge.

<A NAME="71112-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Beloff: </B>   My Lords, we have had a very interesting four hours and have heard many speeches. I thank all noble Lords, although not all necessarily by name. One always wonders what will emerge in Hansard. I hasten to say that there will be one total inaccuracy. The noble Earl, Lord Carlisle, was mistaken in his belief that I had anything whatever to do with the foundation of the Open University. No doubt the new biography of its true founder, written by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, will give him the correct answer.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para43"></a>I learnt that the noble Lord, Lord Desai, is not a graduate of Oxford, Cambridge or any analogous British institution. I can only say how much I regret that. I believe that if he had been subjected to the discipline of an Oxford tutorial his eloquence would not have been marred by an indifference to the facts that he was discussing.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-07_para44"></a>Much was made about access, and rightly so. I have always wondered how one would broaden it. It is probably the greatest problem facing the major universities, not only Oxford and Cambridge. But when one looks at Oxford, at any rate, it is remarkable that, wherever undergraduates come from, in the end they form a community and do much the same things. Perhaps I may give two examples. One student comes from a grammar school, works very hard, becomes President of the Union and gains a first-class degree. The second student comes from a public school, plays a guitar in a pop group and gains a second-class degree. Yet there they are at the other end of the Palace, almost interchangeable! I beg leave to withdraw the Motion.

<P>


<a name="column_213"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 213</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, until the past few weeks it has been assumed in Scotland that a Scots parliament, if it ever came about, would be sited at Edinburgh's Calton Hill, using the handsome building which was once the Royal High School, the fine 1930s Scottish Office building across the road and buildings and lands adjacent to both. It is well known that the chamber for the parliament's meetings already exists there. It was created for the Scottish assembly planned for 1979, but since that was turned down in a referendum it has been used from time to time for meetings of the Scottish Grand Committee and other bodies. Therefore, most people know from television what that chamber looks like. People have also seen on their television screens devotees earnestly keeping day and night vigils on the hill, packing up in celebratory style only when the referendum result was announced.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para1"></a>Therefore, there was some astonishment when recently the Secretary of State for Scotland expressed the view that Calton Hill, so long taken for granted, was too expensive. It was said to be an awkward site and the Government believed that a bright and purpose-built parliament at Leith, close to a building recently erected for civil servants, would be cheaper and more convenient. There was an immediate outcry against that idea. The Government did one of their swift somersaults and said that three sites--Calton Hill, Leith and one near Haymarket--would be examined and costed as possible options.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para2"></a>In Written and Oral Answers in another place, at cols. 107 and 157 of the Official Report of 4th November, the Secretary of State announced the commissioning of design feasibility studies for the three sites, costings and transport and environmental impact assessments. The firms involved were named and it was said that the work was to be completed by mid-December at a cost of &#163;250,000.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para3"></a>That was probably a necessary decision, although the timescale looks tight. Since the existence of three options was revealed, the machinations of competing vested interests, not least within the Edinburgh local authority and the Port Authority, have made it difficult for the public to assess the true pros and cons. I just hope that the Secretary of State will not do as the Government did in respect of university fees and Dearing; I hope that he will not announce his decision on the day the report is published and, because of haste, get it wrong. Perhaps the Minister will assure us that he will allow time for people to study the report before any decisions are made. I say that because this is an important decision for all of us in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para4"></a>Of course, cost matters greatly, but it has to be said that the whole devolution exercise will not come cheap. Comparatively small differences in the cost of the options should certainly not be the only deciding factor. If devolution is to give the satisfaction that is intended--and we must all hope that it does--surely the parliament building must be a worthy focus; a prominent building of quality on a first-class site; a beacon--as Mr. Blair likes to say--at the centre of Scotland's national life; a symbol of Scotland's particular place within the United Kingdom that benefits us all.
<P>


<a name="column_214"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 214</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para5"></a>Obviously, it must also be as accessible as possible from all parts of Scotland and beyond for elected members, civil servants and the public. I quite see that an exciting new building has attractions, but to site it down by the sea at Leith, attractive as Leith may be, would be like asking everyone working at or visiting the United Kingdom Parliament to come and go to London's Docklands. I suggest that only the group of civil servants already housed at Leith would find that idea convenient.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para6"></a>To site a new building near Haymarket would certainly make more sense than Leith. Trains from the west and north stop there, it is on the right side of the city centre for the airport and space is available. But it seemed to me--I may be wrong--that the site cannot be prominent or give a feeling of "specialness", unless the Secretary of State has Donaldson's Hospital building in mind. However, I do not believe that that has ever been mentioned.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para7"></a>On the other hand, Calton Hill is already special. It is even more accessible by rail than Haymarket, being five minutes walk from Waverley Station where all trains to Edinburgh arrive. It is marginally less easy to reach by road from the west and north but easier from the east and south. Calton Hill's real specialness is in its position and existing buildings. On a hillside visible from much of the city, with a magnificent view of Arthur's Seat, the old Royal High School is an impressive pillared classical building, solid and unadorned in Scots style, designed by Thomas Hamilton and completed in 1829.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para8"></a>Inside is the 1979 debating chamber. It is U-shaped and thus appropriate for the not-so-confrontational style which we are told proportional representation will produce. That and the accommodation around were designed for an assembly of 144 members, so it should easily contain the 129 members now proposed, particularly, I suggest, as new technology demands less manpower.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para9"></a>Over the road in St. Andrew's House is the Scottish Office, designed for that purpose by William Tait in the style of the 1930s and opened in 1939. There will be no need for the Scottish Office any more so, with a bridge over the road or, some suggest, a tunnel, that building could house the elected members' offices and perhaps any conferences too large for the intimate high school chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para10"></a>Appropriately, over the doors of that building--and some of your Lordships will know this--are statues by Reid Dick. They represent health, agriculture, fisheries, education and architecture or housing, all powers to be devolved to the parliament. A sixth statue seems likewise to be tailor-made: it represents statecraft. I have not seen it but I understand that there is room in a courtyard behind St. Andrew's House for some extra accommodation; for example, a media centre could be situated there. All that would mean relocating a comparatively small number of civil servants now based in St. Andrew's House. I suggest that that should not be too much of a problem since the Scottish Office departments are already scattered in various parts of the city besides Leith--at South Gyle, Saughton, Sight Hill and so on.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para11"></a>Apart from those buildings, Calton Hill has other features representing Scotland's key role in United Kingdom and European history. On top of the hill, visible from most of the city is the memorial to Scots who died in the Napoleonic Wars, the first memorial to Nelson erected in 1819, long before London's Nelson's Column, a Carnegie, I may say, having commanded the van at Trafalgar. There is the old City Observatory, a house by James Craig who laid out the New Town of Edinburgh, a monument to Hume and down the road, a statue of Burns. There is also, it must be said, some shady activity at night which badly needs cleaning up, high on the hill.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para12"></a>The Prime Minister is keen to emphasis that which is new, fresh and modern about our country. I agree with him wholeheartedly. But when you possess a site like Calton Hill, convenient to reach, sitting splendidly above the capital city, full of the past 200 years of Scotland's story and for 20 years the focus of expectation for the next chapter of history, is it right to cast aside that site? I believe that it is at least a debatable question. I much look forward to hearing the views of other noble Lords and, of course, to the Minister's reply. My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.

<P>
<A NAME="71112-08_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, for introducing this debate about the location of our longed-for Scottish parliament. I welcome also the noble Lord, Lord Selkirk of Douglas, to a speakers' list of what is otherwise made up of the usual suspects.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para13"></a>It is a strange feature that the issue of the site has become a crisis only since the highly satisfactory referendum result. There was a sense of relief at the central count at the EICC when the first result, from Clackmannanshire, proved to be a magnificent 80-68 in favour, which set the tone for that long night. It is worth saying that I believe that the Scottish electorate was extremely impressed by the formation of the broadest coalition that Scotland has seen in recent years. The level of consensus achieved was noteworthy and much approved of.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para14"></a>I turn to the discussion of the site of the parliament. This is not the first time in this century that the UK and its Parliament has had to face up to the issue of selecting the site of a new parliament. After the Government of Ireland Act 1920, locations were sought in both Dublin and Belfast. The issue of tradition was certainly present in the consideration of a site for the admittedly ill-fated parliament of southern Ireland. However, there were no such considerations in Belfast when a greenfield and peripheral site was chosen at Stormont Castle for the parliament of Northern Ireland. I make the observation that Belfast had never previously been a capital city.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para15"></a>In terms of Scotland and its parliament, I believe that the arguments for a location outside of Edinburgh are now all lost. That does not mean that the claims of, for example, Glasgow, Falkirk, Sterling, Perth and Dunfermline, are not valid. They all have merit in either historical, economic or geographic terms. I accept that <P>


<a name="column_216"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 216</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Edinburgh has the acceptable claim both in terms of tradition and reasonable public transport. Yes, the Scottish parliament met in Edinburgh on most occasions in the years leading up to the Union of the parliaments; and yes, Scottish public transport is reasonably orientated towards Edinburgh, although it must be said that Glasgow Airport has a greater volume of traffic and a wider network, particularly from the islands. Rail communication, where it exists, is possibly better for Edinburgh. However, it remains a long way from the remoter areas of the north and north west Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para16"></a>Within the city of Edinburgh, there are sites with various merits. Calton Hill has good public transport links but may be rather congested. Leith has the merits of a brownfield site for, I suspect, a shiny new parliament but at present has poor public transport links. Morrison Street car park has trains rumbling underneath it. Having suffered that phenomenon for 39 days of the Strathclyde tram inquiry at Charing Cross in Glasgow, I do not wish that on the Scottish parliament. It must be said that the Morrison Street car park has admirable links with Haymarket railway station but now with the buses from outwith Edinburgh.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para17"></a>Whichever site is chosen, there must be room for the parliament and its inevitable range of facilities. It would be sensible to ensure that the parliamentary estate is adequate for more than just a devolved parliament with limited powers. It would be wise to do that now as I believe that progress will be made towards either federal autonomy or independence within the next two decades, and that based on the confidence gained from home rule.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para18"></a>In support of that, when I see the Barnett formula being tossed aside and the President of the Board of Trade trying to stamp out internal competition, I can see that there is still along way to go in learning how to run a Union. The loss of incentives to stay in the UK will play a significant part in loosening the Union ties. We are supposed to be developing a United Kingdom that is not dominated by any one part. The benefit of UK membership is always under review and continuously needs to be proved.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para19"></a>I return to the parliamentary estate in Edinburgh. Will this be a physical presence chamber or will electronics be allowed in? Will we be taking the necessary steps to allow the members (or "commissioners" as I would call them) to participate from their constituencies on occasions? Alternatively, will we be insisting that the distant members have to leave home for parliamentary work on every occasion?
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-08_para20"></a>If I thought earlier that the Calton Hill site might be constrained by lack of space, that will ultimately be determined by the range of facilities that the parliament has. I do understand that this site includes the use of the old Scottish Office and the old GPO building. It is not just the range of offices and meeting rooms, it is also to do with the scale of the refreshment department--<FONT SIZE=3><P>

I would hope that the parliament, committed to consensus politics, will adopt, from this House, the use of the long-table principle and avoid eating by political party. The prospect has to be that, if about 5,000 people work in this building in Westminster, then I suppose that 1,000 will work in the Scottish parliament buildings.

First, I hope that the Scottish version of the UK coat of arms--yes, my Lords, that is the one with the motto Nemo me impune lacessit (two lions rampant with three leopards and a harp)--will be used throughout the parliament and on all its legislation. Of course, it is already used by the Scottish Office.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para2"></a>I also hope that the officers of the parliament will have the historic names attached to the new titles. This would be similar in style to the Leader of the House of Lords, who is also known as the Lord Privy Seal, a historic title. So, the presiding officer would have the title of Lord High Chancellor appended in brackets to his title. The first Minister, whose modern title might well be the Convenor, should have appended the title of Lord High Commissioner. So, too, might the ministerial titles of Principal Secretary and Chief Principal Secretary.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para3"></a>Moreover, as I have already said, I hope that the members will be referred to as, for example, the Commissioner for Clackmannanshire--or, more correctly, Ochil. Those historic links should act as an aide memoire that this is not a parliament in the mould of the Westminster Parliament, but a new creation drawing strongly on its own historic parliamentary traditions. I wish Donald Dewar and his team well in this venture. We owe them a great deal. I hope that this issue of the site can be resolved soon so that we can get on with designing the parliament to meet the needs of the people; the first of which must be to make it accessible, both physically and politically, to the electorate and its interest groups.

<A NAME="71112-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   My Lords, the importance of the decisions as to where to site the new Scottish parliament, and what form of design it should take, cannot be underestimated. Therefore, my noble friend Lady Carnegy is to be congratulated upon initiating tonight's debate. The noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, referred to the "usual suspects" being on the list of speakers. I am not sure that that is entirely correct as some of those usual suspects are missing. In particular, when one looks at the Benches behind the Minister, one notices not only that there are no speakers but also that there are no listeners. It is a matter of some regret that those who have promoted a devolved parliament with, one has to say, a measure of eloquence and a considerable measure of success, have not found it possible to be with us tonight to give us the benefit of their view; and, indeed, to give the Minister the benefit of their support. One can only wonder why they are not present. However, in the hope that this might be a <P>


<a name="column_218"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 218</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>constructive debate, I shall refrain from speculating as to why they are not with us. But, as I said, it is a matter of some regret.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para4"></a>As the parliamentary Answers last week made clear, the Government are currently considering three options. They are to be congratulated on their decision to consult widely on those options. I have seen some of the preliminary papers and clearly much more detailed work needs to be done. However, the wish to consult with other political parties and other interested parties is to be welcomed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para5"></a>If a decision were to be taken as to location and design, I understand that it would not be possible to have the building complete and fully operational by the date when it is anticipated that the new Scottish parliament will start its work. For that reason, some temporary accommodation will be necessary and that will need to be fitted out to allow for a parliamentary chamber, committee rooms and all the ancillary offices required by a parliamentary assembly. I hope that the Minister will be in a position to confirm in his reply that that is likely to be the situation. If it is, I venture to suggest that another option ought to be considered; namely, to wait until the parliament is up and running before any final decisions are taken, certainly so far as concerns the overall design of the building.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para6"></a>Much was made during the referendum campaign--and understandably so--of how this would be a new form of parliamentary assembly which would evolve new techniques for dealing with parliamentary business. That theme has already been mentioned by the noble Earl. If that is correct, it seems to me that there would be great value in waiting to see what those procedures are, how the committee structure evolves and what role non-members of the parliament are to have in the work of committees. There are also less important matters, such as whether members will wish to dine together or separately to be considered. Indeed, various aspects of the functioning of the building ought to be put into the design and construction of the new building that will be required.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para7"></a>I say a "new building" because in my view it is impossible--and regrettably so--to alter the old Royal High School building and make it into a suitable parliamentary chamber. I worked in that building for about four years in the early 1980s as an advocate depute. Noble Lords will recall that, in anticipation of an assembly coming into being at the end of the 1970s, the building was purchased by the then government and fitted out to a very high standard for the proposed assembly. In the event, it was not required and, having lain vacant for a while, the Crown Office, the Lord Advocate's department in Scotland, occupied it. In a way it was a pleasant building in which to work. It had wonderful car parking facilities, to which even the lowliest members of staff had access, especially on a Saturday morning when they wished to shop in Princes Street. However, it was quite obviously unsuitable. Many of the rooms are very large, while others are very small. Without completely destroying the character of the building, both internally and externally, I see no way in which it could be used, however regrettable that may be to those who are committed to the success of a <P>


<a name="column_219"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 219</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>devolved parliament. Accordingly, a new building is required. Drawing on my experience regarding how long it takes to design, construct and bring into operation new courts of law, it is easy to understand how that cannot be achieved by early in the year 2000.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para8"></a>I hope therefore that if my understanding of the position is correct, the Government will at least give some consideration to this fourth option of deferring any final decision until the parliament has been elected. That is not to suggest that work should cease. Clearly much work could be done in the interim on issues of land ownership, planning and the traffic management of the various designs that are being submitted. But, ultimately, I believe it is for the members of the new parliament to decide what building they wish to occupy and in particular what design it should have. Normally if people are buying a house or moving into new offices, it is they who take the important decisions rather than others on their behalf. I suggest that there might be some prudence in following such a course notwithstanding the importance of the decisions which lie ahead.

<A NAME="71112-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, in the debate on the Motion that the referendum Bill should pass in July, I poured scorn on the idea that any new building was going to be ready by January 2000, and I am amused to discover that now I am not alone in holding that view. But four months on, I am wondering whether there is really any necessity to have the building ready for January 2000. After all, the devolution Bill, which we were told last summer was drafted and all ready to start in another place in October--hence the rush to hold the referendum--has apparently not even finished being drafted yet, let alone started its journey through Parliament. At this rate it will have to be put off until next Session, unless this one is prolonged possibly into 1999.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para9"></a>At that time, last summer, many possible sites were being canvassed, and now we appear to be down to three possibilities. The trouble is that we do not have enough information. We are told that the Haymarket could be developed for &#163;26 million, by January 2000, with a glass building. I cannot help wondering what the quality of the building would be, if it can be run up so quickly and cheaply. What would it be like to work in a glass building? Rather like working in a goldfish bowl, I suspect. Most of the glass buildings I see are remarkably characterless, and I should not like our parliament to be just like another multinational corporation's headquarters. I think that the unattractive surroundings of the Morrison Street car park are a considerable drawback. No doubt with time, they could be acquired, bulldozed and redeveloped, but is the cost of doing that included in the &#163;26 million? Where are the cars at present using the car park to go? Where will the cars of members of the Scottish parliament and staff go? An underground car park would seem to be the answer, but--as, I think the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, pointed out--the railway runs through a tunnel underneath the site, and quite apart from the annoyance that the noise of the trains would cause to the members <P>


<a name="column_220"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 220</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of parliament and those others working there, that could make the creation of a car park difficult, and there could be a security problem in a car park shared with the public. Again, was the cost of a car park included in the &#163;26 million? Admittedly it is central, but that is the only advantage I can see, not being sold on the idea of a modern building.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para10"></a>Turning to the Leith site, again I ask what was included in the &#163;30 million? What sort and quality of building was contemplated? Was the acquisition and demolition of all the seedy tenements round about included? Was the construction of a new road, and possibly a rail link with the Waverley Station included? I suspect not. And we have to consider how long all that would take, as well as the cost.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para11"></a>The Calton Hill site is undeniably the most expensive on the face of it, at &#163;40 million. Again we need to know what we are getting for that &#163;40 million. What we already have, as the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, has said, is a very fine building by Thomas Hamilton, with a fine dignified debating chamber. I think this is more important than might at first appear. If the buildings and debating chamber of our parliament do not have dignity and some degree of gravitas, the conduct of its members will be likely to leave much to be desired. Surroundings do make a difference to people's conduct, just as formal dress leads to better conduct. If Members of another place were allowed to wear jeans, sweatshirts and trainers, they would be brawling all over the place like a lot of playground layabouts.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para12"></a>But then we are told that there is inadequate room for the public or the press. I wonder whether nowadays that is as important as it used to be. After all the public need not attend a debate now to hear what is going on, it can all be televised. The public only need access for amusement, and that could be rationed. I wonder whether the press could not work by video link, possibly even from another building, such as St. Andrew's House or even further afield. What kind of link with St. Andrew's House is envisaged? What car parking facilities are envisaged?
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para13"></a>I know the motor car is no longer politically correct, and that it is hoped that everyone is going to arrive by public transport or on foot. Most of the staff, who will be local residents, probably will, but quite a lot of MSPs will not. They will use their cars to come from their constituencies on Monday, with their luggage, and to go back to them on Thursday or Friday. They may need them for parliamentary business during the week too. You really must allow for that. Taxis are not easy in Edinburgh. You can easily queue for one for 20 minutes or half an hour at Waverley Station and the same applies at the airport, where the organisation is abysmal, and you stand in the rain too.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para14"></a>No site is ever going to be ideal, but I certainly come down heavily on the side of Calton Hill and the High School. If we were doing this 200 years ago, and the services of those two greatest of British architects, Robert and James Adam, were available, it would be quite a different matter. Then I should plump possibly for the Haymarket site. But they are not, and I doubt whether there is an architect in the world today whom <P>


<a name="column_221"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 221</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I should consider capable of designing a suitable, dignified building. Last, but by no means least, it appears to be the option which the people of Scotland favour, and I think that some attention should be paid to their wishes.

<P>
<A NAME="71112-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Selkirk of Douglas: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, is to be warmly congratulated on raising this issue. If I may, I wish to support the conclusion of the noble Lady who has just spoken in favour of Calton Hill. I was for some 25 years an elected representative in Edinburgh and I believe that the people of Edinburgh have a strong preference for Calton Hill for three reasons.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para15"></a>First, Calton Hill is at the heart of Scotland's capital and there is excellent access to it. Not only are the central railway station and central bus station extremely close, but before long there will be a guided busway from the airport to St. Andrew's Square. The citizens of Edinburgh want to have a parliament which is readily accessible to people from all over Scotland and elsewhere. No other site can compare with Calton Hill in terms of ready access.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para16"></a>Secondly, Calton Hill is the obvious city centre site with the magnificent backdrop of Edinburgh Castle, the cupola of St. Giles Cathedral, the Royal Mile, the City Council and Holyrood Palace, as well as the National Gallery and the Princes Street Gardens. Much of the city centre near Calton Hill is a world heritage site. Calton Hill itself is a dramatic site. It can be seen from every direction in Edinburgh. It has been described as,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an upthrust of volcanic rock rich in national symbolism at the heart of the capital". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para17"></a>We have already heard about the unfinished parthenon standing as a memorial to those who gave their lives in the Napoleonic wars. As for the monument to Nelson nearby, the view from the top of it is one of the most impressive in Europe. The Scottish Office itself at St. Andrew's House with its huge bronze doors with Scottish saints engraved upon them looks like a place to which men and women would wish to come to make representations and to obtain redress of grievances. Calton Hill has the atmosphere and the aura associated with national affairs and as one would expect Edinburgh Council supports a parliament on this site. Here is a site in the Athens of the north to which the people of Scotland can journey with ease and in which they could have great pride.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para18"></a>Thirdly, the proposals of the EDI Group, the development and investment group owned by the city council, has identified an effective solution to the problem. Its proposals would link Calton Hill and St. Andrew's House and would create a debating chamber behind St. Andrew's House with a panoramic view of Arthur's Seat and Holyrood Palace, right up to the castle. The plan would have parking arrangements on site and appropriate media provision, accompanied by facilities for the best use of information technology.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para19"></a>St. Andrew's House is a splendid, Grade A listed building, with a capacity to adapt to Scotland's needs. Adjacent to it is the governor's house of the old Calton Prison. It could be converted into a Speaker's residence.
<P>


<a name="column_222"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para20"></a>The Royal High School, although not part of the parliament plan, is an important building, and there is no doubt that it could, and would, be adapted to other related uses associated with the needs of the public.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para21"></a>Also, there are many vacant buildings in Waterloo Place, including the GPO building. A positive decision to locate the parliament in Calton Hill would mean that those wonderful buildings would have significant and relevant roles during the next century.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para22"></a>I understand that the proposals put forward are well within the White Paper budget of &#163;40 million. I venture to suggest that the Scots are looking for quality, but also expect value for money.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para23"></a>I hope that the Government will press ahead with the design and feasibility study in relation to Calton Hill, to meet the required specification and operational needs of the parliament and the traffic and environmental needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para24"></a>So far as the site is concerned, in terms of Scotland's history and image abroad, there is one compelling and extremely awe-inspiring site which looks the part of a Scots parliament. That site is in the city centre--it is Calton Hill.

<A NAME="71112-09_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Kintore: </B>   My Lords, I come from Aberdeen; I am afraid, therefore, that I can add very little to the excellent knowledge of Edinburgh displayed by the noble Lord, Lord Selkirk.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para25"></a>I, too, thank the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, for initiating the debate this evening. In preparing for the debate, I sought the views of a number of people, including my dentist, who is an Aberdonian, trained in Edinburgh. He was firmly of the view that the parliament should be in the former Royal High School because of the public money already spent on its adaptation. In answer to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, he went on to say that, if the building is too small, then the number of members of the parliament should be reduced. When I was next able to speak, I suggested that although a reduction in members was still politically possible, it was, equally, highly unlikely.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para26"></a>A parliament building must register in the consciousness of its citizens. They must be able to have a memory of the place. I suggest that most people in the United Kingdom are aware of this Parliament; and the people of Scotland will be aware of their own parliament, provided it is housed within a building which has day-to-day visibility as an obvious parliament. That is why I suggest that, of the three options, Calton Hill appears the best. It was certainly favoured by everyone to whom I spoke last weekend.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para27"></a>One query that arose, and which I was unable to answer, related to the problem of security. I think most noble Lords were first made aware of this at the Report stage of the referendum Bill on 22nd July 1997, when the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An issue which now has a higher profile than formerly is that of security. Those who know the location of the Royal High School will recognise that it poses significant problems for security. It may be possible to overcome those problems".--[Official Report, 22/7/97; col.1368.] <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para28"></a>Provided that it does not comprise security, is it in order to inquire where the threat to security is coming from, and whether much the same threat would apply to both of the other locations?
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para29"></a>The convenience of members in getting to the parliament is important. On a good day it takes me just over three hours to cover the 500-plus miles from my home in Aberdeenshire to your Lordships' House by car, plane and Underground. But if travelling by car, even from parts of Aberdeenshire, one would be well short of Edinburgh for the same travelling time. Members of the parliament living in the remoter areas would have many hours to travel. A solution for those, say, needing to drive for more than four-and-a-half hours, could be to use a helicopter. That would not apply to that many members; and if the helicopter could also be used for public service, for example as an air ambulance or in support of the police and mountain rescue at weekends and during recesses, the cost might not be as high as at first appears. I hope that the Minister does not regard that suggestion as pie in the sky, but more as MSPs in the sky, and a perfectly reasonable method of getting to parliament in the 21st century.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para30"></a>In conclusion, let us be characteristically frugal and house the parliament within existing buildings, possibly linking, by an overhead bridge, old St. Andrew's House to the old high school. New buildings are always over budget and late on completion; and they take time to achieve the character which a parliament building requires and deserves.

<A NAME="71112-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rowallan: </B>   My Lords, I must declare a minor interest in this debate in so far as I have already declared that I hope one day to be a candidate. It is an uphill struggle to be a candidate for this particular parliament--especially, I fear, when one sits on this side of the House. Nevertheless, I have declared that as my intention. It is sad that many of those who should be taking part in a debate to decide the seat of the new parliament are not present. The absence of Members on the other side of the Chamber has already been mentioned. I seem to remember the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay of Cartvale, stating strongly that this would be a marvellous occasion for women. It is sad that we have not had the benefit of hearing the noble Baroness's views on what should be done.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para31"></a>This debate is divided into two parts--historical considerations, which immediately take us from Stirling to Edinburgh, Perth, and to a lesser extent Dumbarton; and ease of access, with Glasgow and Edinburgh being the two most accessible places in Scotland. The name that occurs on both sides is Edinburgh. I believe that we all now accept that that is probably where the parliament will be. And that is where it should be, because it is the capital of Scotland--much as Glasgow would suit me a great deal better, living, as I do, in Ayrshire.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-09_para32"></a>All three suggested sites--Leith, Calton Hill and Haymarket--as we heard, have pluses and minuses. To me, Leith has no pluses at all. It is out of the way, there are no direct rail connections, and it is a backwood. <P>

<A NAME="71112-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rowallan: </B>   My Lords, I cannot answer that; I have no intimate knowledge. No doubt it will be answered from my Front Bench, whose Members will be very much involved in that decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para0"></a>Calton Hill exists and, as the noble Earl, Lord Kintore, pointed out, has already had a great deal of money spent on it. It must therefore be considered. However, it is very expensive to change; and getting a car into the centre of Edinburgh is becoming more and more difficult. The Haymarket has a great deal going for it, but much against it, as we heard during the course of the debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para1"></a>I seriously wonder whether the best answer is to go for a complete greenfield site and a completely new location--near Ingleston, for example, or somewhere such as that, where there is a ring-road and links to the M.8 and M.9. There should be a spur on the railway to the airport, and everything could come together there very nicely.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para2"></a>My noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Drumadoon says that we should wait to decide how and where until the Parliament is to sit. I believe that that would be a mistake. We must show the people of Scotland that we are moving towards the parliament which the people of Scotland have indicated that they want.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para3"></a>As I said in an earlier debate, the parliament will start sitting at about the time of the millennium. Would this not be a good project into which to put the millennium money? Would this not be a perfect opportunity for the new Labour Government, with its vision of a Britain with parliaments of different natures throughout the country, to build a monument to the Scottish people, a future for the Scottish people, a chamber built specifically for the use of the most modern parliament in Great Britain, probably the most modern parliament in the world today? I believe that that is something worth considering. There are plenty of sites to be considered. Surely it is not beyond the wit of man to find an architect to design a building of which we could be proud?

<A NAME = "71112-10_para4"></a>I was delighted to see a comment in the newspaper by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, that the Parliament will last a long time and &#163;1 million or &#163;2 million of capital expenditure should not stop it being placed in the right position, both historically and as regards access. That is a real conversion, which I am delighted to see. I welcome him to the ranks of supporters.

<A NAME = "71112-10_para5"></a>Perhaps the Minister will speak to his Back Benchers. There is not one present. It must be quite shaming for him.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para6"></a>As regards the site for the Parliament, I agree with the criticism of Leith. Leith is a wonderful place. There are bits of rocks at the pier of Leith. I dare say that Sir Patrick Spens "sailed from there to Noraway" across the foam. But it is not an attractive place, I am afraid, in spite of the fact that the Tory Party headquarters are there. The building would be on a derelict site, mainly owned, I understand, by the port authority. It would be a difficult place to get to. It is true that there are one or two good restaurants, but the attraction stops there.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para7"></a>Haymarket is not a bad alternative. It is near the Scottish Liberal Democrats' office, which I have no doubt would be extremely helpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para8"></a>However, there is no question but that everyone favours the historic site of Calton Hill. I am surprised that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, is against it, having worked there. He said that it was a very pleasant place in which to work. I believe that that is an argument which far outweighs the one about such things as large rooms and small rooms. As with a house, if you like the place in which you work, it is better to work there than in a highly efficient building on which you look with dislike.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para9"></a>When the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, said that surroundings were important to the quality of debate, I thought of the Chamber of the House of Commons along the corridor: the surroundings there do not always influence the quality of debate all that much.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para10"></a>There is no doubt that the historic site of Calton Hill has a lot to recommend it, being in the centre of Edinburgh. The noble Lord, Lord Selkirk, knows it well from his period in office. He put the matter eloquently and with a great deal of knowledge. It is all there; and it is there, undoubtedly, that we should be.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para11"></a>There is no doubt that a greenfield site is cheaper. The noble Earl, Lord Kintore, and others have said that money had been spent already. There is nothing more expensive than altering an old building. A new building is much cheaper, as I know perfectly well. My wife and I recently bought a house and altered it considerably and we know that that was more expensive than building a new one. However, in this case the expense would definitely be worth it. It is right and proper that history should be considered. We shall be providing a centre for a new type of parliament. I am full of hope that we might devise something unique.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para12"></a>I have heard that a large number of directors of Scottish businesses are thinking of standing for the parliament. In the past I have found that people are busy and when you ask them to be a candidate they say, "I approve of your policy, but I have no time; I must develop my career".
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para13"></a>Calton Hill is an attractive building. If we can provide proper facilities--including, for example, a good dining-room for members and their friends--I believe that it could house a parliament of which the people of Scotland could be proud.

<A NAME="71112-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that all those who have taken part in the debate and who have stayed to listen are grateful to my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour for introducing this important subject. I cannot resist the temptation--a temptation not resisted by one or two previous speakers--to note that the debate has been engaged in by the Liberal Democrats, the Cross-Benchers and the Conservatives. Until the Minister speaks, not a single Labour Back-Bench Member of your Lordships' House will have taken part. Indeed, not a single one is present to listen to the debate. Many of the Government's Back-Bench friends have been outspoken in their advocacy of a Scottish Parliament. I should have thought that they would want to engage in a debate about this important decision. I do not intend this to turn into a party political point, because it is not: it is about where we site the parliament, a parliament to which all the parties will send members, a parliament for the people of Scotland. It is a shame that, for example, the co-chairman of the Constitutional Convention on the Labour side, who normally graces us with her presence and her opinions on these matters, has chosen to do neither. Unlike my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, I cannot resist being uncharitable enough to wonder if they have not been given instructions as to the line to take. Perhaps their bleepers have not gone off and they are therefore totally unable to get up and make a speech. That said, I shall leave the point aside. I hope that the people of Scotland will notice that the Labour Party do not seem to wish to engage in this debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para14"></a>I was surprised, as I think many others were, when the new Government indicated that Calton Hill would not necessarily be the site of the Scottish parliament. After 20 years in which the party opposite has advocated a Scottish parliament and given us all to believe that it would be based in Calton Hill, it seems a little odd that suddenly, once they have achieved power and started to think about putting it into effect, they say that that may not be the case. As my noble friend Lady Carnegy said, people have looked on Calton Hill and the old Royal High School as the potential site for this parliament since 1978. News bulletins in Scotland have used the facade of Calton Hill as part of their introduction. As my noble friend said, from 1992 a vigil took place 24 hours a day outside the old Royal High School in favour of having a Scottish parliament. So it seems a little odd that it has taken the Government 20 years to decide that this site is not suitable after all. I find that very hard to believe.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para15"></a>I agree with one of my noble friends who said that perhaps this ought to be left to the Scottish parliament itself. After all, this is what devolution is about, I kept being told, and I should have thought that there was an argument for saying "We will prepare the plans, we will ask for the various suggestions to be worked out but the decision at the end of the day ought to be taken by the people who will be entrusted with the government of Scotland for the years to come." That seems to me to be perfectly reasonable because whenever a decision is taken by the Government now, unless it is to use the <P>


<a name="column_227"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 227</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>existing debating Chamber and facilities, they will not have a building ready for 1999, spring of, when I suspect the elections will be held. Dare I say, it will probably not be ready until well into the year 2000 or 2001 so, for a year or two's delay, I should like to hear the Minister explain why this decision ought not to be left to the Scottish parliament itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para16"></a>We are told in Chapter 10 of the White Paper, at 10.6, what is wrong with the Calton Hill site and I shall deal with one or two of those issues. The noble Lord, the Earl of Kintore, mentioned security. I must say that I take air or refreshments on the terraces of this Parliament in the summer time and I cannot see that the security in Calton Hill will be any different from the security here: we are certainly overlooked by busy bridges and by people opposite. I do not believe that it would be impossible to move the public fences on the Calton Hill back from the immediate environment of the Royal High School in order to deal with the problem, if indeed there is one. Perhaps more flippantly, I wonder who they think they are when they think there will be a terrific danger to their security.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para17"></a>My noble friend Baroness Carnegy gave a clear exposition, as did my noble friend Lord Selkirk, of the historical importance of this particular site. There it is: it stands in a very prominent place, the second most prominent site in Edinburgh after the castle, seen by everybody--and I am not even talking about the views out the way, I am talking about the people looking up. They will see their parliament on its hill, and I think that is very important. I suspect that unless you are sailing about the docks in Leith you will not see a parliament based at Leith. But you are going to see it in Edinburgh. It is an important place. It has St. Andrew's House adjacent to it. I worked in St. Andrew's House for some five-and-a-half years as a Minister. It is an excellent building, an excellent example of the architecture of the 1930s. I am satisfied that it would make perfectly good accommodation for Scottish Members of Parliament and their staffs. Perhaps the officials at the Scottish Office do not want to move out of St. Andrew's House and that is one of the reasons why the Government have been persuaded to think again about this issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para18"></a>Access is one point that I want to deal with, because I do think it is very important. I visited Edinburgh last Friday. I walked to the City Chambers from Waverley Station because I had to meet somebody there. I then had to go to Leith. The Conservative Party headquarters are at Leith partly because it was a good economic bargain but I have to say that the one thing which was not taken into account was transport. On my way to Leith the taxi driver said quite quickly, "The traffic down here to Leith is diabolical, sir." So that, I think, is a good point. It would not be a convenient site for members drawn from all parts of Scotland. That is a serious defect which the Government will have to address when looking at Leith. It is a motor driven site, whereas for most of Scotland, most people would not dream of going to a site at Calton Hill other than by railway, which is hugely convenient and no hassle. Leith will be difficult to get to and will involve driving through Edinburgh. That is a city in which, whether for good or ill, the local authority wants to reduce car use. Frankly, they will not be helped to reduce car use <P>


<a name="column_228"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 228</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>if the parliament is built at Leith. So I am sure, all other things being equal, that the Calton site is by far the best site.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para19"></a>Cost may be a problem for the Government. I can see that that is one of the difficulties the noble Lord, the Minister, is going to flag up. I am not sure whether it would be worth saying to somebody "What can you do for &#163;40 million?" and then making the decision of whether the advantages of being sited in central Edinburgh are worth the disadvantages of what you might lose if you only have &#163;40 million to spend. We have to look carefully at that. Of course I understand that the Government will say that they do not have a vast amount of money to throw at this. We did warn them, I have to say, during the referendum, that setting up this parliament was going to cost them money. They cannot now walk away from it and somehow pretend that it will not cost them any money. It has to be done properly and correctly. It seems to me that under that &#163;40 million price tag we ought to be able to get a good enough building in Calton Hill to do the job properly for Scotland--for all parts of Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para20"></a>I have nothing against Leith, although I notice that in their little pictures they have sited "Britannia" in the dock. I have to say that Glasgow will have something to say about that when they register this proposition. I favour the "Britannia" going to the river of her birth rather than being docked in the port of Leith. That is another matter but we must think about history: Leith's historical importance in Scotland is great but nothing like that of Edinburgh. Those of us who do not come from Edinburgh and frankly have little affinity with it, view it as the capital city. I, for my part, and I think an awful lot of people--and the noble Minister has heard the clear message from their Lordships this evening--feel that this parliament ought to be in the capital city. That means in the centre of Edinburgh and not on the edges.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I start by congratulating the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, on giving us the opportunity to discuss this important issue and, of course, the various different views that have been drawn out during the course of our debate. I am reminded of the old adage in politics that one's opponents sit opposite you and one's enemies sit behind you. For most of the evening, I have had no enemies.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para21"></a>It is also customary in a debate such as this to say that one has found it interesting. This evening that would be a gross understatement. I have been sitting here in utter amazement. It has been, in a way, a surreal debate. From time to time I have pinched myself to make sure that I am still in touch with reality. Two months ago the party opposite were warning us that a Scottish Parliament was a threat to the Union, the end of civilisation as we knew it, and not even worth a marquee on the meadows. Now it is to be an adornment, an adornment that is to be cherished: put the price to one side, with no restraint at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-10_para22"></a>I, of course, welcome the constructive and positive approach being taken by members of the party opposite <P>


<a name="column_229"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 229</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and do so in the spirit of inclusiveness and consensual decision-making. And that is proper. In all seriousness, I recognise that the party opposite has reflected on the decisive endorsement of the proposals made by the people of Scotland and are now reacting, quite rightly and quite properly, in a positive and constructive way, and I wish to pay tribute to that. But in some ways it makes the conversion on the road to Damascus appear as a long considered and deliberate decision. I want to be as generous as possible and not to be churlish, but members of the party opposite would have greater credentials in arguing their point if they showed a little humility with regard to getting it wrong to start out with. They should let a little time pass before they present themselves as the guardians of the Scottish parliamentary heritage. But now I welcome them to the project. It is good to have them on board.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="71112-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether, after the debate, the noble Lord might like to consult his right honourable and honourable friends at the Scottish Office--some of them at least--who, since the referendum result, have gone out of their way to express the hope that the Conservative Party will engage positively in this debate and accept the result of the referendum. Being a democratic party, we have done the latter, and we are now doing the former. I should have thought that the noble Lord would warmly welcome that. Certainly, I hope his honourable friends will do so.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I thought I was doing that, in a kind and generous way. We shall talk about it afterwards--down some dark alley.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-11_para0"></a>It may help your Lordships if I set out briefly the background to the issue of where the parliament is to be sited, the latest position and our proposed next steps. In the White Paper, Scotland's Parliament, which was published during the summer, we announced that the parliament would be located in Edinburgh. The point has been made by noble Lords that any idea of not locating it in Edinburgh is now out of court. Edinburgh is the natural centre of government in Scotland and therefore the fitting home for the parliament. We also announced that we would be considering various options for a suitable site for the parliament building. That has not been seriously challenged. It is quite proper to look at a range of possible options.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-11_para1"></a>Many people understandably assumed that the Old Royal High School building on Calton Hill would be the automatic choice for the site. As I say, that is perfectly understandable given that it was prepared for a similar purpose, to house a parliament in the 1970s. During the wasted years of the previous Administration, it remained a symbol of hope in Scotland. Clearly, there is great sentimental attachment to it in the hearts of the people of Scotland. However, time has moved on since then, in much the same way as our vision of a parliament has evolved.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-11_para2"></a>We want the new parliament to be accessible to the public, both in terms of physical accessibility and also in terms of making the workings and activities of the parliament accessible. Making the best use of modern <P>


<a name="column_230"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 230</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>technology and electronic communication will also play an especially important role. The parliament should be a place where elected members can meet, in a suitable environment, to carry out their business. They should be able to meet their constituents, to discuss local matters of concern, and also representatives of various lobbying groups and organisations. It is also important that the accommodation should be as flexible as possible to be able to adapt to the changing needs of the parliament in the years to come. We are embarking on a new venture and we must allow for the fact that those leading that venture--that is, the elected members of the parliament--will want to influence the outcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-11_para3"></a>The old Royal High School building, I am bound to say, is severely disadvantaged in these respects. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, drew our attention to some of the disadvantages. In particular it is unsuitable at present as a permanent home for the parliament and lacks the flexibility needed for successful conversion. The noble and learned Lord made the point that once one starts trying to convert it in order to make it suitable, one loses the whole ethos, charm and grandeur of the place.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-11_para4"></a>Of course, this is not to say that we have discounted the area around the old Royal High School or, indeed, its possible use as part of a wider development. My right honourable friend has considered many sites in and around Edinburgh, and these have now been narrowed down to three leading sites, to which many noble Lords have referred. First, a development centred on Regent Road, which would probably involve making use of St. Andrew's House, the headquarters of the Scottish Office since the 1930s, and its rather lavatorial interior. This has been put forward by Edinburgh Development and Investment. Secondly, a site at Leith near to the new Scottish Office building at Victoria Quay has been proposed by Forth Ports Plc. A third site at Haymarket is proposed for development by Kantel MacDonald Orr.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-11_para5"></a>My right honourable friend has already received presentations detailing the proposals for the sites at Calton Hill and Leith. Officials have met with those promoting the Haymarket site and a presentation is scheduled for later this month about the Haymarket proposals. The main opposition parties in Scotland have been briefed on progress to date and my right honourable friend has undertaken to keep them informed as developments progress. I am sure we can progress this issue in that bipartisan and non-partisan way.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-11_para6"></a>It is clear from the information we have received that each site presents both advantages and disadvantages. There is not one clear runner where all the advantages stack up on one side. We are, of course, aware that public opinion, expressed in letters to my right honourable friend and to the Scottish newspapers, is very much in favour of siting the parliament in the city centre, most probably on Calton Hill. Equally, there are important questions to answer in terms of the feasibility, within acceptable costs, of converting historic buildings, the point that was alluded to, although in part dismissed, by the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie. Once one gets into an old building one does know what one is going to find and what will be the costs involved in conversion and rectification.
<P>


<a name="column_231"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 231</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-11_para7"></a>The sites at Leith and Haymarket are both cleared and would therefore enable a new building to be constructed. As a number of noble Lords indicated, the Haymarket site is rather more constrained than Leith and it might be more costly but it has good rail and bus links, in particular to west and northern Scotland. That is why my right honourable friend also wishes to look at options for building an entirely new building, purpose built to house the parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-11_para8"></a>There are many other factors to consider and my right honourable friend has therefore decided to seek more detailed information before making any decision about the eventual site. Noble Lords will be aware that an announcement was made last week in the other place that design feasibility studies on each of the three sites have been commissioned. These studies, which will be carried out by separate architectural practices, will be subject to independent comparative costings.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-11_para9"></a>The cost of the parliament building is clearly a key factor. It is essential that we achieve value for money. The White Paper acknowledged that it was not possible to say precisely how much the parliament building would cost until the location and the nature of the parliament was settled and until the most suitable funding option was chosen. In the White Paper we identify a budget of about &#163;40 million. We have to bear that in mind when we make the final selection.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-11_para10"></a>We hope to stick to that estimate but, based on the information which we have for the three different sites, the costs do vary quite considerably. There is also some variation between some of our own estimates and those of the organisations promoting the various sites. This, in part at least, reflects the different assumptions which are being used. By commissioning the design studies we will be given a more accurate view, in particular as to whether the proposals put forward are feasible. Subjecting the feasibilities to independent scrutiny of the costs will also provide us with a clearer indication of the final costs. The choice of site for the parliament has environmental impacts and, certainly today, when sustainability and the environment are key issues, they cannot be put to one side.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-11_para11"></a>We are committed to putting the environment at the heart of government and we expect the building itself should make as small an environmental impact as possible. The environmental impacts of the decision fall under two main headings--the impact of the building itself, and the effect of its location. On the first of these, different buildings will have different total energy use and energy efficiency, and they will have varying effects in terms of the amount of material used in their construction.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-11_para12"></a>On the second point, people will obviously need to come and go to the parliament building wherever it is situated. That is the point of physical accessibility, as a number of noble Lords have said. That will have implications for the transport system and also for air pollution, which is now one of the most pressing problems on the environmental agenda. All these studies <P>


<a name="column_232"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 232</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are expected to be completed in December, after which we hope to be in a position to reach a final view taking into account all these important considerations.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. Will these studies be made public?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I shall write to the noble Lord on that matter and clarify it to him directly.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-11_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, that is an absolutely critical question and it is one that I asked as well. If it is really uncertain, that makes a difference. The people of Scotland must be involved here. It is absolutely no good confronting them with a final decision without publishing the report. That is very important indeed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, the basis on which the Government make any decision will be subject to scrutiny and debate and, quite properly, questions can be asked at that time. We shall have to see the extent to which, at the end of the studies, information can be made broadly available. I take the point that the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, have made. I shall return to that issue subsequently. I can give an assurance at this stage--and not 10 seconds ago!--that we shall be in a position to publish at least a summary. So the basis on which the decision is made will be available.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="71112-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   My Lords, as the Minister has been unable to give as full an answer as some of us would like, will he undertake to look at the legal implications of the environmental assessment? It is my understanding that a project of this magnitude will not only require the assessment to be made public, but must afford an opportunity to the public to comment on it in order that the Government comply with their obligation to the European Union.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I certainly would not wish to tangle with the noble and learned Lord on a matter of law. It is certainly a matter that I shall take up with my colleagues.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para0"></a>In successfully calling for this debate the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, rightly drew attention to accessibility. As I said earlier, the White Paper stated that the parliament building
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"must be secure but also accessible to all including people with special needs". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para1"></a>I hope that reassures the noble Baroness that accessibility is something which we accept needs to be addressed very carefully, both in terms of travelling to and from the parliament and accessibility within the parliament building itself for those working in and visiting it.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para2"></a>One thing which I have not mentioned is timing. It has always been clear that permanent accommodation for the parliament is unlikely to be completed in time for the first full sitting in 1999 or early 2000, though we are, of course, aiming to have it ready as soon as <P>


<a name="column_233"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 233</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>possible thereafter. We are already looking for suitable interim accommodation. Once a decision on the site has been made, a competition will be held to ensure that we have the best possible design for the building to meet the needs of the parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para3"></a>I close by addressing the point made about historical considerations. I understand them and I am sensitive to them. Scotland has a proud and long history. That must not be lost sight of. Indeed, it should be properly reflected in the parliament building itself. The new parliament building must also, however, reflect the modern world of which Scotland is such a successful part. It must be a parliament which future generations can be proud of. A careful balance must therefore be struck.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para4"></a>My right honourable friend has made it clear that his mind is open on the most suitable site and, until the results of the studies which have been commissioned are known, there is little point in predetermining the eventual site. The good, strong and new points that have been made during this debate will feed in to that discussion and the eventual decision. I can assure all noble Lords that their points of view will be very much taken into account.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-12_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I thank all those who have spoken in this debate. It has been a very interesting one because we have heard a number of different points of view. Some noble Lords knew more about the state of the research and the internal conversation on the subject than others. My noble and learned friend Lord Mackay knew more than I did and so did my noble friend Lord Selkirk. That was interesting because they had developed their thinking rather further. My noble and learned friend clearly did not much like working at the high school and I understand that. I believe that something can be done about it if it is necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para5"></a>The general vote of all noble Lords was, I believe, either for Calton Hill or to wait until the members of the Scots parliament have assembled and then decide. There was not a great vote for Haymarket. In fact, the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, gave us something of a warning about what will happen if trains run underneath the parliament. I hope that the Minister will take note of that. It will no doubt come into the environmental assessment which he is hoping to receive.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para6"></a>The Minister certainly told us some things which I did not know and we are very grateful to him. He was totally unsupported by his colleagues on the Labour Benches who are supposed to be keenest of all on this project. It was difficult for him. He did his best. He gave us a lot of extremely useful information. He expressed surprise that noble Lords on this side of the House were interested in this project. I believe that he underestimates us as people. A number of us have been in politics for a long time. When we believe that an idea is likely to be difficult to work we warn and point out the difficulties. We have been doing that for some time. I can assure the noble Lord that we shall be very energetic at looking at the legislation when it comes. <P>


<a name="column_234"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 234</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>We shall do our very best to make it workable for the people of Scotland. If we believe that it is not workable we shall not hesitate to say so. We shall also look at the plans for the parliament because they must be not only suitable, but workable as well. It is very important indeed that this parliament is exciting for people.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para7"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will convey to his right honourable friend the Prime Minister that we of course understand that modern buildings can be exciting and that the parliament should also be exciting, forward looking and good for a long time, but that does not mean that it cannot be in old buildings. Any Scot knows that. Any Scot with any sense of history knows that. I hope that we shall not be too carried away by modernism because that could be a mistake. I do not say that it would necessarily be a mistake--only that it could be. I thank all noble Lords who have participated and I beg leave to withdraw my Motion for Papers.

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Tactics which we condemn in criminals and their lawyers are increasingly being used by a small number of bent police officers. A depressing cycle of events often takes place. Within hours of arrest or suspension officers go sick, insist on a right of silence, use every delaying tactic known to lawyers and increasingly frustrate justice. Leaving the service on enhanced medical pensions, they miraculously regain full health within weeks". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para10"></a>The Association of Chief Police Officers supports the Commissioner. In its evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee on Home Affairs, it referred to that conduct as an abuse of the system. It said that the system effectively rewarded wrongdoing, especially when there was no pre-existing medical condition. The association said that feelings were heightened by the fact that the suspended officers received pay throughout the duration of their suspension while an officer not subject to investigation who had the misfortune to suffer a lengthy illness could be reduced to half pay after six months and no pay at all after 12 months.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para11"></a>The Association of Police Authorities appeared to share those views. It too wants a tightening of the rules relating to the retirement of officers on medical grounds <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>when subject to disciplinary proceedings. It has made the not unreasonable point that there are substantial public expenditure implications with regard to such devices.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para12"></a>Perhaps I may give just one example of the absurdity of the present situation. A senior officer retired on medical grounds. He was being investigated after serious allegations were made against him relating to corruption and fabrication of evidence. He was filmed running in the London Marathon 10 days before his medical examination, which reported that he was not fit to appear before a police disciplinary hearing. The gentleman concerned is now living in Spain, receiving an enhanced pension. Of course, he may be entirely innocent, but that sequence of events hardly creates a mood of confidence among the general public.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para13"></a>I shall give another example. Two detectives facing serious disciplinary charges claimed to be suffering from illness soon after they became aware that an investigation was about to take place. They are now running a business together without any apparent difficulty. Again, their ill-health has miraculously improved.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para14"></a>I return to Sir Paul's speech. He referred to a "significant minority"--his words--of dishonest officers who were engaged in corrupt practices and, in some cases, even more serious crimes and who had endeavoured to intimidate fellow officers in their attempts to avoid detection.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para15"></a>That brings me to the extremely important question of the burden of proof in police disciplinary proceedings. The present regulations require evidence to be proved beyond reasonable doubt--the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, is well aware of the criminal standard of proof--rather than the "balance of probabilities" which is the civil standard. However, it is the civil standard of proof that is applied in disciplinary proceedings in Scottish police forces. As far as I am aware, that has created few, if any, difficulties. The civil standard is applied also in the Prison Service and in Her Majesty's Customs and Excise, many officers of which work side by side in major drugs investigations with officers from the police service. How can such a distinction be tolerated any longer?
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para16"></a>I am well aware of the difficulties facing honest officers when confronted by malicious allegations made by professional criminals in an endeavour to shore up an otherwise weak defence. We have to take those concerns seriously. It is not my intention to suggest that the views of the Police Federation on these issues should simply be swept aside. Indeed, I urged the previous Government to take the federation's anxieties rather more seriously than at that stage they were prepared to do when we were debating the Police and Magistrates' Courts Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para17"></a>We have to try to strike a new and fairer balance between the interests of police officers facing investigation for serious disciplinary offences and the interests of the police service as a whole and of our society. Like the Commissioner and, I believe, the general public, I consider that the overwhelming <P>


<a name="column_236"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 236</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>majority of police officers are honest, decent and brave. But there is, I fear, a disreputable minority who involve themselves in conduct which is so unacceptable that they should be removed from service.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para18"></a>My Unstarred Question asks what the Government propose to do about that situation. I am sure that the Minister will tell us that the Select Committee on Home Affairs is studying this matter at the moment and that he has to await its report. That is entirely right. However, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, will also tell us that once that report is received, Ministers will treat this issue as a matter of considerable urgency. We cannot afford endless delays. Given the Commissioner's stark description of the situation, I believe that this matter is too serious to be delayed by endless periods of consultation. The blunt reality is that the Home Office has been aware of the concern of chief officers for a very considerable period of time. The last Home Secretary chose not to take action before the election. I make no comment on that other than to record it as a fact. I very much hope that the present Government, recognising the critical importance of this problem, will act decisively as soon as possible in the New Year.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para19"></a>I believe that the present Commissioner is a decent and civilised man. He has done much to insist on the highest standards of conduct within his force. A lesser man would not have chosen to make the speech that he did at the meeting of his own federation. Only a man of high courage and determination would have done that. I believe that he deserves the unqualified support of Parliament.

<A NAME="71112-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bethell: </B>   My Lords, it is thoroughly appropriate that the noble Lord, Lord Harris, should table this Question at this particular time. The speech made by the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis is a matter of extreme importance. In effect, he is saying that there is something wrong in the Met. He makes the very serious allegation that there is corruption abroad and that the authorities require further powers to deal with it. This is a matter that must be dealt with immediately and with the utmost seriousness and severity.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para20"></a>At the outset I should declare an interest, as I am bound to do, in that I am a paid part-time adviser to the Police Federation of England and Wales. I have not however been asked by that federation to speak in this debate. In this matter I speak entirely for myself. My views may or may not coincide with those of the federation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para21"></a>The level of corruption gives Sir Paul cause for concern. He believes that he needs additional powers. In recent weeks one has read in the Independent and the Guardian that there may be as many as 200 corrupt officers in the Met. I am sure that every policeman who deserves that name agrees that if that is the case these people should be dealt with immediately. The noble Lord referred to their dismissal from the force. On the contrary, I believe that they deserve to be charged with corruption, if that is the case. Not only do they deserve to be dismissed from the force; they should be punished <P>


<a name="column_237"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 237</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>under the criminal law. A corrupt police officer is a criminal who belongs in gaol and dismissal is not enough.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para22"></a>One wonders why the commissioner has chosen to go public at this time. Perhaps the Minister can indicate to what extent the fears of the commissioner are shared by the Government. This is worrying. I am unaware of the position of the Government on this point. Do the concerns of Sir Paul find reflection in the views of the Government? Is immediate severe action proposed by the Government or is the commissioner exaggerating a little? Certainly, a good number of articles on this subject have appeared in both the Guardian and Independent.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para23"></a>Bogus claims of ill health are a very serious matter. I listened carefully to what the noble Lord said about this matter. However, this is not as simple a matter as some may believe. A police officer who is charged with a disciplinary offence cannot just obtain a chit from his friendly GP to say that he is feeling a bit poorly. He must obtain evidence from a police authority. If that evidence about his health is not enough, I suggest that evidence from the doctors who are treating him should be made available to the disciplinary hearing and to the court. I refer not only to the views of the medical men and women but also the medical records of the doctor. If an officer believes that he can ask to leave the force on full pension as a result of ill health it should be up to him to prove that that is the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para24"></a>The question of the right to silence is one that has arisen many times. I recall the stalwart work on this subject by the noble Lord, Lord Harris, when noble Lords debated the Police and Magistrates' Courts Bill in 1994-95. I am not sure that it is wise to change this fundamentally as indicated by the noble Lord. However I believe that the police as a whole would accept a change to the right to silence along the lines that now apply to criminal matters as proposed by the previous government. Will the Government consider that possibility? What powers does the commissioner want, and what do Her Majesty's Government think about them? Are they inclined to accept the concerns voiced by the commissioner and by ACPO? Should there be the high standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt in disciplinary matters that might lead to the dismissal of a police officer from the force? The noble Lord, Lord Harris, has made a strong case in that regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para25"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Harris, also pointed out that police officers were frequently subject to malicious allegations and had to take split-second decisions in the midst of very difficult and perhaps violent episodes. In the case of armed police officers in particular, it has been said that if they act too quickly they may find themselves subject to a criminal charge of murder; if they act too slowly they may get a bullet in the head. I ask the Government to bear in mind that police officers are in a very special position. In the past two hours two people have been murdered in the metropolis in drug-related crimes. The police are rightly concerned about their safety as well as the safety of the public.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para26"></a>The civil standard of proof may well be appropriate for minor offences of a disciplinary nature within the police, but that standard is not appropriate in a matter <P>


<a name="column_238"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 238</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that may lead to the dismissal of a police officer from the force. I point out to the noble Lord, Lord Harris, that that standard of proof would not, for example, be sufficient to remove a lawyer or doctor from his chosen profession. I do not believe that that standard should be applied to a police officer who carries out tasks that are in many ways more difficult than those performed by other professions. One must remember that a dismissed policeman is no longer employable in that capacity. If he is dismissed from one force, be it the Met or another, he is not employable by any other force in the country. Indeed, he is unlikely to be employed ever again. He is not like a lawyer, doctor, plumber or teacher.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para27"></a>It is quite right that the noble Lord should raise this matter. There is something particularly nauseating about a person who is employed to uphold the law enriching himself by breaking the law. If the commissioner believes, as clearly he does, that something must be done quickly and that there are more than 100 such cases, let us see swift action but without panic and overreaction. I should be most grateful if the Minister can indicate to what extent he shares the concerns of the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis.

<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para28"></a>It is a rare occasion, but I find myself in general agreement with everything that the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, has said and I expect that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, too, is in agreement. There is just one matter on which I am not in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Harris and I will not presume to second guess what the reply of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, will be.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para29"></a>I hope that after the Home Affairs Committee produces its report there will be an opportunity for these matters to be discussed, obviously in another place but also in this House. That is not a matter for the noble Lord but for the usual channels. It is something that I am sure the noble Lord will be prepared to pass on.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para30"></a>I echo what my noble friend Lord Bethell said about the police being in a very special position. We owe an enormous debt of thanks to the police, not only in the rest of the country but in London itself. As the noble Lord, Lord Harris, has done, I will quote from the speech of the commissioner.

<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para32"></a>Another point which will have general agreement is one quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Harris. We believe that the overwhelming majority of police officers--and again I am quoting from the speech of the commissioner--are honest, decent, brave people who have never and will never do anything bad criminally or in terms of discipline, and they deserve the <P>


<a name="column_239"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 239</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wholehearted support of their bosses and the public. That is something it is important that all of us should make clear and echo.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para33"></a>There are obviously some concerns, and the noble Lord, Lord Harris, made the case quite clearly that there are a number of police officers who are bent and it is important that the Home Office is prepared to address these particular concerns. It is something that affects a tiny minority. As the commissioner made quite clear, it is important that whatever we do--and here I would not necessarily follow what the noble Lord, Lord Harris, had to say about where the balance of proof may or may not lie--it is important, to echo the commissioner, to ensure that we have a fair system which balances justice for police officers with protection of the public and the good name of the service.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para34"></a>How one achieves that is another matter. That is something about which we should be grateful to hear from the noble Lord, Lord Williams, and, in due course, from the Home Affairs Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para35"></a>I have only one question to address to the noble Lord. He might not have an answer on this occasion but I would be grateful if he would write to me in due course. There is considerable concern about the numbers of officers taking early retirement. Some take early retirement for the reasons set out by the noble Lord, Lord Harris; some take early retirement because they would like to have early retirement and argue that there are medical reasons why they should take that early retirement.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para36"></a>I remember from my previous portfolio in the department of Education and Employment that there was a considerable problem with a large number of teachers taking early retirement--possibly because of the stress of teaching or possibly because the pension structure was rigged in such a way that it was much easier to take early retirement through what were possibly bogus claims of ill health.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para37"></a>If it is possible, I would like the noble Lord to address that point. Is he able to give figures on the costs of early retirement to the Met--and for that matter, other police forces, but as this question relates solely to the Met perhaps he could confine his answer to that. Can he also indicate whether there are any plans in place to ensure that that early retirement--pursued not necessarily for reasons of criminality or to avoid disciplinary proceedings but purely on the grounds of bogus ill health--will be addressed in due course?

<A NAME="71112-12_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, for initiating this debate. Few of us have spoken but it is of enormous public importance, and not just in the metropolitan area.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para38"></a>I pay tribute, as did the noble Lord, Lord Henley, a moment ago, to the vast majority of police officers in all police areas of this country who carry out a <P>


<a name="column_240"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 240</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>very difficult job. It is dangerous, it is often not fully regarded by the public, and most police officers are decent, honourable, brave, dedicated people of integrity. It is very recently that a serving officer in the Metropolitan police lost her life in the course of her duty. Certainly none of us sitting anywhere in this House, forget that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para39"></a>The Home Secretary takes it very seriously indeed when a man of the commissioner's standing and seniority makes these assertions--and I entirely agree with the description of him by the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich. He has said that there are corrupt, rogue officers in his force and he does not have sufficient powers to deal with them. The noble Lord, Lord Bethell, has asked about numbers. Of course, by definition, I cannot give them. He asked specifically whether the Government share the commissioner's alarm. Undoubtedly, unambiguously, yes. We would be derelict if we did not.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para40"></a>We know from what Sir Paul has said that it is a very small minority of officers, but even a small number, as the commissioner rightly says, have a corrosive effect on the organisation and a debilitating effect on their colleagues. In fact they are traitors to their colleagues. We share absolutely the commissioner's determination that these individuals cannot continue to serve. They cannot tarnish the high reputation of the force. The public must have confidence in the police officers who serve them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para41"></a>Let me give an example from my own experience. If you are prosecuting serious crime and there is a general feeling, an innuendo, very often unjust, that police officers are corrupt, then the fact is--and it is a blunt, brutal one--that guilty defendants escape because of wrong allegations supported by corrupt practices by officers who have no connection at all with the case in point.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para42"></a>So we deal with this matter with the utmost seriousness. I make this statement on behalf of the Government: the current system for dealing with officers who fall short of what is expected of them is not satisfactory. It is fair to say that the police staff associations have been working with the Home Office to achieve better procedures.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para43"></a>The staff associations, along with everyone else who is concerned, recognise that the introduction of procedures to deal with unsatisfactory procedures in the police service, as opposed to malpractice, is long overdue. I pay tribute to Ian Westwood of the Police Federation, who is the only member of the original working group still involved, who has put dedication and knowledge into this work. I think that I can tell your Lordships that I can understand these problems. I have acted for the Police Federation over the years--true, in defamation rather than criminal matters--and I have prosecuted large, serious police corrupt practices. So I know the difficulties. I know the difficulties of producing evidence which will be up to the criminal standard in a disciplinary context.
<P>


<a name="column_241"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 241</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para44"></a>Apart from that first statement, I say on behalf of the Government that we have to find a means to separate procedures for dealing with misconduct from those which deal with unsatisfactory performance. The two are qualitatively different. The mischiefs which they reflect are different.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para45"></a>The problem is that the current system has to cover the whole range of unacceptable behaviour, from corruption and gross misconduct at one end of the scale to lateness, poor paperwork, and minor incivility at the other. That is just not tolerable in a modern police service.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para46"></a>What has been suggested is the introduction of a new system, parallel to the procedures for dealing with misconduct, which would allow managers, which is what senior police officers are and have to be, to deal with staff who are merely inefficient or do not have the required ability to do the job. That would be much more in line with management practice in other areas of employment. We would not need to have the whole complicated business of formal disciplinary proceedings. That is the approach which the Government intend to follow.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para47"></a>Sir Paul does not stand alone on the aspect of misconduct. Many of his senior colleagues have said the same. It is a difficult area. We need robust and speedy discipline, balanced with fairness to officers who I entirely accept, as the noble Lord, Lord Bethell, said, are unusually vulnerable to malicious allegations. They are not uniquely vulnerable--doctors and other professionals are vulnerable--but we do not disregard the point, which is well taken, made by the noble Lord, Lord Bethell. I believe that there is general agreement on the need for a fast-track dismissal procedure to enable chief officers to deal decisively and swiftly in the most serious of cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para48"></a>If you speed up the process, you have to ensure that you have, as an integral part of the process, the necessary safeguards to ensure a fair hearing for both sides, but we believe as a government that it is essential for chief officers, for the officers' morale, and for the public, that we see swift results. Protracted proceedings dilute the effectiveness of the system. They bring about a public perception that sometimes these matters are not taken seriously.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para49"></a>It is of course worth noting that a suspended police officer is suspended on full pay until the outcome of the hearing. It is in everyone's interest that that should not be allowed to continue for any longer than is necessary. I have taken part, in various capacities, in disciplinary proceedings. At present they are just not tolerable in their length and delay. Length and delay of course tell harshly on the innocent police officer. One needs to bear in mind the stress and strain that the man or woman is under if wrong allegations are made and the proceedings drag on for months, sometimes for years.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para50"></a>Double jeopardy is a question that is frequently raised--the possible overlap in some cases between criminal and disciplinary proceedings. There are of course instances of misconduct which do not, or may not, amount to a criminal offence that could be seen <P>


<a name="column_242"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 242</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as inappropriate behaviour for a police officer. There is a strong link here with the question of the standard of proof raised by the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich. We have to bear in mind that serving police officers have rights as well as the duties and responsibilities we impose upon them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para51"></a>The Home Affairs Select Committee of the other place--I believe that another place is fortunate indeed to have its present chairman; I do not believe anyone could imagine someone more dedicated to eradicating corruption in the police force than Chris Mullin--decided to take this on board in July of this year. It is taking evidence from a range of groups and individuals, including the commissioner, and, of course, Home Office Ministers. I believe that Mr. Michael gave evidence yesterday. It expects to report at about Christmas time. This is not one of those reports that will disappear.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para52"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, asked me specifically--I am happy to give him my answer--whether the Government will treat this as a matter of considerable urgency. The answer is yes. We have now a Home Secretary who is determined to see that these matters are got right. I believe that I can say fairly and not just because I am his junior Minister, that when he puts his mind to things he delivers what he has promised. Therefore, there is no doubt about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para53"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Henley, helpfully gave indications in respect of two aspects. First, he asked whether we should have an opportunity of an early, certainly better populated debate. He rightly said that it is not for him or me to dictate to the usual channels. All I can say is that this is a matter of such public importance that I hope the usual channels can be successfully massaged. As regards costs, I shall write to the noble Lord. He wanted Metropolitan figures as well as nationwide figures.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para54"></a>We must strike a balance between the needs which I hope to specify. First, we must ensure public confidence in the system which deals with police officers who have acted wrongly. Secondly, we must ensure that senior officers have the ability to manage their staff effectively. Thirdly, we need to protect police officers from malicious, mischievous, unfounded complaints. Those are difficult tests; they are not incapable of reconciliation. We are waiting for the report of the Home Affairs Committee before making any changes to the system. We will of course consult with all those who are entitled to be consulted. It is our duty to do so. We will make changes and our aim is to give chief police officers the powers they need in the context of the individual serving officer having the protection which he or she deserves.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-12_para55"></a>This has been a short debate. Often, short debates in your Lordships' House relate to important topics and sometimes there are long debates about less important matters. One cannot but think of four hours spent on the ancient universities--the curiosity is that <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>a criminal offence he must be treated as an alleged criminal. The Minister mentioned double jeopardy. Many police officers sometimes feel that they are affected by that.

We shall go through the Bill clause by clause; noble Lords will speak standing; all noble Lords are free to attend and participate; and the proceedings will be recorded in Hansard.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 1, line 7, leave out ("and other expressions of cultural identity").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: We have had opportunity on a previous occasion to look at the broad picture which has brought us to the position of this Bill, but in looking at the amendment my noble colleague and I have put forward on Clause 1 I would also like to refer to our proposition that Clause 3 shall not stand part of the Bill and also the consequential amendment, Amendment No. 40 in the Title referring to "other expressions of cultural identity".
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para5"></a>I think it is wise for us, even at this early stage and in particular in relation to these amendments, to reflect on how this Bill came about. There have of course been traditional processions in Northern Ireland, and throughout Ireland, for a very long time indeed, but over a number of years these have been contentious - not by any means all parades, not even by any means the majority of parades, but only a small minority. However they have become contentious and difficult. They have created problems for the police, who have frequently found themselves in the invidious position of being <P>


<a name="column_2"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 2</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>attacked, not just on both sides but on all sides. In an attempt to bring some order back and to give the police the best opportunity to maintain public order, this proposal has come forward. I shall not go into the details of how that came about; suffice to say that the whole issue has been about parades.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para6"></a>When Dr. Peter North was invited by the Government to look into the question, he was not requested to look into the question of cultural identity, its expressions, disputes over signs and symbols, or any of these matters. He was not asked to do that. He was asked to look specifically at the problem of how to deal with contentious parades. He did that and I think by the view of many people provided the Government with an extremely helpful and constructive report, and a somewhat detailed one--one where public opinion was extensively and professionally canvassed on the issue of parades.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para7"></a>If one looks, for example, at the public attitude surveys which were conducted, they are interesting, they are helpful; indeed sometimes the responses are quite enlightening. But they are all on the issue of parades and how to manage them. They do not refer to the question of cultural identity and its expression in the broader way. It can scarcely be disagreed that cultural identity, and its expression, is an enormously broad field.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para8"></a>If we were to enter into contentious questions of cultural identity in general, I would submit that we have entered into a minefield, even in Northern Ireland terms. For example, if it is the case that some of these parades are effectively accepted as an expression of cultural identity, then what about the Church services that are related to them? Few would deny there is an element of cultural identity in religious services. After all, it is often around that whole area that so much of the division has taken place. How are we then going to deal with the impossible enlargements of the application of cultural identity which will inevitably come about either because there are some who will wish, for the sake of clarity, to have rulings on the question, or--and much more dangerously--because malign individuals may well seek to extend the boundaries of cultural identity on a contentious basis?
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para9"></a>It is not unreasonable to assume that there might be some malign individuals around in this. After all, it cannot be doubted that some of the parades to which the Bill refers are contentious. There have been demographic changes in various areas, so that Orangemen are now marching through areas which were once in the middle of the country. Protestants may now find themselves walking through areas which are very largely not populated by people supportive of Orange Parades.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para10"></a>I can recall myself in the Ormeau Road, where my mother was brought up, my grandmother speaking about the demographic changes that were taking place and how this was going to affect all sorts of things. It was no surprise to me that in recent years particularly the Ormeau Road has become a flashpoint. Why?--because of demographic changes taking place.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para11"></a>Those are some reasons why things have been sparked off. However, it has to be acknowledged that there are also those who, seeing the contention that was created, recognised that here was an opportunity for them to provoke even greater dissent and to make a political point. In the republican community, when the ceasefire came about, and the energies that were particularly deployed in more violent ways were freed up, it may have been quite attractive for them to seek out other ways of expressing contention.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para12"></a>I do not myself have the view that there was a particular plan laid out initially to focus on this. I think what happened was that a few contentious parades quickly came to the attention of leading figures in the republican movement, and they realised the opportunity that this bestowed upon them to create difficulties. Then the whole thing began to grow and develop and gallop, and we must acknowledge that. We must acknowledge that even if we have a parades Bill and we have a Parades Commission, there will still be those who will seek to make mischief out of it. It therefore behoves us to ensure that the Bill is the best possible; that it is as tight as possible and that it leaves as few loopholes as possible for people who wish to make mischief. On the specific issue of extending it to exclude the whole mass of cultural identity, it seems to me that we are creating an enormous problem for ourselves and for those who want things to happen for the best.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para13"></a>I recognise that there may well be a reason why the Government felt pressed to introduce this Bill. It is not in the North Report. But I feel that over the summer period many unionist people construed the notion of a Parades Commission and a Bill as something that would prohibit or reroute marches. I do not see it as exclusively that. I see it as an opportunity on some occasions for perfectly reasonable Orange parades and other appropriate loyal order parades, including some nationalist parades, which may otherwise be obstructed by those who wish to create mischief or for other quite legitimate reasons to be given a legal stamp of approval. They would therefore have a degree of protection.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para14"></a>I do not see this as being an anti-parades Bill; I see it as being a parades Bill or a public processions Bill which will point up which are the reasonable and appropriate ones and which are those that perhaps ought to be considered in another way. I believe that, particularly in the unionist community, there was a sense that somehow or other this was a Bill that was opposed to them, in the same way as fair employment legislation is often seen as not being fair for everyone but being particularly fair for Catholics and equal opportunities legislation is not there to ensure that both men and women get jobs but in order to protect the rights of women. It is unfortunate that often human rights legislation is seen in that kind of one-sided way rather than as protecting everyone's interests. It is particularly unfortunate in this case.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para15"></a>What happened was that unionists wanted something in the legislation that they felt would balance things up, and perhaps without the deepest of thought this proposition was put in.

<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para16"></a>If there are indeed concerns about lack of balance, it may be worth considering how that can be addressed. I certainly do not want to see a piece of legislation that is unbalanced in any way--unbalanced in its fairness to the community as a whole or unbalanced in its provisions. But what I judge to be an attempt to create a degree of acceptance and balance has turned out not to be that, but to be something that creates a real problem for us.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para17"></a>The introduction of the notion of cultural identity is not in the North Commission Report and, in my judgment, can open up a Pandora's box which may have an entirely counterproductive effect to the one that unionist leaders and Orangemen wish to have. I request, therefore, that we give serious consideration to withdrawing that provision from the Bill and to seeing whether there are other ways in which reassurances can be given to those who feel some anxiety and concern about the impact of the Bill. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="71112-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, clearly set out the origins of the Bill and of the North Report on which it is based. He made clear that most of the processions in Northern Ireland are not contentious. Relatively speaking, it is only a few that become contentious, and many of those become contentious because people use the opportunity of a parade to make trouble and to make mischief. Of course we must do our best, in looking at all this legislation, to try to make sure that we do not give further opportunities to people to make mischief.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para18"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, said that the Bill is not only about balancing the rights of people to express their cultural identity--in this case, primarily through processions--but also to minimise the offence which is caused to others by those expressions of cultural identity. The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, is also correct in saying that we should not present a one-sided Bill; we should not have a one-sided commission. It may be seen as a one-sided Bill, an anti-Orange Bill, not to put too fine a point on it. I believe it should not be and we should do our best to address that. As the noble Lord suggested, Clause 3 provides one way in which this may be addressed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para19"></a>Parades are not the only way of expressing cultural identity in Northern Ireland; as we all know, there are many other ways. Clause 3 attempts to put parades into the context of expressions of cultural identity as a whole by giving the commission a duty to recommend, where it seems fit, changes in the law and practice relating to other expressions of cultural identity. That is, of course, a much lesser power than the power it has as far as processions themselves are concerned. It can determine the detailed arrangements for individual processions: it has to be given notice, and so on. That is backed up by the law. As far as other expressions of cultural identity are concerned, all it can do is recommend to the Secretary of State that the law or the practice on those might be modified. It is a much lesser power, but our task is to decide whether Clause 3 is effective in giving greater balance to the Bill. If it is, clearly it should stay in the Bill; if not, it should obviously come out.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para20"></a>I am not clear as to, and I hope the Minister can help us by indicating, what other expressions of cultural identity the Minister believes that Clause 3 is aimed at. What other expressions are likely to be examined by the commission if Clause 3 remains in the Bill and becomes law? We know from the face of the Bill that they do not include sporting events, which seems odd because they are sometimes very clear expressions of cultural identity. They evidently include religious services held in the open air, which can genuinely be expressions of cultural identity. They apparently include painted walls and kerbstones. They presumably also include outdoor meetings which are held at the end of a parade or, for that matter, held separately. I am not quite sure of the position of those that are held adjacent to processions--at the end of a procession or in the middle of a procession. Are those included in the aspects about which the commission can recommend changes in the law, or do they come under the provisions relating to processions with the greater restrictions that those allow the commission to impose? It seems to me that included in outdoor meetings would be bonfires, which are often big expressions of cultural identity. Protest meetings, particularly political protest meetings, often have a cultural identity wrapped up with them; and sometimes, indeed, industrial protests can have that kind of context, rightly or wrongly. We all believe wrongly, of course, but nevertheless sometimes these things might be regarded as having a cultural identity.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para21"></a>On the other hand, as the Bill is written at the moment the commission cannot review indoor meetings, even if they are public and publicised meetings. The commission would not be able to comment on those. We can, of course, discuss the pros and cons of these definitions separately later; but we need to know at this stage, when considering whether Clause 3 should stand part of the Bill, what the Government have in mind. If, in the course of that consideration, we eliminate the need to discuss separately Amendments Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 7, which stand in my name, so be it. It seems to me that we need to look at the definition and what is intended by the Government before we can decide whether Clause 3 should remain in the Bill, and, if so, whether it will help to put in context the detailed controls which the other clauses in the Bill provide over processions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-13_para22"></a>It is very important that we get this right. As both the noble Lord said and I said, we do not want a one-sided Bill or a one-sided commission.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="71112-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   On a point of order, I wonder whether the noble Lord the Minister could give us some guidance, particularly in the light of what the noble Lord, Lord Cope, has just said. Would the Minister be prepared to come in now or wait until some of us have contributed?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-14_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office   (Lord Dubs): </B>  I thought I would listen to the range of arguments about this and then do my best to answer the points that have been made. However, if I am pressed to come in earlier, I will of course accede to the noble Lord's suggestion.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, has made a powerful and persuasive speech based clearly <P>


<a name="column_6"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 6</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on his local knowledge and experience, which we have learned to respect. I can understand the desire of the noble Lord's party, and no doubt also of the Liberal Democrat Party, to narrow and restrict the scope of the Bill. I am not quite sure that I am entirely persuaded by them for a number of reasons.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para0"></a>Cultural identity embraces such issues as flags and emblems and bilingual signs, which have not so far been mentioned. On both those issues rather positive and good conventions have developed in Northern Ireland. For example, at places of work, a general convention seems to have been established that flags and emblems will not be displayed. On the question of bilingual signs, I believe it is already enshrined in law that these may be put up where there has been demonstrated to be a sufficient local demand for them, and that again seems reasonable and seems to my mind to be the sort of thing that the commission should be actively promoting and supporting.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para1"></a>Mention has been made already of Clause 3, and I would just like to emphasise that it says quite clearly that the expressions of cultural identity are limited to those taking place,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"wholly or partly open to the air". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para2"></a>It may be that the problem could be overcome by having a phased implementation of the Bill, once passed. By this I am suggesting that the commission should first be required to deal with questions relating to marches and parades, and then perhaps after two or three years, and if it made good progress on the more urgent question of public processions, its remit could be enlarged to include other items relating to cultural identity.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   I am delighted to follow the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. As he knows, we have carried on correspondence over many years. I had the advantage in that I was able to read his writing, but I am quite certain he would have had difficulty with mine.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para3"></a>I beg to differ ever so slightly with my friend and neighbour, the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, in regard to the amendment. I take the view that the whole background of the Bill was coloured by expressions of cultural identity, and if those expressions could be ignored by all concerned - and I say all concerned - then there would be no need for the measure at all. Clearly the Government have recognised that reality in the Long Title, where the phrase appears and may possibly remain.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para4"></a>I imagine the members of the commission will have used that reality in such judgments as they have formed thus far, and if they are to be given such powers as is intended by this Bill, and if Parliament so decides, an awareness of that reality on the part of the commission will be absolutely essential. If they were to ignore that background reality and it could be shown that they did, it would follow that any determination by the commission would be at risk of rejection, perhaps by the Secretary of State, who might feel bound to reject a decision depending on the form in which the Bill emerges from the deliberations of Parliament. An appeal to the judicial process would in those circumstances almost certainly succeed.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para5"></a>In my humble opinion, the withdrawal of recognition of the obvious fact that controversial processions arise from cultural differences would hamper the work of the commission. We would be in the situation where again "expressions of cultural identity" would be taken into account by Her Majesty's Government, by the Secretary of State and the Chief Constable but would have to be discounted by the commission alone.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </B>   I rise to support the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Alderdice and myself. The first thing we have to accept is that Clause 3 is a bolt-on. It is an addition to the proposals of Dr. North which would otherwise be substantially and wholly reproduced in the Bill which the Government have brought before us. It might have been bolted-on, and has been argued for purposes of balance.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para6"></a>In trying to solve a problem--which is obviously a real one--that a measure like this must not be seen to discriminate against one community in Northern Ireland, it may be opening up a real Pandora's box of problems, both for the commission, which has to deal with it, and ultimately for the Government, who will end up with the sharp end of a number of these issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para7"></a>First, there are many people who will not wish the Parades Commission well. There are many people who, for whatever reason, will hope that it fails. The crucial period will be its first determinations next spring. Many eyes will be on it, and those who do not wish it well will be trying, before it acquires authority, to discredit it and say that it is not working properly.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para8"></a>If we lay on the Parades Commission such an extension of its remit as to take in this very wide definition of "other expressions of cultural identity", we run the risk of it straying into areas of controversy that go even further than the already difficult and contentious issue of the parades themselves; and even this question of cultural identity manifestations in the open-air, so a T-shirt worn indoors is not a manifestation of cultural identity but outdoors it is. A bowler hat - is that a manifestation in itself of cultural identity? I suppose in the Northern Irish context it might be argued to be so. I see debates as to when something is a matter of cultural identity going into matters that could keep a commission of anthropologists, social scientists and philosophers occupied on this issue alone for 20 years.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cope, has very gallantly by his subsequent amendment attempted to deal with this problem by taking a rather bad bolt-on and putting patches on it, and taking out things, which I do think would be particularly unfortunate, which is trying to whitewash kerbstones and deal with gable ends. I can quite see why he has done that, but I would argue that we should go to the heart of the problem and deal with Clause 3 as a whole.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para10"></a>It is true to say that there is now some danger that this is seen by some people--the unionist community in Northern Ireland--as their quid pro quo, as it were, for accepting the Parades Commission. I hope my unionist friends would not see it that way because ultimately it <P>


<a name="column_8"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 8</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>could be damaging to expressions of unionist identity, probably more so in Northern Ireland than it would be to equivalent expressions of nationalist identity.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para11"></a>The final question I would like to ask is this. Clause 3 wisely provides for more research in this area, which is just as well, for some of the reasons I have outlined. I do not think any government should rush into this area, and I am quite certain the unfortunate Parades Commission will not want to be driven into this area until a great deal more research has been done.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para12"></a>The first question is, are we quite clear that the research has to be done first? Secondly, if the Government maintain Clause 3, which we certainly would not advocate, are they prepared to let a decent period of time elapse so that the Parades Commission can be established properly, working on the remit which Dr. North was asked to consider, and which the Parades Commission was set up to deal with, namely the question of marches and parades and the real balance between the expression of a tradition on the one hand and aggressive assertion of sovereignty of one community over the other? That is the meat of the problem, and I hope the Parades Commission, at worst, could be given a great deal more time.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para13"></a>I put the question in that form because I think the attitude of my noble friend and myself to the amendment will be very much conditioned by whether the Government propose to place what seems to us an inoperable extra responsibility on the Parades Commission within a short timetable.

<A NAME="71112-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I thank all the noble Lords who have taken part in this debate, which indeed is an interesting one. I am aware that opinions differ in the Committee, so the argument is not all in one direction.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para14"></a>Clause 3 provides that the commission shall keep under review and make determinations in relation to the law and practice concerning expressions of cultural identity which appear to the commission to have, or to be likely to have,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"an adverse impact on relationships within the community". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para15"></a>Of course, there may be many expressions of cultural identity, but they would only come within the scope of Clause 3 if they are judged to have an adverse impact on relationships within the community.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para16"></a>As some noble Lords have indicated, the clause does not apply to sporting events, or to public processions which are covered by the remaining provisions of the Bill. As the noble Lord, Lord Holme, said, it also enables the commission to commission research.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para17"></a>In including this clause in the Bill we have been acutely aware of the feeling in some quarters that the Bill and the structures it establishes are exclusively targeted at a form of cultural expression favoured mainly by one side of the community. Of course the Parades Commission will treat all applications for parades according to the same criteria and in an even-handed way. Nor is it true that the Bill is designed to be anti-parades, to create no-go areas for them or <P>


<a name="column_9"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 9</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reduce the overall number. What we want is local agreement; otherwise we have no fixed outcome in mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para18"></a>Nonetheless, concerns about a perceived lack of balance remain, and we feel it is important to address them. Indeed, many noble Lords referred in their speeches to the need to achieve balance. Parades are not the only form of cultural expression which can cause hurt and resentment, and we see a valuable role for the commission in identifying other ways in which public space can be used by one side of the community in ways which, intentionally or not, can damage community relations.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para19"></a>Your Lordships will note it is not our intention to commence this clause immediately. The noble Lords, Lord Holme and Lord Hylton, talked about phased implementation, or something of the sort. We believe that the new structures of the Bill as a whole need to be given time to bed in, and the commission will want to focus in its first months on its key responsibility of working towards a peaceful resolution of disputed parades in the course of the coming 1998 marching season.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para20"></a>We hope, however, to commence the clause within a matter of months. That is the timescale that was indicated recently by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State - within a matter of months. That means that the beginning of the marching season will be such that the commission will be able to concentrate solely on its main remit, and that within a matter of months, after the commission has got down to its key work, the Secretary of State will consider the right time to give effect to this clause.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para21"></a>I want to make sure that I have dealt with the specific questions that I was asked. I was asked what other expressions of cultural identity there might be. I would think it better for the Government not to start telling the commission in advance of the commission starting its work what those expressions of cultural identity might be. It would not be helpful; indeed, it would pre-empt the decision of the Committee in coming to a balanced assessment of what those expressions of cultural identity might be. Otherwise it would simply be a matter of the Government saying, "This is what we think they are", and the Secretary of State would then be advised by the commission as to there being such expressions of cultural identity. It would not be helpful, and I believe that noble Lords will understand why I am reluctant to start giving examples.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-14_para22"></a>The question of phased implementation I have already dealt with. The other point was about research. I do not want to be too dogmatic about that. Clearly it depends on the scale of the research that the commission would have in mind. What I do not think the Secretary of State would be inclined to do would be to say that there was a research project that the commission had in mind and so we would wait until that was finished before Clause 3 came into effect. My right honourable friend would be unlikely to want to take that path. We would need to see what the commission has in mind about research before being too precise about a timetable for research in relation to the implementation of Clause 3.

But the Government will consider all the points made very carefully and will see whether any amendments might be appropriate at a later stage. However, I am bound to say that, whereas many noble Lords have indicated their wish to see some changes in the clause or to put something in its place, I have not heard any particular suggestions as to what those changes might be.

<A NAME="71112-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, will he make it absolutely clear what he has told us about the timing of the Secretary of State's likely decision on the implementation of Clause 3? I should say in parenthesis that I am very uneasy with the formulation that says that we are going to do research but we will not wait to see what it says before we start acting. That seems to me to be a curious view of what research is for. But it was the remarks that the noble Lord made earlier about the possible implementation of Clause 3 in relation to next year's marching season that concerned me. Will he please repeat what he said so that we can be clear about the implementation of the clause in relation to the key negotiations on next year's marching season?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   If I may deal first with the point about research, it depends upon the scope of the research, the length of time, and so on. I am not sure that the Secretary of State would want to delay giving effect to Clause 3 because there was some rather long-term research proposal that the commission had in mind. I know that this is speculative, but I do not want to be drawn into giving a categorical answer one way or the other as to what effect the research would have, although I believe it is unlikely that a long piece of research will be a sufficient justification for delaying giving effect to Clause 3.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-15_para0"></a>The noble Lord asked a more particular question. Let me repeat what I said. We believe the new structures need to be given time to bed in, which is the overall scheme of the Bill, and the commission will want to focus in its first months on its key responsibility of working towards a peaceful resolution of disputed parades in the course of the 1998 marching season. However, we hope to commence the clause within a matter of months. I am not sure I can do better than that, because quite clearly the Secretary of State will wish to be influenced by the burden of work on the commission and whether the commission has managed to concentrate sufficiently on its main remit before adding other responsibilities.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Alderdice: </B>   I thank the Minister for his response, though I must confess that it seemed to me that he had accomplished facing two ways at the same time within the confines of the one sentence--that it was going to be delayed, but that it would not be delayed very much, but we are not really terribly sure how much. If the delay were such that the initial indications of determination were to be made, which one would <P>


<a name="column_11"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 11</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>assume would be perhaps around the February/March period, the implications of those determinations would be coming to fruition at precisely the time when this more contentious responsibility would be becoming the responsibility of the commission. So I regret to say that at this point I do not find myself particularly reassured by the Minister's responses.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-15_para1"></a>I am somewhat of a new boy to this House and its proceedings, and I am not entirely clear if my assumptions are correct. It seems to me that the particular arrangements of this Grand Committee may be rather helpful in this instance, because we have the opportunity of considering all the various matters through to completion before having to move to a Division on any matter. The Minister has indicated that he is interested to hear what other alternatives there might be which would give balance, and there are indeed a number of propositions by other noble Lords which, when we have explored them further, may begin to open up to us some of those alternatives. This is one of the reasons why I have not alluded to them in the comments I have made. Therefore, the mechanism chosen may be a particularly useful one for this process.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-15_para2"></a>One of the things I am not at all clear about is this. If the members of the commission--and, after all, they undertook their task largely in the knowledge that they would be dealing with the question of public processions--were to indicate to the Secretary of State that there were any areas of cultural expression to which they wished to extend their remit, would the Secretary of State be in a position to say, "I know you have indicated that and I know it is a rather tough job, but I am sorry, you are going to have it anyway"; or would the Secretary of State in that context be in a position to say, "You have considered the matter and I take what you have said, and therefore we simply will not implement this section of the Bill at all, given that the commission as it is now feels that that is not appropriate"? Or, indeed, if the commission were to return and say, "Indeed, there are matters of this kind but we would recommend to the Secretary of State a totally other mechanism for dealing with this, because we don't believe it is appropriate for the commission itself", would this put the Government in an invidious position, or would this assist the Government in making their difficult decision? Would it provoke the Secretary of State to overrule the advice of the Parades Commission, or would she perhaps be somewhat relieved to accept its advice?
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-15_para3"></a>It seems to me that we must discuss quite a lot of the implications of what has been said. Therefore at this point I feel it is important for us to continue to press for this. It would be a grave mistake to include this notion of cultural identity, which would be thoroughly regretted all round, including by those who were most keen to see it. However, it is perhaps good fortune that it is not necessary to press it to a Division at this point, and we can consider the other matters as they come forward. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-15_para4"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "71112-15_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: As one of the principal geriatrics in this gathering, I am deeply grateful to the Chair for that improvement in the illumination because my eyesight is fading rapidly.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-15_para8"></a>I beg to move Amendment No. 2 standing in my name. My decision to table the amendment arose from my exchange with the noble Lord the Minister on Second Reading. He will remember that on that occasion I suggested that where a decision had been made by the commission and the determination issued, the commission became the deciding body. He did not contest that. The drafting does not spell out its subsequent role as the implementing body, and it was for that reason that I suggested to the Minister that members of the commission would have to be present at the potential flashpoint. I was not influenced in my thinking by the dictum that nothing stimulates the mind as much as being shot at without result. It was rather that the Minister assured me the members of the commission had been present in many areas of dispute. I naturally accepted his assurance in regard to the recent past.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-15_para9"></a>However, once the Bill receives Royal Assent, the nature of the commission alters dramatically. It makes decisions, it issues determinations, but it must ensure that its determinations are in force, and that is the central problem in this measure. It could be said that the police would find this preferable to a situation where their own Chief Constable makes the decision. The police would then be seen in new circumstances to be enforcing a decision and directive of a lay body, namely the commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-15_para10"></a>However, there must be visible evidence of responsibility on the part of the commission dealing with any disturbance which might result from its determination in order to convince international opinion, and international television teams in particular, that the responsibility rests with the commission and not the police. In order to ensure that that is done, members of the commission must be on the spot to explain to the news industry present on that occasion that it, the commission, accepts full responsibility for any unseemly activity which might result, which journalists will have come to see and to some extent usually done much to incite.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-15_para11"></a>The second reason for my amendment arises from what seems to be an absence of repeal of the relevant sections of the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987. That appears to be intact if I have read the schedule of repeals at the back correctly. Article 5(1) of that order is still in force, except for the deletion admittedly of four words which are not relevant to Clause 2 which we are debating.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-15_para12"></a>The Chief Constable and the Assistant Chief Constable may recommend a ban on one of two grounds. The relationship to that is to be found in that section of the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order to which I have referred. The first one is that rerouting or imposing conditions might not be sufficient to prevent serious disorder, serious damage, disruption or intimidation. The second part--and I quote directly from it--is that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"rerouting or imposing conditions would place undue demands on police manpower". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-15_para13"></a>Most of the decisions taken over the past three years by both Chief Constables would have been based on that particular article. I believe it was that second reason that governed many decisions, particularly in the Garvaghy Road, in previous years.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-15_para14"></a>The Chief Constables were supported by the police authority, which even now harks back to the financial cost of police operations. The police were also supported by the Ministers then in the Northern Ireland Office, who explained that cuts in expenditure on education and health budgets were necessary because of the limited police costs which could not be met in any other way--limited in the sense that, had the police ignored Article 5(1) of the existing Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987, that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"rerouting or imposing conditions would place undue demands on police manpower", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-15_para15"></a>the cost would perhaps have increased tenfold. With hindsight, those decisions of the Chief Constables were probably wise in the interests of the community in general.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-15_para16"></a>As this Bill does not list Article 5(1) in the repeals section of Schedule 4, it would appear to me that police decisions will still be based on the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 and not necessarily on the Bill which we are discussing in your Lordships' Committee today. I have to ask whether the commission will, in the exercise of its powers which we are now conferring upon it, particularly in Clause 2(2)(b), base its decision on Article 5(1) of the order now in force; or when it issues a determination and commits the police to implementing that determination, will it have the advanced approval of the Northern Ireland Office Minister heading up the Department of Finance, and will it also have the advanced approval of the police authority for additional costs of placing undue demands on police manpower? Hitherto Chief Constables have been very cost-conscious. Will the commission be as sensitive in regard to Treasury-imposed budgets in this particular matter?

<P>
<A NAME="71112-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </B>   I wonder whether the noble Lord, in proposing this amendment, is aware of the research done on this very difficult decision about who decides. It showed within Northern Ireland by a clear majority of the whole community that an independent commission should decide rather than the police. Indeed within the Protestant community that was true as well. We oppose the noble Lord's amendment, not because we do not have a great deal of sympathy with the point he is making, but to remove this clause from the Bill invalidates the main purpose of the North Report and the main development which the commission represents as a way of trying to deal with this intractable problem in Northern Ireland. I am afraid that the noble Lord cannot count on support from these Benches.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   I wonder whether the noble Lord will give way. I am most grateful. But the simple point remains: will the commission then shoulder the burden of ensuring the costs which will be imposed as a result of an undue burden on police manpower? Will the commission find some means of funding the increased expenditure which would automatically arise from that decision of the commission?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </B>   I had sat down, but I shall await the answer of the Minister on that point with great interest.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-16_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   I am inclined to support this amendment, mainly because of the practical problem: should a parade go wrong and should there be trouble, who will take responsibility for acting on the spot? Do the police have the right, in order to save lives, in order to protect the community, to override what the commission has decided in the meeting previous to that parade in order to carry out their job correctly? I am quite happy that the commission should initially be the authority to decide whether the parade should go forward. However, in Northern Ireland parades, and people, have a funny knack of going wrong at very short notice indeed. If there are not enough police and security forces on site at that time, it has previously been the responsibility of either the most senior policemen or indeed, taking it further, the Secretary of State. However, the commission is a group of people. Those people will not all attend every single parade. Indeed, they may not all be in Northern Ireland at any particular time. So will there be a quorum that has to be in the country which has to be available? I should like to ask the Minister to clarify that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   As I see it, the commission is being asked first of all to facilitate and encourage local agreement by whatever means it can. If that fails, and it may fail, it is being asked to exercise a quasi-judicial function, and it is desirable that it should exercise that function as a matter of last resort rather than the decision having to be taken either by the Chief Constable or by the Secretary of State. The commission may have to <P>


<a name="column_15"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 15</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>exercise that responsibility on the balance of probabilities and on its knowledge of the resources available. It is for those kind of grounds that I am not inclined to support the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I have much sympathy with a great deal that the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, said. However, he went considerably wider than the detailed terms of the amendment. There is clearly a difficulty if a parade goes badly wrong and large resources of the police or, for that matter, the military are called upon. Indeed, we all remember instances when the numbers of police have needed to escalate very quickly and there have been difficulties about getting the police or for that matter the numbers of military on the ground in the right place at the right time. It has been the practice to have large numbers standing by in order to assist, if required. That can be a considerable waste in one sense of police and indeed military time. However, it is necessary in the circumstances which arise.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-16_para0"></a>Clearly, on the day, as the noble Lord pointed out, the situation can be different from what was expected at the time the commission made its determination a number of days before--sometimes a while before. It is important that the police continue to have the right to change the situation in the interests of public order--if necessary even to stop the march altogether--with the Secretary of State's powers possibly being involved as well. As I understand it, the Bill preserves the right of the police in these circumstances to alter the determination effectively: to issue an overriding determination in the interests of public order on the ground on the day. If the Bill does not, I believe that it should.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-16_para1"></a>The amendment would take away from the commission the right to issue the determinations. It has been argued that it is wrong for the commission both to be the mediator attempting to get agreement in the early stages of a parade being set up, and also to be the judge who says at a certain point, "You may go ahead but not down this road or with this condition", or whatever it is. Certainly it seems to me that if the commission is in a position to issue a determination, it alters the way in which the negotiations are likely to go. In a sense the negotiations are under some form of duress because the big stick of the commission's determination is under the table all the time as the discussions proceed. I understand that difficulty but we have to accept it in the light of the way that the Bill and the commission are being set up.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-16_para2"></a>If it were not the commission which issued the determination and determined the detailed conditions for a march, either the police would have to do so--that is what we are trying to get away from--at the suggestion of the previous Chief Constable, or, for that matter, the Secretary of State. While not coming to the same thing, that is also what we are, in a way, trying to get away from. There is a further alternative: that we should have one body set up to deal with the mediation; and a different body set up to make the determination in the light of the mediation if the mediation does not succeed. <P>


<a name="column_16"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 16</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>But I do not want to see two bodies; one is enough. I should therefore be happy for the commission to have the dual role of presiding over the mediation, and ultimately, in the necessary cases, of issuing the determination.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-16_para3"></a>Of course it is right that it is the police who have to carry out on the ground the necessary operations to ensure that the determination is put into effect and that offenders who go against the determination are dealt with in a proper way. It will fall back on to the police to enforce the determinations. That is why ultimately the police must also have the fallback power in cases of public order, in effect to overrule the determination and take charge of the situation on the day on the ground and deal with it as best they can.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-16_para4"></a>Sometimes the police will be influenced in their decisions in this by the available police resources. If they are extremely stretched at a certain point the amount of resources required will influence their decision. That is inevitable. It is not possible to ring up Stormont to get the Finance Minister's permission to call a few more police out. At one stage I was in the position of being both the Finance Minister and the Security Minister, so I could ask myself if such a situation occurred! In practice, of course, it does not, because the police operations on the ground are conducted by the police and by the Chief Constable in particular.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. With the recollection in mind that he had very admirably looked after our housekeeping allowances when he was a Minister at Stormont, I make a final plea to him. Would he suggest that the Government do all in their power to persuade the commission to be as cost conscious as previous chief constables in the making of decisions and assessing what the cost of those decisions might be?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-16_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   The short answer to the noble Lord is yes. One of the matters that the commission has to take into account in the later clauses is the burden on the police and the resources available to support law and order. It is something of which the commission should take account. Indeed, the commission will be obliged to take it into account as one of the factors; and it is quite right that it should.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-16_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   May I try to reassure some noble Lords as regards how the police can influence what may happen. In the first case, the commission will take a number of views, including the views of the police, in arriving at a determination. Secondly, having made a determination, if the Chief Constable is unhappy he may then make an application to the Secretary of State to ask her to review the determination that the commission has made in Clause 9. Thirdly, in Clause 10 it says very clearly that nothing as regards the determination of the commission affects the common law powers of a constable to take action to deal with or prevent a breach of the peace on the day. The police could make a decision on the day based upon the possibility of a breach of the peace being threatened.

<A NAME = "71112-16_para5"></a>We know that the RUC has done an excellent job over many years, at times when resources have been very stretched. I am sure they will continue to do so in this particular case. If the likely resources on the day seem to be inadequate, I am sure that the police will make that known. If they were not happy with the commission's response to that fact, the Secretary of State would, of course, listen to what the chief constable had to say.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-16_para6"></a>There are a number of checks and balances in the system. We would hope that there will never be a time when police resources are too stretched to deal with all the demands made upon them on any single day. It may have happened in the past. I am hopeful it will not happen in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-16_para7"></a>Obviously the Secretary of State is mindful of the needs of the police to have adequate resources to police Northern Ireland whatever the security situation demands. I believe there would be a sensitivity to the points made by the noble Lord.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister. We are moving closer on this topic because the Minister is getting to the point--and I do not want to press him too far--that consideration will be given by the Secretary of State to the expense involved by increasing the burden on police manpower. I would not want to press him for an assurance at the moment, but I hope we can get it before the Bill leaves this House. If it were to happen again, the additional cost would not come from the health and social services budget, education, or any of those other worthy departments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   It would be difficult for me to give categorical assurances as regards public expenditure. All I would say to the noble Lord is that if he had been party to some of the public expenditure discussions that the ministerial team in Northern Ireland have had recently, he would know just how closely the Secretary of State scrutinises all headings of expenditure, and how she is very careful to ensure that public money is spent sensibly and properly. I could not give a further assurance as to how specific additional financial needs, if they arose, would be met. That is going beyond what I am able to do here and now, and I know Members of the Committee will appreciate that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-17_para0"></a>Having said that, perhaps I can deal with a couple of specific questions asked. Article 5(1) of the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order will only apply to banning open air public meetings. The power to ban parades is that contained in Clause 11. Both powers belong to the Secretary of State. I think it is probably widely understood that the commission now has power to ban parades. However, I am concerned that the effect of Amendment No. 2 would materially damage the main thrust of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-17_para1"></a>The commission does, of course, have a very important power to conciliate, to mediate, and to achieve a peaceful resolution of any disputes about a specific parade. If the commission is to be 100 per cent successful, that would be the totality of its work. In the real world it may not always be that successful in its mediation responsibilities. Therefore, we need the <P>


<a name="column_18"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 18</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>commission to have the powers which the noble Lord seeks to delete in his amendment. I think that would not be appropriate; it would damage the whole concept of the commission's work; it would undermine the way in which the North Report approached it, and I very much hope the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-17_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>   I apologise for coming in late. I was at a commemoration service for Vincent Hanna.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-17_para2"></a>If we were to accept this amendment, it would mean in effect that it would nullify the whole raison d'etre of this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-17_para3"></a>In the real world of Northern Ireland, in relation to these contentious parades the commission will not be able to take a decision on a recommendation which may be at variance with that of the RUC, which in the final analysis will be responsible for the conduct of those parades. Another element will be the Northern Ireland Office--in other words the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. In any conclusion leading to the conduct of these parades, it will have to be a tripartite arrangement. The Northern Ireland Office Secretary of State must be asked for her opinion; the RUC must be asked for its opinion; and the commission will be asked to give its opinion. It is highly unlikely, and indeed it would be disastrous, for the commission to make a decision or a recommendation in relation to a parade which would not meet with the sole approval of the RUC, because at the end of the day it will be the RUC who will have to police those parades. It would have to take into account the views of the commission, and the views of the Northern Ireland Office which in the final analysis will be responsible for all the financial considerations--the pay of the police and the pay of everybody else in the security field in relation to the conduct of these parades.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-17_para4"></a>In this present situation it may be considered that the Bill is directed at one section of the community in Northern Ireland. That, perhaps, is the reason for this amendment, because the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, represents one section of the community in Northern Ireland: that he is taking whatever measures he can to lessen the impact of this commission in relation to the parades with which he has been associated, and indeed has taken part in over many years.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-17_para5"></a>It was said during the Second Reading of the Bill that only 20 to 25 of these parades are contentious, and have led to contradictions over many years. Before the Bill becomes law, as the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, said, one would hope that the police, the Northern Ireland Office and the commission do not have to wait until February of next year. We are all aware of the contentious parades due to take place. There is a great deal of time between now and February.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-17_para6"></a>On the question of police manpower, nobody knows more about police manpower in Northern Ireland than the RUC Chief Constable. He will know whether there will be a large parade or a small parade in Bellaghy; or a large parade in the Garvaghy Road, and another more contentious parade in the City of Belfast. On a fair analysis, the RUC will have to agree with the <P>


<a name="column_19"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 19</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>commission; the commission will have to agree with the RUC; and the overall responsibility will be that of the Northern Ireland office.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-17_para7"></a>I cannot support the amendment because I believe that it will nullify what the Bill, the commission and the RUC will be called upon to do in the event of contentious parades. To accept this amendment would nullify the whole concept of the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   Perhaps I may comment on what the noble Lord said. I am not in major disagreement with him, but I want to stress that the commission is an independent body. That is one of the reasons that we are setting it up. It is independent of Government and independent of the police. We will come to the point in later clauses, but of course the commission has to take a number of different factors into account in arriving at a determination, and the views of the police will be one of them. I do not, however, think that the views of the Secretary of State will be fed in. The Secretary of State would only come in at a later stage if the Chief Constable felt it necessary to ask the Secretary of State to consider a particular determination.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-17_para8"></a>I want to stress that one of the gains to Northern Ireland is that the commission will be independent. It will not be a plaything of one group, of the police or of politicians. It will have that independence, and that is surely its strength and why we believe that the structure we have in the Bill and the independence of the commission ought to appeal to people in Northern Ireland in order to see that that independence is a safeguard for their rights and freedoms in these rather vexed areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-17_para9"></a>Let me just comment on another point that the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, made earlier, to which I did not refer when I spoke a few minutes ago, and that is the presence of the commission members at parades. It is not possible to lay down that commission members ought to be at any of these contentious parades. I understand that some members of the commission were present on some occasions earlier this year, but I do not want to be categoric about that. It is up to the commission members themselves to decide what they want to do and whether they feel being on the spot would be useful in terms of their work. It would be inappropriate for a Minister to tell the commission how it should exercise its functions, including attendance at flashpoints, although I suspect in the real world they might well wish to be present at any flashpoints that they perceive in the coming months.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-17_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Brookeborough: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, I accept that the commission does not ban parades. However, the wording of the clause says to issue "determinations". What is a determination if it is not a decision? It does not say "to issue advice"; it says "to issue a determination".

<FONT SIZE=3>parade should follow; that is to say, they would have to do that if the process of mediation and conciliation had not arrived at an outcome without making a determination necessary.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-17_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   With regard to this matter of the members of the commission attending parades, on the one hand, it is impossible for the commission to do its job properly without seeing some parades on the ground, seeing what happens, what goes wrong, what goes right and so on. The members need to do this as background information for the determinations that they have to make.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-17_para10"></a>As I read the Bill, and I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm this, there is no question of members of the commission being present on a parade to issue further determinations in the course of the afternoon, or even in the course of several days, because, as we know, these situations can go on for several days. The purpose of their attending would be as background information to do their general job, not to try to take command of the situation away from the police commander on the spot in a difficult situation. If a situation becomes difficult, it is for the police themselves under the public order legislation to which the Minister referred to take any necessary action.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   If members of the commission attend on the day, they would do so simply as people who want to see how their determinations work out on the ground. However, the commission's determinations would have to be available some time before the day of the parade in order for them to make it clear to those organising the parade what was the basis on which the parade might proceed. My understanding is that on the day itself the commission would have no remit except to learn what has happened as a result of what it did or did not decide sometime previously.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   Clause 10 makes it clear that that would be a breach of the peace and that any decision on the day would be made by the police.

<A NAME="71112-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>   We want to live in the real world of Northern Ireland. If I were a member of a concerned residents' association--and there are far too many of them in Northern Ireland at the moment--I would arrange to have four or five different contentious parades taking place on the one day, and where is the commission going to go then? Are there enough members of the commission to sit around from Garvaghy Road to Bellaghy to Newtownbutler to the Armagh Road? That is what will happen in Northern Ireland because of the IRA and its supporters and those who have fuelled all these so-called concerned residents. It is easy for them to spark off a whole lot of different contentious parades. And where will the commission be? Perhaps some photographs of members of the commission will be available before then which may be leaked to the press.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para0"></a>Take, for example, a contentious parade on Garvaghy Road. One member of the commission may be standing there and another member of the commission is in Bellaghy and another one is in Dunlewy. I would not give too much for their survival if a riot were to break out at such parades.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para1"></a>That is why the commission has been set up, because of the possibility of riotous behaviour. I would urge the Minister to take on board the fact that he is not dealing with very innocent people in the organisation of these parades. There may be three, four, five or more contentious parades on the same day. What will the commission do then? Will its members go to watch what happens at that parade? It is too late then, because whatever is going to happen will have been stoked up by those who are opposed to the parade, by the concerned residents' association.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para2"></a>All that will have to be gone into with the police. The Minister had said that one of the great attributes of the commission is that it is independent. Independent of what? The independence of that commission will be guaranteed only by its ability to seek what will be a contentious parade. Whether we in this Committee like it or not, the commission will have to consult the RUC. If there are four or five different contentious parades on the one day or in the one week, at the end of the day it is the RUC that will have to police them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para3"></a>I urge the Minister not to depend too much on the commission's neutrality, therefore, because that will be put to very severe test by those who are opposed to the parades in the first place.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   This might be a good moment for me to pay tribute to the very valuable work carried out last summer by the interim commission--if I may call it that--and in particular by the Reverend Roy Magee who in certain parades was able to bring all parties concerned to adopt a problem-solving attitude to the proposals under discussion.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para4"></a>Having said that, may I go on to draw the attention of the Committee to Clause 8(1):
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Commission may issue a determination in respect of a proposed public procession imposing on the persons organising or taking part in it such conditions as the Commission considers necessary". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para5"></a>As I read that, it could cover such matters as the dates of parades referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Fitt. Then in lines 44 to 45, it goes on:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may include conditions as to the route of the procession", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para6"></a>as was already mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs,
<P>
<BR>

<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para7"></a>That is very significant.

<A NAME="71112-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   May I elaborate for the benefit of the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, on the brief point that he made. I still feel that there is a real need for members of the commission to be in the position, wherever that may be--even if it is only in a television studio--to protect the police against criticism for their handling of a situation which the police had no part in creating.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para8"></a>Secondly, in the light of the Minister's assurance, it is to be hoped that the independent commission will not act so independently in the matter of incurring expenditure so that the cuts that we had to suffer in Northern Ireland last year will not again fall on the most needy sections of our community.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-18_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I should like to give an absolute assurance on how Northern Ireland expenditure will develop. Clearly no Minister in Northern Ireland, nor the Government, would wish any cuts to fall on the most needy members of the community. That is a general political proposition to which the Government subscribe. It is a matter for argument as to whether a particular cut falls on a specific sector of the community, but it is not the Government's motive. We would not wish that to happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para9"></a>I cannot be pressed any further on what is an attempt to pin me down to future public expenditure patterns, and I know that the noble Lord is not seeking to do that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para10"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-18_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Alderdice </B>   moved Amendment No. 3:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 2, line 2, at end insert--("( ) issue conclusions covering processions in a particular area over a period of time.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: It might appear on the face of things that the amendment I propose is in direct contradiction to the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux of Killead. He was indicating a wish that the power of determinations be withdrawn from the commission; and I am asking that the power be extended to ensure that conclusions can cover processions over a period of time in a particular area.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para12"></a>In fact, we are not at variance on this. It is quite clear from what the noble Lord said that he wishes to see the best of all possible worlds: that there be some discussion, negotiation and agreement within the community. It seems more likely that one could achieve that kind of agreement within the community if a pattern of parades were to be agreed over a period of time.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para13"></a>If we consider any of those areas where there have been contentious parades, in particular areas such as Drumcree, the Ormeau Road, around the Ballymena area and so on, almost all attempts to reach an understanding have been posited on the notion that some parades would be allowed in some circumstances while other parades would be foregone by the organisers. That cannot be undertaken if one simply looks at each single individual parade by each individual organisation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para14"></a>In recognising this, Dr. Peter North and his colleagues in their report stated at recommendation 59 that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Commission should be empowered to issue determinations for one or more parades in an area, to do so where appropriate over a period"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para15"></a>indeed, they went further than myself--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"longer than one year". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para16"></a>For example, there might be an agreement that in the current climate, a parade might be foregone this year on the understanding that it would be permissible next year.
<P>


<a name="column_23"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 23</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para17"></a>I submit that this is remarkably congruent with the underlying approach of the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux of Killead, that there should be some agreement within the community. We all realise that there are those individuals who do not want agreement, and will try to stir up trouble. But their efforts are much more likely to be frustrated if the opportunities for reaching accord are maximised. It seems to me that if a commission can look at only every individual parade as it arises, the prospects for a real agreement are much reduced.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para18"></a>I know that there have been indications from those who are legally better informed than I that such propositions might be in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights. Many of us look forward to the Government incorporating such legislation in our own domestic law.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para19"></a>I am always a little sceptical of lawyers and legal advice. I trust that those who are so qualified will not hold that against me. But for example, in the field of town and country planning, it seems entirely permissible that if the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland issues guidelines for a particular area--perhaps it is an area of town-scape character which they wish to protect--it is making it crystal clear that almost any application which comes forward, which is outside those guidelines, will not be accepted. Of course anyone is entirely permitted to put forward an application that contravenes the guidelines, and in exceptional circumstances it might even be that it would receive approval. But they would be exceptional circumstances; otherwise there would be no point in having such guidelines.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para20"></a>There are areas which are important, and indeed in local terms--as we all know as representatives of areas--quite contentious in their own way but nevertheless not of the security import concerning the parades about which we have been speaking. It would seem to me extraordinary that the Parades Commission could not be empowered to issue definitive guidelines for parades over a particular period of time, doing so after full consultation, as we indicate in the more detailed Amendment No. 17, with all those who are likely to want parades.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para21"></a>On this side of the water it may seem an impossible task to speculate on who might wish to have a parade down a particular road at any time of the year. Let me assure your Lordships that it is not in the slightest degree difficult to suggest who would be likely to have a parade. We are talking sometimes of a few weeks' notice of a parade. In Northern Ireland we can sometimes have 100 years' notice of a parade, because they have been continuing for that length of time. It is referred to in amendments that some of the parades are those which we know will take place, or are proposed to take place, not just next year but every year thereafter, barring some unusual eventuality.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para22"></a>There must be some way to achieve this objective. In the view of Dr. North and his colleagues and myself and my colleagues--and I am sure it is a view even more widely held--it would be profoundly desirable to ensure that we can have agreements reached and guidelines and <P>


<a name="column_24"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 24</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>recommendations given, even as to the significance of determinations, in order to ensure that the pattern of parades in an area is acceptable. I am sure that, if there were such an agreement, it would reduce the chance of malign individuals coming in and stirring up trouble--for, after all, it would not simply be an informal piece of collusion between two or three organisations. It would be something that, after negotiation, had the stamp of approval and the public registration of a determination by the commission, making it much more difficult to breach for those who want to create trouble.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para23"></a>I would appeal to you, and I would appeal to the Minister to give the most earnest consideration to the amendments we have put forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_time0"></A><H5>5 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-18_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I am in sympathy with the argument put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice. It seems to me that it would be helpful to everybody, the commission, those organising parades and those taking part in them, that, as it were, groups of parades in a particular area should be able to be considered together, particularly when they are being organised by the same people. I am not a lawyer any more than the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, but it seemed to me that the Bill permits this as it is. I noticed in the draft of the guidelines issued by the commission that in considering what it should do about parades one of the things it proposes to have regard to is the frequency of such parades along the route in question. It is paragraph 4.3 of the guidelines. That seems to indicate that the commission also thought that it could see individual parades in the context of others.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-18_para24"></a>It is not precisely the same point as that being made by the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, because he wants the commission to be able to issue what is described in the amendments as "conclusions", although they are not actually defined very carefully--but we all understand what he means. The commission should certainly be able to consider groups of processions in making its decisions, and sometimes will wish to make decisions on a whole series of parades in a particular area at the same time. If the Bill does not do this, then the Minister should look for ways to ensure that the commission is able to do it.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </B>   I rise briefly to support my noble friend on this amendment and to agree with the noble Lord, Lord Cope. I would like to make the very practical point that it is far easier in negotiations to arrive at a conclusion, whether it is a commercial or a political negotiation, if you have a number of factors to put together in a package deal. If you have to take them seriatim, one by one, then there can be quite the reverse effect--the domino effect of attitudes entrenched and hardening.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para0"></a>I hope the Government accept the logic of the North Commission that if there is the flexibility to deal with what is referred to in the guidelines procedural rules as a pattern of parades in an area it is far more likely that the outcome that we are all seeking--of trade-offs leading to a win-win solution--will be achieved. I would like to add my own tribute to the efforts last year <P>


<a name="column_25"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 25</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of certain leaders of the Orange Lodge, who clearly treated the problem in exactly this way, asking what trade-offs could accommodate everybody's interests in this area. It is much easier to do that if it is possible to consider a number of parades simultaneously. When the Minister replies, I hope he will tell us whether the Bill does this or, if it does not, that he will accept the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I appreciate that on this issue the Bill departs from the recommendation of the North Report. I am aware that at Second Reading some noble Lords referred to this particular point. Given that this is a fairly complicated issue, perhaps I could spend a few moments trying to explain the Government's position and why there are difficulties, but offer a little comfort at the end.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para1"></a>The amendment seeks to implement recommendation 15 of the North Report that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Parades Commission should be empowered to reach and promulgate conclusions in relation to one or more parades in an area and to do so where appropriate over a period longer than one year". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para2"></a>Given the Government's commitment to implementing North, our decision not to implement this particular recommendation was not taken lightly. But the difficulties involved are, as far as we can see, insurmountable. I can assure members of the Committee that we have gone into this in quite some detail.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para3"></a>I suggest that the draft clause demonstrates neatly the problems with this recommendation of the report. The proposed new clause would give the commission power to issue determinations before it was in full possession of the facts. Given the lack of this information it is inevitable that such decisions would be taken on a vague basis. The new clause simply empowers the commission to impose such conditions as it may consider necessary without clarifying the factors it would need to take into account. While implementing one North recommendation, giving the commission this power would ironically go quite against the spirit of the report that decisions should be made on an entirely open and transparent basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para4"></a>This is not a problem with the noble Lord's drafting. It is inherent in the proposal. We recognise that the likely date of a parade may be known well in advance--I believe the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, said 100 years in advance. But the factors which everyone agrees need to be taken into account in deciding whether to impose conditions on a parade include public order, disruption to the life of the community, danger of intimidation and impact on relationships within the community. But all of these are closely associated with the facts of an individual parade.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para5"></a>In the procedures and guidelines, to which we shall turn before too long, the commission has made clear that it intends to start gathering evidence as early as possible on all planned parades for the year ahead and issue a preliminary view. But short of increasing the notice period to, say, six months or a year, the commission cannot know the full facts of the case. It will not have notification of key issues like how many will be attending, how many bands, the organisers' adherence <P>


<a name="column_26"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 26</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to the code of conduct. And even then, factors such as the public order situation can change rapidly as the proposed parade approaches.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para6"></a>What a package deal at the beginning of the marching season cannot take into account are parades of a more spontaneous nature which the commission will still need to consider on their merits when the application has been received. The commission could not rule out in advance allowing such spontaneous parades to go ahead without being vulnerable to charges that it had fettered any discretion. But given the possibility that such parades could be applied for and would go ahead, even a power to make a determination for an entire marching season cannot provide total assurance about how many processions will take place in a given area.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para7"></a>We believe the commission, as an independent body, can play a valuable role, one hopes, primarily in facilitating local agreement but, if this is not possible, in issuing determinations which stand a chance of achieving the respect of both sides of the community. But we believe this responsibility could be undermined if the powers it is given are sweeping and unspecific. To issue determinations on parades six months or even longer ahead would require the commission to make binding legal decisions on scanty evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para8"></a>We believe this could also run into difficulties with the European Convention on Human Rights, to which the noble Lord, Lord Holme, referred. Under the convention, governments are required to show that restrictions on the exercise of rights are necessary and proportionate for the purpose in question. It could be difficult to show that if the decision is taken so far in advance that the facts are not fully known. Giving the commission power to demand full knowledge about future parades would require an extension to the notice period for many months ahead, which would itself be dubious in European convention terms.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para9"></a>The alternative approach might be to give the commission a licensing role, enabling it effectively to set quotas for the number of parades it was prepared to see in a given area over a given time. But this would be a remarkable incursion on what is seen as a basic civil right in every western democratic society, and we do not believe it would be justifiable or defensible in convention terms.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para10"></a>We are deeply conscious of the need to broaden the picture and seek accommodation in given areas over a wider time. This would clearly be one of the commission's top priorities. The procedural rules to which the noble Lord, Lord Holme, has already referred also make clear that the commission will want to issue initial views setting out the position it is minded to take. These will not be legally binding, but they will provide a certain level of assurance about the commission's long-term approach. May I say that I suspect in practice there will be little difference between an initial view of this type and the sort of package deal determination recommended by the noble Lord. After all, realistically circumstances may change so much between the time of the initial determination and the parade that the commission will be forced to review an advance decision anyway.

<A NAME = "71112-19_para11"></a>I believe that what I have said goes quite a long way towards meeting the points made by the noble Lord and indeed the noble Lord, Lord Cope, and I hope therefore, for reasons of practicality and principle, the Committee will feel that this new clause is not appropriate and that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, greatly assisted us in the explanations he gave as to his intentions and objectives, and the Minister has also been very helpful with that information which introduces a new angle to the whole issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para12"></a>The difficulty arises from the words "particular area". In a village or hamlet it might be simple to relate the number of processions to, for example, the make-up of the population in the locality. It should be possible to judge whether the locality itself would generate a proportionate--to use that word again--number of processions at a given time, and then to make allowance for a rather odd phenomenon of which we ought to take note--the phenomenon of the village playing host to a much larger event or procession, which could happen on a rota system once in 10 or 15 years. It is not uncommon.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para13"></a>A different aspect arises if a major arterial road passes by but not through a built-up area. In such a case to consider the local factor pertaining in the village is not appropriate. The use of the main arterial road might justify a greater number of processional occasions, and the same road might provide for road traffic on the arterial route as the natural and shortest way from the start of a journey to its termination.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para14"></a>The words "period of time" require further consideration. Do they imply some form of rationing or, if we use air traffic control language, do they mean slots? Until about three years ago, when the IRA launched its campaign against peaceful processions--that is not an assumption or an allegation; we have the words of one, Mr. Adams, that he and his colleagues spent two years planning this particular campaign--there had been a steady reduction in the frequency of processions and but for the Adams' campaign, my assessment is that such reduction would have continued quite markedly.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para15"></a>If we were to insert in the Bill the amendment and the new clause implying--it may not be the intention--quotas and rationing, the tendency to reduce would be reversed, just as church attendance in England would mushroom following a ban on Sunday worship.

<A NAME="71112-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, has rightly drawn the Committee's attention to the words in the amendment "a particular area". That could lead us into a long discussion on what an area or a particular area means. The noble Lord did not mention Drumcree in his remarks, but we know that he was referring to the arterial road which passes down by Drumcree church and past the nationals. We all understand that. In fact, many people in Northern Ireland did not understand the meaning of, or could not spell, arterial road until the events of Drumcree.

<A NAME = "71112-19_para16"></a>Is Portadown to be taken as an area? Is the whole area around Drumcree or the town of Portadown to be taken as an area? Only one part of that area will be contentious, and that is the Drumcree area. One could have 100 or 1,000 Orange parades in the town of Portadown itself and nobody will object to them. Therefore one will not be in a position to do a trade-off because there is no trade there. That is a wholly unionist area, and there will be no objection from any concerned residents in the town of Portadown itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para17"></a>The conflagration would break out in Drumcree. No trade-off could be achieved in relation to Drumcree. Last year I found it frightening that Drumcree was relating its activities to what occurred in the Ormeau Road in Belfast, which is 60 or 70 miles away. The Ormeau Road is absolutely nothing to do with Drumcree, but the organiser of the Drumcree opposition and the organiser of the Ormeau Road opposition were saying, "We will have a parade if you are not allowed to have your parade", or "If there is any attempt by the police to stop your parade it will have an effect on our deliberations." That was totally wrong within the context of Northern Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para18"></a>One could have all kinds of marches at the top end of the Ormeau Road, which involves a unionist community where there has never been any difficulty. It is the parade which comes down over the Ormeau Road bridge which causes the contention. There is no way that one could have a trade-off with the concerned residents' association because that is the only parade with which the residents are concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para19"></a>There are about two or three parades a year in Bellaghy, another concerned residents' flashpoint. Again, I found it very disheartening that the Poppy Day parade this year has been dragged into political considerations. Does one have a parade there? Does one say, "You can have your 12th July parade, but you are not allowed to have your Poppy Day commemoration parade"? Can you do a trade-off in that area?
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para20"></a>The geography of Northern Ireland and the demographic changes that have taken place would make it difficult to have parades. In Belfast we know that parades take place in nationalist areas--the Falls Road, West Belfast, the New Lodge Road and the Ardoyne--and they are restricted to those areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-19_para21"></a>We know that again there is no trade-off in those areas. It is not possible to say to those who are organising opposition parades in West Belfast: "We will let you have those parades there if you don't have parades in Ardoyne". They are all different geographic areas and parades that they hold there will be determined by the people who live in those areas. To try to involve them in an in-depth discussion or analysis of what is a "particular area" will be a difficult job for the commission, but we should not rule out further clarification on that.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="71112-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Alderdice: </B>   I am interested in a number of the comments made by Members of the Committee, particularly about the wording of our amendments. I shall come back to that in a moment. Perhaps I may first comment on some of the things that have been said.
<P>


<a name="column_29"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 29</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-20_para0"></a>The Minister said that if the commission were to make a determination in advance over a period of a year, it would be fettering its decision-making further down the line. He implied that the key issues in making a decision were on matters very much of the time in terms of public order, the atmosphere in the community, the impact on the local community, and so forth. The reality is that when looking at any specific parade, the commission already takes into consideration how many more parades there are to be.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-20_para1"></a>Here I must differ a little from the noble Lord, Lord Fitt. In the Ormeau Road, for example, it is not a question of the one parade that comes across the bridge. It is an issue of a whole series of parades that come across the bridge. In fact, when agreements have been reached, as they have been in one fashion or another, they have been reached in relation to the number of parades that come down through that stretch of the road. I entirely agree with the noble Lord when he says that it would be futile for us to get into speculation about when an area is an area, and when a "particular area" is a "particular area". Noble Lords may be assured that in Northern Ireland there is no lack of creative capacity in constructing argument and debate on such matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-20_para2"></a>However, the reality is that in our proposition we are simply making it possible for the commission to take these matters into consideration if it is appropriate. I believe that there is a fair appreciation of what areas are specific areas and what areas are contentious.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-20_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Fitt, refers to areas round Portadown. I have visited and talked with folk there and they made it clear to me that the impact not just of parades but of prayer meetings in the open air on a bridge--one such meeting stopped a parade last year--and so forth, does transfer across. There are, of course, malign individuals, as we know, who will want to refer to what is happening in a totally different area as justification for what they are doing. But any reasonable person and reasonable commission would rule that out of order in much the same way as the authorities ruled out of order any tinkering with the Royal British Legion parade in Bellaghy. All the residents accepted that that was truly the case anyway.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-20_para4"></a>Although it may seem otherwise, therefore, there is not yet a total lack of reasonableness in Northern Ireland, and I trust that there will continue to be sufficient for our commission to operate in a reasonable fashion.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-20_para5"></a>I am somewhat puzzled by the view expressed that it is likely to be in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights to put on the face of the Bill that the commission could make such determinations, but at the same time would not be in contravention of the ECHR for the commission itself to publish guidelines that indicated that that was precisely what it intended to do. It seems to me that there is bound to be a problem if at first one simply maintained the position that it would be an informal view and therefore not fettering the discrimination and judgment of the commission. I can guarantee that an informal view would not be satisfactory to some people in the area. It is merely inviting further pressure on the commission to <P>


<a name="column_30"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 30</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ensure that its informal view stated on one occasion is not transferred into the opposite formal view at a later occasion, so making the situation much worse than if it had not expressed a view at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-20_para6"></a>The commission must be able to consider everything and then make a decision which is tolerably binding. If it issues an informal view it is likely that it will simply come under further pressure. On the other hand, if guidelines implicitly indicate that the commission is capable of looking at the pattern of parades, as the noble Lord, Lord Cope, mentioned, and that is not in contravention of the ECHR, then I cannot see how, if they explicitly indicate that, they would be in contravention. That seems to me to be a somewhat extraordinary position, though it may be entirely legally correct.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-20_para7"></a>In view of those matters, and in view of the indications from other Members of the Committee (which I take seriously) that the wording of the amendments we put forward are not perfect--that I entirely accept--we would certainly be prepared to re-visit the wordings that we have made. I also urge other Members of the Committee, particularly the Minister and his colleagues, to re-visit the question and look at other possible forms of wording rather than simply say that this wording is not immaculate and therefore they dismiss the whole notion.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, I accept what my noble friend said in relation to my mention of the area of the Ormeau Road. The contentious area in the Ormeau Road is the Ormeau Bridge, and the noble Lord has already said that there are a number of parades scheduled to take place there. The reason why the parades take place there is that some people want to cause contention in that area. Is the noble Lord suggesting that here we can have a trade-off? Is he saying that the commission could say to the organisers of those Orange parades, because they are the parades that cause the trouble, "You have four or five parades scheduled to go over the Ormeau Bridge, and every one of them is liable to cause a great deal of dissent. If we allow you to have two of them, will you do away with the other three"? If that question is put to the organisers of that parade, the concerned residents of the Ormeau Road will also have to be asked, "Would you permit two of those parades rather than the five or six which have been scheduled?". Would that be a legitimate trade-off on the part of the commission?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Alderdice: </B>   Far be it from me to propose a solution to the Ormeau Road, or to any other problem in the area. The issue that the noble Lord has begun to open up and unpack for us is the possibility that a whole series of flexible agreements might be possible in terms of whether one went down to the bridge and then re-routed another way; or went down to the bridge and over the bridge; or went over the bridge and did not play with the band; or went over the bridge and played a hymn tune, and so forth. There are enormous possibilities. But the point the noble Lord addressed is the fact that it would have to be with consultation with those who lived further down. If we simply stay back <P>


<a name="column_31"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 31</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in a position of consultation, as the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux of Killead, has already said, we find the number of parades increasing and increasing.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-20_para8"></a>Northern Ireland has had the extraordinary capacity to increase the number of traditional parades by some 50 per cent. in the past couple of years--traditional parades. It does not take as long as one might imagine for things to become a tradition in Northern Ireland. There are those who have now made it traditional to picket a Catholic church in Harryville and that has taken less than a year; it has taken only a few weeks. We want to defuse all of that and so we will happily revisit the wording; but I appeal to colleagues, to other Members of the Committee and to the Government also to re-visit that notion and not simply set it aside on the basis that our wording was indeed not perfect.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I appreciate what the noble Lord has just said, but I can assure him that it is not on the technicality of the wording that I am unhappy about the amendment. I am unhappy about the new clause proposed by the noble Lord because we think it is fundamentally flawed. We have spent many, many months considering this point. It was not easy for us to come to the view that it is proper to depart in this particular respect from the North Report. We did so only after thorough scrutiny and much thought and much attention to the detail. I do not want to sound as if our minds are closed, but I assure the noble Lord that we have thought very hard indeed over a long period of time about this issue, and I am not sure that any change in the wording of the amendment will deal with the fundamental problem of principle.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Alderdice: </B>   Could I press the noble Lord on the particular point on which I requested clarification? How might such a power be implicit in the legislation and within the remit of the commission, yet to make it explicit would be to make it in contravention of the ECHR? It seems to me that the noble Lord, Lord Cope, was under the impression--one which I share to some extent--that the power to do this was implicit. Perhaps that is incorrect.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I am not quite sure whether the words "implicit" or "explicit" apply to the point I am about to make, but let me make it anyway. I refer to the procedural rules, and I made some mention of them when I spoke previously. Those rules make it clear that the commission will want to issue initial views about the position it is minded to take about marches, and that can be some time ahead. They differ from what the noble Lord wants in that those initial views will not be legally binding, but I would have thought they would provide a certain level of assurance about the commission's long-term approach, even though, when the commission comes to make its determination in a particular instance nearer the time, that determination will not necessarily be in line with the initial views. At that point the commission will have more information that will enable it to take all the factors into account. <P>


<a name="column_32"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 32</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, in terms of setting out the views initially and over the longer term, the commission will be able to do that but, I repeat, not on a legally binding basis.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </B>   Could I interpose before the Minister sits down and press him again on this point? Is he saying--and I will put it in my own words--that, if there were wording to the effect that in making individual determination the commission shall bear in mind the possibility of a local pattern or package, that would be acceptable?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I think I would want to consider the implications of that if the noble Lord tables an amendment. What we do not want to do is to proceed in a way which fetters the commission's discretion or in any way leaves us open to a breach of the European convention. We are dealing with basic freedoms here and these are very fundamental issues for the community. If the noble Lord tables the amendment, I would want to think hard about the implications.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Alderdice: </B>   We wish to consider whether an alternative wording might be more helpful and we will revisit it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para0"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para1"></a>Clause 2 agreed to.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para2"></a>Clause 3 [Functions of the Commission in relation to other expressions of cultural identity]:
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley </B>   moved Amendment No. 4:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 2, line 14, leave out ("wholly or partly open to the air").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 4 and Amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7, which it is suggested we should discuss with it, bring us back to Clause 3 which we discussed earlier. During that discussion, I pressed the Minister for a little more of the Government's thinking as to what other expressions of cultural identity might be covered by Clause 3 and hence might be considered by the commission. The Minister said that the Committee would understand why he was reluctant to get drawn into this subject. I understand that he would be very reluctant to get drawn into a very different area, but that is not quite what the Minister meant. He meant that he did not want to fetter the hands of the commission by stating in advance the expressions of cultural interest which it might look at. I understand that, and the court case of Pepper v. Hart makes Ministers extremely cautious about what they say on such occasions which might later be used in courts of law and elsewhere to draw a meaning out of the Bill which is not on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para4"></a>Nevertheless, it seemed to me when I read the clause that there was some very precise wording both left in and left out to which presumably, as the Minister was saying in respect of the previous amendment, careful consideration was given by the Government and by the legislative draftsmen. These amendments press the Government to tell us at least why various items have been included or excluded from the things that the commission may consider.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para5"></a>Amendment No. 4 relates to the phrase,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"wholly or partly open to the air". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_33"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 33</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para6"></a>I am not quite sure what "partly open to the air" means; presumably part of the event in question is inside and part is outside. That seems to me to be odd in itself. In any case, I am not sure that one should limit the commission's discretion to look into things wholly to things that are out of doors. There are some extremely contentious expressions of cultural identity that take place indoors at meetings of one sort or another, often fully reported outside with the aid of television and so on and extremely offensive to people of a different persuasion. It might be that the commission would think that some of those indoor meetings were just as much to be looked into as outdoor meetings that happened to be held in a field instead of a hall.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para7"></a>It seems to be that at least some explanation needs to be given there. I appreciate that the amendment would very much widen the duties of the commission under Clause 3 because all sorts of additional matters would need to be considered. I therefore proposed Amendment No. 5, at least ruling out services held in a recognised place of worship. In the presence of the noble Lord, Lord Eames, I wish to emphasise that I was anxious that the commission should not be given the duty of inquiring into whether Church services are expressions of cultural identity that offend people, although, sadly, the fact is that the cultural identities in Northern Ireland are often expressed in terms of the religious denomination to which people belong.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para8"></a>There is, incidentally, nothing exclusive about this kind of division causing difficulties. People sometimes think in this country that Northern Ireland is unique in having such difficulties. When they do, I point out to them that the keys of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, one of the holiest places in the world to any Christian, have traditionally been kept by a Moslem family. The Christian denominations cannot agree who should keep the keys because it would imply ownership of the church, and they have been kept by the same Moslem family since around 600 AD, which is a very long time indeed. Some of the problems between different parts of the Christian Church, therefore, go back even further than they do in Northern Ireland. Nevertheless, an outdoor service, as I understand it at the moment, could be held to be an expression of cultural identity and might give rise to the commission looking into it under Clause 3 as it is worded.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para9"></a>One of the most contentious areas is sporting events. I have drawn attention to this in Amendment No. 6. We all know that sporting events can also be a clear expression of cultural identity and the events themselves, and certainly the events surrounding a sporting occasion, can give offence and cause difficulty to other people.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para10"></a>The notes on clauses, which were helpfully made available to us before we came, contain an error in this respect. I am sure it is a mistake rather than anything else. But in relation to Clause 3 they say that subsection (3) provides,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that this section does not apply to public processions or sporting events which are covered by the provision of the rest of the Bill". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para11"></a>Of course, public processions are covered by the provisions in the rest of the Bill but sporting events are not. Sporting events are unique in being left out of the <P>


<a name="column_34"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 34</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provisions both in Clause 2 that cover processions for the commission to make determinations and in Clause 3 for the commission to look at and make recommendations as to any changes there might be in the law. In the context of Northern Ireland, that is not a balanced provision if Clause 3 is to exist at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para12"></a>Lastly, in Amendment No. 7 I have drawn attention to the painting of property. At Second Reading a good deal of mention was made of gable ends with King Billy painted on them in some places and the Pope in other places, and with paramilitaries of both sorts represented on different gable ends in different parts. We all also know of the kerbstones being rather gaily painted but nevertheless in a definite expression of cultural identity--either red, white and blue or green and white. If the commission is to involve itself in whether a particular gable end, or gable ends in general, should be painted, in whatever direction, it will get into a good deal of trouble.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Fitt, said at Second Reading that he would not give much for the chances of the person whose duty it was to paint out a picture either of King Billy or of anybody else who might be thought undesirable on a gable end. I agree with the noble Lord in that. I have therefore suggested that we should take out the painting of property to rule out both these types of things. Of course, it can be offensive, and some of the individual graffiti, never mind the more artistic efforts, can be offensive to people, and they are certainly expressions of cultural identity as we understand the words. I would personally wish to rule them out from the commission's powers under Clause 3.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para14"></a>All these four amendments seek to press the Government more as to what the commission will be expected to look at under Clause 3, if we pass it. This runs alongside the debate we had earlier as to whether Clause 3 should exist in this Bill. We are not trying to fetter the commission, except by precise wordings that might be added to the Bill--it will be at its discretion. But if we had a better idea as to what the commission might look at, we would have a better idea as to whether Clause 3 would add balance to the Bill, and we want a balanced Bill. That is why it is important that, if possible, the Minister can give us more indication of what was in the Government's mind in preparing this clause, particularly about the four matters to which I have drawn attention in the four amendments. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   I wonder whether the Minister would be in a position to give us a definition as to what was meant by the section about open-air events and whether he intended to include, perhaps on the advice of the authorities, some measures to control what are called festivals but which take the form of the installation of loudspeakers which can be clearly heard at least one mile away. The sinister thing about that is that it is not entertainment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para15"></a>What happens, and I have checked on this myself with my own hearing, is that a republican song--I am just taking that side; there is no doubt it works both ways--is played over this loudspeaker system and the announcer says, "This is dedicated to John Smith, <P>


<a name="column_35"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 35</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>number such and such Whitewell Road, and John Smith had better pay heed to what befalls the person concerned in the verse because he will suffer the same fate very soon", meaning he will be shot fairly soon. I know it sounds rather facetious, but it is a real concern to law-abiding people of both communities living in the areas selected for this type of action. My understanding is that there is a loophole in the existing law and I wonder whether the Minister might undertake to consider it. He may not be able to get an undertaking, but it would be a help to know whether those so-called festivals are included within the meaning of that phrase.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-21_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </B>   I am inclined to support the noble Lord's amendments but on the grounds that they are trying to make the best of a bad job and the bad job is Clause 3. The longer this discussion goes on, the more apparent it is that the Government are in an impossible dilemma. On the one hand, they say it is up to the commission to arrive at a definition of cultural identity; they cannot possibly do that--yet we know very well that the commission does not want to do that. The commission does not want to be landed with this task of defining cultural identity because it is a poisoned chalice; and this short discussion indicates just how difficult the matter is.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-21_para16"></a>Having generally supported the amendments, not least because they expose the problems with Clause 3, I am not sure I followed--perhaps it is my fault--the reasons why the noble Lord, Lord Cope, wanted to leave out "or sporting events". It seems to me particularly undesirable that sporting events are sucked into this terrible definition of cultural identity. Certainly from these benches we do not want sporting events to become the subset of cultural identity; sport is sport. Although I know traditionally there are arguments about Irish sports and other sports, if we end up with Clause 3 in its present form--which I would very much regret--I hope that we do not throw on to the commission the yet further burden of defining which sporting events are not just sport but manifestations of cultural identity.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lyell: </B>   I apologise for the fact that I was not with noble Lords at Second Reading but I was at what is always known as the second city of the empire, in Glasgow.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para0"></a>I follow on from what the noble Lord said about sporting events. Indeed, where might the sporting events take place? I can tell the Minister--I am sure he is aware; the noble Lord, Lord Fitt, will certainly be aware--that a major sporting event took place last week in the city of Glasgow. Usually it involves both sport and cultural identity, and it is certainly way outside Northern Ireland. I do not know whether it is beyond the scope of the Bill; should it be beyond the scope of the commission? I refer of course to the happy, four times a year meeting of the Celtic Rangers, the result of which can give rise to scenes of considerable disorder in the Province.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para1"></a>Indeed, the noble Lord said that sporting events are inextricably intertwined: if you play Gaelic games, that is a strong assertion of your culture. I had always <P>


<a name="column_36"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 36</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expressed a wish in my career in Northern Ireland to play Gaelic sports, and noble Lords, and indeed the Minister, will know very well what the reply was.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para2"></a>My noble friend's amendment enters very much into my thoughts about the Bill before us and the discussions of the Committee. Sporting events look quite harmless but I am sure the Minister will understand that they are not.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Fitt: </B>   As time goes on, it will become clearer and more evident that the clause should never have been included in the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Cope, has already said that even from his side of the Committee he finds it very difficult to understand the full ramifications. If one wanted to be less than serious one could say that in the amendment he has moved to exclude sporting events, and the Government have included sporting events. In view of all the facts relating to Formula One that we have been reading about over the past few days, has any subscription to be made to any of the major parties in Northern Ireland in relation to sporting events?
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para3"></a>It can clearly be seen that to implement any of this will cause turmoil in Northern Ireland. The noble Lord, Lord Cope, has put down amendments relating to public processions and sporting events. That can be related to the winning of a match, or attendance at a football match or a Gaelic match; but when does a procession become a parade, and when does a parade become a procession? The Government will find great difficulty in determining what is a parade and what is a procession.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para4"></a>As I said on the Second Reading of the Bill in relation to this question of expressions of cultural identity which take place wholly or partly in the open air, in Northern Ireland the flying of a flag is an expression of a cultural identity, and I referred to the flags and emblems Bill which we had in Northern Ireland. People conversing in any particular area might see one or half a dozen Union Jacks at a distance, or a half dozen tricolours at a distance. If it offends their cultural identity, do they make representation to the commission to have those flags removed? Who removes them? If they are removed by the police it immediately throws the police again into the cauldron of sectarian politics in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para5"></a>In relation to this whole business of wholly or partly in the open air, how do you determine what is right? Could you paint either King William or the Pope on a gable wall? Does it have to be done in the open air? It cannot be done at two or three o'clock in the morning; it has to be done during the hours of daylight, although some graffiti has been done in the early hours of the morning. That is an expression of cultural identity again. Carrying it to its most laughable extent, there is the red, white and blue of the kerbstones. People traversing from one Protestant area to another, and I am thinking particularly of County Antrim, can pass through from Ballycastle to Coleraine and see two different expressions of paintings on gables in Coleraine and in Ballycastle and in Dunloy and in Armoy. Does the commission have the power under Clause 3 to prevent either the painting of those gable walls, or, if the gable walls had been painted, to make sure that they are erased because they offend one section of the community?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para6"></a>It is very difficult for the Government in any way to implement Clause 3, and I would ask the Minister why it was included in the Bill. What representations were made to the Government? Was it included with the intention of balancing the Bill, recognising that the main thrust of the Bill was aimed at the Protestant or Orange cultural identity so something had to be included in the Bill which would show that it was not one-sided or biased but reflected impartiality and neutrality? If that was the intention, it has signally failed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para7"></a>I do not think there is any necessity for Clause 3 in this Bill, and any reasonable Member, either of this Committee or who lives in Northern Ireland, will see that this Bill was brought before your Lordships' Committee to deal specifically with trouble that had been brought about by contentious parades. That was the reason for this Bill being brought to this Committee, and why it will be brought to the other end of the building. You could have dealt with what we call republican parades, or Irish nationalist parades. They would all come within the context of this Bill. But in relation to all the other issues contained in Clause 3, I do not believe the provisions will ever be implemented. If you bring a bad law to the statute book, you will have every sore head in Northern Ireland bringing grievances to the political arena. People will use Clause 3 to invent grievances. Many inventive minds in Northern Ireland will see something as provocative because they want to be provocative. They want to be provoked. Clause 3 gives them every indication that if they do so they will get away with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para8"></a>I urge the Minister to consider this clause again; it will not mean anything in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   I apologise that I was not present at the Second Reading debate. I was elsewhere on committee business.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para9"></a>I feel deeply concerned about Clause 3. I dislike the thought of sporting events being brought into the Bill. During the nine years I spent on the Sports Council, and the 20 or more years I have been involved with sport in Northern Ireland, we have done our best to keep sporting events and sport out of the political arena. It would be a great tragedy if it were sucked in by this provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para10"></a>I take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley, about painted gable and painted kerbs, abortions that they are--sometimes artistic, but nevertheless abortions. To place the responsibility on the commission to decide what is right and wrong is like trying to make choices of which painting should go to the National Art Gallery. It would be totally impossible.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para11"></a>Clause 3 as it stands is inadequate to do the job that we clearly think that it should do. Were I ever to be a member of that commission I should be concerned as to how I could honestly do the work requested of the commission in relation to expressions of culture and identity.

<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para12"></a>This is a good Bill. It is a necessary Bill in relation to parades. It would be a pity to contaminate or overload the commission by giving it a task which at this stage seems to be verging on the impossible.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Eames: </B>   I have hesitated to take part in this discussion for obvious reasons. However, I believe that discussion on Clause 3 is the opportunity for me to say something on an issue which has concerned me greatly as I have watched the development of the Bill. I apologise that I, too, was unable to be present at Second Reading. However, I hope what I have to say is relevant to the present discussion.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para13"></a>First, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Cope of Berkeley, as regards religious services. That will not surprise him. I wish to express to the Minister a deep concern as one who has found himself in the cock pit of all that the Bill is set to ameliorate.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para14"></a>Secondly, with the other Church leaders in Northern Ireland, I have found myself on several occasions attempting to negotiate solutions to individual parades. My concern is based on my thoughts since the North Report became public. In the growing expansion of details being given to the commission, there is a real danger that what is initially essential to the life of Northern Ireland will deteriorate because of the vast amount of detail that the commission will be asked to address.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para15"></a>I took the simplistic view, not just as a Church leader but as a lawyer, that the commission would deal as fairly as possible with this cancer which is the sectarian aspects of public processions. I took the view, perhaps naively at the beginning, that the commission was being given a specific task. I respected that task, and I encouraged it. Now I find, as I listen to this discussion, as I read the debate in Hansard, the commission's remit is growing, growing, growing. It is going into areas of concern where the sensitivities cannot even be described in speech. They have to be felt on the ground, they have to be experienced by those who are involved and by those who have a part in them. I am sorry to take up the Committee's time in expanding this theory under Clause 3, but this is the crucial point in the discussion.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para16"></a>If we allow our party continually to expand the remit given to this important commission, we will regret it. I also believe that it will become a mockery on both sides of our religious and political divide if it is not seen to be addressing the essentials of our problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para17"></a>I have referred in public to a cancer of sectarianism, and that cancer is equally shared on both sides of our community. I believe in my heart that this commission can make a definite contribution to relieving that cancer. It will not solve it all but it can take us along the way. If that is to be the vision of this commission, what I believe is happening now is that by constantly expanding the area of its remit we are going to dilute it so much in the perception of the people of Northern Ireland that it will lose very much of the potential and the vision that I believe it ought to have.

<a name="column_39"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 39</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, proposed earlier. I do not think that tinkering with the words will achieve a desirable result, although the noble Lord, Lord Cope, made the best of a bad job.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para18"></a>I should like to make one brief point. The Minister said in his earlier comments that it is not the Government's role to start telling the commission what expressions of cultural identity are. It is not the Government's role to start giving examples, and that is just what the clause is doing: it is flagging up a definition and going into detail. There is no end to this path if you start going down it, and it is very dangerous. What the clause proposes is completely contrary to what the Minister said earlier.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-22_para19"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Holme, said, this is an unnecessary bolt-on, and I hope that the Minister will seriously reconsider, particularly what is said in line 17. As most of us know, there is a long history in Ireland of sporting events and clubs being used for political purposes, and it is unfortunate if sporting events are introduced into the Bill in any form. I do hope that the Minister will seriously reconsider Clause 3.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I thank the many Members of the Committee who have spoken in this debate on all sides of the argument. May I try to deal with some of the specific points that have been raised before dealing with the main issue of principle.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-23_para0"></a>If I may take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, first, it was a question about threats issued by loudspeakers which could be heard some distance away. I am certainly happy to look into that. My first inclination is to think that that sort of reprehensible behaviour would already be covered by existing legislation, namely by public order legislation dealing with provocative or threatening conduct or intimidatory behaviour. If that is so, I shall be able at a later stage to assure the noble Lord; if it is not so, we will have to think again. But I will look into what he has said.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-23_para1"></a>I should make it clear at the outset that under Clause 3 the commission has one power in keeping under review these expressions of cultural identity; that is to make recommendations to the Secretary of State. That is the sum total of the powers that Clause 3 will give to the commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-23_para2"></a>Secondly, within Clause 3 it is made clear that we are concerned with those expressions of cultural identity that have an adverse impact on relationships within the community. I would suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Cope, that some of the examples that he has introduced by way of amendment would be unlikely to have an adverse impact on relationships within the community because of the nature and locations he has described. It is important to know what are the powers of the commission and the fact that they are limited to those expressions that have an adverse impact on relationships within the community. Therefore, as the clause now stands, sporting events are specifically excluded--it says so very clearly--and they would only be included if the noble Lord's amendments were to be accepted.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-23_para3"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Rathcavan, who is concerned with sporting events, gets dragged into this, I can assure him that if he does not support the amendment he will keep sporting events out of it. I appreciate nevertheless that many noble Lords are concerned about the point which the noble Lord, Lord Eames, made about putting too much of a burden on the commission and diluting its main task. That is why this clause will not come into effect until the commission has had a chance to deal with its main task for several months. It will not be an immediate responsibility of the commission to take on board the extra responsibility in Clause 3.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-23_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Fitt, asked me why we had Clause 3 in the Bill. But indeed he answered the question: it is to achieve a sense of balance. We want to persuade the whole of the community in Northern Ireland, of both traditions, that the Bill is even-handed. We want to do this in such a way that we will achieve wider support for the Bill than we would have if it were perceived to be unbalanced and only had an impact on one section of the community and not on the other. That is the sole purpose. The noble Lord may think we have not achieved that end, but that is our proper aim.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-23_para5"></a>Let me now deal with the specific points in the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Cope. Clearly, they would imply quite a considerable extension of the commission's remit. I would suggest that some of these extensions would be into areas which would not be helpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-23_para6"></a>On the definition of a public place, for example, we have been careful to restrict it to remain as close as possible to what the ordinary man or woman in the street would understand by it. If the noble Lord's amendment were accepted, the committee would realise that the sort of public places covered would involve not only churches, as the noble Lord recognised in a subsequent amendment, but also, say, concert halls or pubs. The commission would then be required to consider manifestations of cultural identity which may take place in, say, a pub in an area solidly of one tradition or the other. Being realistic, we have to recognise that quite a lot of cultural manifestations in those areas would not pass muster if they were taking place in a public space shared by those of both traditions. Similarly, it seems bizarre to cover cultural manifestations which may take place in a hall which those present had chosen to attend or to which they had even paid admission. If they did not like what they were going to hear or see, they would not need to attend, and I would think that in the situation in Northern Ireland they would not attend.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-23_para7"></a>The last amendment relates to the painting of property. I know many noble Lords have expressed reservations about how the commission could really get to grips with problems like kerbstones and murals, and this has been a thread running through the discussions on this clause. If the commission is to have an extended remit, and I recognise that opinions are divided on this subject, it would be strange to exclude those manifestations of cultural identity which are perhaps most obvious and may have the greatest potential for causing offence. That is not to say that the Government are indicating to the commission that that is what they should do as regards Clause 3, but simply that by <P>


<a name="column_41"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 41</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>excluding the painting of property we would be unduly restricting the effect of Clause 3 in a way which might go against its intentions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-23_para8"></a>The noble Lord also proposes to introduce sporting events. We left out sporting events after some thought. First, we do not want to politicise sport. Secondly, while the event may take place in the open air, it too is an activity which people are entitled to take or leave as they wish. Nobody is forcing anyone to watch Linfield play football or attend a GAA match. What we are seeking to achieve by the new remit is ideas and proposals on how to ensure that cultural manifestations in shared public space can be regulated so that they do not give offence to those of the opposing tradition.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-23_para9"></a>There has been considerable discussion of the clause, and I am aware that views are divided. All I would say is that the Government will listen and take account of what has been said here this afternoon. I cannot go further than that, but we will scrutinise the contributions that have been made to the debate and we will think hard about the implications of what has been said. At this stage, I cannot say more than that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, he has in a sense just given the game away. He said he did not want sport to be politicised. The implication is that everything else will be politicised, and that is precisely the issue which has concerned most of the noble Lords who have spoken this afternoon. They are putting into an arena of contention, of analysis, of adjudication, things which are part of the tapestry of life in Northern Ireland. Then the Government, and we can all understand what they are trying to do, are attempting to reach an accommodation that allows the unionists to say, "There is something for us in it". I am sceptical, incidentally, if that is the case, because they are very hard on many of the traditional practices of unionists in Northern Ireland. But let us assume that that was the Government's motive in doing it.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-23_para10"></a>The effect in the Bill of the Government in trying to reach that accommodation is to put the whole onus of picking up the pieces after the Government on to the wretched commission, which has a big enough problem trying to deal with parades. I am pleased to hear the noble Lord say the Government will think about it and I hope they will think about it very hard.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-23_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   We have had a further interesting debate on the principles behind Clause 3, as well as on the detail of the amendments, and I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he will reflect on what has been said in our debates today. I do not want to add much more at this point, but he said that the Government do not want to politicise sport, and of course I agree with that as a principle, but it is far too late in the case of the GAA. It has been highly political for a very long time, and if he doubts that he should look at the rules of the GAA, particularly those which refer to members of the RUC, for example, who are not permitted to join in any circumstances. That is obviously a highly political rule.

Page 2, line 20, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "71112-23_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: As a parliamentarian of some 27 years, I have a natural horror of untidiness in drafting legislation. I am not accusing the draftsmen in this case because no doubt they were under a number of pressures.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-23_para15"></a>It is true that subordinate legislation is frequently used by departments in phasing implementation of sections of wide-ranging legislation where there is need for what one might call a timed sequence. In this Bill there appears to be no good reason for two separate commencement dates. That is my elementary instinct, but it may be that, given the opposition to Clause 3 in its entirety, the need for any amendment such as mine may be removed. Although I move it, I shall not press it to a conclusion. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   In tabling the amendment, the noble Lord seeks to commence immediately Clause 3 of the Bill, which extends the remit of the Parades Commission to include expressions of cultural identity other than parades and sporting events. I acknowledged in my speech introducing the Bill that we have added this provision to it in recognition of the widely expressed concerns that the commission would focus too narrowly on parades, in practice, of course, the predominant form of cultural expression of one side of the community.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-23_para16"></a>It is our view that to include at the outset this very considerable additional burden to the commission as it begins the difficult task of considering and deliberating upon parades would be to ask too much of its members, dedicated though they have shown themselves to be. No one can yet know just how the commission will in practice take forward its responsibilities, and the Government consider that a bedding-in period is desirable to allow the commission to establish itself in its new role.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-23_para17"></a>The timing of the Bill coming into effect will not give us very long before the marching season commences, and to give the commission this additional responsibility from the outset might well detract it from paying full attention to the parades. I am not therefore happy that we should seek to fetter the power of the commission to deal with parades in the first instance by putting these other responsibilities upon it.

<P>

<A NAME = "71112-24_para1"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 3 shall stand part of the Bill?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Alderdice: </B>   We have had a fairly full debate on this issue and I have to say that I fully expect that we shall be revisiting it even as we continue our discussions; that is already clear. Before withdrawing my objection on the understanding that the Government have indicated their preparedness to look very seriously at this matter, I mention one further matter which has come out of some of the comments of the Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-24_para2"></a>The Minister made it clear that one major concern about the other amendments that I and my noble friend put forward is the conflict with the European Convention on Human Rights. I am concerned to ensure that there is no conflict in the legislation. I put it to the Minister that he may very well have a problem with Clause 3, because the ECHR enshrines the right to express cultural identity. If Clause 3 stands part of the Bill, it is quite possible that that right will effectively be removed, not just for an individual or a group in an area for a specific circumstance, but in general terms over a certain area. There is a difference between adverse aspects of relationships and the denial of rights because they impact, or potentially impact, as an infringement of someone else's rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-24_para3"></a>The Government's lawyers will need to look carefully at whether handing to the commission not just the right to make representation back to the Secretary of State with its advice but the fact that it will be expected effectively to give advice is in contravention of the ECHR. Of course, it may be the case that there is no real intention to introduce the clause. However, that would be an entirely unfortunate way to proceed with a piece of legislation--including for political purposes something which one specifically did not want to find oneself acting upon--and I cannot see that the Government could possibly wish to proceed in that way.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   Perhaps I could just comment on the noble Lord's point about the European Convention on Human Rights. The action that would be taken as a result of whatever the commission recommends under Clause 3 would be for the Secretary of State to consider the commission's recommendations. Therefore, it would be up to the Secretary of State to take or not to take whatever action she saw fit, and I am absolutely certain that she would take the requirements of the European Convention into account in deciding what action to take. However, the onus would be on the Government through the Secretary of State to make sure that we comply with the European convention. I do not think the commission could be in breach of the convention <P>


<a name="column_44"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 44</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>merely for making a recommendation to the Secretary of State. It would be the action that the Government took that would determine whether we were in breach of the convention. I can assure the noble Lord that we believe very much in the European convention, as does he, and we do not want to find ourselves in breach of it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Alderdice: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that point. It does rather seem to confirm that the commission might be encouraged to consider all these contentious issues and make doubly contentious recommendations only with the possibility that the Secretary of State would be in a position to declare herself completely unable to proceed with the legislation and with the empowerment because it would contravene ECHR. Perhaps the Minister will come back to that at a later stage. At this point I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 2, line 26, at end insert ("or a counter-demonstration to a public procession").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "71112-24_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: The North review body has been mentioned favourably many times this afternoon and was very clear in its thinking. In all my contact with the members of that body it was clear that they were determined that where a procession had been approved, any person attempting to obstruct or break up such a public procession should be severely punished. That meant that where the statutory requirement had been met in terms of giving notice in compliance with any changes suggested by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and when all that had been done, they were obstructed sometimes at the last minute by a person or persons--usually persons--very well organised.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-24_para8"></a>When I met the North review body in its very initial stages, I noticed that the members could not understand why such disruptive behaviour had been tolerated in the past. It was something that I could not explain away. I note that the conclusions of the North review body have been reflected in Clause 14, but I am convinced that the recommendation must be included earlier in the Bill, in the code of conduct mentioned in Clause 4, to ensure fairness and balance to all concerned. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-24_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I rise briefly to support the amendment. In discussing parts of the Bill earlier, particularly Clause 3, a large number of us emphasised the desire to achieve balance in the Bill. There are on the Marshalled List a number of occasions when a greater balance can be put into the Bill as it stands, and this is the first of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-24_para9"></a>We all know that processions go wrong not so much when the procession itself takes place but when there is a counter-demonstration. To a great degree it is the counter-demonstration that sets off the trouble. I do not mean to say that the blame is necessarily wholly on one side or the other, but the counter-demonstration is what leads to the trouble and to the police having to get <P>


<a name="column_45"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 45</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>involved, and so on. On many occasions there is no counter-demonstration, even though the parade might be regarded as provocative, either because the police are holding people back sufficiently to make it impossible or not disruptive if it does take place or because those involved do not press it to the point where difficulties arise.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-24_para10"></a>Where there is a counter-demonstration that is serious, that is what leads to the loss of order, which the police then have to do their best to restore. It seems to me, therefore, that this is one of the occasions where balance can be put into the Bill. I support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-24_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   The Minister has just defended the inclusion of Clause 3 in the Bill on the grounds that it will provide an element of balance between the different cultural traditions in the Province. I would have thought that acceptance of amendments like Amendment No. 9 might be a better way of achieving this.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-24_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Alderdice: </B>   The Minister referred earlier to his wish to see other possible balances than Clause 3. I must agree with the two previous noble Lords who have indicated that they see this as one of a number of contexts in which the balance could be provided in a better way than in Clause 3. I am minded, with my colleagues, to support the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux of Killead, in his proposition.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-24_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I am aware that some in the unionist community, and particularly those in the loyal orders, feel that this legislation is excessively targeted at those organising and taking part in public processions. It has been suggested that the thrust of this legislation is that marches are the problem and must somehow be dealt with. Many feel this is unfair and point to the provocation which some marchers have been subjected to. I understand those feelings. It is often clear from scenes of disturbances associated with parades that the fault is not only on one side, and this Government have never attempted to argue the contrary.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-24_para11"></a>The Government are determined that the legislation and the structures established under it should show balance and even-handedness in practice. My only doubts about the amendment are what its practical effects will be. The amendment deals with changing the code of conduct. Breaking the code of conduct does not itself constitute a criminal offence. Many of the things which counter-demonstrators are accused of--for example, blocking roads--are criminal offences in their own right. The purpose of the code of conduct is both to enable march organisers to demonstrate in a practical way that they have taken account in all reasonable ways of the sensitivities of those in areas through which they are passing and to enable the commission in those rare cases where that is not the case to take account of that in future determinations. I am not quite clear what conclusions the commission will be expected to draw from the misbehaviour of protesters. There is a difficulty in terms of how the amendment will work in practice.

<A NAME = "71112-24_para12"></a>The Government are, however, prepared to consider the amendment, or any other ways of enhancing the structures, to ensure that they operate in an even-handed way in practice. I am aware of the technical difficulties of drafting an amendment to achieve that end.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-24_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   The Minister says the code of conduct is designed to enable march organisers to organise their marches in an acceptable way. It seems to me perfectly proper to permit counter-demonstrators to organise counter-demonstrations in an acceptable way in order to make clear their opposition to the particular parade or point of view of it taking place without disrupting it and without necessarily causing a public order difficulty but nevertheless indicating that their point is different from the marchers in a reasonable way. That is why I think the code of conduct should provide for counter-demonstrations as well as for the processions themselves.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="71112-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I understand what the noble Lord is saying--that there is a difficulty because when we are dealing with a march we are dealing with organisers. Therefore, we can have a code of conduct which the organisers would have available to them so that they would know what was expected of them. The trouble is we may not know precisely who the protestors are. Therefore, it is difficult to make available to the protestors the code of conduct when we are not aware of who they are. It is a practical difficulty. The problem is also that if the marchers are in breach of the code of conduct, that will be held against them in the future should they wish to march again.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-25_para0"></a>It is difficult to apply the same principle to protestors because one cannot say, "Here is a code of conduct, and if you protest again this is what the problem will be", because protestors are by definition not organised in a way that marchers are. I am not trying to denigrate what the amendment is seeking to do. I said that the Government would consider it. I am simply pointing out that there are some practical difficulties to doing it precisely in the way the noble Lord who moved the amendment has suggested.

<P>
<A NAME="71112-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   I was just going to respond to say that the Minister is surely aware that counter-demonstrations are often organised; there is an organiser behind them. His name may not be apparent and of course he does not have to give 28 days' notice or whatever that he is going to organise a counter-demonstration. The idea that therefore he will not have a copy of the code of conduct seems to me to be rather naive, if I may say so to the noble Lord. The code of conduct will, after all, be widely available, dealing with both processions and counter-processions if the amendment were carried, and would be known to all sorts of people and I believe would be helpful to those organising peaceful counter-demonstrations.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-25_para1"></a>It is wrong to say that the code of conduct will go only to those people to whom the commission sends it. It will no doubt be available widely in public libraries <P>

<P>
<A NAME="71112-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   As we are all trying desperately to be helpful to each other, I can be helpful to the Minister, with great respect. If he looks at his Clause 14, the offence is stated quite clearly there, and what is more important, the penalty is also stated--Clause 14, page 10 "Breaking up public procession".
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I was just reading Clause 14. I said we would consider the point. I am not sure I can be more helpful than that. I have said we will consider it and I repeat that we will do so. I am just concerned about the precise way of giving effect to what the noble Lord wishes to achieve; that is why we want to consider it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   I could quote the penalty section:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(2) A person guilty of an offence under subsection (1) shall be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or to both". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<A NAME = "71112-25_para2"></a>There are those who believe that that should perhaps be increased, but we will not come to that one for a moment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   Could I respond, not so much on the offence, because we are coming on to the offences in a later amendment, but just to say that one of the reasons I want to consider it is that I want to consider what we already have in Clause 14, assuming that the Committee and Parliament as a whole approve it, in relation to what the noble Lord has attempted to achieve with the amendment we are now discussing, to see whether Clause 14 is sufficient, or whether the further powers might be appropriate. That is again a reason why I want to think about it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-25_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   My purpose in tabling the amendment for an earlier stage in the Bill was to ensure that there was a degree of priority in bringing it forward in the legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-25_para3"></a>In the mood of co-operation existing between all sides of the Committee, I beg to leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 3, line 29, leave out ("28") and insert ("7").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "71112-25_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: Given the degree of co-operation received thus far it would be a pity to spoil it by making a long speech. The reason for our suggesting that "28" should be left out and "7" should take its place is that there is reason to believe that notice as long as 28 days would be a standing temptation to all manner of people to organise that which we have just been discussing, namely counter-measures and all the <P>


<a name="column_48"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 48</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>rest of it. It is not something which would affect many of the organisations of which I am a member because, as has been already said, many of these plans are known and published as far as a year ahead. If all parades, and particularly those in sensitive areas, were required to observe 28 days instead of seven as at present, this could place temptation in the minds of people who were not terribly sympathetic to the maintenance of law and order.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-25_para9"></a>On the second point, processions are customarily held in an area or areas. We have given that a fair amount of coverage in the debates on the amendments moved by the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, and I do not think that it is necessary to go back over that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-25_para10"></a>Amendment No. 12, would add:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a procession to or from a church for or in connection with a service of divine worship". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-25_para11"></a>I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-25_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for his amendments, but we are not happy with them. His suggestion that the proposed period of notice be reduced from 28 days to seven days would do nothing to address the problems presented by such a short period of notice which Dr. North and his review team identified. To take the amendment on board would therefore run counter to the North Report's recommendations, which suggested extending the period of notice to allow information to be made available to the local community and for anyone who might wish to make representations to the commission to do so. That process would be made impossible. The extension of the notice period would also give the commission time properly to assess representations made to it, and enable the RUC to plan the policing of potentially contentious parades.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-25_para12"></a>Neither can I agree with his proposals that parades which may be considered traditional, or which have particular associations with church services, should be exempt from these notice requirements. Surely, if a parade is of long standing, it is generally known from year to year when it will take place in any case. Indeed, one noble Lord said we normally knew 100 years in advance when these parades were to take place. There are, as I hope the noble Lord will recognise, additional difficulties in trying to differentiate in law between parades of long standing and those which are not, and those which have a religious character or otherwise. We are committed to balance and even-handedness in this legislation, and believe that creating privileged categories of parades in this way would run counter to that. I therefore hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw these amendments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-25_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Alderdice: </B>   In a spirit of co-operation and mutual elucidation, upon which the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux of Killead, has remarked, I bring to his attention that were his amendments to proceed--particularly Amendments Nos. 11 and 12, referring to what we would call traditional parades and parades to and from a church--that would mean that the parade at Drumcree would therefore be removed from the remit not once but twice, all in one go. Given that this whole Bill has largely come about through the difficulties <P>


<a name="column_49"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 49</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>there, I am sure that my having pointed that out to the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, it will immediately become clear to him that it would not be the best thing to do to proceed with these amendments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-25_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   In the light of that very helpful advice, and given that I conceded that there were some difficulties, I hope that we can accept that in principle, in an ideal world, this ought to be the position. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="71112-25_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley </B>   moved Amendment No.13:

Page 4, line 38, at end insert ("or
<BR>
(b) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to a fine, or to both").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "71112-25_para15"></a>The noble Lord said: We have been searching for ways in which to improve the balance of this Bill as between those who organise parades and those who break them up, among other balances, but that is the particular balance to which this amendment is addressed. The amendment increases the possible penalties under this part of the Bill so as to make the penalties the same for breaking a procession up and subsequently for organising a wholly illegal procession the same as the penalties for a legal organiser of a procession which breaks the conditions imposed on it by the commission. It seems to me that it is only fair that the potential fine and the potential prison sentence should be the same for those who organise processions which go wrong and for those who break them up. To have a lower limit on the breakers-up of processions seems to me to be unbalanced.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-25_para16"></a>I appreciate that in both cases--that of the organiser of the processions which go wrong in some way, and those who try to break them up--other offences will often be committed, in particular public order offences. Those people may find themselves in greater trouble and liable to longer sentences as a result of the public order offences with which they are charged than from the offences under the Bill. In that sense, the Minister may argue, as he did at Second Reading, that there is no need to have a higher maximum level, but that there is a need to make the Bill balance on the face of it, as well as fairness in having the same fine for the different offences and the same possibility of being sent to prison on indictment for the different offences.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-25_para17"></a>I am aware that the disparity between the two levels of sentencing for the different offences reflects precisely the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987. There is the difference in the existing order. However, that is not necessarily a reason for continuing the difference if it is unfair and unbalanced. We should not be so hidebound by tradition that we feel it necessary to carry forward the offences from one document to another just because they have existed in the old document. It seems to me that it was probably wrong in the 1987 order to have different levels of punishment for the corresponding offences. But it seems to me that it would <P>


<a name="column_50"></a>

<B>12 Nov 1997 : Column 50</B></P>

<A NAME="71112-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </B>   I have great sympathy for the logical case which the noble Lord, Lord Cope, has made. However, the onus is on the Minister to tell us whether there is a reason other than the precedent of the 1987 order for this apparent disparity which gives confused signals if the wrecker of the peace is let off more lightly than another.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Cope, but it seems to me that the penalties outlined in the Bill in Clause 7 are precisely identical to the maximum penalty imposed in Clause 14:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or to both", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-26_para0"></a>would appear in both clauses.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Cope of Berkeley: </B>   If the noble Lord refers to page 4, line 38, he will see that six months' imprisonment is the punishment there, and on the next page, page 5, the bottom line reads:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(b) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to a fine, or to both". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112-26_para1"></a>There is, of course, another way of doing it, as proposed in another pair of amendments to be moved later by the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux. Instead of increasing both punishments, as my amendment suggests, to two years, the noble Lord being a more merciful man, has decreased the punishments to six months' imprisonment in both cases. We are both trying to achieve the same level, but we have done it in different directions.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Molyneaux of Killead: </B>   It is true that we did go in slightly different directions, but with the same objective--to secure uniformity in the matter of the penalties. Given that the noble Lord, Lord Cope, is senior to me in terms of service--I have never yet been a member of a government--I shall leave it to him. I propose, with the leave of the Committee, not to move my amendments and to support his.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   I prefer the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux. I know he is not going to proceed with it, but image is everything, as we know in Northern Ireland. It will appear to the public rather draconian to have the possibility of a maximum sentence of two years. I know the maximum is not often imposed, but it is possible, and with an unlimited fine for what is not really a very serious offence, looked at objectively, I would have thought it was better to equalise downwards rather than upwards.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Alderdice: </B>   I was not going to comment at all, but I have to say that when such disruptions lead to losses to the public purse in excess of &#163;20 million or &#163;30 million, it is perhaps not unreasonable that one should consider this as a matter of considerable gravity, and indeed sometimes of course loss of life. It is a matter of considerable gravity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71112w01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   On 9 September 1997, Mrs. Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, suspended UNHCR activities in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on the grounds that DRC actions had made it impossible to carry out their protection mandate. On 5 October the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo issued an order expelling UNHCR from North and South Kivu. Implementation of the expulsion order in South Kivu is uncertain, and UNHCR are seeking written clarification of the situation. We have given full support bilaterally, through the EU and in the UN, to UNHCR efforts to fulfil their mandate in the DRC. At this stage, however, UNHCR regard the negotiation of their re-entry to the country as their own responsibility. A new draft Memorandum of Understanding has been prepared, which UNHCR are currently discussing with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112w01_para0"></a>UNHCR estimate that the original number of DRC refugees in Tanzania was 74,000. Of these, 35,000 had registered for repatriation and 7,000 had been repatriated to the Democratic Republic of the Congo before the suspension of UNHCR operations.

<P>
<A NAME="71112w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Lord Donoughue): </B>  We are continuing to make good progress towards getting this system in place. My honourable friend the Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food announced to the House on 30 July that the organisation responsible for administering the system, the British Cattle Movement Service, (BCMS), will be based in Workington, Cumbria. He also announced subsequently that BCMS will take over responsibility for cattle passports. There are now two further developments to report.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112w01_para1"></a>First, the Government consider it very important for there to be as much reporting of cattle movements to the new cattle traceability database by electronic mail as possible. This should reduce the paperwork burden on businesses which move large numbers of cattle, such as livestock markets and abattoirs. To help such businesses, we are issuing a protocol today for them to follow in order to communicate with the database by e-mail. Copies are being sent to all livestock markets and abattoirs in Great Britain. We very much hope that markets and abattoirs will invest in the relatively small changes needed to their IT systems over the next few months. This work needs to start now if it is to be completed by the time the new computerised system goes live in 1998.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112w01_para2"></a>Second, the Government have decided to charge for the cattle traceability system via cattle passports. Farmers applying for cattle passports will pay a fee which will cover the costs of the new computerised system. This follows consideration of a wide range of alternatives, including charging on the basis of the number of movements for which a business is responsible, charging via eartags, charging at slaughter and charging via an annual registration fee for cattle producers. Charging via passports was chosen because it should be easy to enforce, since cattle without passports cannot go for human consumption. Because it is simple, administrative costs will be kept down, so benefiting industry directly. The fee is expected to be in the range &#163;5 to &#163;10 per animal. The livestock industry will be involved in how this method of charging will be implemented, for example through its representatives on the Project Board which is managing the introduction of the computerised system.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71112w01_para3"></a>These proposals mark a new phase in opening up quangos to public scrutiny and making them more accountable to the people they serve. The Government's devolution policy will help to bring quangos in Scotland and Wales under the proper level of scrutiny that a modern democracy demands. Our purpose is the same for public bodies which operate on a United Kingdom or Great Britain basis, or an England or England and Wales basis. The proposals in the consultation paper will help to achieve this.

<A NAME="71112w01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The information requested falls within the responsibility of the Chief Executive of the Office for National Statistics. I have asked him to arrange for a reply to be given.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112w01_para6"></a>Letter to Lord Acton from the Director of the
Office for National Statistics, Dr. T. Holt, dated
12 November 1997.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112w01_para7"></a>I have been asked to reply, as Director of the Office for National Statistics, to your recent question on the rate of unemployment in May 1997 in various countries.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112w01_para8"></a>Figures based on the internationally recognised International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition of unemployment provide an appropriate basis for international comparisons. The ILO measure of unemployment, as derived from the Labour Force Survey, defines somebody as unemployed if they are: (a) without a job at the time of interview; (b) were available to start work in the two weeks following their interview and
(c) had either looked for work in the four weeks prior to interview or were waiting to start a job they had already obtained. The ILO unemployment rate gives the number of the ILO unemployed as a percentage of the economically active.
<P>

<A NAME = "71112w01_para9"></a>Standardised unemployment rates are published monthly by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). These rates are calculated by taking the latest available ILO measure from each country's Labour Force Survey and projecting the results forward using recent movements in their particular administrative measure (the claimant count in the case of the UK).

<P>

<A NAME = "71112w03_para0"></a>Between 17 and 27 October, 224 Czechs and 59 Slovaks arrived at the Port of Dover. Of these, 110 have been refused entry and removed. The Dover office of the Benefits Agency has received approximately 100 claims from the Czech and Slovak arrivals. A very broad estimate based on estimated average weekly benefit costs for asylum seekers is that the weekly benefit costs of these cases is in the region of &#163;15,000 per week.
Note:
Cost arrived at by using the estimated average weekly benefit cost of asylum applicants: &#163;202.90 for those with dependent children, and &#163;73.20 for those with no dependent children. This is an estimate of average weekly Income Support, Income Based Jobseeker's Allowance, Housing Benefit, and Council Tax Benefit. These figures are based on the Income Support Quarterly Statistical Enquiries for May and November 1996 and the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit Management Information System 1 per cent. sample for May 1996, uprated to 1997-98 prices and benefit levels. Take-up is assumed to be 100 per cent. for those with children, and 85 per cent. for those without (based on the Income Support Quarterly Statistical Enquiry for November 1996, and Home Office figures on the number of outstanding applications at the same date).
