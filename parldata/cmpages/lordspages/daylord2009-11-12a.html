The latest published information can be found on the Home Office website. At 31 October 2009, 27 persons under 18 years of age were detained at Yarl&#146;s Wood. This information is taken from data used for management information only. It is provisional and not subject to the detailed checks that apply for national statistics publications.</p>

Does he further agree that this practice has been condemned by a range of charities, the Chief Inspector of Prisons and the Children&#146;s Commissioner and is a breach of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child? I ask my noble friend in all sincerity to have his department look again at the pilot project that was tried out in Kent a couple of years ago, which his department says failed, but which was never given a chance to succeed, whereby children and families were given accommodation but were not detained.</p>

No one wants to detain children. We do this only if their families have refused to leave the UK voluntarily, despite lots of financial and other support being offered them, and we have to enforce that removal. It is absolutely right that we should protect our borders from false asylum claimants. We detain children with their families because we think it would be worse if we split them from their families. That is why they are kept together. We do this sensitively, our staff are trained and we have to identify children&#146;s needs. We want every child to be as safe and secure as possible. The Kent establishment did not really work. We have now opened a pilot in Glasgow. That is going extremely well but we shall have to see how it settles down. It began in June this year and will run for three years. It is a long-term project, in which 17 families are involved so far. I hope that it is a success, because clearly we would much rather do that than have them in a detention centre.</p>

However, for as long as children are detained in places such as Yarl&#146;s Wood, how will the new duty that has been laid on the Minister to take special care over the conditions of children be discharged, since clearly the conditions which prevail which led to these reports are very unsatisfactory indeed? How will conditions change?</p>

In giving evidence, Sir Al Aynsley-Green said that he had to give credit to that establishment for the improvements that have occurred over four years since the first time he went there. He said that the staff were trying to do well, and he celebrated that, but thought that there might still be some way to go. The IMB report acknowledges the dedication, kindness and patience of the staff involved. We have subjected ourselves to all the guidance about looking after and taking care of children. We are in contact and debating with the Department for Children, Schools and Families. We have debates with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Children, Young People and Families. The statutory guidance is supported by a programme of reform, so we are very much taking these things seriously and it is being implemented in conjunction with all the various people involved with children&#146;s welfare.</p>

Is it not a question of working out a way in which children are not detained at all? Can the Minister confirm that out of those children who are let out of detention with their families, less than half have been removed anyway, and they should not have been detained in the first place?</p>

We have an absolute obligation to this country to maintain a safe and secure border. What happens then is that things are delayed. Why are they delayed? Obviously, for each individual this is a personal tragedy. They want to be in this country; of course they do. I like being in this country. I would rather be here than anywhere else in the world. Lots of people around the world would rather be here, but that does not mean that they all have a right to be here. What they do is obfuscate, make it very difficult to pin down exactly where they have come from and they spin it out. That is why it goes on. I cannot blame them for trying to do that, but we have to bowl it out and take action. This is what happens if we wish to keep the family together, children and adults. I am afraid that that is why we have arrived where we are. We take huge care in trying to look after them.</p>

When the first consultation was announced in 2006, we were told that it would be completed and that legislation would be published early in 2008. In fact, it was not until April 2009, almost two and a quarter years later&#151;at the end of the first consultation&#151;that the second consultation was announced, with no legislation. The consultation took six months as opposed to three, which is normal. Will the Government explain these inordinate delays in responding to a ruling of the European Court?</p>

This is a particularly difficult and complex issue, involving both what we should do and how we would do it when we allow some prisoners to vote. We have completed a second consultation on the enfranchisement of prisoners. It set out a range of options for prisoner enfranchisement based on sentence length, as well as a number of questions on the practical aspects of implementation, which is not easy. We are studying carefully the responses to the second stage and, as I have told the noble Lord on many occasions, we will consider the next step in due course.</p>

The European Court of Human Rights did not say which prisoners should be given the vote. The court held that the blanket ban was unlawful&#151;of course we accept that&#151;but expressly recognised that each member state has some discretion as to who should be given the vote. It is on that basis that the second consultation has been held.</p>

It is a substantial time but, as I have said, these are complex and difficult issues, about which the public also have views. It remains our view that the right to vote goes to the essence of an offender&#146;s relationship with a democratic society and that the removal of the right to vote from some convicted prisoners can be a proportionate and proper response following conviction and imprisonment.</p>

That could be done on the basis that they get the vote but we so contrive an educational system&#151;I use those words, but they are not exactly what I mean&#151;whereby they are introduced to general issues of concern to us all.

This amendment would have placed a requirement in primary legislation that financial sanctions should not be imposed on a single parent with a youngest child under five for failing to undertake work-related activity. In the other place, a government amendment to make affirmative the regulations to which this clause applies was agreed in place of Amendment 2.</p>

<a name="91112-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09111245000069"></a>I shall take a moment to reiterate our position on lone parents and the safeguards that we have incorporated following the valuable discussions that we had in this House. Noble Lords will be aware that our policies for lone parents rely on two key tenets; namely, that work is the best route out of poverty and that parents, especially lone parents, must be allowed to fulfil their responsibilities to their children.</p>

<a name="91112-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09111245000070"></a>We have continued to invest heavily in evidence-based policies over the past 10 years. The changes we have debated in this Bill are a further step forward along that path. We know that combining programmes such  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_904"></a><b>12 Nov 2009 : Column 904</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as the New Deal for Lone Parents with work-focused-interview conditionality increases take-up of support and movements into paid work. Nevertheless, there is still a very significant disparity between the numbers who would like to move into paid work and those who take steps to achieve this. We want to bridge that gap so that we have the potential to make further significant reductions in the numbers of children who still live in poverty and improve those children&#146;s life chances. That is why we want to introduce the measures in this Bill.</p>

<a name="91112-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09111245000071"></a>Over a period of time, lone parents will be prepared for the time when they are able to engage with the labour market and be actively available and looking for work. The gradual steps which we will expect people to take will ensure that preparation for paid work becomes a natural progression by helping lone parents gradually prepare for the workplace by improving their skills and undertaking work-related activity.</p>

<a name="91112-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09111245000072"></a>We feel that preparing for work should become the norm for lone parents with younger children. Indeed, it would be unfair not to encourage them to do so and would risk them being unprepared for the time they start looking for work when their children are older. Lone parents with a youngest child aged under one will be in the &#147;no conditionality&#148; group and will not be required to undertake any mandatory activity unless they want. Lone parents with a youngest child aged between one and two will be required to attend six-monthly mandatory work-focused interviews. We made amendments in this House, which were supported in the other place, to ensure that this policy intention was secured in primary legislation.</p>

<a name="91112-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09111245000073"></a>When the lone parent&#146;s youngest child is aged between three and six, they will be expected to attend three-monthly work-focused interviews and agree an action plan with their adviser which will detail mandatory work-related activity. This action plan will set out their individual route-way to prepare them for work when it is appropriate for them, and will take into account the well-being of their child. We expect that some lone parents with a youngest child aged between three and six will be among the hardest to help, some distance from the labour market and with multiple barriers to employment. If it is to be most helpful, work-related activity should therefore be interpreted broadly to meet their needs.</p>

<a name="91112-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09111245000074"></a>Lone parents and advisers will work together to agree appropriate work-related activity. Given the broad spectrum of activities that count as work-related activity, we would hope that in most cases customers and advisers would be able to agree suitable activity and that these activities can be easily undertaken by lone parents. I should stress that work-related activity is not intended to be an onerous requirement. There will be no daily, or even weekly, requirement to undertake activity; but a minimum of one activity to be undertaken between work-focused interviews, or every three months. This will allow advisers and lone parents flexibility in drawing up the action plans and allow activities to be tailored to take into account not only their individual needs but also the well-being of the child.</p>

<a name="91112-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09111245000075"></a>The nature of the work-related activity will vary with the age of the child and the situation of the parent. For example, after their discussion a parent  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_905"></a><b>12 Nov 2009 : Column 905</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and an adviser may agree that because confidence is low and the lone parent is at the beginning of their journey and some way from the labour market, quarterly attendance at a children&#146;s centre is an acceptable work-related activity as a starting point. At the other end of the scale, a parent who is much more prepared for work may agree with an advisor a more intensive activity, such as attendance at a short part-time course to develop or update work-related skills, perhaps while their child is at school. These agreed activities will act as a starting point for a lone parent&#146;s journey towards work and will be reviewed and built on over time so that when it is appropriate they can progress to further activities that will increase their chances of moving into work when the time is right.</p>

<a name="91112-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09111245000076"></a>Throughout this process, lone parents will not be required to undertake any activity that cuts into time where their child is not normally at school or in formal childcare. For lone parents with a youngest child aged three or four, this would mean that they could restrict the times they can undertake work-related activity to within the hours that locally provided free part-time nursery places are available. However, if a lone parent fails or refuses to undertake such activities without good cause, we would want, as a last resort, the ability to impose a sanction until they comply.</p>

<a name="91112-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09111245000077"></a>As noble Lords are aware, sanctions are very much a last resort and we have outlined on many occasions the sanctions regime we wish to test as part of the Progression to Work model, which moves away from those currently present in jobseeker&#146;s allowance and income support to include a more upfront, in-depth method of engagement with lone parents before a financial sanction is imposed. This will provide extra opportunities for personal advisers to gather further information which may have been missed or not volunteered by the lone parent, and then adapt work-related activity accordingly. This should encourage participation and ensure that lone parents understand what they need to do and the consequences for not doing it.</p>

<a name="91112-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09111245000078"></a>If a lone parent initially fails to take part in a work-focused interview, or to undertake or complete work-related activity without good cause, there will be no financial sanction. Instead, the adviser will discuss any issues the lone parent may have and give them another opportunity to engage. If a lone parent misses two work-focused interviews or has failed to carry out the minimum agreed work-related activity in their action plan over three months, they will be given an opportunity to explain good cause, renegotiate the action plan, or begin the work-related activity. If they fail or refuse to do so, a formal written warning will be issued.</p>

<a name="91112-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09111245000079"></a>After three missed interviews or three failures to take up agreed work-related activity, an individual case review will be done as the next stage of compliance action. This could include home visits for parents and, where necessary, compliance checks. The purpose of this stage is to provide a more in-depth review of the lone parent&#146;s circumstances and the reasons for their failure to comply. Only after this fourth stage will a financial sanction even be considered if they fail to comply, with initial sanctions at a significantly lower level than currently applied. Those lone parents for  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_906"></a><b>12 Nov 2009 : Column 906</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whom there is a very real barrier to their being able to undertake work-related activity will have had the opportunity to explain this long before a sanction is even considered.</p>

<a name="91112-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09111245000080"></a>This model will provide lone parents with more opportunities to comply with the requirements and ensure that they will not face a financial penalty before a full review of their circumstances has been carried out. As now, lone parents will have the opportunity to ask for the sanction decision to be reconsidered, and to appeal the decision. Overall, this approach will provide lone parents with every opportunity to engage with work-related activity and lead to fewer financial sanctions but will provide the necessary backstops to ensure engagement and progression.</p>

<a name="91112-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09111245000081"></a>As I hope noble Lords will agree, requiring lone parents to undertake work-related activity will benefit them and their children in the long-term. It is for this reason that, in the other place, the Government laid an amendment that overturned the amendment made by the noble Lord, Lord Freud. That amendment amended the Bill so that financial sanctions could not be imposed upon a &#147;single&#148; parent in receipt of income support with a child under five if they failed to undertake work-related activity. This amendment would not achieve the purpose I believe it was intended to achieve. &#147;Single&#148; is not defined in social security legislation and as such there is a risk that it could be interpreted to mean a non-resident parent rather than the lone parent who has caring responsibility for the child. Furthermore, the amendment applies only to lone parents on income support. It would not preclude financial sanctions being applied to lone parents on employment and support allowance or the modified jobseeker&#146;s allowance regime. This seems like an anomaly that could confuse people and make the administration of the system difficult.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/91112-0003.htm"/>


<a name="91112-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09111245000082"></a>I took it from the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Freud, on Report that his party was in favour of financial sanctions for failure to undertake work-focused interviews when the youngest child of a lone parent reaches age one, and that they were in favour of the concept of work-related activity starting for lone parents when their youngest child reaches age three, although I must admit that his colleagues in the other place seemed somewhat confused on this point. I also took it that they were in favour of some other sanctions, although not specified, for failure to undertake such work-related activity. The only issue that we are apart on is the use of financial sanctions in some circumstances. As I have said, we believe that financial sanctions with appropriate safeguards have a role to play in underpinning work-related activity. The amendments made in this House put crucial additional safeguards for lone parents and parents in the Bill and enable them to ensure that the well-being of their child is taken into account so that they can fulfil their caring responsibilities. They will ensure that where there is no suitable childcare available, a lone parent will not be required to undertake work-related activity or will be able to restrict their hours of availability to those which are suitable for them.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09111245000083"></a>Starting the work-related activity process when a lone parent&#146;s youngest child is aged three is right. A strong foundation of childcare provision is available for children in this age range and these measures will allow them gradually to build their confidence and skills at a pace that suits them over a four-year period.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_907"></a><b>12 Nov 2009 : Column 907</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91112-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09111245000084"></a>As to the amendment laid in the other place, as noble Lords are aware, the Bill served to set out the framework of the work-related activity proposals and that the detail of these proposals will be set out in regulations. The amendment proposed in the other place has the effect of requiring all work-related activity regulations, insofar as they relate to lone parents with children under seven, to be brought back to both Houses for further affirmative debate. This is a sensible proposal. It gives the assurance that the passing of the Bill will not have the effect of shutting the door on further debate on work-related activity for this customer group because any regulations made within five years of Royal Assent will come back to this House and noble Lords will have an opportunity to consider how work-related activity is working in practice.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09111245000085"></a>As I have stated before, it is right that lone parents who are beginning their journey towards work do so in good time so that they are not distant from the labour market for longer than they need to be, with all the disadvantages that that would bring, and that they have the encouragement and the support they need. With this explanation and the changes we have made both in this House and the other place, I hope noble Lords will agree that these proposals offer the best chance for lone parents to begin their family&#146;s journey out of poverty. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_73"></a>
<a name="09111245000086"></a><b><a name="91112-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09111245000270"></a>Lord Freud:</b> My Lords, it is with some surprise that I see this amendment in lieu has come back from another place because the arguments have been firmly on the side of the original Lords amendment. John Grogan MP&#151;a Member on the government Benches in another place&#151;said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="09111245000162"></a>&#147;This proposal is mean-spirited. It is cold, austere ... and it is unworthy of the Secretary of State and the Minister&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 10/11/09; col. 181.]</p>

<p><a name="09111245000148"></a>I find it difficult to disagree. The purpose of my original amendment was simple: to make sure that as this new, very active labour market policy is applied to lone parents there are no unfortunate impacts on those who look after children under school age.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09111245000087"></a>The Government have argued that this will compress the time that lone parents will have to prepare for work from four years to two. This is barely concealed sophistry. The Minister has today described a new sanctions regime for lone parents with a youngest child of three. There will, apparently, be a process after two missed work-focused interview or a three-month failure to undertake work-related activity&#151;this includes an opportunity to explain good cause&#151;after which there will be a written warning. After three missed interviews or three failures to take up work-related activity, there will be an individual case review. After a fourth breach, a financial sanction will be considered, and then there is an appeal process on top. In the real world, this will take a considerable time; in some cases, indeed, not much less than two years. So what has happened to the argument based on compression now? It has disappeared.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09111245000088"></a>I was not so much surprised at the amendment in lieu but more puzzled. As my colleague in another place, James Clappison, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="09111245000163"></a>&#147;The amendment in lieu deals with work-related activities to be imposed on the lone parents in question, not the sanctions that  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_908"></a><b>12 Nov 2009 : Column 908</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are to be imposed as a result of a breach of those requirements&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 10/11/09; col. 177.]</p>

<p><a name="09111245000149"></a>I agree. The amendment in lieu is irrelevant to the issue under debate.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09111245000089"></a>I am sure that the Minister would prefer to debate the principle of the amendment rather than shelter behind technical drafting issues&#151;whether it should state &#147;single&#148; or &#147;lone&#148;&#151;so I shall go straight to the nub of the issue. It is clear that this amendment has become something of a political game for the Government. They cannot accept this simple, unambiguous proposal because it came from our Benches, and for no other reason. I do not think that it is appropriate or seemly to join this political game. This is a Bill that we support and I do not want to endanger it. We have made our point. We believe that there should be protection for lone parents with pre-school-age children. Judging by the large number of e-mails that I have received in the past 36 hours, many lone parents are utterly dismayed that this amendment is being removed and disbelieving that it is a Labour Government who are doing it.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09111245000090"></a>I can console them with this thought: in this area, it may matter considerably more who are in government in six months or so than whether this protection is explicit in the legislation. As David Cameron concluded in his remarkable speech on Monday, the Conservatives, not Labour, are best placed to fight poverty in this country. I can assure noble Lords that if we are in a position to form a Government in six months, lone parents with children under five will not face financial sanctions as a result of the progression-to-work regime.</p>

<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="09111245000091"></a><b><a name="91112-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09111245000271"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> I take exception to any suggestion that the views of the government Bench are part of a political game. The noble Lord, Lord Freud, is a fairly late entrant to the discussions on lone parents. Members on the Liberal Democrat and Labour Benches have fought the corner of lone-parent poverty for something like 15-plus years. I take strong exception to being told that we are now in a political game as we come up to a general election. Those remarks are unfortunate and I hope that, on reflection, he will feel able to withdraw them. None of us makes such aspersions in this House and all of us assume good faith, however misguided we may think any amendment may be. I hope that the noble Lord will accept that statement.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09111245000092"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s original amendment was highly regrettable, ill thought out, back to front and illogical. It would have meant that the lone parent faced greater conditionality and greater sanction for the lesser failure&#151;of turning up for an interview&#151; and with a younger child. But when it came to the greater failure, to follow through a commitment that they had given to enter work preparation&#151;a commitment which was more feasible given the greater age of their child&#151;the noble Lord would have removed the sanction. In other words, the conditionality in the sanction applies for the lesser offence on the younger child, but not for the greater failure and the older child. That is daft. I am amazed that the noble Lord thinks that there is any coherence in his position.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09111245000093"></a>I have been involved in new deals for eight or 10 years as a junior Minister and subsequently. I know that, without the evidence of conditionality backed by  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_909"></a><b>12 Nov 2009 : Column 909</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a sanction, the participation of the group of lone parents that one most wants to reach and is hardest to reach becomes essentially voluntary. In that sense, what the original amendment would have done, which is why it was so deplorable, is drive a coach and horses through the concept of trying to ensure that all lone parents of children aged three to five are engaged in work preparation. The Benches opposite would have made that entirely voluntary. That is not in the best interests of the lone parent or the child.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09111245000094"></a>My noble friend has spelt out a long list of good cause and protections and efforts to engage lone parents. Of course we want the lone parent as a willing participant, because that is how we will ensure that she goes into the labour market in due course and stays there. That is the outcome that we want. But I know that the later that engagement with the lone parent is left, the harder and longer that journey is&#151;and it is no kindness to the lone parent or her child that the journey should be made tougher for her than it already is. That was the focus of the original, deplorable amendment.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09111245000095"></a>Finally, the noble Lord said that he and his party were on the side of attacking poverty. I hope that at some point he will guarantee&#151;and I invite him to come back to me&#151;that the tax credits that make work pay for lone parents will be protected in their entirety, should there be any change of government. Let me remind the noble Lord that as a result of tax credits, which his party fought all the way, a lone parent going into work at 16 hours a week at minimum wage takes home double that pay as a result of tax credits. An unskilled lone parent returns home with the pay of a semi-skilled man. That has transformed outcomes for that lone parent and her child, and I invite the noble Lord&#151;since he has made the commitment today that his party will overturn the thrust of the Commons amendment, which is to engage the lone parent in work preparation with a child between three and five&#151;to make a similar commitment today that he will protect tax credits, which alone ensure that it is worth while for the lone parent to go out to work on a part-time basis. I invite the noble Lord to respond.</p>

Will he explain to his e-mail recipients why he has not done so, because I do not believe that the Bill would have been lost?</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09111245000102"></a>During the passage of the Bill through this House, we have come a long way over the issue of lone parents and when and how they should prepare for work. In overturning the amendment in the other place, admittedly a flawed amendment from Report, which sought to exempt some lone parents with children under school age from the work-related activity sanctions regime, the Government have now tabled this amendment in lieu, which simply gives the House a chance to have another debate on affirmative statutory instruments about the issue of work-related activity before the pilots are rolled out nationally. I think that the statutory instrument is for lone parents with children under the age of seven.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09111245000103"></a>This is certainly a way of drawing the House&#146;s attention to the issue, but it is an extremely rare procedure for the House to vote down a statutory instrument. I am sorry that the Grand Committee gave such short shrift to my attempt to bring super-affirmatives into the Bill. That procedure would have given the House the chance to suggest amendments, although it would still only be the Government who could amend the statutory instrument. In parenthesis, it always strikes me as misleading that affirmative statutory instruments are laid in draft as though Parliament had the power to amend them, but that is a debate for another day.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09111245000104"></a>Turning back to the subject of lone parents of very young children and the work-related activity sanctions regime, I was encouraged that the Minister said on Report and again today in terms that the action plan agreed at work-focused interviews could be as light as one work-related activity between two three-monthly work-focused interviews. He also made it clear that any work-related activity would be required to suit only the hours that the lone parent could manage and that if satisfactory childcare was not available, no work-related activity would be expected. The Minister also made it clear, both on Report and again today, that any financial penalty would be the very last sanction to be imposed after four failures to comply with work-related activity.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09111245000105"></a>At the end of all this, we come back to the fundamental question at the heart of this section of the Bill. Is this whole sanctions regime for lone parents, starting when their child is three, aimed at giving them a genuinely helping hand out of a life on benefits and therefore relative poverty, or is it beating them with a stick to make sure that they comply with the demands of the state or risk losing benefits when they have their hands full with the demands of a young child?</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09111245000106"></a>How Jobcentre Plus offices around the country make this part of the Bill work will be all-important. We must all hope that staff there are sensitive to our concerns about this very vulnerable group of parents. If we hear that all the safeguards in the Bill are not enough to stop too many lone parents of very young children falling foul of the sanctions regime, we on

In the mean time, we hope that the sanctions regime for all groups of vulnerable people will be used as little as possible during the pilots and that they will all be monitored as closely as possible before rollout.</p>

He might be upset about that but he may find himself in a position to do something about it in the not-too-distant future. After all, as my noble friend just said, these are pilots.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09111245000108"></a>The key difference in all this&#151;it is not yet properly understood outside the precincts of Parliament&#151;is that there are clear differences between how people look at this progressive conditionality that the report of the noble Lord, Lord Freud, first enabled and Professor Gregg&#146;s report then fleshed out. You may believe that this is a penal set of sanctions to force people back into work off benefits; you think, &#147;This is a cost-saving measure that will be tough, but people better shape up or they&#146;ll suffer&#148;.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09111245000109"></a>Alternatively, if you put the Freud report and the Gregg report together and, like me, you are an optimist&#151;if you are a Liberal Democrat you have to be an optimist&#151;you may reach a different conclusion. If personalised conditionality can be deployed sympathetically, without sanctions, as my noble friend said, you are in a different place altogether. You want to support people and you do not want to leave people out of the labour market for a long time.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09111245000110"></a>I was a slightly lone voice advocating Professor Gregg&#146;s report. I think that the Government suffered from the spin that some Ministers put on it when it came out, which I do not think its contents merited. Four bullet points from the report state what Professor Gregg thinks personalised conditionality means for the progression-to-work group, which is the group of people about whom we are talking. He says that conditionality would, first,</p>
<ul><a name="09111245000165"></a>&#147;Reflect the claimant&#146;s co-ownership of the return to work process&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09111245000150"></a>He goes on to say that it needs to,</p>
<ul><a name="09111245000166"></a>&#147;Be tailored to their capability and built around their circumstances&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09111245000151"></a>Thirdly, it should,</p>
<ul><a name="09111245000167"></a>&#147;Be based on activity that supports the claimant&#146;s own route back to work&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09111245000152"></a>and, finally, it has to,</p>
<ul><a name="09111245000168"></a>&#147;Link up with effective support&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09111245000153"></a>If all these are delivered&#151;and it is a big &#147;if&#148;&#151;we should be grabbing it with both hands for the progression-to-work group. The difficulty is that the Government have still not entirely made the case to the public that that will happen. There is still a feeling that it will be the hardship regime that people fear. Some of us have had the advantage of seeing the helpful letter that the Secretary of State has just written to the chairman of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, which gave more comfort that we are more likely to get the Gregg version of events.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09111245000111"></a>I do not know how many pilots there will be, although I guess that there will be two or three and it would be helpful to know where they are likely to be. I  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_912"></a><b>12 Nov 2009 : Column 912</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>also have an incidental question about Scotland. We have won protections through helpful government amendments in Committee, meaning that if no childcare is available there cannot be sanctions. I still hope that if a pilot area happened to be in Scotland&#151;I suspect that none will&#151;in the three-year or five-year period during which these pilots are rolled out and evaluated, the availability of childcare will be equalised throughout the United Kingdom. It would be unfair if it was not.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09111245000112"></a>If we get the pilots evaluated, it will become clear whether Professor Gregg&#146;s vision or the hardship regime is delivered. My noble friend is absolutely right and I come in behind the point of the noble Lord, Lord Freud, that, if this turns out to be an oppressive hardship regime where people are being sanctioned and nothing much is being achieved for the progression back to work, we will vote in big numbers to ensure that these pilots are not rolled out across the United Kingdom. I console the noble Lord, Lord Freud, with the thought that maybe he is too new and enthusiastic and expects things to happen too quickly. There may only be a delayed decision or vote but, speaking for myself, I am willing to take that risk. I do so in the earnest hope that Professor Gregg&#146;s vision is delivered, and nothing else.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, is right to analyse what is proposed for the sanctions regime for work-related activity: it flows that it will be broadly consistent with the Gregg model. The Secretary of State&#146;s letter to the chair of the Select Committee itemised that in particular and I am pleased that that was helpful.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09111245000114"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, made a key point: if the sanctions end up being penal in practice, forcing people to do wholly unreasonable things, we will have failed. That is not the intent behind this process. We must recognise the point made by my noble friend Lady Hollis that there needs to be a degree of conditionality, partly because we know that, sadly, some people will simply look to buck the system. The evidence shows that conditionality&#151;rights and responsibilities&#151;is the best route to getting people to engage.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09111245000115"></a>The noble Lord also asked about pilots. Four pilots are proposed, but the areas have not yet been identified. He again raises the issue of childcare in Scotland, or the lack of it. A course avoiding sanctions if appropriate childcare is unavailable would absolutely be a good one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09111245000116"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, said that we have come a long way. Our deliberations in this House have been particularly important in helping the Bill to end up where it is. She is again right that it ultimately depends on how it works in practice. I take the point that, if it does not turn out as we propose and believe that it will, noble Lords reserve their right, as I am sure they would anyway, to express their views forcefully when we come to those regulations and will not hesitate to vote them down.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09111245000117"></a>We do not believe that the super-affirmative process is appropriate in this case. As the noble Baroness will be aware, a further safeguard for social security legislation  


<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_913"></a><b>12 Nov 2009 : Column 913</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is provided by the scrutiny of the Social Security Advisory Committee, which has the ability to consult on secondary legislation made more than six months after Royal Assent. This is a significant control and we work constructively with the committee, as I think the noble Baroness would acknowledge, on the development of our regulations. There are some technical issues over where super-affirmatives apply and where they should not, but I will not dwell on that today.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09111245000118"></a>My noble friend Lady Hollis, as ever, expressed the Government&#146;s position forcefully and clearly; I am grateful for that. In particular, she pointed out the inconsistency in the approach of the noble Lord, Lord Freud, and his colleagues. Our objection to his amendment is not just to do with its technical deficiency. It concerns the inconsistency of an approach where somebody could be sanctioned for not attending a work-focused interview if their youngest child is just one, or where lone parents with a youngest child aged three could be sanctioned, after all the protections have been exhausted, for not attending a work-focused interview. One could not receive a financial sanction for not turning up to a children&#146;s centre, say, two weeks later, but one could then be sanctioned for not turning up to the next work-focused interview at the end of the next three months. Frankly, that is a recipe for confusion and is inherently inconsistent. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Freud, will reflect on that.</p>

<a name="91112-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09111245000119"></a>I think that I acknowledged that the noble Lord and his colleagues have in mind&#151;should they ever be given the opportunity to implement it&#151;a proposition that I, of course, would not accept. There would be other sorts of sanctions. There are very interesting issues about whether denying somebody part of their cash benefit and delivering it in another way is a financial sanction. Maybe there will be a chance to test that issue. It seems that we agree on work-related activity commencing when the youngest child is aged three and that there should be a sanctions regime. We may disagree on a component of that and on whether financial sanctions are appropriate in extremis at the end of an exhaustive process. However, I think that the gap between us is quite narrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09111245000124"></a>Like my noble friend Lady Hollis, I think that it was unfortunate to refer to this issue as a political football, because we have covered a lot of ground in this House during the progression of the Bill. We have improved it immensely. We have had some quite intense and important debates about what it means, what its parameters should be and how we can best move to do something that I think we all want, which is to help people to move closer to and into the labour market. To characterise it in that way was, I think, unfortunate. Perhaps I have said enough. I gather that the noble Lord is not seeking to oppose what I have moved today. It is up to him.

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09111245000127"></a>Concerted action to stop trains running is irresponsible, but train companies need to ensure that their staffing arrangements are robust so that they cannot be held to ransom in this way.

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09111245000129"></a>The origins of the problem, exposed by the current situation, go back some time. Both sides of industry have been relying on rest-day and Sunday working. The drivers needed it to ensure a decent income and the train operating companies needed it to ensure that their drivers were available when required. However, there are only a certain number of shifts to be driven, a certain number of drivers to drive them and a certain amount of money to pay them. Surely the industry could have devised a more robust system to keep these in the balance. I think the Secretary of State agrees with me, but what does he think the

Does the Secretary of State have a handle on what percentage of drivers work on rest days and Sundays? It seems to me that the rate is very high.</p>

<a name="91112-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09111245000130"></a>There seems to be some confusion about whether industrial action is taking place. It smells like it, it looks like it, and it has the same effect, especially on the passengers. Rest-day and Sunday working is very lucrative for the drivers. It seems peculiar that many of them suddenly decide of their own volition to not work on a Sunday. It is, of course, extremely disappointing that the drivers decided to disrupt Remembrance Sunday, when old comrades would want to meet up just one more time; in many cases they will not have the opportunity to do so again. It is also surprising that the unions would decide to take this course of action at this particular point in the electoral cycle and when the rail industry enjoys so much cross-party political support.</p>

It certainly was not, but we did think that capricious and spiteful trade unionism which hurt the many out of all proportion to any dispute was a thing of the past. Such actions hurt fellow workers, the vulnerable, working mothers and children trying to get home from school. Certain trade unions seem to have learnt nothing from the experience of the 1970s. They have forgotten that their industrial militancy brought in a Conservative Government who trebled unemployment and brought in legislation that curbed trade union powers&#151;some victory. As the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, indicated, does this clever way of seeming to cause damage without offending the Trade Union Act need to be looked at?

<a name="09111245000138"></a><b><a name="91112-0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09111245000285"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Earl and the noble Lord for their responses. As the noble Earl said, passengers face misery on this line. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, is one of those passengers and has properly expressed their anger and frustration. I make it clear to the House that I share that anger and frustration. I not only share the anger and frustration of passengers who are being deeply inconvenienced by this totally unjustified action, I also share the concern which the noble Earl expressed about the deep damage being done to the cause of the railways by this action. As Secretary of State I seek to promote the railways as strongly as I can as a form of transport for the future which is efficient and green and should be regarded by passengers as reliable. Action of this kind, which calls into question the reliability of the railways, will cause deep damage to the cause of the railways as regards securing future investment decisions of a kind that we in this House all wish to see. I deeply regret the action. I call on the staff to continue to work and I call on the unions to engage with the management to see whether it is possible to bring about a speedy resolution to the underlying pay dispute. However, this concerted action is not justified and is deeply regrettable. I hope that it will be ended forthwith.</p>

<a name="91112-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09111245000139"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McNally, asked specific questions about industrial relations law and First Capital Connect. We obviously keep the state of industrial relations law under review, but the immediate issue here is that First Capital Connect staff work in a way that ensures that the service can be properly provided. That is what we wish to see. First Capital Connect is expected to use all reasonable endeavours to provide a full service.</p>

<a name="91112-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09111245000140"></a>It is not my job to use the long screwdriver that the noble Earl mentioned to seek to manage the service myself. I spoke this morning to Mary Grant, the group rail manager of First Capital Connect, who assured me that every effort was being made to run as full a service as possible. I made clear to her our expectation that that would happen. It is important that First Capital Connect continues to use all reasonable endeavours to restore the service, but this situation could be ended immediately if the concerted action on the part of the staff was ended. That step should be taken immediately.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="09111247000053"></a>Cyprus</h2>
<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09111247000003"></a><b><a name="91112-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09111247000048"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Chris Bryant) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09111247000004"></a>The UK remains an active supporter of the negotiations between the two Cypriot leaders aimed at reaching a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem. The current round of talks offers the best opportunity yet to solve the Cyprus problem.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09111247000005"></a>The UK has no role in the negotiations but, in order to support the efforts of the two leaders, the Government made a renewed land offer to the UN Good Offices Mission in Cyprus on 10 November 2009 to cede a portion of territory of the sovereign base areas (SBAs). The extent of the land offer is the same as the offer made in 2003 (modified in 2004). My right honourable friend the Prime Minister announced this on 11 November (see the text of his Statement below).</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09111247000006"></a>The Government have offered to cede 45 square miles of SBA territory, just under 50 per cent of the total, to a reunified Cyprus. This would make up 1.2 per cent of the area of the reunited island. The SBAs would be able to function as normal within a reduced land area.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09111247000007"></a>As in 2003, the offer is dependent on a successful outcome to the settlement negotiations. It will be up to the two leaders to decide how the land will be allocated and how to incorporate it into a settlement. The offer will become null and void should a comprehensive settlement not be approved by both communities in Cyprus. Legislation would be required to bring the transfer of territory into operation in the event of a comprehensive settlement being agreed.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09111247000008"></a>The UN will include the land offer in future negotiations between the two leaders on the territory issue. It would not be appropriate, therefore, to comment further on the details of the land offer at this stage.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09111247000009"></a>The Government will continue to support the two leaders in their search for a solution. We believe a settlement in Cyprus is vital towards securing peace and stability in the east Mediterranean. We urge all parties to seize this unique opportunity.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09111247000011"></a>My right honourable friend the Prime Minister said on 11 November:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09111247000042"></a>&#147;I was very pleased to welcome President Christofias to London today and to have the opportunity to discuss the Cyprus problem with him. This is a critical time for the settlement talks.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09111247000043"></a>President Christofias has shown enormous courage and determination in progressing discussions this far. I know that both Cypriot leaders are fully committed to finding a solution. And today I urged President Christofias to exploit this unique opportunity and move to resolve the issue to the benefit of all Cypriots.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS62"></a><b>12 Nov 2009 : Column WS62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="09111247000044"></a>I welcome the deeper co-operation between the UK and Cyprus, and reaffirm my commitment to work together on the basis of previous agreements.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09111247000045"></a>It is important that the solution to the Cyprus problem is a Cypriot one&#151;a solution by Cypriots for Cypriots.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09111247000046"></a>Nevertheless, as a sign of support for the negotiations, I can confirm today that an offer has been made to the United Nations to make available just under 50 per cent of the territory of the UK's sovereign base areas to a unified Cyprus in the event of a solution. It will be up to the two leaders to negotiate what happens with this land. The sovereign base areas would be able to function as normal within a reduced land area.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09111247000047"></a>Today, my message to Cyprus's leaders and to their people is: you can make history. Be bold, be courageous. The UK will support you&#148;.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09111247000013"></a>The Government have today published an independent clinical report by Professor Sube Banerjee, into the prescribing of anti-psychotic drugs to people with dementia, together with a government response to the report. The report was commissioned by the Government in recognition of widespread concern about the overprescription of these drugs, and as part of the priority being given to improving care for people with dementia.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09111247000014"></a>The Government welcome the report prepared by Professor Banerjee, and accept the conclusions and recommendations he has reached. The report acknowledges that these drugs are currently being overprescribed, and contains a series of recommendations to the Government and others on action to address the current level of overprescription.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="09111247000019"></a><b><a name="91112-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="09111247000051"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead):</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State for Borders and Immigration (Phil Woolas) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09111247000020"></a>The Government have today published the draft Immigration Bill, copies of which are available in the Vote Office</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09111247000021"></a>The Bill consolidates and simplifies nearly 40 years of legislation and will ensure that Parliament and not case law determines immigration policy. This Government have created a dedicated UK Border Agency which combines customs and immigration powers in a strong new border force at the frontier. We now count migrants in and out of the country to ensure visa compliance. The points-based system allows us to raise or lower the bar for entry to ensure that migration continues to benefit the United Kingdom and avoid the negative impacts of sudden change.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09111247000022"></a>We need to ensure that the law which underpins our work is in the best shape to support a fair and effective immigration system. Our legal framework needs to reflect the changes we have made and support continuing reform. It must enable the system to work more efficiently and effectively.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09111247000023"></a>In taking forward our reforms we have already made specific changes to the law which were necessary to support the wide-ranging changes of policy, process and organisation we have put in place. We have also been clear that a wider reform and consolidation of the whole legal framework for immigration from the Immigration Act 1971 to the most recent Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, is now needed, to build on those changes and ensure that the law as a whole is clear, consistent and comprehensible.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09111247000024"></a>Immigration law is very often subject to legal challenge. The current legislation needs to be considered together with the case law which interprets that legislation. We now have an important opportunity for Parliament to take stock of what the law is and decide the path forward, bringing clarity to an increasingly difficult area of law.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09111247000025"></a>The draft Bill we are publishing today is the next step in a continuing process to meet the objective of a simpler legal framework&#151;thereby providing a clear basis for the operation of our controls, and increasing our effectiveness in protecting our borders and removing those who do not have our permission to be here. As this document makes clear, we began that process two years ago as part of the reform of the then Immigration and Nationality Directorate and have consulted widely on our developing proposals. We are setting out now what we have achieved so far and what further work remains to be done.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="11" year="2009" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS64"></a><b>12 Nov 2009 : Column WS64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09111247000026"></a>The draft Immigration Bill introduces new and far-reaching concepts for the future immigration system strengthening our borders, simplifying immigration processes, and increasing our effectiveness at removing those who do not have permission to be in the UK:</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="09111247000027"></a>Permission will become the basic authorisation given or refused by the UK Border Agency&#151;in an embassy overseas, on arrival at a port, on application after entry. It replaces the outdated and overlapping concepts of leave to enter, leave to remain, entry clearance, the right to abode and exemption from control. It will be easier to use and understand&#151;a migrant either has permission or does not.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09111247000028"></a>Expulsion will replace the current separate procedures for deportation and administrative removal. All those expelled can be banned from returning&#151;for a fixed period, or indefinitely. As now, expulsion will be the automatic consequence of specified prison sentences.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09111247000029"></a>Immigration bail will replace separate provision for temporary admission, temporary release and current bail procedures and provide a strong alternative to detention. It brings with it a broad menu of conditions to ensure contact and control of those awaiting decisions or expulsion. Those on immigration bail will remain liable to detention at any time.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09111247000030"></a>The immigration appeals system has been simplified to improve its clarity and speed for those who need to use it while reducing the number of cases where repeated challenges create obstructions to enforcement. The Bill limits the grounds of appeal to whether the decision in question is in accordance with the Immigration Rules and otherwise in accordance with the law. It will not be possible to win an appeal on the grounds that discretion should have been exercised by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="09111247000031"></a>The draft Bill is accompanied by the Command Paper <I>Simplifying Immigration Law</I> which explains the approach which has been taken in the draft Bill and what further work there is to be done. This document also sets out the Government&#146;s intention to reform the route for those wishing to enter or stay in the UK on the basis of marriage or another long-term relationship. Decisions in the courts have weakened the current scheme for issuing certificates of approval before ceremonies take place; the courts have also found certain elements of the current scheme to be incompatible with human rights law. The scheme is no longer effective and it will be withdrawn: we will be bringing forward a remedial order to achieve this.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09111247000032"></a>I am today also publishing a consultation on the future of the support provided while an application for protection is being concluded. The consultation focuses on how asylum support powers can be used to continue to ensure that genuine asylum seekers are not left destitute, while also enabling and encouraging those who are refused asylum and no longer have any right to be here to go home.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09111247000033"></a>I have also made available today a consultation on the framework for the Immigration Rules which will be made under the new Bill. This consultation sets out proposals to make these rules simpler and easier to use.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09111247000034"></a>Copies of both consultation documents have been placed in the House Library and in the Vote Office.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="09111247000038"></a>I have carefully considered the inspector&#146;s reports on the public inquiries and his latest report on the public hearing into the South Downs National Park (Designation) Order 2002, as varied, made by the Countryside Agency under the provisions of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949.</p>

<a name="91112-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09111247000039"></a>In line with the inspector&#146;s recommendations, I have decided that the area now proposed for designation meets the criteria for a national park, taking account of the modifications made, and that it should be managed by a national park authority, to be established under the provisions of the Environment Act 1995.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="09111247000040"></a>Full details of the South Downs National Park boundary will be released in my decision letter today, a copy of which, together with an illustrative map, will appear on the Defra website.

<a name="91112w0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_39"></a><a name="09111249000047"></a>The IA focused on potential additional liabilities for the police and the criminal justice system (CJS). It also identified potential benefits of the policy change in terms of the change in the estimated population of serious cannabis users, reflecting the gradual desistance through contact with the CJS and consistent with current trends as measured by the British Crime Survey. It did not specifically address the overall benefit to the community of reclassifying cannabis as a class B drug. The full IA can be found at: <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/em/uksiem_20083130_en.pdf">http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/em/uksiem_20083130_en.pdf</a>.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_40"></a><a name="09111249000048"></a>The Home Office has consulted and worked closely with the police to implement the changes to the enforcement approach to cannabis possession by adults as well as actions to tackle commercial cultivation. It has provided funding for a series of measures to support this work.</p>

Fast-tracking refers to using streamlined processes that allow new funding to be approved more quickly. Frontloading means allowing countries to anticipate funding from next year to allow more investment in the current year. In response to the crisis, IDA members agreed to increase the amount of funding that could be frontloaded from 30 to 50 per cent. These measures resulted in IDA commitments reaching $14 billion in the IDA&#146;s financial year 2008-09, which ended in June 2009. This is a record, and 25 per cent higher than the previous year. However, there has not been a similar increase in the spending of these funds, and we continue to press for reforms that will improve the Bank&#146;s performance in this area.</p>

It was also one of several concerns highlighted in a report, published in May 2009, by the UN Committee Against Torture. Israel is a state party to both the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989 and the UN Convention against Torture of 1984. Israel has also stated it takes seriously its periodic reports before the treaty bodies, using them as an opportunity for in-depth self-examination.

Estimates given show the gross additional basic state pension spend due to increasing the basic state pension by earnings from 2010 and implementing all of the other 2007 Pensions Act reforms to the basic state pension from April 2010 relative to uprating by RPI or 2.5 per cent. They also reflect the estimated savings from reduced income-related benefit payments (pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit). During the next Parliament, we will re-link the uprating of the basic state pension to average earnings. Our objective, subject to affordability and the fiscal position, is to do this in 2012, but in any event by the end of the next Parliament at the latest. We will make a statement on the precise date at the beginning of the next Parliament.</ul><ul><a name="09111267000022"></a>10. In the financial years up to and including 2014-15 Treasury economic assumptions consistent with Table C1 of the Budget Report 2009 have been used to model earnings uprating.

The Government consider that there is nevertheless a case to be made for reform of some individual powers in order to increase the level of parliamentary scrutiny and control.
