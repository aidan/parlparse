<h4 align=center><a name="hd_0"></a>The House met at half-past two of the clock: the LORD CHANCELLOR on the Woolsack.</h4>


<h4 align=center><a name="hd_1"></a>Prayers&#151;Read by the Lord Bishop of Leicester.</h4>

<a name="60523-01_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Food: Imports</h3>



<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spopq0"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>  My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. In doing so, I declare an interest as a farmer.
</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a>The Question was as follows:


</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>To ask Her Majesty&#039;s Government what effect the increasing amounts of food imports have on the United Kingdom economy.
</p></ul>



<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spmin0"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Rooker): </b>  My Lords, our farmers cannot grow all the agricultural products that domestic consumers wish to buy. Some foods must be imported to provide a wide choice of products all year round. Our policy is not to intervene in the market to reduce imports but to help farmers compete successfully to deliver what people want. UK food and drink exports are beginning to thrive again, and the domestic market for local products is growing.
</p>




<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rotherwick: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for the Answer. Is it not a fact that the farming industry is in a precarious state, with one-third of farmers receiving less than &#163;5,000 in income a year? Surely the deteriorating situation in the farming industry requires proper financial viability in farming over the next five years, otherwise the employment in the UK provided by the farming industry&#151;1.8 per cent&#151;may collapse considerably and affect food imports in this country.
</p>




<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I take the thrust of what the noble Lord says, which was covered in last Thursday&#039;s debate. However, there is some evidence that consumers are concentrating more on local produce. Mintel&#039;s latest report shows that 23 per cent of shoppers are very active in looking at local produce when they are shopping. We do what we can to help farmers to respond to consumer requirements for competition and diversity and to look at flexibility and protecting the environment, through the rural development programme, which has paid out &#163;1.6 billion in the past six years.
</p>




<p><a name="st_4"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spnew2"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister not agree with me that the Government could do more to discourage the imports of food, such as meat, which is produced at standards way below those imposed on our own farmers? Also, the current abuse by which food coming into the country is processed over here <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_690"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 690</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and labelled as being British should cease. Both those items would help considerably in boosting the hard-pressed rural economy.
</p>




<p><a name="st_5"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I take what the noble Earl says. Some third countries&#151;that is, non-EU countries&#151;have lower welfare standards than apply in the European Union. World Trade Organisation rules do not allow us to restrict trade in products solely on the basis of the method of production, but 90 per cent of our imports of bacon, ham and pork come from EU countries where, by and large, the same standards apply. In fact, as a result of market forces, there is evidence that supermarkets that source abroad now insist that animals are reared to the same high standards as in the United Kingdom.
</p>




<p><a name="st_6"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Taylor of Blackburn: </b>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that some of us who have great sympathy with the farming industry and other industries that are experiencing this problem have had to endure it for years? For example, in my area, the textile industry asked for embargoes to be put on textiles coming into the country. However, it is a free economy, and the Government cannot and should not control what is coming in and what is going out.
</p>




<p><a name="st_7"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, the food production chain is a private sector concern, as my noble friend indicated. However, I do not think that people outside the farming industry generally recognise the cultural, economic and social changes that that industry has undergone in recent years. It is not noticed because farmers do not work in large factories but, by and large, live in isolated communities and operate as small, independent businesses. The changes that have affected food production, for example in the use of technology and other matters, have been just as significant as those that have affected many of our old smoke-stack industries.
</p>




<p><a name="st_8"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   My Lords, I declare an interest as an owner of a small food shop selling local food and as the chairman of Somerset Food Links. I acknowledge what the noble Lord says about the importance of local food. However, how does the Minister equate the fact that we are importing 44,000 tonnes of frozen boneless cuts of chicken and exporting 51,000 tonnes of fresh boneless chicken with Defra&#039;s effort to reduce food miles?
</p>




<p><a name="st_9"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, the food industry accounts for 25 per cent of heavy goods vehicle traffic in this country. Many products are imported and exported, but that is up to individual companies. The Government are not growing or exporting food; individual companies are doing that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_10"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Brookman: </b>   My Lords, can my noble friend help me? My wife has gone organic, and I have had to follow. It is costing us a fortune. What advice can my noble friend give me?
</p>




<p><a name="st_11"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spnew9"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I advise my noble friend to eat what his wife puts on the table.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_691"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 691</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_12"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spnew10"></a><b> Lord Hamilton of Epsom: </b>   My Lords, following that point, does the Minister accept that farmers have been encouraged to convert their farms to organic farming on the basis that they would get a premium for the food that they produced but that they have been undercut by exports from countries in Europe that do not have the same tight controls over organic farming as we do?
</p>




<p><a name="st_13"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, I fully accept that a lot of the food that is sold as organic is imported. We need to produce more organic food. That is why we have a conversion programme to help the economic change-over. Over the two to three-year period of conversion to organic farming, there is obviously a reduction in production and you cannot get the premium. However, there is evidence that organic production is increasing in England and the rest of Great Britain and that the premiums can be maintained.
</p>




<p><a name="st_14"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Swinfen: </b>   My Lords, if push came to shove, could we feed our population with the products of our own agriculture?
</p>




<p><a name="st_15"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, we are 75 per cent self-sufficient in food that can be commercially grown here, although that is a bald statement. We are 60 per cent self-sufficient in all food. However, people are demanding non-seasonal food. They want every week to be the same season. That demand cannot be satisfied commercially by producing food exclusively in this country.
</p>




<p><a name="st_16"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spnew14"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that farmers provide more than just food? Indeed, it was a joy to welcome him to the Leaf Launch this morning, as it will be to welcome him to the forthcoming Sunday Farm Day. Is it not important that we as parliamentarians try to convey to the public the work that farmers undertake in addition to their providing food for the country to eat?
</p>




<p><a name="st_17"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, the subsidy arrangements have changed. In fact the word &quot;subsidy&quot; is no longer applicable to the help that is given to farmers. Basically, they are paid to look after the countryside and the landscape, all of which is man-made. We need to appreciate that. If people want the landscape to be maintained as it is, that has to be paid for. We rely on farmers, as managers of the land, to do that.

<a name="time_0"></a>
<a name="60523-01_time0"></a><h5>2.45 pm</h5>


<p><a name="st_18"></a>
<a name="60523-01_spopq1"></a><b> Lord Lyell: </b>  My Lords, in the absence of my noble friend Lord Steinberg and at his request, I beg leave to ask the Government the following Question:


</p>
<ul>
<p><a name="qnpa_1"></a>Whether they will ensure that all members of the Northern Ireland Executive make a prior declaration of support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland.
</p></ul>



<p><a name="st_19"></a>

<a name="column_692"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 692</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

ministerial office in Northern Ireland should support the policing arrangements there. The existing pledge of office set out in Schedule 4 to the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which all Ministers must affirm before taking up their post, already requires a commitment to non-violence and exclusively democratic means.
</p>

<p><a name="st_20"></a>
<a name="60523-02_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lyell: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that semi-clear reply. I am afraid that I do not have Schedule 4 in front of me. Is it not bizarre&#151;even inexplicable&#151;that members of the would-be Executive in Northern Ireland simply cannot give unequivocal support to the Police Service of Northern Ireland?
</p>




<p><a name="st_21"></a>
<a name="60523-02_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, we regret that as well. The Government have made it clear that we want Sinn Fein to take its seats on the Policing Board and the district partnerships as soon as possible. The Secretary of State has, however, made it clear that he does not intend to add further preconditions.
</p>

<a name="60523-02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a>Noble Lords will shortly have ample opportunity to debate these matters in great detail when the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill reaches the House. In fact, it has already reached the House, but we have not yet begun debating it. The Bill involves the devolution of policing and other aspects of criminal justice at some point in the future. The fact of the matter is that, if you are not for the police, you are for the muggers, the rapists and the criminals. It is as simple as that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_22"></a>
<a name="60523-02_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Harris of Richmond: </b>   My Lords, the noble Lord has already indicated that Sinn Fein is not a member of either the Policing Board or the district policing partnerships, which is a great shame because they have proved very effective. What are the Government doing to persuade Sinn Fein to join these as an interim measure, before becoming&#151;I hope&#151;full members of the Policing Board?
</p>




<p><a name="st_23"></a>
<a name="60523-02_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, we are using every means at our disposal in the sense that discussions take place, the position has been made clear and there has been no change in the recent past. It is our intention to have the Assembly up and running before the 24 November deadline approved by the House. That requires devolution and Ministers to take up their posts. The latest IMC report makes it clear in paragraph 219 that:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a>&quot;We believe the leadership&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-02_para1"></a>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a>&quot;has accepted the need to engage in policing&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-02_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a>It is a positive statement. There are moves under way, but we have not yet reached the final point at which Sinn Fein is prepared to make the move. It will have to make that move in the end, because there can be no future without that.
</p>




<p><a name="st_24"></a>

</p>




<p><a name="st_25"></a>
<a name="60523-02_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, that is in the hands of the Members of the Assembly, who have now started to meet and discuss. They are the only elected politicians in the world who do not seem to want to pull the levers of power. For their citizens&#039; sake, it is their responsibility and duty to take on the role of running and governing Northern Ireland. It does not matter how many excuses are put in their way. The only way to tackle Northern Ireland&#039;s problems in the long term is for local people to take over governance and for local Ministers to take decisions and be accountable for them.
</p>




<p><a name="st_26"></a>
<a name="60523-02_spnew6"></a><b> Lord Glentoran: </b>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it is really very undemocratic and unjust for devolution to be abandoned because one party&#151;not the largest or majority party but a minority party&#151;refuses to accept British law and the British criminal justice system?
</p>




<p><a name="st_27"></a>
<a name="60523-02_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   My Lords, we want the Assembly up and running by November, but this is not a clean sheet. These parties were part of the Assembly before, albeit under different electoral arrangements, so we are not asking people to do something that has not been done before. There has been an election in the mean time, and things have changed. The responsibility of governance lies now with other people. It is their responsibility and duty. We cannot allow that to be put to one side. There is an elected Assembly that ought to carry out its duty to govern Northern Ireland. It is a multi-party Assembly and will work by power sharing. We are not going back to the old way.

In doing so, I declare that an organisation with which I am associated is the operator and 42 per cent owner of the power station in question. I further declare that I have no financial links whatever with the power station.
</p>

<ul>and the Middle East quartet with a view to seeking the payment of electricity supply invoices and the continued delivery of fuel to the power station in Gaza so as to avoid major power cuts.
</p></ul>



<p><a name="st_31"></a>
<a name="60523-02_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office  (Lord Triesman): </b>  My Lords, with the quartet and EU partners, we continue to monitor the humanitarian situation in the Occupied Territories. It is very important that the Gaza power station continues to provide electricity for the Gaza Strip. The UK will continue to do what it can to ensure that. On 15 May, EU Foreign Ministers called on Israel to pay currently suspended clearance revenues. Those payments would allow the PA to pay the power station&#039;s invoices.
</p>




<p><a name="st_32"></a>
<a name="60523-02_spnew10"></a><b> Viscount Waverley: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister very much for that response. The effect of continued non-payment for the power or fuel disruption for the turbines would, with great reluctance but necessity, mean 50 per cent of Gaza being without power. I ask the Minister only to accept the gravity of the situation.
</p>




<p><a name="st_33"></a>
<a name="60523-02_spnew11"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, we certainly do. The situation in Gaza is serious, as yesterday&#039;s violence showed. We will continue to monitor the position, and we will continue to call on Israel to transfer the customs revenues that, at the moment, are paying for the Israeli electricity supplier&#039;s bills. If the money is transferred, as I said, the power station invoices can be met. It is essential to recognise that, if there is to be the development of a Palestinian state, it needs a stable economy, and a stable economy needs a stable power supply. That is the only way in which economic growth will happen.
</p>




<p><a name="st_34"></a>
<a name="60523-02_spnew12"></a><b> Lord Tomlinson: </b>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that, if they want a stable economy, one of the best things to do would be to take all the necessary steps to live at peace with their neighbours? That would add to the stability of their economy greatly.
</p>




<p><a name="st_35"></a>
<a name="60523-02_spnew13"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, that is absolutely right. The existence of proper and harmonious peaceful relations would be the greatest stimulus to the economy of the entire region. Adherence to the road map by both nations and Hamas, in its responsibilities as the newly elected party in the Palestinian territories, could add immeasurably and self-evidently to that progress.
</p>




<p><a name="st_36"></a>
<a name="60523-02_spnew14"></a><b> Lord Astor of Hever: </b>   My Lords, the quartet has recently endorsed EU efforts to find a mechanism to deliver temporary aid to the Palestinians. What mechanism is envisaged, and what steps could be taken to ensure that nothing is diverted to terrorist activities?
</p>




<p><a name="st_37"></a>
<a name="60523-02_spnew15"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, following the 9 May quartet endorsement of the idea of a temporary international mechanism to support directly the Palestinian people&#039;s basic needs, the United Kingdom has been working with the European Commission to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_695"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 695</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

deliver a mechanism as quickly as possible. The Commission circulated a paper to member states and other donors, which is being discussed today and tomorrow. There is a lot of work to do, but we are determined that the mechanism must be up and running as fast as possible. It is particularly important in some areas, such as the delivery of medical services. We are working on it as we meet today.
</p>




<p><a name="st_38"></a>
<a name="60523-02_spnew16"></a><b> Lord Dykes: </b>   My Lords, has not the habit of a fair utilities supply, not just electricity, from Israel to Palestine now become heavily politicised in the latest crisis? Does that not inevitably mean that, subject to the negotiations in detail, the only way to put the situation right for Palestine and for Israel is for the two fully independent states to sign a mutual support agreement?
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060523/text/60523-03.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_39"></a>
<a name="60523-03_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, if we get to the point of having two fully independent states capable of living in harmony together, I would expect them to sign a number of bilateral arrangements that would wholly normalise the politics of the region and, I believe, secure the support of the wider region and the other nations in it. We have some way to go. Not least, people on both sides must accept that Israel has the right to exist. It cannot be a debate between two nations when one of them is denied that right.
</p>




<p><a name="st_40"></a>
<a name="60523-03_spmin0"></a><b>The Earl of Sandwich:</b>  My Lords, does the noble Lord accept that the diversion of aid away from the Palestinian Authority has seriously divided the Palestinian people and has made the Authority under Abu Mazen especially vulnerable to attack from Hamas?
</p>




<p><a name="st_41"></a>
<a name="60523-03_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, the Palestinian people, as their election showed&#151;whatever its result&#151;are widely divided. One party argues for the peace process and for the recognition of the right of Israel; the other says that that right should not exist. I do not think that that argument will be overcome rapidly or readily, but it has to be overcome. The whole peace process is dependent on a mutual recognition of the right of the other to statehood and all the things that accompany it.
</p>




<p><a name="st_42"></a>
<a name="60523-03_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </b>   My Lords, I follow on from the question of the noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson: how can it aid and abet peace in Palestine and Israel for the new Israeli Government to announce increased settlement building round the east Jerusalem area? Also, how can it aid and abet the peace process to dismantle the outlying settlements, which are indefensible, and to relocate the 60,000 or so settlers in the West Bank in extended settlements, in respect of which there are no signs of any dismantling, contrary to the road map and to international law?
</p>




<p><a name="st_43"></a>
<a name="60523-03_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I have said from this Dispatch Box on a good few occasions that we regard the route of the barrier and the building of settlements <br>&nbsp;<br>

on lands that would be in a fully integrated Palestinian state as illegal acts. We have pressed that argument strenuously on the Israeli Government. The art of this, if there is an art in diplomacy, is that both sides must recognise their obligations to a peaceful route, and, as the noble Lord said, there are obligations on both sides.
</p>




<p><a name="st_44"></a>
<a name="60523-03_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Tonge: </b>   My Lords, while the Minister is looking into electricity supplies in the Gaza Strip, can he also look into water supplies in the whole of the Occupied Territories? It is well known that Israel has control over much of the water in that area. Is there not a danger not just for the Palestinians but for the whole peace of the Middle East if one country has control of water?
</p>




<p><a name="st_45"></a>
<a name="60523-03_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Triesman: </b>   My Lords, I accept that control of water is a vital issue. It is a cause of great instability in many areas in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa and so on. I am clear that we need to resolve all the bilateral issues relating to the control of all the utilities, and that will be one of the most dynamic achievements&#151;if it can be achieved&#151;in enhancing the economic prospects and the stake that everyone has in a peaceful future.

I refer in particular to clean coal technology, on which much progress has recently been made, and to decentralised electricity generation, including microgeneration, which can be twice as efficient as the centralised stations. Can we be assured that these and other possible low-carbon technology solutions will be considered in the report?

was in the energy review at all. He simply pointed to three incontrovertible facts: if we do nothing, there will be a dramatic gap in our targets to reduce CO2 emissions; we will become heavily dependent on gas; and, at the same time, we will move from being 80 to 90 per cent self-reliant on gas to 80 to 90 per cent dependent on foreign imports, mostly from the Middle East, Africa and Russia. Those are simple statements of fact with which no one in the House would quarrel. He then went on to say that,

In the intervening period, everything has been pushed up the agenda with the vengeance to which he referred.

He did not say that we would do it; he did not say that we would not do it. He said that it was on the agenda and needed to be considered. Clearly, if you build more nuclear power stations it will reduce your reliance on gas; that is a material consideration. Given that, on current projections, we will be 80 to 90 per cent dependent on foreign imports of gas, I should have thought that the House would be very concerned.

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a>The noble Viscount said: My Lords, in moving this amendment, I speak also to Amendment No. 6. These two amendments were grouped with an amendment which was passed by a narrow majority of two votes on Report. Following that, I should have formally moved them on Report. Through the excitement of winning a vote, and oversight, I did not. The Minister has kindly allowed me to move them today and accepts that they were grouped.
</p>

<a name="60523-04_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a>However, I understand that, since Report, he has been able to consider the principle of the amendments and may have something to say about their suitability for the Bill. I beg to move.

It is rather like having private notice that at least half the argument, the significant half, has been accepted. The prescription of those categories will be taken account of, but they will not be absolutely binding.

<a name="60523-04_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a>We discussed these amendments on Report, when I set out why we could not accept them. Due to a slight slip, the amendments were not formally moved at that stage, but the Government accept that they were effectively carried. That being so, I will explain how we propose to deal with those matters when the Bill returns to the other place. For the reasons that we have given at length, the Secretary of State needs to be able to set out, at the very highest level and in the broadest possible way, the types of expenditure that the Big Lottery Fund should focus on. The Secretary of State is not out to direct the Big Lottery. I want to put to bed the notion that the Government seek directly to interfere in the work and allocation of the Big Lottery Fund. However, without the ability to prescribe devolved expenditure, the devolution arrangements in the Bill would not work. We will, therefore, seek in the other place to retain the powers in Clause 7.

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a>I made clear on Report how important we thought that was. However, the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, emphasised that it was a fundamental concern that, as they saw it, there was perceived government control over the Big Lottery Fund. They wanted assurances about prescription. As I maintained then, I think their fears are unfounded, but I accept that they are genuinely felt.
</p>

<a name="60523-04_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a>We will, therefore, table amendments in another place that deliver the spirit of Amendment No. 6. We accept that the House voted accordingly and that, for procedural reasons, the vote was not recorded. We will act according to the decision of this House. Our amendments in the other place will provide that the Big Lottery Fund must comply with policy directions only as to matters to be taken into account. That will put the Big Lottery Fund in the same position as the Community Fund and all the other lottery distributors.

We are very pleased because he has accepted the main issue. The Government have now agreed that, in the provision on directions, &quot;comply with&quot; is too strong.

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Government&#039;s amendments in this group concern the proposed reserve power to reallocate an excessive National Lottery Distribution Fund balance from a lottery distributing body to another body. This power was the subject of extensive debate both in Committee and on Report. On both occasions I assured the House, as have my ministerial colleagues in another place, that the Government would seek to use the proposed new <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_702"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 702</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

power only as a last resort against a distributor which had failed over an extended period to tackle an excessive balance, and which had refused to take steps to manage that balance down to a reasonable level.
</p>

<a name="60523-05_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a>Let me emphasise the point. To get into such a dismal position, a distributor would need to have ignored not just the Government&#039;s guidance, but the recommendations of the National Audit Office and of the Public Accounts Committee in another place, both of which have addressed those issues. At present, I see no distributor as being in a position where we would consider exercising the proposed reallocation power against it. They are just not working that way.
</p>

<a name="60523-05_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a>As the reallocation power is framed in the Bill, the Secretary of State would not be able to exercise it without first consulting the bodies from which and to which it was proposed that a sum would be reallocated. The Secretary of State would also be obliged to consult the devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
</p>

<a name="60523-05_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a>My noble friend Lord Borrie was particularly helpful on Report when he emphasised that, as he saw the Bill, there was nothing to prevent the Secretary of State consulting more widely if she so wished. On Report, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Sheffield tabled an amendment seeking to create specific provision to require the Secretary of State to consult more widely any other person whom she thought appropriate. That was an amendment that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham tabled in Committee.
</p>

<a name="60523-05_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a>In responding to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Sheffield on Report, I acknowledged that there would indeed be legitimate wider interest in any proposed use of the reallocation power. However, I also pointed out that, as any use of the new power would be subject to affirmative resolution, there would be no question of the Government being able, somehow, to exercise the power in secret or without giving people time to make representations. It is in the nature of the issues that if we had provision that an affirmative resolution would be necessary for this to be carried through, of course people would be fully aware of what was going on, and the Secretary of State&#039;s decision would be subject to parliamentary consideration.
</p>

<a name="60523-05_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a>Nevertheless, I undertook to consider this issue in the light of the broad consensus across the House on the matter. Today I am saying that the Government can agree to include such a provision to require the Secretary of State to consult any such bodies as she thinks appropriate before she can exercise the reserve power to reallocate balances. Therefore, I hope it will be recognised that the Government have seen the strength of opinion across the House. We thought we had got the position right. We never thought for one moment that this was a hole-in-the-corner exercise, but one that would be subject to the fullest public debate and the affirmation of Parliament through <br>&nbsp;<br>

Our reason for including this provision was because we needed to make clear that lottery distributors have the power to encourage participation in activities related to promotion of the lottery good-causes funding, such as National Lottery Day and the National Lottery Awards.

<a name="60523-05_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for moving Amendment No. 4. I agree with him; I do not think it was ever thought that the Government&#039;s intention was otherwise. We were arguing simply about the precise use of the words in Clause 11. We on these Benches very much support the general purpose of the clause, so I am delighted that the Minister has come back with an amendment of this kind. This means that Members on both sides of the House can agree that the implementation of the clause will be greatly to the benefit of the lottery projects.

<a name="60523-05_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville: </b>   My Lords, I was absent from Report by virtue of being in Killarney, so was not in a position to hear the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, move the relevant amendment, to which the Minister has in effect responded in speaking to Amendment No. 4. I have no problem with the amendment that the noble Lord moved on Report, nor do I have any problem with this one, but he said then that the clause was designed in essence to ensure that the National Lottery distributors took a greater part in publicising aspects of the National Lottery. Personally, I would have wanted Clause 11 to place stronger obligations on the distributors, because the current wording, which is permissive rather than statutory, does not seem to ensure that action is taken. But we live in an imperfect world, and the Bill will have to go on the statute book without that extra degree of compulsion.

<a name="60523-06_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham </b>   moved Amendment No. 5:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a>After Clause 11, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_1"></a><br>
&quot;DISTRIBUTING BODIES: ANNUAL REPORTS

<br>
In section 34 of the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 (c. 39) (annual reports) after subsection (2) insert&#151;


<br>
&quot;(2A)   The report shall set out the body&#039;s policy and practice in relation to the principle that proceeds of the National Lottery should be used to fund projects, or aspects of projects, for which funds would be unlikely to be made available by&#151;


<br>
(a)   a Government department,


<br>
(b)   the Scottish Ministers,


<br>
(c)   a Northern Ireland department, or


<br>
(d)   the National Assembly for Wales.&quot;&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_78"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, scarcely would this important issue of additionality have been grouped with any other because, if anything, this was the one that vexed us the most in Committee and on Report. It is quite clear that there is a general view on both sides of the House about the principle of additionality. There is also general agreement that it is right that lottery distributors should report annually on the way in which they have interpreted the principle. We all regard the lottery as separate from, and additional to, government expenditure used for the good of the community, not a substitution for it. The principle underwrote the 1993 Act, and it underpins the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60523-06_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a>On Report, the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, tabled an amendment to include such reporting in the Bill because he was concerned about the issue. We opposed that amendment, but not because we disagreed with the sentiments being expressed. I hope the noble Lord accepted my assurances then. We support the idea of transparency, and we endorsed the voluntary agreement reached by the lottery distributors, but the Government could not accept the amendment as it was worded, particularly the section on funding for not-for-profit organisations, which, as I pointed out, would be very difficult, if not impossible, for distributors to meet.
</p>

<a name="60523-06_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, was kind enough to withdraw his amendment on the ground that the Government would table their own to enshrine additionality reporting, which was the objective of his amendment and his argument, in a way in which the lottery distributors would find acceptable. That is what this amendment does. It is very important to get the wording right and we believe that the terms of the amendment can be met by the distributors and will allow proper transparency of their actions.

</p>

<a name="60523-06_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a>It is important to remember that this amendment constitutes a reporting requirement. It is not a definition and does not attempt to set out what lottery distributors can or cannot fund. I think that we have agreed on all sides of the House that it would be wrong to try to define additionality. Decisions on what to fund remain for lottery distributors and I am sure that the whole House will agree with that. If Parliament has reason to take issue with reports from distributors, there will be opportunities to debate that. As I pointed <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_706"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 706</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

out previously, the fact that lottery funding is additional to government funding does not mean that it may not be complementary to such funding.
</p>

<a name="60523-06_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a>We have also pointed out that agreement on what is appropriate for the Government to fund can change over time. Just because something is not funded now does not mean that that will always be the case. For example, some things which the lottery has in the past funded are now funded by government and would probably not even be considered by the lottery as being right to fund in future.
</p>

<a name="60523-06_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a>I am sure that noble Lords have thought of many examples, but MRI scanners are the obvious one. Early MRI scanners were first funded through charitable donations and people and hospitals working hard in their localities. Then the lottery funded scanners. It is now recognised that that is an obligation on the health service. It would be a strange Government who would suggest that the funding of MRI scanners should be appropriate for lottery funds.
</p>

<a name="60523-06_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a>The funding of MRI scanners demonstrates changing patterns of expenditure, and that something else for which there is a need or desire now may be funded by the Government in the future. There have certainly been cases in the arts and heritage where the lottery has met immediate needs, with much public debate following such decisions. The argument has been that at some stage it ought to be right for the Government to take responsibility for such funding. We are bound to have a constant debate over areas which the lottery appropriately funds to meet needs which the Government are not at the time prepared to meet, but that is not to say that the debate will not change. In due course, it will become a charge on the public purse through public resources, because the argument about the importance of such funding has been won.
</p>

<a name="60523-06_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a>To sum up, the amendment will enshrine in legislation the requirement for lottery distributors to report annually on how they have interpreted additionality in their funding decisions so that this guarantees transparency, while allowing&#151;I think that the whole House would recognise this&#151;proper freedom and flexibility in funding decisions.
</p>

<a name="60523-06_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a>We have had a substantial debate about additionality, which has brought together all sides of the House on its complexity and on the care that the Government must take in this legislation to ensure that distributors have proper freedom and that we do not pre-empt lottery decisions. I hope that it will be recognised that the Government have tabled an amendment which meets that requirement and that noble Lords will feel able to support it. I beg to move.

<p><a name="st_79"></a>
<a name="60523-06_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Clement-Jones: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his substantive reply and substantive amendment to the Bill. I also want to thank Members on both Opposition Benches in the other place and indeed in this House who have kept up fairly consistent pressure throughout the Bill&#039;s passage on what has turned out to be a satisfactory conclusion of the debate about additionality.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_707"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 707</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60523-06_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a>This amendment makes it clear that the different lottery distributors are not fulfilling the Government&#039;s objectives; are not adding to the Government&#039;s expenditure on their own projects; and are not simply a pot to be raided by Government. The reporting obligation highlights the strong requirement for lottery distributors to demonstrate how they are using their funds as an additional source of income for projects that are not necessarily part of the Government&#039;s agenda. They will retain flexibility in the way that the Minister described and a strong degree of independence in the way that they direct their funds. That is a wholly satisfactory conclusion. We recognise that it would have been extremely difficult&#151;and we would probably still be in Committee&#151;if we had been charged with finding a definition for additionality, so I am glad that we moved off that point. However, the reporting requirement will, over time, probably lead to a satisfactory definition of the Government&#039;s proper province and the province of the lottery distributors. That will come to be an extremely useful form of reporting.
</p>

<a name="60523-06_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a>Finally, as this is my last opportunity to speak on the Bill, I want to thank the Minister for his courtesy throughout its passage and his willingness to listen to arguments&#151;sometimes to contrary arguments to which at first he was perhaps not particularly willing to listen. After mature reflection in a number of cases, he has accepted the arguments made and on these Benches we are extremely grateful.
</p>




<p><a name="st_80"></a>
<a name="60523-06_spnew3"></a><b> Viscount Astor: </b>   My Lords, this has been a joint effort on this subject between the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and myself. I echo what he said about the Minister and the way that he has steered us through this Bill, which has been extremely helpful. We have been able to come to a sensible conclusion. The Government have always said that they accepted the principle of additionality. The problem is that almost everyone else realised that over time it had been broken in a number of instances. However, the Minister has been helpful because the new clause will help to stop any further abuses. It will give much-needed transparency in this area and the obligation to report is extremely helpful. No doubt all those who think that that principle was coming under pressure will be satisfied.
</p>

<a name="60523-06_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a>The Minister said that this is not a definition of additionality, but he may have created one, because his amendment mentions projects for which funds would be unlikely to be made available by a government department. Maybe that is a new definition of additionality. To me it sounds like the normal advice one received when one went to see the Treasury asking for money for a particular department.

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a>As on the London Olympics Bill, where the Minister was extremely helpful from Second Reading, I concur with the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that he has been equally understanding on this occasion, although it has taken him a little longer. However, we are extremely appreciative. He will recall that we indicated at Second Reading that the Government in 1993 had thrown down the challenge to the Opposition to produce a better definition of &quot;additionality&quot; than was contained in the original Bill. The Minister threw back that challenge to us late at night in his winding-up speech at Second Reading and said that it was up to the Opposition to meet the challenge. However, he accepted the spirit if not the letter of the various attempts which the Opposition made and has now, with great skill, come up with the final solution. That is much appreciated.
</p>

<a name="60523-07_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a>In the 1997 Parliament, there was a Member of Parliament whose election to the House of Commons was challenged on the grounds of their election expenses. I am afraid that the jury found against the Member of Parliament concerned, but the Member of Parliament was reprieved by the noble Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, on the grounds that their dismissal from the House of Commons would effectively have been on a technicality. The Member of Parliament never came to be known in the House by the soubriquet &quot;Technicality Jones&quot;, though had they lingered longer, they might have been. However, they left the House. As with Capability Brown, who would have inspired Technicality Jones, there has to be a possibility that, despite the Minister&#039;s skill, he will still go down in parliamentary history as Additionality Davies. I hope that he will treat it as the compliment that all of us intend.

<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="60523-07_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My Lords, that challenge was laid down in appropriate fashion. I noticed during the passage of the Bill that the gauntlet was not picked up effectively on the other side, otherwise it would not be a government amendment that we would be considering today. I am grateful for the kind words of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, although I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, would recognise that I am still part of that old school which says basically: <i>Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes</i>. Therefore, I am not so sure that I accept this as a wholly satisfactory occasion, but suffice it to say that the challenge that was laid down over additionality is exceedingly difficult. That is why noble Lords opposite were not able to respond to the challenge which I laid down. We have, however, recognised the obvious public concern about these issues and that lottery expenditure should be different from, and additional to, government funding. It is exceedingly difficult to define in law. We have given it our best shot. It is not a definition of additionality. I do not therefore deserve the epithet or soubriquet which the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, suggested, but I welcome him back from the haunts of Killarney. Lest <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-07_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving the amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 2 to 6 and 19 to 26. When this issue was raised on Report on 9 May, the Minister agreed to consider the execution of documents by company secretaries. Since then, the Minister has been kind enough to send a letter to us, stating that the Government are, in fact, inclined to go further than we asked and to allow execution of documents by a &quot;named other person&quot;. Sadly, as the letter then says, it has not proved possible to produce the amendments in time for the proceedings of this House, which is indeed a pity, but we are pleased that the Government are in a receptive mode and grateful for that further assurance from the Minister. Indeed, Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 in this group, amending Clause 44 on the execution of documents, take that proposal a stage further.
</p>

<a name="60523-07_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a>However, we still harbour some concerns that the Government do not seem to have fully appreciated the thrusts of our amendments in Committee and on Report. The execution of documents point that they have agreed to consider was only part of our argument. The bigger picture was about the empowerment of company secretaries where they are not legally required; that is, secretaries who private <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 710</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

companies choose to have even though the law does not oblige it. That is why we have tabled a further group this afternoon. The position of such secretaries under the Bill is unclear. There are no requirements for them to be registered, nor to be fit for their role; there are none of the requirements that secretaries of public companies must fulfil.
</p>

<a name="60523-07_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a>We do not argue with the deregulatory intent behind that approach, which is obviously aimed at easing the burden on smaller companies, but it has drawbacks. The lack of any requirement for the registration of secretaries will leave those that still exist in limbo, with no official recognition of their status. For example, how will an outsider to the company know, or be able to check, that such a person is a company secretary? The role is, currently, one that helps encourage the spread of good corporate governance; yet, by removing the need for any registration and denying them any legal status, the Government have cut the ground from under the feet of all secretaries of private companies, no matter how large.
</p>

<a name="60523-07_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a>Now, we agree that many companies welcome the removal of the need to have a secretary and the Bill will result in a decreased regulatory burden for them. Yet, there will remain some private companies, especially the larger ones, for whom a secretary adds value. Those companies who want to keep a person in that role should not then see the legal status of that secretary eroded or weakened. The Government seem, to us, to have missed that point and we now ask them to reconsider it. The amendment will impose no burdens on those companies that choose not to have a secretary, which will be unaffected. It will give strength to those companies which wish to preserve the status quo by keeping a secretary, probably because they believe that such a person adds value to their corporate governance processes. In that spirit, I beg to move.

</p>




<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="60523-07_spmin0"></a><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </b>  My Lords, the Bill abolishes the requirement for private companies to appoint a company secretary. This is a major deregulatory measure. The Company Law Review recommended that as, it argued, the decision on whether to use the services of a secretary should be made by the market rather than by law. Removing the requirement to appoint a company secretary does not prevent a private company appointing one; it leaves the decision entirely to the company, giving it the freedom to choose. If it chooses not to appoint a secretary, the approach of the Bill is that the appointment is not subject to any regulatory requirements. If, on the other hand, the company chooses to appoint a secretary, the company is completely free to decide what its secretary&#039;s function will be.
</p>

<a name="60523-07_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a>The Bill gives greater flexibility to companies in their internal administrative arrangements. For example, some companies might choose to appoint someone as secretary just for peak periods, with the director or directors doing whatever else was necessary between times. To require such a company to notify the registrar of the appointment and its termination <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_711"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 711</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

each time, and to keep a register of such short-term appointments, would be over-burdensome. Surely, the only justification for imposing such a burden would be if the information is genuinely needed by third parties. At present, third parties only ever need that information when the secretary is participating in the execution of documents. That is why it is sensible to discuss together the amendments relating to a company secretary&#039;s details being on the public record and those relating to the execution of documents.
</p>

<a name="60523-07_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a>There are four questions that need to be addressed with this group of amendments. First, who should be able to execute documents for a company? Secondly, and related to the first, if private companies appoint a secretary, should that secretary be able to participate in the execution of documents for the company? Thirdly, should the details of any secretary voluntarily appointed by a private company be on the public record? Fourthly, and finally, if private companies appoint a secretary, should the directors be under an express duty, imposed by the Bill, to secure that the secretary is a person who appears to them to have the requisite knowledge and experience to discharge the functions of a secretary?
</p>

<a name="60523-07_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a>I shall address these questions in that order, although not in the order of their appearance in the Bill. First, who should be able to execute documents for a company? At present, for any company executing documents, the alternative provided under the law of England and Wales to affixing its common seal is execution by signature of either two directors or a director and the secretary. Importantly, these two signatures can be made at different times and places. As many noble Lords have pointed out, this flexibility can be very useful to companies. Yet this flexibility will not be available under the Bill as presently drafted, particularly for those private companies that have only one director. Neither does the new provision introduced by the Bill, that a director may execute a document in the presence of a witness, wholly solve the problem, because the witness must be present at the moment the director places his signature. We accept that this is a weakness.
</p>

<a name="60523-07_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a>As indicated on Report, we therefore propose to implement the recommendation made to us by the Law Society and the City of London Law Society that the provisions which set out who is able to execute a document for a company should be less restrictive than either under the present law or as in the Bill. Instead, every company is to be able to designate whoever it chooses to execute documents for it, but only if it so wishes. This new option will be entirely voluntary. There will not be a requirement on any company to use this new facility and companies will be able to designate as many individuals in this capacity as they wish, provided that they are an individual who is 16 or over.
</p>

<a name="60523-07_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a>Directors and public company secretaries will remain able to execute documents, by virtue of their office. Any designated signatories will be in addition to them. It is expected that many private companies that choose to appoint secretaries will want to give the role <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_712"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 712</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

as a designated signatory to their secretaries, but this may not always be the case and it is not to be a requirement. We are also considering whether transitional provisions for existing secretaries of private companies should be made, automatically designating them for this role, at the first instance. So we are looking at the transitional arrangements. There will need to be a public record of designated signatories for the benefit of third parties with whom the company deals. We are consulting over draft amendments to implement this proposal with a view to introducing amendments to this effect in another place. I will place a copy of the consultation letter in the Library.
</p>

<a name="60523-07_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a>The second issue is, if private companies appoint a secretary, should that secretary automatically be able to participate in the execution of documents for the company? In company law there is a distinction between private companies and public companies, even though many private companies are big by any measure, whether number of shareholders, turnover, capitalisation, or whatever. Similarly, many public companies are small. The crucial difference between private and public is not a matter of size but a matter of governance and ownership. That is why we have argued, for example, that it makes sense for the requirement to have a company secretary to adopt this criterion. That is not to say that big private companies may not benefit from having a secretary and giving that secretary a particular role and function within the company. Rather, it is to say that in a private company, all decisions, including whether to have a secretary or not, and what functions to give any secretary appointed, should be left to the company alone&#151;in other words, to those who will be directly affected by the decision. This should include the decision as to whether the secretary can execute documents.
</p>

<a name="60523-07_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a>My third question is whether private companies&#039; secretaries should be on the public record. The purpose of the public record is to ensure that those who deal with the company know who has the necessary authority. But the Bill and the present law make this a real issue only in relation to secretaries with regard to execution of documents. In the case of private companies, it is therefore considered be an unnecessary and over-burdensome regulation to require entries on a company register and the notification requirements to the registrar, with the associated criminal offences, in the case of anyone except those able to execute documents. Details of all such persons must be on the public record, so that third parties can check and see. Under our proposals, when a private company has a secretary who is authorised to sign for it, that individual&#039;s particulars will need to be on the public record; if not, then not.
</p>

<a name="60523-07_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a>I accept that if private company secretaries, as the amendments propose, are automatically to be able to execute documents, their details ought to be on the public record. Where I take issue with the noble Lord is that it should be provided that private <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_713"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 713</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

company secretaries should automatically be able to execute documents. I consider this a decision that should be left to the company, even though I expect that the vast majority of private companies that appoint a secretary will choose to designate them to execute documents.
</p>

<a name="60523-07_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a>The fourth point that arises under the proposed amendments in this group is, when a private company has chosen to appoint a secretary, whether the directors of that company should be subject to a new duty to secure that the secretary appears to them to have the requisite knowledge and experience to carry out the role. This would extend the extent to which the present law regulates the position of private company secretaries, rather than deregulate it, as we are proposing to do in this Bill following on from the Company Law Review recommendations. We would be going in exactly the other direction and increasing regulation. For the reasons expressed earlier, there are differences in approach to the governance and regulation of private companies, and in my view this proposal would lead only to unwarranted and unnecessary further regulation.
</p>

<a name="60523-07_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a>I regret that it has not been possible to table amendments that would provide that companies may designate one or more individuals who would be able to be signatories for the execution of documents under Clause 44 and who may authenticate under Clause 48. There are complications, to which I alluded earlier. But in the light of our clear intentions, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendments on the issues he has raised in this group.

<p><a name="st_90"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 7 to 10, which relate to the register of members, and also to Amendments Nos. 51 to 65 and to Amendments Nos. 81 and 99.
</p>

<a name="60523-08_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a>Recent activities of animal rights activists have once again focused attention on the risks associated with shareholders&#039; names and addresses being publicly available. Last week, noble Lords made clear that they wanted the Bill to provide greater protection for members. We were very sympathetic to that. Clearly, there is a balance to be struck between, on the one hand, protecting members from attempts to defraud or to harass them and, on the other hand, members&#039; and the public&#039;s right to know who a company&#039;s members are and how to contact them. As the UK Shareholders Association points out,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a>&quot;easy access to share registers is important to maintain shareholder democracy&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-08_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a>I do not think that it is possible, while retaining the principle that the register is a public document, to draft provisions that will make it impossible for anyone ever to abuse the information it contains. However, I believe that this group of amendments strikes as fair a balance as possible between the various competing interests.
</p>

<a name="60523-08_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a>Before I deal with the amendments in detail, it is perhaps worth explaining the Government&#039;s general approach to this problem. We start from the position that the existing law, which has been amended several times in recent years, particularly by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, is entirely adequate to deal with cases of the sort recently exemplified by the attempted harassment of GlaxoSmithKline shareholders. Once someone is putting information from the register to malicious or fraudulent use, they will be committing an offence under the existing law. Moreover, the existing law on aiding and abetting, counselling and procuring and conspiring to commit criminal offences deals with those who deliberately assist campaigns of fraud or intimidation without participating in them directly. What we are therefore concerned with here is to try to ensure that when these crimes are committed, there is a paper trail leading from the primary offenders back to the requests made to the company for access to the register. By introducing further safeguards and offences at the top end of this paper trail, we aim to assist companies in exercising their rights and generally to encourage much tighter management of information from registers of members by all concerned.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_715"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 715</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60523-08_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a>In framing these amendments, we have, of course, considered a broad range of possible provisions. We are grateful to the Opposition and other interested parties for having suggested some of these. I will come later to why we have not adopted some of the suggestions that they have made.
</p>

<a name="60523-08_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a>I turn now to the amendments themselves. Clause 115 provides that access to the register of members will be denied if, but only if, the court, on the company&#039;s application, is satisfied that it is not being sought for a proper purpose. The first three amendments expand this clause. Amendment No. 7 makes it easier for companies to identify those requests for access to their registers of members that may be damaging to members&#039; interests and ensures that companies will have a record of who has requested access and why they have said they want it. It also makes it easier for companies to decide whether or not to comply with such a request.
</p>

<a name="60523-08_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a>Amendment No. 8 protects companies from improper requests in two ways. It provides the power for the court to order that the costs of the application to the court be paid by the person making the request. It also addresses the risk of companies being swamped by co-ordinated campaigns in which, for example, activist organisations might generate hundreds of similar access requests. In this context it provides the court with the power to make an order prospectively, relieving the company of any obligation to grant access to its register in response to a specified class of further requests. Amendment No. 9 simply replicates subsections (6) and (7) of current Clause 115.
</p>

<a name="60523-08_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a>Amendment No. 10 introduces two new offences relating to abuse of the public right of access to registers of members. As I have already mentioned, we are satisfied that the existing criminal laws of theft and harassment deal adequately with substantive misuse of information from registers of members. However, we consider that it would afford useful extra protection if it were an offence to make a misleading, false or deceptive statement when applying for access to the register, or to do, or fail to do, things that may lead to the information coming into the hands of someone who may use it for an improper purpose. Amendment No. 10 provides for such offences. These amendments fulfil my promise at Report to bring forward amendments to strengthen this clause.
</p>

<a name="60523-08_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a>I turn now to some of the suggestions made in this area which we have not followed. We were urged to define what constitutes a proper or improper purpose. In our view this is a case where it is impossible to formulate a definition satisfactory in all situations. In this case that does not matter, because a court or company will instinctively know a purpose that is not proper when it sees one. Any definition we put in the Bill would either restrict the discretion of the courts in a way that would be unhelpful in the future, or fail in its purpose. For example, we could talk in terms of purposes relevant to members&#039; holdings or the exercise of their interest, and clearly most such purposes would be proper. On the other hand, it would be easy to present a letter-writing campaign by animal rights <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_716"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 716</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

activists as falling within such a definition. Even giving examples could narrow the perception of what is thought of as proper, and so risk diminishing the protection this clause affords to members.
</p>

<a name="60523-08_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a>It is not an undue burden to place on companies who have a suspicion that a request for access to its register may be misused to ask them to decide that it may not be for a proper purpose, and so apply to the court. It could be argued that the burden should be the other way around: that those requesting access be obliged to prove that their request is for a proper purpose and apply to the court if it is turned down. However, this would be a step too far away from a public right of access to a register.
</p>

<a name="60523-08_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a>I return now to the other amendments in this group. It is not sufficient only to protect members. There are similar rights of access to any register of debenture holders that a company may keep. New Part 19A, introduced by Amendments Nos. 54 to 60, moves Clauses 581 to 583. These did not sit comfortably in Part 19, and are thus removed by Amendments Nos. 51 to 53. These amendments also introduce further provisions to ensure that debenture holders have the same protection that the earlier amendments provide for the register of members.
</p>

<a name="60523-08_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a>A public company that investigates the interests in its shares using the powers conferred under Part 21 is required also to keep a register of interests in shares. There are significant differences between these registers and registers of members, not least the absence of a time limit for the company&#039;s compliance with a request for access. As the risks listed are similar to those affecting members, Amendments Nos. 61 to 65 provide similar protection, while retaining the effect of the previous clauses. We have been mindful of the need to strengthen existing safeguards without overreacting to recent events. I hope noble Lords will agree that these amendments increase protection for companies&#039; shareholders while retaining the ability for anyone to contact the owners of any company.

<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="60523-09_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, the whole House will be grateful to the Minister for the amendments he has tabled. As he says, there is a delicate balance to be struck between shareholder democracy and shareholder tyranny. On these Benches we welcome these changes, which are clearly an important and worthwhile step in the right direction. Events involving GlaxoSmithKline have given them urgency. We have not yet had much time to study them or to think through their implications. That will probably be for debate in the other place, during Committee stage. We wonder whether further tightening-up will be needed as consultation takes place.
</p>

<a name="60523-09_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a>Three thoughts have occurred to us, which I offer to the Minister this afternoon. First, we have not heard the end of the issue of proper purpose and the definition thereof. If a company&#151;particularly in the early months and years of the legislation without any court guidance on what the court thinks is proper or <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_717"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 717</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

improper&#151;has to go to the trouble and expense of going to court, there must be a risk that, because of the time, money and the risk to reputation of going to court and being turned down, it will be inclined to hand over the register rather than go through that hurdle. The &quot;not a proper purpose&quot; issue will have to be further probed as consultation takes place.

</p>

<a name="60523-09_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a>The second question is whether the amendments prevent the chain request; that is where I persuade someone who is perfectly legitimate to use a legitimate purpose to get the register for someone else. Therefore, will there be a proper trace back to the person who is improper, even if the sequences in the chain are perfectly proper? The last thought is whether there is an alternative route that might provide a more effective way of preventing this situation in the Data Protection Act or equivalent legislation, which would achieve the purpose that we entirely share in a way that shuts off the issue more completely than it is possible to do in what is, after all, a company law reform Bill.
</p>

<a name="60523-09_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a>Those are our thoughts, on which I hope the Minister may be able to give some preliminary comments. For the time being, from these Benches, we welcome the Government&#039;s prompt attention to this important matter and entirely support the amendments.
</p>




<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="60523-09_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, as far as one can see, the Government have dealt with the mischief that we had the misfortune to witness the other day, but only experience will tell. I hope that what the Minister said will satisfactorily deal with the situation, but if the Act is not performing well, would he be prepared to look at it again with an open mind? I am not saying that it will happen, but it might.
</p>




<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="60523-09_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   My Lords, I share the thanks of the Conservative Benches to the Government for the amendments. I have a couple of points to make. First, there should be no doubt about the seriousness of the issue that the amendments are attempting to address. Anyone who heard the chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline on the radio the other day will have taken heed of his warning that there is a danger that significant chemical and scientific research will be exported outside the United Kingdom if the actions of extremists continue. He even suggested that those decisions were already being taken by multinational companies, so it is in the interests of UK plc that the Government get this right.
</p>

<a name="60523-09_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a>It was slightly unfortunate that the chief executive went on to say that he did not think that any change in the law was necessary. Although he was making the technical point that the Minister also made that existing statutes could be used to prosecute such people, he gave the impression that this was not a serious issue requiring a change of the law, which does not reflect the Government&#039;s position. I share the Government&#039;s concern.
</p>

<a name="60523-09_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a>Secondly, we had 13 days in the Moses Room in Committee on this Bill, which are forever etched in our memories, and we had three days on Report. However, because of the events triggered by GlaxoSmithKline, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_718"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 718</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the Government are being forced at this very late stage of the Bill to bring forward these amendments for the first time. What would have happened had this process started at the beginning of the Bill? This is no criticism of anyone; this is just what has been provoked by recent events. Had this come at the beginning of the Bill, the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Opposition and the Government would have had the benefit of extensive consultation and input from all those people who have given us input on all sides, which has enabled this Bill to be significantly improved as it has passed through its various stages.
</p>

<a name="60523-09_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a>I just hope that when the Bill goes to another place, the Government will take heed of the fact that that consultation exercise will probably need to take place without the benefit of the two experts sitting on the Government Front Bench here. The other place does not have a serious record of imposing detailed scrutiny on these sorts of points in technical Bills of this kind, so I urge the Minister to impress on his colleagues in another place that, when the Bill goes into Committee, they should concentrate on the clauses that have not received the detailed scrutiny given to some other clauses in the Bill.
</p>




<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="60523-09_spnew3"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   My Lords, I want to make a couple of observations related to those made by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. Unlike the noble Lord, I do not think that it is viable to try to define &quot;a proper purpose&quot;. You can be absolutely guaranteed that the one thing you leave out of the definition will be the one thing that happens.
</p>

<a name="60523-09_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a>On the other hand, I am a little unhappy that the test for the court is still the motive of the person making the request&#151;what he seeks it for&#151;rather than the way that the information is likely to be used. Perhaps I may illustrate what I mean. A very worthy, but perhaps somewhat naive, person genuinely wants to write to those who have shares in animal research companies and wants to get the names to do so. However, the person is associated with, or is a member of, one of the extremist organisations. From experience in relation to other companies, it is well known that if this worthy person gets the list, he will pass it on to the activists, who will then use it for an improper purpose.
</p>

<a name="60523-09_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a>Although the motive of the person seeking the information is perfectly proper, surely the fact that the court is convinced that the information will be used thereafter for an improper purpose should require it to refuse the application. I accept that the people misusing the information may be committing offences and so on, but that has never daunted them in the past and it will not daunt them in the future. Surely the purpose of the provision is to ensure that the names and addresses do not get into their hands. I suggest that the other place considers adding words such as &quot;is not sought or is unlikely to be used for an improper purpose&quot;. I am not trying to draft on my feet but I hope that the Minister sees what I am getting at.

<a name="60523-09_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, obviously we will keep an open mind on this issue, should it not work in the future. However, the problem is that you <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60523-09_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a>I think that we dealt with the problem of what the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, described as the chain-letter situation, to which the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, also referred. That is covered by Amendment No. 10, which states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a>&quot;It is an offence for a person in possession of information obtained by exercise of either of the rights conferred by that section . . . to do anything that results in the information being disclosed to another person, or . . . to fail to do anything with the result that the information is disclosed to another person, knowing or having reason to suspect that person may use the information for a purpose that is not a proper purpose&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-09_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a>So we are trying to put a block on the chain-letter situation, which would be a way round the problem.
</p>

<a name="60523-09_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a>This clause was already in the Bill. Therefore, the Government had thought about this point and wanted to act on it.

&quot;REGISTER OF MEMBERS: RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR INSPECTION OR COPY

<br>
(1)   Where a company receives a request under section 115 (register of members: right to inspect and require copy), it must within five working days either&#151;


<br>
(a)   comply with the request, or


<br>
(b)   apply to the court.


<br>
(2)   If it applies to the court it must notify the person making the request.


<br>
(3)   If on an application under this section the court is satisfied that the inspection or copy is not sought for a proper purpose&#151;


<br>
(a)   it shall direct the company not to comply with the request, and


<br>
(b)   it may further order that the company&#039;s costs (in Scotland, expenses) on the application be paid in whole or in part by the person who made the request, even if he is not a party to the application.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_720"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 720</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(4)   If the court makes such a direction and it appears to the court that the company is or may be subject to other requests made for a similar purpose (whether made by the same person or different persons), it may direct that the company is not to comply with any such request.

<br>
The order must contain such provision as appears to the court appropriate to identify the requests to which it applies.


<br>
(5)   If on an application under this section the court does not direct the company not to comply with the request, the company must comply with the request immediately upon the court giving its decision or, as the case may be, the proceedings being discontinued.&quot;


<br>
After Clause 115, insert the following new clause&#151;


<br>
&quot;REGISTER OF MEMBERS: REFUSAL OF INSPECTION OR DEFAULT IN PROVIDING COPY


<br>
(1)   If an inspection required under section 115 (register of members: right to inspect and require copy) is refused or default is made in providing a copy required under that section, otherwise than in accordance with an order of the court, an offence is committed by&#151;


<br>
(a)   the company, and


<br>
(b)   every officer of the company who is in default.


<br>
(2)   A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale and, for continued contravention, a daily default fine not exceeding one-tenth of level 3 on the standard scale.


<br>
(3)   In the case of any such refusal or default the court may by order compel an immediate inspection or, as the case may be, direct that the copy required be sent to the person requesting it.&quot;


<br>
After Clause 115, insert the following new clause&#151;


<br>
&quot;REGISTER OF MEMBERS: OFFENCES IN CONNECTION WITH REQUEST FOR OR DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION


<br>
(1)   It is an offence for a person knowingly or recklessly to make in a request under section 115 (register of members: right to inspect or require copy) a statement that is misleading, false or deceptive in a material particular.


<br>
(2)   It is an offence for a person in possession of information obtained by exercise of either of the rights conferred by that section&#151;


<br>
(a)   to do anything that results in the information being disclosed to another person, or


<br>

<p>
<a name="stpa_110"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 11 in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 12 and 13.
</p>

<a name="60523-10_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 11 is to enable the articles of a company to authorise a matter that would otherwise give rise to a breach of duty under the clause in so far as it is permitted by law. The matter has been raised by the Law Society, and there have been constructive discussions for which I am very grateful. I shall therefore be briefer than I would otherwise be because I am anticipating government Amendments Nos. 14 and 15.
</p>

<a name="60523-10_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a>On Report, we tabled an amendment to the then Clause 159(4) that was designed to enable the company&#039;s articles of association to authorise a matter that otherwise would constitute a conflict of interest, provided it did not contravene a common law rule or equitable principle. The noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General said on Report at col. 866 that the Government would consider the general point made at that stage.
</p>

<a name="60523-10_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a>The amendment to Clause 158(4) is narrower, but it is again designed to achieve a similar objective by enabling a company&#039;s articles of association to authorise a matter which otherwise would constitute a conflict of interest provided that it is lawful.
</p>

<a name="60523-10_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a>On Report, the Minister acknowledged that this was a difficult area. He also acknowledged that because old Clauses 159 and 160 characterised the obligations contained in those clauses as duties, the analysis in the Movitex case, to which the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General referred, might no longer be available. The Minister objected to our amendment on Report because in his view it appeared to permit the company&#039;s constitution to provide a very wide exemption from liability, with the result that the only limits when it would not be possible to exempt directors&#039; liability would be when actual fraud or dishonesty were involved.
</p>

<a name="60523-10_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a>However, the Minister stated that the point raised ought to be considered and that the Government would consider it further before Third Reading. On that basis the amendment was withdrawn. I note government Amendments Nos. 14 and 15, to which the Minister will speak shortly. I ask him to confirm my understanding that those amendments refer to new Clauses 158 and 159. I beg to move.

<a name="60523-10_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General set out our approach to this important but technically complex issue on Report. Two major principles have guided our approach. The first is that we cannot agree to return to the pre-1928 position, under which companies were able to include widely drafted exemption clauses in their articles. The current law sets the balance. It is acceptable for the articles to exempt directors from liability for certain conflicts. But for the necessary protection of the company, it is not acceptable for articles to exempt the directors from others.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_722"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 722</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60523-10_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a>The second principle is that we do not want to prevent the articles doing what they can now do in relation to these matters, which fall within Clauses 158 or 159. Clause 163(4) already enables companies to give authorisation in all the ways that they may do so at the moment. Our amendment to this provision expands it to make clear that the company&#039;s articles may authorise conflicts of interest. The articles may contain provisions for dealing with conflicts of interest, and the directors will not be in breach of duty if they act in accordance with those provisions. Examples might include arrangements whereby the directors withdraw from any board meeting at which the matters relating to conflict of interest are discussed. Clause 213 imposes limits on what the articles may do. Our amendment ensures that the articles are not prevented from doing anything currently possible in relation to conflicts of interest.
</p>

<a name="60523-10_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a>The result of these two government amendments is that everything that may currently be done in the articles for authorising or dealing with conflicts of interest will remain valid and can continue to be done in the future. The Bill will leave the law unchanged in this area. Our amendments will allow all the normal, perfectly acceptable, lawful ways in which companies and their directors deal with conflicts of interest through their articles to continue.
</p>

<a name="60523-10_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a>We accept that these issues are extremely difficult and delicate. We are prepared to continue to look with stakeholders to see whether more can be done to achieve greater clarity without opening up the possibility of widely drafted exemption clauses in companies&#039; constitutions. We hope, on the basis of our amendments, that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his. It is also true that the amendments apply to Clauses 158 and 159.

<p><a name="st_107"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment brings back an issue which we discussed, on which the Government indicated that further consultation would be required. It stems from concerns of the Confederation of British Industry and others.
</p>

<a name="60523-11_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a>The amendment was previously tabled in Grand Committee, and seeks to meet concerns that the Bill goes too far in preventing parent companies indemnifying directors of their subsidiary companies and, in particular, employing companies indemnifying the directors of corporate trustees of their occupational pension schemes. The problem is particularly acute given the limited protection afforded to such employee directors by directors and officers&#039; liability insurance policies currently available.
</p>

<a name="60523-11_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a>The amendment will aid recruitment of and provide appropriate protection for employee directors of subsidiary companies, including company secretaries, who frequently act as directors of subsidiary companies to aid company administration and compliance requirements, and for employees who agree to act as directors of pension trustee subsidiary or associated companies. In Grand Committee, at <i>Hansard</i> cols. GC 366 and GC 367 on 9 February, the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General seemed sympathetic to my amendment, and sought further consultations on the problems highlighted.
</p>

<a name="60523-11_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a>While my amendment may require some further development in due course, we are keen to see the Government accept the principle that parent companies and subsidiary parent undertakings are able to indemnify the directors of subsidiary companies.

We look forward to the Government addressing companies&#039; concerns in this area. I am <br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>




<p><a name="st_108"></a>
<a name="60523-11_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, this amendment deals with two distinct issues: first, exempting or excluding from these provisions the case of an indemnity by a parent company to directors of its wholly owned subsidiaries; and secondly, dealing with pension trustees. I will deal with these separately.
</p>

<a name="60523-11_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a>As my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General explained in Grand Committee, the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004 closed an important loophole concerning the indemnification of directors by third parties. It used to be the practice in some groups of companies for one group company to indemnify a director of another company in the same group. That is not acceptable. If one company in the group is not permitted to provide indemnification, we do not think it is right for another group company to do so.
</p>

<a name="60523-11_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a>It is also important to remember that, at the same time as the loophole was closed, important reforms were introduced that permit all companies to indemnify directors against third-party claims, subject to the requirements in Clause 215. Although we agree that indemnification by a parent company of the directors of its wholly owned subsidiaries is less likely to result in attempts at circumvention of the prohibition than indemnification by a wholly owned subsidiary company of the director of a holding company, we still believe there is scope for potential mischief. We cannot, therefore, accept this aspect of the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60523-11_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a>The amendment also raises the possibility of indemnification by an associated company of a director of a company acting as a trustee of an occupational pension scheme. We made clear in Committee that the Government attach great importance to the work of such directors, and that we are aware that it can sometimes be difficult to recruit high-quality directors for such companies. In view of that, we said that we would look further at the issue, and we have sought the views of key stakeholders.
</p>

<a name="60523-11_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a>The responses were broadly supportive. It was, for example, suggested that there is only a limited market for indemnity insurance in this area, which in turn is expensive. It was also argued that, in principle, there is no reason to prevent indemnification of trustees by reason of the structure adopted for the trust vehicle. In the light of the comments that we have received, we accept that indemnification of trustees is not otherwise a controversial practice and that there are reasonable grounds for concluding that there are concerns that deserve to be addressed. We are, therefore, willing to accept in principle this aspect of the amendment. We will, however, need to consider the drafting of the amendment carefully. I invite the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, to withdraw the amendment with a view to the Government tabling their own in another place.

There is a related problem that I hope may be addressed: if a director of a company that is likely to be targeted by animal terrorists is also a director of other companies, those companies are obliged to disclose his address unless the court has made an order. Terrorists could get hold of a director&#039;s address through that avenue. Can a director of an entirely independent company apply to the court for his address to be withheld? Many people are directors of a number of companies and are all the more valuable for it. Can a director say that he does not want his address to be disclosed, not because of anything that that company may be doing&#151;it may have nothing to do with animal research&#151;but to prevent harassment and intimidation of him via his family? Will that be open to a director in the circumstances that I have envisaged?

There may well be a small number of circumstances in which the current address of a director who has protection under a current filing could be discovered in past filings.

<p><a name="st_116"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 18 brings us to Part 11, whether permission be given. This is concerned with derivative claims, an issue which has given rise to a great deal of concern and about which we have had lengthy debates. We are very grateful to the Government for the important changes that they made to Part 11 at Report stage. They went a long way towards easing concerns on this issue. However, there are still misgivings over the effect that the enactment of this part will have if left as drafted. One should not underestimate the impact of possible threats under this part on the readiness of people to serve as non-executive directors.
</p>

<a name="60523-12_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a>Amendment No. 18 inserts into Clause 243(3) a clear provision requiring a court, in considering whether to give permission to continue a derivative claim, to take into account,


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a>&quot;whether any alternative remedy is available to the member&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-12_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a>That is not clear from the Bill as drafted.
</p>

<a name="60523-12_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a>In its report, <i>Shareholder Remedies</i>, published in 1997, the Law Commission, referring to the case of Barrett v Duckett&#151;1995 1 BCLC 243&#151;recommended that the court should take into account the availability of alternative remedies. Consistently with that recommendation, it included as a factor for a court to take into account whether a remedy is available as an alternative to a derivative claim.
</p>

<a name="60523-12_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a>In the context of contributory winding-up petitions, it has long been held that &quot;alternative remedy&quot; is not confined to an alternative cause of action available to the petitioner, but includes a fair offer to buy the petitioner&#039;s shares. That was the situation in Re a Company in 1983, Re a Company in 1987 and Re Cyracuse Ltd in 2001. An alternative remedy has also always been a potential bar to a derivative action, as in the case of Barrett v Duckett where the alternative remedy on which the court relied was a liquidation offered by the defendant, which the claimant opposed; in other words, this was an alternative means provided by the defendant for the claimant to receive a fair value for her shares. The policy behind this approach is that it would be wrong for the claimant or petitioner to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_727"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 727</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

continue with proceedings that will affect shareholders generally if his grievance can be met in some other way, which may include receiving a fair value for his shares. Whether this is an answer to his grievance on the facts of a particular case will be a matter for the court to decide in the exercise of its discretion.
</p>

<a name="60523-12_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a>Clause 243, &quot;Whether permission to be given&quot;, as it stands, does not incorporate this recommendation of the Law Commission. Clause 243(3)(f), as it now stands, partly addresses the point, but imposes a limit on the concept of alternative remedy by confining it to an alternative cause of action that a member could pursue in his own right. We cannot see any good policy reason for confining the concept of alternative remedy in this way. Nor is the point satisfactorily addressed by Clause 243(3)(a) which requires the court to take into account whether the member is acting in good faith since the requirement of good faith for a claimant in a derivative action has always been treated as a separate hurdle from that imposed by the availability of an alternative remedy. Our amendment would give effect to the Law Commission&#039;s recommendation and would finally achieve a fair and proper balance in this very difficult area. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_117"></a>
<a name="60523-12_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General has said that the provisions relating to derivative claims in Part 11 of the Bill have their origin in the Law Commission&#039;s 1997 report on shareholder remedies. I readily acknowledge this and also acknowledge the argument that this amendment reflects a Law Commission recommendation, although I have to say that I am not wholly persuaded that it is what it intended. Either way, as noble Lords opposite have frequently reminded us, we have to consider proposals on their merits in the context of today.
</p>

<a name="60523-12_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a>There are two important reasons why we cannot support this amendment. In the first place, it seems to us that an offer to buy the petitioner&#039;s shares is not an appropriate remedy in the circumstances of a derivative claim. Such a remedy derives from provisions relating to winding up, and it is a perfectly fair and reasonable remedy in that context where some members want the business to continue and others do not. However, we are dealing here with claims which are brought in the name of the company against a director for breach of duty. The court may in due course find that the director has been negligent or has put his own interests ahead of those of the company. In such circumstances, we believe that the appropriate remedy would be one of the usual consequences of breach of duty, such as damages or compensation where the company has suffered loss or restoration of the company&#039;s property. It is the company that has suffered as the result of the director&#039;s breach of duty and we therefore do not believe that the court should be required to take account of an alternative remedy available essentially between the members, such as an offer to buy the petitioner&#039;s shares.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<a name="60523-12_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a>Secondly, we do not think that the proposed amendment is in the interests of companies or of their shareholders as a whole. Noble Lords have in previous debates in this House rightly drawn attention to the activities of vulture funds. Their arrival is a new element that needs to be taken into account. We believe that there is a strong possibility that the insertion of this additional factor in the list of matters of which the court must take account might encourage such funds to tell companies that they must either buy them out or face a possible derivative claim. In short, we fear that it would be open to abuse.

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, will be willing to withdraw his amendment in the light of these concerns.

I accept the point he made about vulture funds and how this could be an incentive to them. Our amendment was concerned with a situation where the value of the company for the shareholders as a whole might be diminished by prolonged public struggle over some derivative claim that could more easily be solved by the passage of money. We accept that there is the countervailing argument that the Minister has properly put forward. I think we have taken this as far as we can this afternoon. I am grateful to the Minister for his response. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="60523-13_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville </b>   moved Amendment No. 27:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a>Page 137, line 20, leave out from &quot;a&quot; to end of line 22 and insert &quot;day that is not a working day&quot;</p>

</p>

<a name="60523-13_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a group of minor technical amendments. The Bill defines a working day in Clause 789. The definition could have been used in Clauses 307, 310 and 624, but was not, so the amendments tidy up the drafting. There is no substantive change. However, I am delighted we have found this error at this late stage. I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a>Clause 322 [<i>Members&#039; power to require independent report on poll</i>]:
</p>




<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="60523-13_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts </b>   moved Amendment No. 29:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a>Leave out Clause 322.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-13_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 29, I also speak to Amendments Nos. 32 to 38, by which we seek to strike out 10 clauses from this already overlong Bill. The amendments would remove the new provisions in the Bill relating to members&#039; powers to require an independent report on a poll. We discussed this issue, too, in Grand Committee and on Report. Each time, we asked the Government a number of questions, which frankly still remain unanswered. The first question is: what mischief are the provisions supposed to remedy? The Minister justified them by saying that they were there because of a recommendation by the Company Law Review. He went on to say:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a>&quot;The problem they were seeking to put right was a lack of confidence in the integrity and effectiveness of the voting processes in quoted companies. Their&quot;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-13_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a>that is, the Company Law Review&#039;s&#151;


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a>&quot;objective was to deal with what was perceived to be a problem in registering voting instructions&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 9/5/06; col. 896.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-13_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a>My understanding of that reply is that no mischief needs remedying. The problem is a perceived one, as the Minister himself put it. We have not heard a single example or been given any evidence of cases where there has been an actual problem. We would therefore say that introducing these clumsy and burdensome requirements is an over-reaction. Surely there are less expensive and less restrictive ways of challenging this perception than by forcing this type of burden on all public companies.
</p>

<a name="60523-13_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a>A second unanswered question is: what value will these provisions add? Again, the Minister&#039;s reply on Report was that the benefit was improving confidence in investors. He also said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a>&quot;If an independent report found the poll to have been carried out improperly, the chairman&#039;s declaration made at the time could still stand. The company would be able to ensure through its articles that this would be the outcome of any report on a poll. <br>&nbsp;<br>

</ul>

<a name="column_730"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 730</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>What such a report would do, of course, is to put the directors on notice that the company&#039;s polling processes needed improving&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 9/5/06; col. 897.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-13_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a>It seems to me that, with this response, the Minister has shot his own fox. The report will not, apparently, have sufficient authority to challenge the result of an improperly conducted poll; nor will it require the directors to change procedures. Instead, it will put them &quot;on notice&quot;. This seems to be an awfully expensive and time-consuming way of achieving a minor objective. Surely directors will be on notice of any problem, perceived or real, by complaints from shareholders. The directors can authorise an independent poll themselves if the complaints appear to be valid, but to give members the right always to require such a poll is simply asking for abuse by minority interests.
</p>

<a name="60523-13_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a>Finally, the clauses do not reflect the reality of present-day company meetings. Resolutions used to be carried out almost exclusively on the basis of a show of hands, but no longer. Today, polls are increasingly used&#151;a trend that must be expected to intensify in the future. As the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, pointed out in his powerful contribution on Report:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a>&quot;It is important to understand that current practice is for most annual general meetings of shareholders to be conducted by poll. This is not something that happened under the 1948 Act or preceding Acts. The notion of a poll under those pieces of legislation was of something that happened when the board was in trouble and not supported by a show of hands&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 9/5/06; col. 895-6.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-13_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a>So we are not talking about hypothetical rare cases where polls might be demanded and where an independent assessment might be needed.

</p>

<a name="60523-13_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a>The Minister concluded:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a>&quot;These new provisions form part of the Government&#039;s wider objective to promote greater transparency and improve shareholder engagement&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 9/5/06; col. 897.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-13_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a>We do not disagree with the importance of those objectives, but these clauses do nothing to achieve them. The potential burdens of these provisions far outweigh any possible benefits. The Minister, valiantly though he has tried, has failed to provide a compelling argument for us to support the new provisions in this Bill. I beg to move.
<a name="time_11"></a>
<a name="60523-13_time0"></a><h5>4.45 pm</h5>
</p>




<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="60523-13_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, I will not repeat the arguments that we discussed in Committee and on Report about why these provisions are justified and the support from organisations&#151;City representatives and practitioners&#151;which are concerned with improving voting practice across UK quoted companies. I will just emphasise the key point made to us last week by the Investment Management Association. It said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a>&quot;An independent scrutiny of a poll would add critically to confidence in the integrity of the voting process and company law should require a scrutiny if requested by shareholders&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-13_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a>On Report, I addressed noble Lords&#039; concerns about the practical operation of these provisions, how the poll report should not change the outcome of a meeting and why bringing an action under Clause 459 does not provide a satisfactory, cost-effective means of remedy <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_731"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 731</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

for the shareholders. However, the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, pressed further for evidence of the problem that we seek to cure. Inspired by his words that I should take an axe to these clauses and hack them out as an example of deregulation, I returned to the fray to see whether there was evidence and support from the City community on whether this was valuable or necessary. We had a rather strong reaction that this continues to be necessary and is valuable in practical terms today.

</p>

<a name="60523-13_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a>Let me give some examples that have been cited to us. In 2003, there was the much-publicised vote at GlaxoSmithKline to approve the directors&#039; remuneration report, which was defeated by just half a per cent. Then there was a directors&#039; remuneration report at BAE Systems, which the Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended voting against. The concern was whether the company had voted the shares held in American depositary receipts where no voting instructions had been given in order to ensure that the report was approved. Further examples that we have been given are mostly around where the vote has been contentious in nature, whether the count has been very close or questions about how shares held in ADRs have been voted. In each case, we are told that the right for shareholders to require an independent report would have helped allay concerns about the reputations of the companies in question.
</p>

<a name="60523-13_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sharman, has suggested that since most polls are conducted by the registrar, who&#151;perhaps I may quote the noble Lord&#151;&quot;is usually pretty independent&quot;, there is no need for these provisions. Earlier evidence to the Company Law Review suggested that that is exactly where the problems lie. It had evidence to suggest that the registering and counting of votes was accident-prone and that there were problems between registrars recording the votes on behalf of companies and those seeking to execute votes, in particular the institutional investors. Thus, the independent report is intended to scrutinise relations between those casting and those recording the votes and to act as a stick to ensure that rigorous voting systems are in place.
</p>

<a name="60523-13_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a>Noble Lords say that these provisions are unjustifiably regulatory and burdensome. We disagree. These provisions are giving shareholders, not some outside regulatory body, an additional tool by which to hold the directors to account. There is no burden on a quoted company unless shareholders exercise the right to require an independent report. Companies will not need to invest in setting up complex systems in advance just in case and, as I said on Report, shareholders of companies with good, transparent voting processes are less likely to ask for independent reports. These provisions are aimed at those with less reliable processes.
</p>

<a name="60523-13_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a>Noble Lords cannot have it both ways. If they voted recently to ensure that shareholders, by whatever means&#151;nominee or otherwise&#151;they hold their shares, can exercise their votes, then they should be in favour of empowering shareholders with this right to ask for the poll to be scrutinised. To remove these <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_732"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 732</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

provisions from the Bill would be a backward step in terms of promoting greater transparency and enhancing shareholder engagement. I therefore urge the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

<a name="60523-14_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, I am very disappointed by the Minister&#039;s response, although I congratulate him on having dug up GlaxoSmithKline and BAE Systems, which are two important examples. I do not think that he should drag the nominee issue into this. This is quite different. The nominee issue was about empowering people to exercise their votes. This is about how their votes will be cast.

</p>

<a name="60523-14_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a>Frankly, there are probably a couple of cases, but the reality is that now, if institutional shareholders wished to obtain an independent poll, it would be an extremely brave company that said that it did not want an independent assessment of a poll. If a group of institutions said that they wanted it independently assessed, the company would say fine, because the damage to its reputation and its positioning in the City would be so great as to be incalculable if it did not agree.
</p>

<a name="60523-14_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a> We have here a huge piece of legislation: 10 clauses and five pages, which could be used by people such as the GlaxoSmithKline animal rights activists to cause a great deal of trouble and expense for investing companies. I do not think that the minor trouble that the Minister has managed to identify justifies the insertion of 10 clauses. I seek to test the opinion of the House.

<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="60523-15_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Northover </b>   moved Amendment No. 39:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a>Page 182, line 24, leave out &quot;In the case of a quoted company&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="st_125"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I rise to speak to Amendments Nos. 39 to 41, which stand in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Razzall. We discussed in Committee and at Report stage the genesis of these amendments. We originally welcomed the DTI&#039;s proposal of the OFR as a significant move toward greater corporate transparency and accountability, including in relation to the physical and social environment in which a company works. As the Minister knows, we regretted the Chancellor&#039;s commitment in November 2005, in a speech to the CBI, to abandon the OFR. At Report, we welcomed the improvements to the business review, which incorporated a number of the original OFR provisions. However, we feel that the Government have still not gone far enough, and I thank the Trade Justice Movement and CORE for their help in focusing on these extremely important issues.
</p>

<a name="60523-15_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a>Amendments Nos. 39 and 41 seek to expand the number of companies that would have to include information about their impact on the environment, the company&#039;s employees and social and community issues in their business review. The Bill currently requires quoted companies to include in their business review assessments of that same information, although it is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a>&quot;to the extent necessary for an understanding of the development, performance or position of the company&#039;s business&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-15_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a>however that might be interpreted.
</p>

<a name="60523-15_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a>Surely, it is right that a larger number of companies&#151;not just those that are publicly quoted&#151;should be required to disclose information on social and community issues and the impact of the company&#039;s business on the environment. As highlighted on Report by my noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury, many companies responsible for the worst abuses around the world&#151;for example, those named in the OECD report on operations in the DRC&#151;are not publicly quoted companies. It therefore seems appropriate that all companies which have to produce a business review, not just the approximately 1,500 publicly listed companies, should be required to report on the full range of their impacts in a manner consistent with the size and complexity of their business operations.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_736"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 736</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60523-15_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a>These amendments seek to achieve that. Amendment No. 39 would extend the provision beyond listed companies and Amendment No. 41 would extend the provision to include medium-sized businesses to report as is appropriate to their complexity. I would note&#151;and this may need to be addressed in the other place&#151;that with subsection (5), which we welcome as far as it goes, added into Clause 396, there is some overlap between that and subsection (6), leading to a certain lack of clarity about where the additional provisions apply. I mentioned before, on Report, that the Government should produce guidelines about what they have mind; perhaps that should be done, as well as clarifying the clause, when this Bill reaches the other place.
</p>

<a name="60523-15_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a>Amendment No. 40 addresses another area. As well as information on social and environmental issues, an understanding of the treatment of suppliers is pertinent to the understanding of the company&#039;s business and the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. It therefore makes sense that supplier issues&#151;that is to say contractual or other arrangements with individuals that the business is dependent on&#151;should be added to the list of factors on which directors should have to provide information in the business review. We therefore seek to add this.
</p>

<a name="60523-15_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a>In all, these amendments are about transparency, accountability and wider corporate social responsibility. Last night I attended the global business coalition on HIV/AIDS where major companies&#151;Unilever, Merck, Amex and L&#039;Oreal&#151;won awards for what they are doing to help combat AIDS in Africa. They should be commended for that and would, I am sure, be happy to have their track record in these areas in the public domain. This is a chance to spread good practice, and I therefore commend the amendments to the House. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_126"></a>
<a name="60523-15_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   My Lords, I support the amendments standing in the name of my noble friend Lady Northover and my own. If my noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury had been here he would have wanted to make one specific point. Sadly, he cannot be here as he is on the Joint Committee on Consolidation, &c., Bills, the lucky fellow.
</p>

<a name="60523-15_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a>The obvious response to my noble friend&#039;s amendment is that an unnecessary burden would be put on small and medium-sized businesses. From our point of view, the sting is taken out of that opposition by reference to the words in the clause,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a>&quot;to the extent necessary for an understanding of . . . the company&#039;s business&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-15_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a>Clearly, by definition, the smaller the company, the less information will have to be provided, because it will not be necessary for an understanding of the company&#039;s business. That provides an overarching protection to meet the necessary concerns that a number of people have, especially the NGOs, about the depredations by non-listed companies in the Third World, and getting the balance right between ensuring that they are caught by having to put the necessary <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_737"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 737</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

information in the business review while, at the same time, not imposing excessive burdens on small businesses.
</p>




<p><a name="st_127"></a>
<a name="60523-15_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Shutt of Greetland: </b>   My Lords, I support my noble friend on this, as there is a very serious issue here. In recent years, there has been this movement of the cult of private equity. We should look at the size of companies and not necessarily at the ownership of companies. Indeed, without this, that cult of private equity could go even further. It is actually a way of avoiding all sorts of regulation that some might think of as onerous but others may well think of as very proper. So looking at the size of company is a far better approach than looking at the particular method of ownership.
</p>




<p><a name="st_128"></a>
<a name="60523-15_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, the noble Baroness tabled some amendments on Report that were similar in effect although slightly different in detail. As before, the effect of the amendments would be to strengthen the requirements of the business review and reintroduce elements of the operating and financial review.

</p>

<a name="60523-15_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a>Amendment No. 39 would be significant gold-plating of the EU accounts modernisation directive and would impose unduly onerous narrative reporting burdens on unquoted companies. Subsection (5) of Clause 396 sets out certain information that quoted companies will need to ensure that their business review includes, to the extent necessary to understand the development, performance or position of the company&#039;s business.
</p>

<a name="60523-15_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a>There was little evidence from the Government&#039;s recent consultation on narrative reporting to suggest that any requirements to report on specific information should apply to a different set of companies. We see no justification for imposing all the business review requirements on non-quoted companies. It is quoted companies, which trade shares on the open market, for which additional reporting and scrutiny is justified. To do otherwise would be to impose undue cost burdens on business and risk hindering the competitiveness of UK companies. It is always difficult to draw the correct line in determining what classes of entities should be subject to obligations, but these are the lines we believe appropriate to draw for company law. It does not help the situation to say that for a smaller company a smaller amount of information would be involved. The proposed requirements would be onerous for companies.
</p>

<a name="60523-15_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a>Amendment No. 40 would in a different way make the provisions of Clause 396 more onerous than the EU directive requires. Subsection (5) currently requires quoted companies, where necessary to understand the business, to report on certain environmental, employee, social and community matters and policies relating to these matters. In determining what specific elements to require quoted companies to include, we took careful account of the issues respondents to the recent consultation on narrative reporting pressed.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_738"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 738</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60523-15_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a>We understand that reporting on contractual or other arrangements essential to the business was regarded as important to some respondents to the Government&#039;s recent consultation. However, we have to weigh up their concerns with those of others pressing to ensure that no undue reporting burdens on business are imposed. We believe that what we have proposed is a balanced package which reflects the outcome of the consultation and our discussions with interested parties. Clearly, where contractual and other arrangements are essential to the business, such information is required by subsection (4) to be included for a balanced and comprehensive analysis consistent with the size and complexity of the business.
</p>

<a name="60523-15_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a>Amendment No. 41 would remove the exemption for medium-sized companies from reporting non-financial key performance indicators. As I explained at Report, the exemption is an option that the EU directive allows member states in implementing the business review requirements. Again, we see no justification for not granting this exemption in the UK.
</p>

<a name="60523-15_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a>We have limited to quoted companies the requirement for specific information relating to environmental, employee, social and community issues to be included in the business review for a better understanding of the business. But if the directors of other companies consider that such information is necessary for an understanding of the company&#039;s business, they may, of course, include it. This is a matter for the directors&#039; judgment.
</p>

<a name="60523-15_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a>At Report, your Lordships, including those on the same Benches as the noble Baroness, congratulated the Government on getting the balance on the narrative reporting package about right. Our overriding objective has been to ensure effective and appropriate narrative reporting without imposing unnecessary burdens on companies. We believe that to change the package we have developed in the way that the noble Baroness seeks will be to risk altering the balance towards putting undue reporting obligations on business and impeding the competitiveness of UK companies. I therefore urge the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendments.

<a name="60523-16_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Northover: </b>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. However, he did not address some of the points that I and my noble friends made, especially in relation to non-quoted large companies and their effect in developing countries. However, the Bill will now go to another place. These issues cause considerable concern and we need to get them right. I am not yet convinced that we have them quite right. There are few opportunities for this extensive review.
</p>

<a name="60523-16_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a>As I say, I am sure that there will further discussion on the matter in another place. Therefore, in the expectation that that will occur, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a>After Clause 443, insert the following new clause&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_9"></a><br>
&quot;DATA PROTECTION

<br>
 Nothing in sections 440 to 443 authorises the making of a disclosure in contravention of the Data Protection Act 1998 (c. 29).&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_131"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, Amendment No. 42 inserts a new clause after Clause 443. This says that nothing in Sections 440 to 443, which deal with the obtaining and disclosure of information by a body&#151;expected to be the Financial Reporting Review Panel&#151;authorises a disclosure that contravenes the Data Protection Act. This is a modest amendment, designed to ensure that, as a minimum, this Bill is internally consistent about the disclosure of confidential information. The application of the Data Protection Act is explicitly referred to in Clause 638, which deals with information disclosure provisions relevant to the Takeover Panel.
</p>

<a name="60523-16_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a>At Report I tabled an amendment which referred to both the Data Protection Act and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. The Minister said that he had sympathy with the element relating to the Data Protection Act, and said that he would consider it before Third Reading. Imagine my disappointment on finding that no such amendment had been tabled by the Government. I felt it necessary to re-table the amendment in so far as it relates to the Data Protection Act to see why the Government resist this important reference to that Act, and also why the Act is relevant to the Takeover Panel&#039;s disclosure, but not to the FRRP&#039;s.

Given that there is such specific reference to the Data Protection Act in other disclosure gateway provisions&#151;for example in Clauses 638 and 639 of the Bill&#151;we agreed to bring forward an amendment relating to the Data Protection Act at Third Reading. Unfortunately, other amendments have been given a higher priority and we have therefore been unable to table an amendment as promised. However, I can assure the noble Baroness that it is our firm intention to bring forward an amendment relating to the Data Protection Act in another place to mirror similar provisions in this Bill and in the Companies Act 1985. I hope the noble Baroness will, despite her disappointment, withdraw her amendment accordingly.

</ul>
<p>


</p>



<p class="tabletext"><a name="amdt_10"></a><br>
LIABILITY FOR FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS IN REPORTS

<br>
(1)   The reports to which this section applies are&#151;


<br>
(a)   the directors&#039; report,


<br>
(b)   the directors&#039; remuneration report, and


<br>
(c)   a summary financial statement so far as it is derived from either of those reports.


<br>
(2)   A director of a company is liable to compensate the company for any loss suffered by it as a result of&#151;


<br>
(a)   any untrue or misleading statement in a report to which this section applies, or


<br>
(b)   the omission from a report to which this section applies of anything required to be included in it.


<br>
(3)   He is so liable only if&#151;


<br>
(a)   he knew the statement to be untrue or misleading or was reckless as to whether it was untrue or misleading, or


<br>
(b)   he knew the omission to be dishonest concealment of a material fact.


<br>
(4)   No person shall be subject to any liability to a person other than the company resulting from reliance, by that person or another, on information in a report to which this section applies.


<br>
(5)   The reference in subsection (4) to a person being subject to a liability includes a reference to another person being entitled as against him to be granted any civil remedy or to rescind or repudiate an agreement.


<br>
(6)   This section does not affect&#151;


<br>
(a)   liability for a civil penalty, or


<br>
(b)   liability for a criminal offence.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_135"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to speak to the two amendments in my name in this group. At Report I told the House that we would bring forward amendments to clarify the position on the liability of directors and issuers, relating to narrative reporting and transparency directive disclosures, as soon as possible. I could not commit firmly to doing so at Third Reading. Much depended on the responses of interested parties to the draft clauses, issued for comment on 3 May, as to what measures the Government might introduce. I am pleased therefore that we have been able to table these new clauses in time to give the House the opportunity for debate before the Bill passes to the other place. In doing so, I would like to record our appreciation for those who commented on the original draft clauses so quickly. This helped us address initial concerns and refine the clauses accordingly into what we have introduced to the House.
</p>

<a name="60523-16_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a>I note that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, tabled our original draft clause as an amendment, but has now withdrawn it; she will have seen that we have moved forward somewhat since the draft in light of comments received. I am happy that the noble Baroness seems to be in agreement with our approach. Let me now expand on that approach before setting out clause details. These provisions provide directors and companies with a degree of certainty about the extent of their liability, so as not to inhibit transparent and meaningful narrative reporting. The clauses should be read and understood as part of the wider provisions in the Bill, dealing with directors&#039; duties and companies&#039; reporting obligations. They deal only with directors&#039; liability for the content of narrative reporting and with issuers&#039; liability to investors for the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_741"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 741</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

content of reports or statements required to be made public under the transparency directive. They do not deal with any liability that may arise in respect of the underlying matters covered by the report. In other words, it is about what is said in the reports, not about liability for the underlying actions of directors. Further, it is addressed to issues of compensation and does not affect regulatory sanctions which may be relevant, such as those of the Financial Reporting Review Panel and the Financial Services Authority.
</p>

<a name="60523-16_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a>In developing a civil liability regime, the Government seek to ensure that the scope of liability is reasonable in relation to expectations, the existing law and the law as it will be after the implementation of the transparency directive. The purpose of doing so is to encourage meaningful and open reporting. The Government are also anxious not to extend unnecessarily the scope of any duties which might be owed to investors or wider classes of third party, in order to protect the interests of company members, employees and creditors.
</p>

<a name="60523-16_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a>I turn now to the detail of both clauses. The key differences between them concern the kind of reporting that is covered, who should be liable&#151;the directors or the company&#151;and to whom they are liable. Thus the new clause before Clause 444 is concerned with liability for reporting under this Bill. It specifies that the liability provisions only apply to statements made in the directors&#039; report, the directors&#039; remuneration report, or summary financial statements derived from them. The clause limits the directors&#039; liability to the company only. In other words, directors will not be liable to individual investors or third parties. This in effect codifies the Caparo principle. That principle is reinforced by Clause 396(2), which specifies that the purpose of the business review is to inform the members of the company and help them assess how the directors have performed their duty under Clause 155 to promote the success of the company.
</p>

<a name="60523-16_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a>The clause also specifies that the directors will only be liable in certain circumstances; that is, for untrue or misleading statements or omissions made in bad faith or recklessly, or where there is deliberate and dishonest concealment. It is the liability for reliance on the report that the clause is concerned with not, for example, liability for defamation. Subsection (4) makes clear that third parties such as auditors will remain liable to the company for negligence in preparing their own report.
</p>

<a name="60523-16_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a>I now turn to the second amendment in the group. We propose to insert a series of revised clauses in a new Part 33A, including other provisions which comprehensively implement all transparency obligations. Within those provisions, we propose to insert a new Section 90A into the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, establishing a regime for civil liability to third parties by companies admitted to trading on a regulated market in respect of disclosures under the transparency directive.
</p>

<a name="60523-16_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a>No liability on the part of issuers or their directors has been found to shareholders and other investors in respect of information communicated to them and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_742"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 742</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

subsequently made public by the issuer. Substantial changes in recent years to the law relating to the operation of financial markets and the obligations of the issuer to the market, culminating in Articles 4 to 7 of the transparency directive, have cast doubt on that position and lead to a position of uncertainty as to whether there is any liability and, if so, what and to whom any relevant duty is owed.
</p>

<a name="60523-16_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a>The transparency directive requires that member states must ensure that their laws, regulations and administrative provisions on liability apply to issuers, or the persons responsible in the issuers, for the information required to be disclosed. Read with the relevant recital, those provisions give considerable flexibility to member states. As the wording of the directive implies a presumption towards liability to a wider class of people than the position in the UK under Caparo, it is desirable that this uncertainty be clarified now in respect of obligations arising from the transparency directive.
</p>

<a name="60523-16_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a>The clause makes issuers admitted to trading on a regulated market liable in respect of the periodic information required to be disclosed under Articles 4, 5 and 6 of the directive as given effect by FSA rules. That would include annual and half-yearly financial statements and management reports, the sign-off by directors or other responsible parties, as well as interim management statements. Issuers would be liable where the disclosures contained statements that were misleading, false or deceptive at the time the statements were made, and such statements were made in bad faith or recklessly. Issuers would only be liable to holders of securities in the issuer who had reasonably relied on the statements for investment purposes and suffered loss as a result.
</p>

<a name="60523-16_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a>As I said earlier, we are grateful to the people who have commented on the earlier draft of these clauses. They raised a number of concerns, some of which resulted in us making changes to the clauses. Let me address some of the key points raised with us. First, have we set the right bar for liability? The Government&#039;s objective is to encourage meaningful, strategic narrative reporting. We need to ensure appropriate standards of care and discipline in drawing up the directors&#039; report. Taken together with the directors&#039; duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence under Clause 157, which applies equally to the way in which directors fulfil their duty in reporting, we believe that we have done so.
</p>

<a name="60523-16_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a>Secondly, several commentators have asked about liability for information included in voluntary operating and financial reviews. We see no reason why information that would have been in a voluntary OFR could not be included in the statutory business review, on the basis that it contributes to a balanced and comprehensive analysis of the company&#039;s business performance. If companies include voluntary OFR information by clear cross reference, the intention is that this would be covered by the new clauses. As now, directors may put their own disclaimers on any reporting that goes beyond statutory requirements.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 743</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60523-16_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a>Thirdly, business and legal interests have suggested that the scope of the liability regime should be expanded to cover the liability of issuers in respect of non-transparency directive disclosures, such as disclosures under the market abuse regime. As I indicated only moments ago, the purpose of these clauses is to establish the civil liability position of issuers arising from disclosures required by the transparency directive, which is why we have focused only on reports required under the directive. This is not intended to affect the regime for the enforcement of the market abuse directive.
</p>

<a name="60523-16_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a>Representations have been made that liability in damages in respect of disclosures required by the market abuse regime, which will be included shortly afterwards in the material protected by the transparency directive regime, needs to be treated in a similar way. At this stage, we are not convinced that that must be addressed, but there is time for further representations to be made.
</p>

<a name="60523-16_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a>The fourth concern is the risk of issuers in UK-regulated markets being sued in other EU jurisdictions under the national law implementing the transparency directive. The Government&#039;s preference is that issuers should be sued primarily in the jurisdiction for which they have opted as their home member state for the purposes of the prospectus directive and transparency directive. The Government will continue to examine how such an outcome might be achieved, recognising that this matter is governed by EC law.
</p>

<a name="60523-16_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a>We have worked hard to produce these clauses in a very short time and we think that they are in reasonably good shape. We appreciate that people have had only a very short time to comment on them and we are grateful for the comments received. We thought it important for this House to have the opportunity to debate the clauses before passing the Bill to the other place. Of course, if anyone has further comments, we will give them very careful consideration as the Bill progresses. I beg to move.

<p><a name="stpa_235"></a>I knew that I was pushing at an open door; nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the Government were able to bring the amendments forward so that the Bill could go to another place with the clauses inserted. Perhaps I may explain that I tabled the draft clauses put forward by the Government because I was under the impression that the Government were not going to table them in time for Third Reading. When I discovered that they had tabled them, of course I immediately withdrew the earlier draft amendments. I tabled them so that the Government could tell us where they had got to.

</p>

<a name="60523-17_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a>I want to raise one point for clarification. The Minister talked about additional OFR-type disclosures coming within the directors&#039; review. Let us suppose that a non-quoted company chooses to comply with Clause 396(5)&#151;an area covered by amendments in a previous group&#151;extending beyond quoted companies the additional requirements which deal with the future development of the business. If a company chooses to include something in its directors&#039; report which it is not required to do, will the directors continue to be protected, even though there is no requirement for them to cover future prospects if it is not a quoted company?
</p>

<a name="60523-17_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a>Subject to that one point of clarification, we believe that the clauses&#151;in particular, in relation to the business review&#151;will have a massive impact on enabling better narrative reporting, and we are pleased to support the amendments.

<p><a name="st_137"></a>
<a name="60523-17_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   My Lords, I am sure that these clauses go very much in the right direction but I want to ask the noble Lord one question about the different treatment of the two paragraphs of subsection (3). In subsection (3)(a), the director is to be liable either if he knew that the statement was untrue or misleading or if he was reckless as to whether it was untrue or misleading. So if, when he reads a positive statement, he says to himself, &quot;Crumbs, that seems to me pretty odd. I can&#039;t think why on earth the finance director is saying that. He may well be trying to mislead somebody but I don&#039;t know and I can&#039;t be bothered to ask him&quot;, then he is reckless and liable.
</p>

<a name="60523-17_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a>However, in subsection (3)(b), he is liable only if he knew that an omission was a dishonest concealment of a fact. So if he says to himself, &quot;This is pretty odd. The finance director hasn&#039;t told us anything about contingent liabilities. That may well be because he&#039;s very worried about that guarantee we gave and he doesn&#039;t want anyone to know about it. But I don&#039;t know whether that is so and I can&#039;t be bothered to ask&quot;, then he is not liable. I do not see why recklessness applies to something that is said, but does not apply to something that is omitted which causes equal suspicions in the director&#039;s breast but which he does not bother to elucidate and recklessly allows to go forward. I find the distinction odd and would be grateful for some enlightenment.

<p><a name="st_140"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment would convert the negative statutory instrument procedure into an affirmative one for Clause 479, which will allow the Government to require companies to disclose the terms on which auditors are appointed. The power is pure bureaucracy and red tape. There is no demand from shareholders to see auditors&#039; terms of appointment. The Financial Reporting Council, which has consulted recently on the matter, has the power to require companies to disclose them but has chosen not to do so for the time being for lack of demand. Anyone who has seen terms of appointment will know that they are highly legalistic and contain no decision-useful information.

<a name="60523-17_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sharman, who I am sad to see is not in his place today, brought in for the education of the Minister last week some examples of terms of appointment.

</p>

<a name="60523-17_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a>We would like to see the clause deleted but recognise that the very existence of red tape powers is important to Ministers and their officials, and we would not want to deprive them of this small pleasure. If Ministers ever decide that they want to activate that power, it is incumbent on them to come to Parliament and make their case for using it. That is what the affirmative procedure involves. The negative procedure compels Ministers to justify their decisions only if the Opposition are eagle-eyed and pray against the order. The CBI thinks that the affirmative procedure is the right one, and so do we. I beg to move.

Perhaps I may say how grateful I am to the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, for sending me in confidence a copy of an audit engagement letter. I certainly understand his view that few shareholders would be interested in reading all of it.

<p><a name="st_148"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, my winning streak might come to an end. In moving Amendment No. 46, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 49. These add two new subsections to Clause 493, the clause which creates for the first time a statutory criminal offence for a particular profession.
</p>

<a name="60523-18_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a>It is often said that hard cases make bad law. With regard to the offence created by Clause 493, there are no cases that have led to this provision, and I do not believe that that is the basis for good law. The Government have adduced only hypothetical examples of auditor behaviour that they seek to penalise by this offence. In the many discussions with those still actively engaged in my former profession, everyone has struggled to work out who in practice the new offence would catch beyond those dealt with in the existing criminal code and the current Fraud Bill.

<a name="column_747"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 747</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

on recklessness. I am no lawyer but I know that offences involving recklessness are notoriously difficult to define with precision. The Government know that too, because in Clauses 494 and 495 they have gone to great lengths to ensure that the effect of Clause 493 will be moderated by guidance issued by the Secretary of State. The Government need that guidance because they know that the new offence will play havoc with the professional disciplinary arrangements that exist for auditors. Those who are the guardians of those arrangements have given warning of this.
</p>

<a name="60523-18_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a>The uncertain nature of this offence is likely to lead the auditing profession to retreat into risk-averse and costly audit procedures to provide auditors with as much certainty as possible that they will not fall foul of the new law. This will not be box-ticking, as has occasionally been suggested. It will be additional layers of review and duplication of processes. It will add no value but it will add cost to British industry. As noble Lords will be aware, my preferred solution would be the elimination of Clauses 493 to 495. It remains my hope that the Government will reach that conclusion when the Bill is considered in another place. For today, I am seeking to explore the meaning that the Government intend for the offences set out in Clause 493(1) and (2).
</p>

<a name="60523-18_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a>My Amendment No. 46 introduces a new subsection which says that an offence is not committed under subsection (1) if a person did not know that there was a significant risk that through his deliberate omissions or acts he would cause a misleading, false or deceptive report to be issued. That means that there has to be knowledge and it should be judged subjectively. Amendment No. 49 has a similar effect in relation to the subsection (2) offence.
</p>

<a name="60523-18_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a>In these amendments I am seeking to set out that I understand what the Minister and his officials mean by &quot;recklessly&quot; in the context of Clause 493. I thank the Minister for the helpful meeting that he arranged last week to discuss this. But some in the auditing profession have been advised by counsel in an opinion that I saw only this morning that such a criminal offence will require proof of dishonesty. The Minister appears to think not, as he has said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a>&quot;It has been suggested that changing to &#039;fraudulently or dishonestly&#039; is the only way of reassuring auditors that they will not be prosecuted for an honest mistake. That is wrong, not because prosecutors would have to prove dishonesty&#151;they would not&#151;but because these offences cannot be committed as a genuine mistake or through negligence&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 10/05/06; cols. 1031-32.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-18_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a>The Government say that it will not be necessary to prove dishonesty, and the auditing profession has been advised of the opposite. There is a potentially harmful gulf in understanding.
</p>

<a name="60523-18_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a>The Minister knows that I have no intention of pressing my amendments today, and wish to use the debate to get greater clarity over the Government&#039;s intentions. I therefore hope that the Government will say, first, precisely in what ways the formulation in my new subsection departs from the Government&#039;s <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_748"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 748</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

intentions for the clause. If, as the Minister has said at the Dispatch Box, dishonesty will not have to be proved, I hope he will also give an undertaking that further discussions will take place with the auditing profession&#151;possibly also involving the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General&#151;as to the real meaning of &quot;recklessness&quot; in the Clause 493 offence. The Minister will be aware that the importance of this goes beyond Clause 493, because the Bill is littered with recklessness offences, including those in the amendments that we have just debated.
</p>

<a name="60523-18_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a>Unless Clause 493 is radically changed in another place, I anticipate that the blunderbuss nature of the offence will need to be refined by the guidance anticipated under Clauses 494 and 495. I hope that the Minister will also say something about that guidance: what form it will take, how and when it will be prepared and who will be involved in its preparation. I beg to move.

<a name="60523-18_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   My Lords, I support the comments of the noble Baroness. It is a pity that, as we passed through our period of purdah in the Moses Room and on Report, we on the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Benches were not able to persuade the Government that there was a problem with &quot;knowingly or recklessly&quot; for the purposes of this clause. As the noble Baroness has indicated, this is important because, if the Government are wrong in their interpretation of the clause, it potentially criminalises negligence by auditors for the first time. It would be the first time a professional individual has been subject to criminal prosecution for negligence where there is no damage to life or limb&#151;there is obviously health and safety legislation, et cetera.
</p>

<a name="60523-18_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a>The difficulty is that the words &quot;knowingly or recklessly&quot; are rather different in common parlance from the way in which they have been interpreted by the courts and the House of Lords. When the Prime Minister went into Iraq, he clearly did it knowingly; he might or might not have done it recklessly; he would certainly argue that he did not do it dishonestly, although others might have taken a different view. Had the question of whether he had knowingly or recklessly gone into Iraq been subject to the interpretation of the top court in our land, the definition would have required him to have been dishonest to have done it knowingly or recklessly, as case law has consistently indicated. The problem, as the noble Baroness indicated, is that, in his remarks on Second Reading, the Minister&#151;presumably speaking from notes provided by his officials&#151;indicated that, in his view, &quot;knowingly or recklessly&quot; in this context went further than the requirement accepted by the House of Lords in endless litigation, which is that to act knowingly or recklessly requires dishonesty.
</p>

<a name="60523-18_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a>Wherever we get to on these amendments&#151;I know that the noble Baroness is not pressing them&#151;it is vital for accountancy practice that the Minister makes clear what the government interpretation of &quot;knowingly or recklessly&quot; is. Does it or does it not require, as up until now the law has required, that definition to include dishonesty?

<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="60523-18_spnew1"></a><b> Viscount Bledisloe: </b>   My Lords, with her Amendments Nos. 46 and 49, the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, obviously and properly intends to increase an auditor&#039;s protection against being prosecuted. I entirely agree that Amendment No. 49 is necessary and helpful to protect an auditor. On the other hand, I am worried that Amendment No. 46 in fact weakens subsection (1) rather than strengthening it. This is dependent on how you read subsection (1). The words are,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a>&quot;knowingly or recklessly causes a report . . . to include any matter that is misleading, false&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-18_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a>and so on. One interpretation would be that the only question governed by &quot;knowingly or recklessly&quot; is, &quot;Did he cause that matter to be included?&quot;. He did, so is it misleading? If it is, he has committed an offence. I do not think that that is the proper interpretation of this clause, or the interpretation that a court would come to. I think a court would say, &quot;Did he knowingly or recklessly cause the report to include misleading matter?&quot;; that is, did he know or was he reckless as to whether the matter was misleading, not whether it was included? However, I agree that that is open to doubt.
</p>

<a name="60523-18_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a>If the second interpretation, which I prefer, is right, then the amendment of the noble Baroness weakens the clause, because it says that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a>&quot;he did not know that there was a significant risk that through his omissions&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-18_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a>et cetera. That is much lower than reckless. An amendment to subsection (1) is needed&#151;although I approve of the amendment of the noble Baroness to subsection (2)&#151;saying, &quot;if he is knowing or reckless in causing misleading matter to be included&quot;, so that it is quite clear that &quot;knowingly and recklessly&quot; governs the inclusion of misleading matter, not the inclusion of matter which is then found to be objectively misleading.

<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="60523-19_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, we have now debated this new offence a number of times, and these discussions have been helpful in achieving a clearer common understanding about the purpose and effect of these provisions.
</p>

<a name="60523-19_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a>The Government attach importance to this offence. Reliable audit reports are an essential assurance for the proper working of financial markets. There should be criminal penalties available for auditors who give assurance about a company&#039;s accounts when they know it is not justified, or when they are reckless as to whether it is justified.
</p>

<a name="60523-19_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a>Most would agree with the proposition that we should be able to prosecute the auditor who issues a false audit report with actual knowledge. The key concern is &quot;recklessly&quot;. Even those who themselves understand clearly what &quot;reckless&quot; means in criminal law are concerned that auditors may none the less believe that it means something more, along the lines of &quot;carelessness&quot; or &quot;negligence&quot;, and that that would have serious and adverse effects on their behaviour.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_750"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 750</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60523-19_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a>I shall try to address that concern this afternoon in three ways. First, I shall explain, by means of an example, what &quot;recklessly&quot; means in the context of this offence. I shall then say something about the guidance that the Secretary of State will issue under Clause 494, and how that will make clearer what will and will not be prosecuted. Finally, I shall say something about the amendments.
</p>

<a name="60523-19_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a>In legal terms, &quot;recklessness&quot; does not mean negligence. Negligence in auditors is a serious matter, falling short of auditors&#039; high professional standards but, in itself, it does not amount to recklessness. To prove recklessness, a prosecutor will have to persuade a jury that the individual auditor decided not to do something that he knew he should do; for example, that he was aware that there was an issue that he should investigate further, that failure to do so could prejudice the truth of the audit report and that he consciously did not do so.
</p>

<a name="60523-19_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a>Let us take the example of a company whose year-end assets on paper largely consist of an amount of valuable stock held in a distant warehouse. Even though he has no reason to doubt its existence and condition, a good auditor will ensure that someone checks the stock. An incompetent or careless auditor might not, and might issue a clean audit report. That could be negligence. If the stock turned out not to exist, and the company suffered loss as a result, the auditor might be sued. If it was more than a simple error and involved failure to observe professional standards, he might well be brought before one of the disciplinary bodies and have sanctions imposed. But he has not caused the audit report to be wrong knowingly or recklessly, so he will not be at risk of prosecution under that offence.
</p>

<a name="60523-19_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a>However, let us consider a similar scenario, where the auditor receives some evidence that there are doubts about the existence of the stock. If he now concludes that there is a risk around the stock, and that that might undermine the validity of the accounts, obviously he ought at that stage to check the stock. If in those circumstances he decides not to, he may well be reckless. On the other hand, if he had received such evidence, had considered it in accordance with his firm&#039;s practice and had reached the view as a matter of professional judgment that that there was no real risk to the validity of the accounts, and so did not check the stock, he would not be behaving recklessly. He might be guilty of extremely bad judgment, but not recklessness, which involves a positive decision not to act despite awareness of the risk.
</p>

<a name="60523-19_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a>If he had not received such evidence, but knew&#151;actually knew, not merely ought to have known&#151;as an experienced auditor that it was standard professional practice to check stock when it is material to the accounts and decided not to check it in this case, for whatever reason, despite knowing the risk that the stock did not exist and that that was the reason for the practice, again he would be reckless. That goes beyond incompetence or bad judgment and is recklessness because it involves a deliberate decision despite awareness of the risk. In practice, however, we would not expect prosecutions to be brought that were based <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_751"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 751</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

merely on an inference of recklessness from failure to comply with standards, as I shall explain shortly when I talk about the guidance under Clause 494.
</p>

<a name="60523-19_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a>The prosecutor would have to demonstrate that the auditor was aware of the risk surrounding the stock, that he knew it could call the accounts into question, and that he had decided not to check it. That is not easy to prove beyond reasonable doubt. The sort of circumstances in which it is possible to prove recklessness in this way are different from what is required to prove negligence. The normal, good, competent auditor will naturally seek to avoid mistakes that could be considered negligent, but he need not worry about being prosecuted under the new offence.
</p>

<a name="60523-19_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a>Let me now say something about the guidance that the Secretary of State will issue under Clause 494 which, I think, will further assure auditors. We do not yet have draft guidance, and the final version will involve careful legal consideration, requiring the consent of the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General. But I hope it will help if I indicate what we have in mind. The power to give guidance exists precisely because there is overlap between the most serious cases subject to professional discipline and the conduct that this offence is intended to cover. The guidance will not be legally binding, in the sense that prosecutors and regulatory authorities are not rigidly compelled to follow it whatever the circumstances of the individual case. But it is intended to ensure that there is a decision at a very early stage whether to go down the prosecution route or the professional discipline one.
</p>

<a name="60523-19_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a>Our intention is that prosecution would be used for the most serious cases: those where the conduct is most blameworthy. Such cases may include, for example, ones where the risk of a problem was obvious and the auditor made no checks at all. In less serious cases, even where there might arguably be knowing or reckless behaviour, the appropriate procedure is likely to be the existing professional disciplinary system. Theoretically, it would be open to a prosecutor to seek to persuade a jury that an auditor must have been aware of the risks because he was highly experienced and was acting contrary to standard professional practice of which he must have been well aware. But proving recklessness is a high test, and it is highly unlikely that it would be appropriate to prosecute in the absence of clear evidence to support the contention that the auditor was aware of the risk he was running. That might, for example, be documentation that it can be proved the auditor has seen, or oral evidence from people in the company to show that he had been made aware of the risk and was therefore culpable. We expect the guidance to prosecutors and regulators under Clause 494 to reflect the importance of a clear evidential basis for proving recklessness.
</p>

<a name="60523-19_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a>The amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, express the conditions for recklessness as I have explained it: there must be knowledge of a significant risk and then a deliberate decision none the less to do or not to do something. I confirm that the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_752"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 752</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

words in those amendments correctly capture the nature of recklessness in this context. But, as the noble Baroness anticipated, I do not agree that these words should be added to Clause 493. &quot;Recklessness&quot; is a standard term in criminal law, and in this context has a clear meaning. It is not our practice in statute to supplement well established legal terms with explanatory glosses. To do so in one case, such as this, could cast doubt on the meaning of the term in other statutes in which it is not explained in this way.
</p>

<a name="60523-19_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a>I note that the noble Baroness has now received legal opinion to the effect that recklessness implies some measure of dishonesty. As noble Lords will realise, my legal advice was that in this context recklessness need not involve dishonesty. If we receive new legal arguments, we will consider them carefully, and if it proves necessary the Government could return to the matter in another place. As a non-lawyer, I am not certain that it would help auditors if recklessness did involve dishonesty, because that would set the bar even higher. I say it with some trepidation, but the noble Baroness&#039;s argument does not destroy what we are saying; in fact, it says that the bar is even higher. If I am wrong, I will write to correct that.
</p>

<a name="60523-19_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a>We can look at the further legal advice. I am very happy to have a meeting. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="60523-19_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Noakes: </b>   My Lords, this has been another useful debate on an extremely difficult topic. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, for his comments, and the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, for an interesting take on my amendment to subsection (1), in which he raised important issues that, as a non-lawyer, I could argue with much less eloquence than he did.
</p>

<a name="60523-19_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a>I thank the Minister for what he said. The issue of dishonesty is important to auditors because they are concerned that they could be caught by the new offence in circumstances where they made some form of honest mistake. As noble Lords can imagine, honesty is extremely important for professional people such as auditors. It is very important to establish whether it is a part of the offence.
</p>

<a name="60523-19_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a>I am very grateful to the Minister for setting down the elements involved in the offence as the Government believe they have drafted it, through the examples and his comments on my amendments. I am well aware that he has not seen the legal opinion, a copy of which I saw only this morning, but I hope that there can be an exchange between those in the profession who hold this opinion and the Minister, his officials and, as I suggested, the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General. It is an important issue. I could have tried to divide the House on the matter; I thought that it was important to seek the truth on it. I was encouraged by the Minister&#039;s comments that the department was still in &quot;receive&quot; mode on this. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

&quot;PART 24A DISSOLUTION AND RESTORATION TO THE REGISTER

<br>
Voluntary striking off


<br>
VOLUNTARY STRIKING OFF: EXTENSION TO PUBLIC COMPANIES


<br>
In section 652A of the Companies Act 1985 (c. 6) (power of registrar to strike private company off register on application)&#151;


<br>
(a)   in the heading to the section, and


<br>
(b)   in subsection (1),


<br>
omit the word &quot;private&quot;.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="st_172"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 67 I shall speak also to the other amendments in the group. With these amendments we turn to the subject of the restoration of companies to the register. Companies can be removed from the register for a number of reasons: for example, when they are wound up under the Insolvency Act, or because they are struck off by the registrar after failing to provide evidence of their continuing to be in operation; for example, failing to submit annual returns. Companies may also apply voluntarily to be struck off the register when they want to end their own life, and Amendment No. 67 extends this route of voluntary strike-off&#151;which is of course subject to strict conditions&#151;to public as well as private companies.
</p>

<a name="60523-21_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a>Sometimes it is necessary for companies which have been struck off the register to be restored to it. This could be because they were struck off, so to speak, in error in the first place, and they had in fact always continued to operate. On other occasions, even where the company is genuinely defunct, it may be necessary to resurrect it as a legal person so that it can play a part in litigation, for example.
</p>

<a name="60523-21_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a>At the moment there are two different mechanisms in law for applying to restore a company to the register, as set out in Sections 651 and 653 of the Companies Act 1985. Both require application to the court. The Company Law Review looked carefully at this subject and concluded that there was a risk of confusion between the two and that it would be more sensible to provide a single, unified scheme. This is what Amendments Nos. 74 to 78 do.
</p>

<a name="60523-21_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a>In setting out the new single procedure, largely based on that which previously existed under Section 653 of the Companies Act, a few changes of substance have been made. The time limit for applying to the court under the old Section 651 procedure was two years, and under the Section 653 procedure 20 years. The new clause, in line with a Company Law Review recommendation, harmonises the time limit at six years. It does, however, preserve a dispensation from this time limit in cases where an applicant is seeking to revive the company in order to pursue a case for personal injury against it. This is important where, for example, an industrial disease does not become <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_760"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 760</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

apparent for some time after a company is wound up. Without this dispensation it could be more difficult for a victim to pursue a valid claim.
</p>

<a name="60523-21_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a>The new unified procedure still requires an application to be made to the court, and in many circumstances this is clearly a necessary and appropriate step. However, in some instances the company will have been struck off by the registrar because it appears that the company is no longer in business&#151;for example, because it has failed to submit necessary and timely returns&#151;but in fact the company has continued to operate. If it is clear that the company is in practical terms in continued existence, and if nobody can and does object, then it may be unnecessarily onerous to provide that the only route by which it may be restored to the register is a court order.
</p>

<a name="60523-21_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a>The Company Law Review therefore recommended that a new, administrative procedure be introduced whereby the registrar herself can, in tightly defined circumstances, reinstate a company to the register, and Amendments Nos. 69 to 73 implement this scheme. I believe this provision is fully in line with changes we have made in related areas of the Bill, where we have now provided that, in certain circumstances, the registrar should be able to amend the register without the need for a court order.
</p>

<a name="60523-21_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a>Finally, I should confirm that the Treasury Solicitor (in England, Wales and also Northern Ireland, where the Crown Solicitor acts as the Treasury Solicitor&#039;s agent), the Queen&#039;s and Lord Treasurer&#039;s Remembrancer (in Scotland), or the representatives of the Royal Duchies (as the case may be), will continue to be involved in the court procedure and will also have a role in the new administrative procedure. No company will be restored by the Registrar of Companies without the appropriate representative&#039;s consent. Amendment No. 68 makes small changes to the related process by which these interested parties may disclaim <i>bona vacantia</i>&#151;the unclaimed property of a defunct company which would otherwise pass to them. As well as making some consequential changes, Amendment No. 78 includes a change regarding the costs incurred by the various representatives. If a company is restored after its property has been sold off, it must be given the proceeds of sale. The amendment allows the costs of sale to be deducted from the amount handed back to the company. I beg to move.

<br>
(3)   The registrar must cause to be published&#151;

<br>
&quot;EFFECT OF COURT ORDER FOR RESTORATION TO THE REGISTER

<br>
(2)   The company is not liable to a penalty under section 434 or any corresponding earlier provision (civil penalty for failure to deliver accounts) for a financial year in relation to which the period for filing accounts and reports ended&#151;


<br>
(a)   after the date of dissolution or striking off, and


<br>
(b)   before the restoration of the company to the register.


<br>
(3)   The court may give such directions and make such provision as seems just for placing the company and all other persons in the same position (as nearly as may be) as if the company had not been dissolved or struck off the register.


<br>
(4)   The court may also give directions as to&#151;


<br>
(a)   the delivery to the registrar of such documents relating to the company as are necessary to bring up to date the records kept by the registrar,


<br>
(b)   the payment of the costs (in Scotland, expenses) of the registrar in connection with the proceedings for the restoration of the company to the register,


<br>
(c)   where any property or right previously vested in or held on trust for the company has vested as bona vacantia, the payment of the costs (in Scotland, expenses) of the Crown representative&#151;


<br>
(i)   in dealing with the property during the period of dissolution, or


<br>
(ii)   in connection with the proceedings on the application.


<br>
(5)   In this section the &quot;Crown representative&quot; means&#151;


<br>
(a)   in relation to property vested in the Duchy of Lancaster, the Solicitor to that Duchy;


<br>
(b)   in relation to property vested in the Duke of Cornwall, the Solicitor to the Duchy of Cornwall;


<br>
(c)   in relation to property in Scotland, the Queen&#039;s and Lord Treasurer&#039;s Remembrancer;

<br>
(2)   If at the date of restoration the company could not be registered under its former name without contravening section 67 (name not to be the same as another in the registrar&#039;s index of company names), it must be restored to the register&#151;

section 81 (change of name: effect),.


<br>

After Clause 670, insert the following new clause&#151;


<br>
&quot;RESTORATION TO THE REGISTER: OTHER AMENDMENTS


<br>

<br>
&quot;655 EFFECT OF RESTORATION TO THE REGISTER WHERE PROPERTY HAS VESTED AS BONA VACANTIA


<br>
(1)   The person in whom any property or right is vested by section 654 may dispose of, or of an interest in, that property or right despite the fact that the company may be restored to the <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 767</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

register under sections (Application for administrative restoration to the register) to (Effect of court order for restoration to the register) of the Company Law Reform Act 2006.


<br>
(2)   If the company is restored to the register&#151;

<br>
(ii)   the value of any such consideration at the time of the disposition,


<br>

&quot;(   )   The order has the effect of making the body appointed under subsection (1) designated under section 5 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (c. 36) (further powers to designate public authorities).&quot;

<p><a name="st_182"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 82 I shall speak also to Amendment No. 83. These amendments make the Freedom of Information Act apply to the two bodies to which the Secretary of State will delegate his functions. Amendment No. 82 relates to the independent supervisor and, more importantly, Amendment No. 83 relates to a body that we believe will be the Public Oversight Board.
</p>

<a name="60523-23_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a>Only yesterday, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor made a speech in which he said that he was proud of the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act. His department issued a report on the progress that has been made in implementation. That showed that while there is still more to do&#151;for example, on the timetable taken to reply to requests&#151;the implementation has, in general, been without problems. However, the Government continue to say that they are still reviewing the implementation of the Act before extending it beyond government departments and the bodies initially included.
</p>

<a name="60523-23_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a>We believe that when a Minister delegates his functions to a body, whether a public sector body or not, it is right that the Freedom of Information Act rights and responsibilities also follow. Put another way, it would be wrong if a government department could avoid the operation of the Act by choosing to delegate functions in a particular way rather than carry them out directly. So as a matter of principle we think that the Act should apply to cases such as the delegation of functions to the independent supervisor and the Public Oversight Board.
</p>

<a name="60523-23_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a>More substantively, we have a very real belief that the performance of audit firms, which will be a function of the Public Oversight Board, ought to be in the public domain. If we are to have confidence in the role of auditors underpinning the strength of our capital markets, it makes no sense at all to keep auditor performance behind the closed doors of the Public Oversight Board.
</p>

<a name="60523-23_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, and I have explained in Grand Committee and on Report, audit committees of listed companies bear a big responsibility to oversee the appointment of auditors and their work. How can audit committees discharge that responsibility if important information is kept from them? How can they rationally carry out a tender for an audit if they cannot compare the relative <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_769"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 769</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

performance of auditors as judged by a knowledgeable external body? These two amendments are in the public interest. I beg to move.

</p>




<p><a name="st_183"></a>
<a name="60523-23_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   My Lords, I support these amendments and the comments made by the noble Baroness. As she rightly indicated, this is an issue that she and my noble friend Lord Sharman have pursued all the way through our deliberations. We are still at it at Third Reading. However, this is an appropriate Third Reading amendment. Some of the discussions we have had today have been inevitable because amendments have necessarily been tabled late because of events. However, this amendment raises a fundamental principle.
</p>

<a name="60523-23_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a>The noble Baroness explained why, with the increased obligations and responsibilities being taken on by audit committees, it is important that those committees are given the necessary tools to enable them to fulfil their functions. However, the real Third Reading point is simple. We in the Opposition have a sense that whenever it is suggested that freedom of information should be applied, the Government&#151;or, I suspect, not so much the Government as those who advise them&#151;immediately throw their hands up in horror at the concept that the public or, in this case, company directors who need access to this information should be provided with it. That is an issue of principle that this House ought to take on board. If the noble Baroness is minded to divide the House, I have no doubt that the Liberal Democrats will be behind her, if not in front of her.
</p>




<p><a name="st_184"></a>
<a name="60523-23_spnew4"></a><b> Lord McKenzie of Luton: </b>   My Lords, noble Lords have argued that extending the level of public reporting, particularly by the Audit Inspection Unit, might offer a greater level of transparency and decision-useful information to companies and their audit committees on the performance of individual audit firms. During the debate last week on Report, I set out the reasons why the Government, in implementing the recommendations of the Review of the Regulatory Regime of the Accountancy Profession, concluded that Audit Inspection Unit reports on individual audit firms should not be public.  At the same time I also acknowledged that there were counter-arguments and I explained that the Public Oversight Board is currently undertaking a review of its approach with a view to consulting more widely.
</p>

<a name="60523-23_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a>Perhaps I may rehearse briefly the arguments against the publication of individual reports. The main concern is that to do so would encourage a rules-driven, litigious approach rather than having the desired effect of creating an inspection regime designed to improve the quality of firms&#039; practices and internal processes through constructive dialogue. In particular, we run the risk of reports becoming more legalistic as the burden of proof required before matters can be made public would arguably increase. The resulting reports would be in danger of becoming anodyne and thus of little real value to audit committees. Ultimately, there must be the risk that such an approach would drive the inspection regime <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_770"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 770</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

towards a tick-box approach to compliance, which would certainly be undesirable to regulators and companies.
</p>

<a name="60523-23_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a>I have reflected carefully on the noble Lord&#039;s point that access to individual reports would help audit committees meet their obligations under the combined code to assess the effectiveness of the external audit. Although I accept that the AIU reports on individual audit firms might be an interesting read for audit committees, I am not persuaded that anything other than an individual report on their particular audit would provide the sort of decision-useful information that the noble Lord perhaps is seeking.
</p>

<a name="60523-23_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a>The concerns and risks that I have outlined again today are important and weighty. Again, however, I do not deny that there are alternative views and I accept that the balance of arguments is one that may be revisited. It is for these reasons that I feel strongly that the right course of action is to allow the Public Oversight Board to conduct a public consultation, as it has committed to do, on extending the level of public reporting, considering precisely what information should be published and when. That is not something that we should decide here. There must be open discussion and debate with all interested parties, in particular with the auditing profession and companies themselves.
</p>

<a name="60523-23_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a>As to whether the Government are shy about the Freedom of Information Act, we introduced that legislation and are proud of it. I caution noble Lords that if the purpose of the amendment is to get the individual audit firm reports out into the open, going down the route of the Freedom of Information Act would not necessarily produce that result. Several exceptions might apply if an FOI request were made for the AIU reports that are currently made only to the firm and the Audit Registration Committee. In particular, Section 43(3) of the Freedom of Information Act provides an exception to the requirements of the Act in cases where the information is prejudicial to a person&#039;s commercial interest. Furthermore, the Freedom of Information Act provides an exception for information that is held in order to monitor compliance with the law. In any such case where an exemption applied, the information would be discloseable only if the public interest in maintaining the exemption did not outweigh the public interest in disclosing it.
</p>

<a name="60523-23_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a>I stress again that if the import of the amendment is to try to get more public information about the performance of audit firms, surely the best route is to go through this consultation with the POB so that all those who are engaged in this process can input properly into it. For example, the AIU itself could input on how it might recast its reports so that matters might be brought more fully into the public domain. That is the best route forward on this matter rather than the route of the Freedom of Information Act. That really might not produce the result that the noble Baroness and the noble Lord are seeking.

principle. We should have access to the information, and when public duties are delegated, Freedom of Information Act rights and responsibilities go with them. That is not inconsistent with a separate consultation by the Public Oversight Board. We are simply saying that the Freedom of Information Act, with all of the safeguards that it contains, should apply.

</p>

<a name="60523-24_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 84, I shall speak also to the other amendments in the group. I gave an undertaking in the debate on Part 21 on Report last week to table on Third Reading further amendments to Clauses 859 to 861. I shall now set out the detail of these amendments.
</p>

<a name="60523-24_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a>The amendment removes the three clauses that are currently in the Bill which give power to the competent authority&#151;at present, the Financial Services Authority&#151; to make rules for the purposes of the transparency directive and connected regulatory purposes. The clauses also make provision for the inclusion of a power for the competent authority to make corporate governance rules, and for the Secretary of State to make corporate governance regulations to implement, to enable the implementation of, or to deal with matters arising from or relating to any community obligation.
</p>

<a name="60523-24_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a>The amendment replaces the three clauses with nine new clauses, which recast and supplement the clauses proposed for removal. There are two reasons for this. First, the amendment will ensure that the provision for rule-making in the clauses is clearer. The clauses will fit better with the approach adopted in surrounding provisions in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. As part of that, we have incorporated the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_774"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 774</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

two amendments proposed by noble Lords in Committee to the definitions of issuer&#039;s relevant information and voteholder information respectively.
</p>

<a name="60523-24_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a>Secondly, the amendments include supplementary provisions. The first substantive additions incorporate provisions for additional regulatory powers of the competent authority. These powers are to suspend or prohibit trading of an issuer&#039;s shares if there are breaches or suspected breaches of transparency obligations and to censure publicly an issuer who breaches the transparency obligations.
</p>

<a name="60523-24_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a>There is also a supplementary provision to determine how the competent authority is to exercise its enforcement powers where the issue is from another member state. The transparency directive requires member states to have those powers. That is Articles 24.4 and 26. The second addition includes provisions to amend the powers of the Secretary of State in Section 14 of the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004 to appoint a body to oversee accounts and financial reporting functions. That will enable the functions overseen by the Secretary of State&#039;s appointed body to extend to the accounts and reports required to be produced by quoted companies in accordance with obligations arising from implementation of the transparency directive. The changes will also provide for the inclusion of a further clause clarifying issuers&#039; liability in relation to disclosures required under the transparency directive. That is part of the implementation of Article 7 of the directive. I beg to move.

<br>
(b)   a person is to be regarded as holding the voting rights in respect of the shares&#151;


<br>
(i)   if, by virtue of those shares, he is a shareholder within the meaning of Article 2.1(e) of the transparency obligations directive;


<br>
(ii)   if, and to the extent that, he is entitled to acquire, dispose of or exercise those voting rights in one or more of the cases mentioned in Article 10(a) to (h) of the transparency obligations directive;


<br>
(iii)   if he holds, directly or indirectly, a financial instrument which results in an entitlement to acquire the shares and is an Article 13 instrument, and


<br>
(c)   a person holds a &quot;comparable instrument&quot; in respect of voting shares if he holds, directly or indirectly, a financial instrument in relation to the shares which has similar economic effects to an Article 13 instrument (whether or not the financial instrument results in an entitlement to acquire the shares).


<br>

</p>

<a name="60523-26_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendment No. 96 seeks to leave out Clause 876. Despite our tabling amendments to this clause in Committee and on Report, there are still many uncertainties over how the Government propose to implement any regulations to be made under this clause and there are grave concerns over the whole approach taken. In Grand Committee, the Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a>&quot;Greater transparency of voting can be expected to improve the confidence of savers in the stewardship exercised on their behalf by institutional investors&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-26_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a>However, it has to be said that public disclosure could undermine and generally dumb down the voting process due to the sensitivity of the issues and the confidentiality necessary. In particular, public knowledge of a disagreement with an investee <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_785"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 785</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

company&#039;s management could have an adverse effect on shareholder value without any solution to the disagreement.
</p>

<a name="60523-26_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a>Furthermore, where an institution has a general policy not to vote, to be distinguished from votes consciously withheld where an active decision is taken not to vote on a particular resolution, a mandatory requirement to disclose the non-exercise of voting rights in each and every situation may drive firms simply to vote without giving due consideration to the issues at stake in order to be seen to be doing something. That could potentially skew the result by diluting the impact of those votes which have been exercised in a considered manner.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a>&quot;the very existence of the power will encourage institutional investors not currently disclosing this kind of information to respond and adopt best practice&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 25/4/06; col. GC 80.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-26_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a>However, the existence of this power could result in a corporate equivalent of planning blight. Institutions will hold fire on their own voluntary disclosure regimes until secondary legislation makes it clear what is needed to be disclosed. Why make an investment in IT and skilled personnel to implement a system which may be rendered completely redundant by a statutory system?
</p>

<a name="60523-26_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a> On Report, the Minister said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a>&quot;The increasing trend towards voluntary disclosures suggests that more institutional investors recognise their clients&#039; right to this information and that its disclosure is of benefit to clients&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, 16/5/06; col. 248.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-26_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a>Again, that reveals the Government&#039;s muddled thinking. We have repeatedly made it clear from these Benches that we have no issue with financial institutions reporting to their clients. But that is not what Clause 876 is about. The regime under the clause can require the information to be disclosed to the world at large, which is a completely different matter. We are aware that the hit rates for those who disclose are very low. One manager who disclosed had no questions raised as a result, which indicates a low level of interest, if any. But, as the Minister said, there is an increasing trend to disclosure being undertaken voluntarily, so there is no need to take the heavy-handed approach that Clause 876 proposes.
</p>

<a name="60523-26_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a>A number of other issues have not been adequately answered by the Government. First, what evidence do the Government have that this information is of benefit to the public or that the public want it? Secondly, are the Government aware that the Institutional Shareholders&#039; Committee, whose membership comprises the Investment Management Association, the Association of British Insurers, the National Association of Pension Funds and the Association of Investment Trust Companies, is developing its own guidance on public disclosure?
</p>

<a name="60523-26_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a>Finally, I hope that the Minister&#151;whichever Minister it is&#151;will not fall back on the argument that this is a reserve power and unlikely to be used. Governments, particularly this Government, love command and control devices, of which this is a classic example. A commensurate regulatory touch has been <br>&nbsp;<br>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 786</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

one of the keys to the incredible success of the UK&#039;s financial services industry. This clause does no one anywhere any favours. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="st_194"></a>
<a name="60523-26_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   My Lords, as on the previous amendment, my noble friend Lord Sharman supported the Opposition on this point throughout the deliberations in the Moses Room and on Report. We certainly do not intend to renege on that support today. The fundamental point which my noble friend would have made had he been able to be here was made by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. There is now extensive development of a voluntary code, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, said, if we have to wait for regulations to come in from the Government, is likely to be frozen. As a result, this is an unnecessary regulatory step too far. This is the one that can be confined to the bonfire of regulations which the Government have so often promised but have so often failed to deliver.
</p>




<p><a name="st_195"></a>
<a name="60523-26_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, Clause 876 confers a power on the Secretary of State and the Treasury to make regulations requiring certain categories of institutional investor to provide information about the exercise or non-exercise of their voting rights. I am pleased that we have reached agreement&#151;confirmed by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, on Report&#151;on the important principle underpinning this clause. Beneficiaries and clients are entitled to know what is being done with the shares that they beneficially own. Disclosure of voting information is an important part of the transparency of the exercise of corporate governance functions. I would have thought that the Liberal Democrat Party in its noble traditions of supporting democracy and transparency would also agree to that simple proposition.
</p>

<a name="60523-26_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a>We are also in agreement that the increasing disclosures by institutional investors, either to their clients directly or more publicly&#151;for example, as the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, noted, the recent decisions by Fidelity Standard Life Investments and Newton Investment Management to disclose voting&#151;are a positive change. We agree that the voluntary approach to disclosures by institutional investors should be allowed to evolve further before any consideration is given of implementing a mandatory disclosure regime. The idea that because we have back-up powers, but are allowing a voluntary approach that will somehow produce a wonderful thing called &quot;planning blight&quot;, seems to be one of the more far-fetched arguments that has been produced in this House, which has not as a whole produced fanciful arguments. However, I must say that the argument of &quot;planning blight&quot; is somewhat fanciful.
</p>

<a name="60523-26_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a>One suggested point of disagreement raised on Report was the extent of disclosure: should it just be to the beneficiaries, or to some wider class, or to the public at large? The clause does not prescribe that a particular approach must be adopted. It leaves the options open. That approach seems the best at this early stage. It cannot be that there is a great matter of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_787"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 787</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

principle; clearly if one divulges how one votes to a wide range of shareholders, it will be public information anyway. It may be that doing so publicly on a public website is the quickest way to give out the information. So I cannot believe that that is a serious issue.
</p>

<a name="60523-26_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a>As I emphasised on Report, the choice with this clause is not between the voluntary and mandatory approaches but whether the Government should have effective backup in the event that the voluntary approach does not deliver or should have no lever to address the problem. On that point we appear to differ. The taking of power is intended to underpin the good progress being made voluntarily, not undermine it as some noble Lords seem to fear. The taking of power makes it clear that the Government value increasing levels of disclosure. By taking a power now, rather than creating a mandatory regime in the Bill, it also shows that the Government are willing to see how market practice evolves before choosing whether and how to exercise the power.
</p>

<a name="60523-26_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a>I simply do not accept that taking the power has the negative consequences that noble Lords suggest. I have no hesitation in repeating the assurances that we have given, because they are important safeguards, not to be made light of. The Government will consult extensively before taking the power and it will be subject to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. Those factors, combined with further scrutiny in both Houses, will ensure that any use of the powers will be proportionate. I return to our common ground. If noble Lords believe that we are right to encourage the voluntary approach, they should support the taking of a power that will serve to underpin that good progress.
</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060523/text/60523-27.htm"/>






<p><a name="st_196"></a>
<a name="60523-27_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: </b>   My Lords, would it have been more sensible to carry out the cost benefit analysis before introducing the legislation in the first place?
</p>




<p><a name="st_197"></a>
<a name="60523-27_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   No, my Lords, there is a matter of principle here about which we feel strongly. It is not possible to carry out the cost benefit analysis of all those things unless one has the principle established and is looking at detailed consultations. That is the sensible moment to carry out the cost benefit analysis. That is the common situation throughout the Bill: where we are taking some back-up powers it is on the basis that we would carry out the cost benefit analysis when considering whether to introduce the regulatory power. I return to the common ground. If noble Lords believe that we are right to encourage the voluntary approach, they should support the taking of power that will serve to underpin this good progress. If noble Lords believe that individual investors are entitled to know what is being done with the shares they beneficially own and that that disclosure is beneficial, they should support the clause. Liberal of all parties who believe that people should know how companies do it should be right there supporting us on the last lap of the Bill. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_788"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 788</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

They should never be allowed to forget it. I therefore hope, but do not expect, that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.
</p>




<p><a name="st_198"></a>
<a name="60523-27_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, as the Minister will realise, that is a disappointing response after the evidence that we have given him. I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, for his support. Trying to talk about clients is confusing the issue, because Clause 876(9) states,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a>&quot;The regulations may require the information to be provided, in such manner as may be specified, to such persons as may be specified, or to the public, or both&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-27_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a>There is nothing to do with clients; it is about the world at large. When the Minister starts trying to confuse that with talking about clients, with the greatest respect, on this last lap, he is slightly edging the truth. Clients are a different matter; this is about the public at large.
</p>

<a name="60523-27_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a>We do not accept that this provision is needed at this stage for the reasons I explained. I hope that when the Minister goes back to his office he will look at today&#039;s <i>Financial Times</i>, which contains an interview with Mr Ed Balls on his new role. He says that the City of London must retain its light touch and risk-based regulatory regime. This is neither light touch nor risk-based; it is a complete red herring. I intend to finish off the Bill with a bang rather than a whimper and I beg leave to seek the opinion of the House.

<p><a name="st_209"></a>
<a name="60523-29_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, a long and winding road takes us back to Second Reading on 11 January. I would like to take this opportunity to express my personal thanks to the two Ministers, the noble Lords, Lord Sainsbury and Lord McKenzie, and, in his absence, to the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General, for their good humour, only occasionally strained during the past few months. I thank also the noble Lords, Lord Sharman and Lord Razzall, for their help on the Bill and, of course, my noble friends Lady Noakes and Lord Freeman for their assistance on these Benches. I thank the Bill team, which has been most helpful in enabling us to get to the bottom of what is required. I express my thanks also to those who have advised, briefed and, occasionally, criticised us. That is as it should be in a vibrant democracy. It is a long list of people and I cannot therefore name them all, but we are grateful to them for their help. I thank also the Government for being, in large measure, open and receptive to reasoned arguments. As a result, we have been able to refine and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_794"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 794</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

sharpen the Bill so that it better serves its purpose of helping UK plc, because, whatever our political colour, the success of UK plc is essential to this country&#039;s future.
</p>

<a name="60523-29_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a>I began to doubt that I would ever see a day when a Marshalled List of amendments for the Company Law Reform Bill contained fewer than 100, but today we almost got there. Today&#039;s list contained 102 or 103 amendments. As we wave this gargantuan Bill on its way, I echo the prayer of the Minister at an earlier date: that either we may have been sacked or some other act of God may have intervened before we see its like again.

</p>




<p><a name="st_210"></a>
<a name="60523-29_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Razzall: </b>   My Lords, I echo the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. I know that I speak for my noble friend Lord Sharman, who manfully spent the best part of 13 days in the Moses Room. If I may add a personal note, I have often freely commented that I am disappointed that a number of noble Lords who have significant experience in company matters and business, and are appointed to your Lordships&#039; House because of their expertise, do not then bother to attend occasions such as this Bill when their expertise could have been so welcome.
</p>

<a name="60523-29_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a>My noble friend Lord Sharman is an absolute exception to that rule and I know that he is sorry not to have been here today. He has been here on virtually every other occasion, notwithstanding his other significant business responsibilities. I know that my noble friend&#039;s former colleague, the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, has enjoyed how he has instructed her on what she should say on many occasions.
</p>

<a name="60523-29_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a>Finally, I thank the ministerial team. In the nine years that I have been in this House and involved in DTI Bills, this has been an absolute paradigm of how Bills should be conducted. There has been no point made by the Liberal Democrats or the Conservative Benches that has not been carefully considered&#151;and when the Government or their advisers feel that we have made a good point, they have come back either to say that they agreed, or with an amendment improving our wording. Enormous credit ought to go to the two Ministers for the way that they have conducted this Bill.

<p><a name="st_211"></a>
<a name="60523-29_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </b>   My Lords, as we send this Bill on its way to another place, it may be appropriate to say a few words about the discussions that we have had in this House.
</p>

<a name="60523-29_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a>At the beginning of our proceedings in Committee, I expressed the hope that we would all work together to produce a Bill that would provide the best possible conditions for the success of British industry, and said that we would be willing to listen to any suggestions on how the Bill could be improved technically. The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, said that serious issues were raised by the Bill and threatened a high level of public <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_795"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 795</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

scrutiny. At the end, we can claim to have delivered on our promises&#151;both his on detailed scrutiny and ours on a receptive and constructive approach.
</p>

<a name="60523-29_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a>Of course, it has been no small exercise. By my reckoning, we have considered over 1,000 amendments in Committee and a further 600 or so on Report, in addition to our discussions today. In fact, we have made over 400 changes to the Bill as introduced. I am sure that there will be further refinements to the Bill in another place, and it may be worth highlighting a few areas where we already know that changes may be made.
</p>

<a name="60523-29_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a>Amendments will be needed as a consequence of our decision to drop the general reform power in what was Part 3, particularly through the introduction of specific new powers in the areas of capital maintenance and company charges, as we have already outlined. An area which we have discussed in some detail is that of consolidation of the law. I am particularly grateful for the suggestions that noble Lords opposite have made in raising this issue, and for the commitment they have given to tackling it as constructively as possible as we proceed. As I have said, it will not be possible or appropriate to take up all the remaining areas of the existing Companies Act into the new Bill. In particular, we do not wish to bring up provisions which go wider than companies, such as provisions on investigations, or specific, self-contained provisions such as on community interest companies.
</p>

<a name="60523-29_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a>However, we intend&#151;subject to finding no insuperable problems, and provided that it can be done in the time available&#151;to bring up the rest. That would include pre-emption rights, arrangements and reconstructions, provisions on squeeze-out and sell-out in takeovers, and the protection of minority rights against unfair prejudice. The effect will be to make the new legislation much closer to a complete code of company law for the majority of users. That will, I know, be widely welcomed both inside and outside your Lordships&#039; House.
</p>

<a name="60523-29_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a>There are a number of other areas where the Government have been persuaded that further changes to the Bill are appropriate by the debates that we have had here. It has not been possible in all these areas to introduce the amendments themselves while the Bill has been in this House, but I hope that wherever possible I have been able to make clear what the government plans are.
</p>

<a name="60523-29_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a>The House agreed some amendments on Report which we opposed, and we will consider whether we wish to amend the Bill when it is in another place. We have received in particular a number of representations that provisions relating to rights of indirect shareholders in Clause 135 could cause considerable problems in practice. In principle, as I made clear in debate, we very much want to strengthen shareholder engagement, but we also want to ensure that it is done in a not unduly burdensome way. Together with interested parties we will, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_796"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 796</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

therefore, be looking at the possible costs and practical implications to see whether amendments in another place would be desirable.
</p>

<a name="60523-29_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a>I conclude by thanking everyone who has contributed to our debates, which have been extremely productive. In particular, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, who have done a fantastic job in criticising the Bill, while the noble Lords, Lord Razzall and Lord Sharman, have also played a major part. I thank my colleagues, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, and the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, for the enormous help that they have given me in taking the Bill through the House. I also want to thank the Bill team, for it is a considerable organisational and intellectual feat to push a Bill of this scale through, and deal with so many points of detail on it, without at any time stopping the debate from happening or going out to get people&#039;s views through consultation. I place on record my appreciation of the job that they have done, not only in guiding us but in talking to the various business communities about the problems, and getting a constant feed-in from what they have done.
</p>

<a name="60523-29_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a>I believe the constructive spirit in which we have engaged in what have sometimes been controversial and often extremely technical issues has contributed greatly to the quality of debate. That is one key reason why the Bill leaves this House in such good shape. Ultimately, it is a Bill that will greatly help the success of British industry. However, all good things must come to an end.

<a name="60523-30_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </b>   My Lords, I think that the Minister may have been anxious about the good news that he was able to give us on consolidation. That is something these Benches have been very keen on. If he is able to bring consolidation forward, we are happy to repeat our assurance that it is not our intention to take up those clauses that have just been moved, without any other change in the law. Provided that he is able to give us that assurance, and that we are not told by the Law Society or some outside body that a lacuna here has been waiting to be tackled for 20 years, in the interest of getting a better and more comprehensible Companies Act we are happy to make sure that we do not delay the Bill&#039;s passage through the House when the Minister brings it back. We all feel that consolidation is a good thing, and I am delighted that the Government are able to move in that direction.

<a name="60523-30_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank </b>   rose to ask Her Majesty&#039;s Government what steps they intend to take to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of the treatment of stroke victims, in light of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, <i>Reducing Brain Damage: Faster access to better stroke care</i> (HC 452).
</p>

<a name="60523-30_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in the early hours of Tuesday 8 May 2001&#151;just five years ago&#151;I was carried by ambulance from my home to the Royal Free Hospital in London, where it was decided that I had suffered a stroke. A few days later, I was moved to the National Hospital in Queen Square.
</p>

<a name="60523-30_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a>I had spent not even one night in hospital in over 50 years. My weight, blood pressure and cholesterol were in order. I did not smoke; I drank moderately, took some exercise and had a careful diet. I had never thought much about health problems or how the body works. Some years earlier, atrial fibrillation had been diagnosed and I settled down to a regime of Warfarin, but that seemed routine in late middle age in order to avoid the possibility of a heart attack.
</p>

<a name="60523-30_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a>I knew of strokes. One had killed Tony Crosland, a friend and Cabinet colleague. Yet in my naivety I thought that a cardiac problem and a stroke were wholly detached&#151;one was of the heart, the other of the head. As far as I recall, stroke had never been mentioned by my doctors during my Warfarin years.
</p>

<a name="60523-30_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a> I tell this story because many are innocent, as I was, about stroke, as it has a low profile among diseases, as is clear in the audit report, and because the consequences of stroke can be fatal to the victims, or they can be left severely disabled. I had no physical consequences of my stroke&#151;I was very lucky&#151;but my reading, writing, speaking and comprehension were severely affected. I can still say &quot;questions&quot; when I mean &quot;answers&quot; and &quot;she&quot; instead of &quot;he&quot; and get the wrong preposition, and find it difficult to grasp telephone numbers. But I am immensely grateful for my recovery to the speech and language therapy service of the North Middlesex Hospital, which I attended for two and a half years of speech therapy.
</p>

<a name="60523-30_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a> In passing, I pay tribute to the Stroke Association for its research, welfare and campaigning, and to Different Strokes, a relatively new charity developed by young stroke survivors to support their special needs&#151;and at least 1,000 young people under 30 every year suffer a stroke. I pay tribute too to Speakability, another charity, which cares for patients with special problems and assists their rehabilitation.

</p>

<a name="60523-30_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a>The performance of the Department of Health and the NHS is the key to preventing strokes and handling the consequences, and the recent National Audit Office report gives me serious concern, especially as many hospital trusts are faced with financial deficits. As an example, I refer to the Royal Free Hospital and the Royal Free Hampstead National Health Trust, where I became a patient. I have had correspondence with the Minister of State, Rosie Winterton, in which I asked whether any reductions were being made in the NHS stroke services in England and Wales, given the problems that had arisen from overspending. I understood that her reply was no, but then learned that the Royal Free intended either to close the stroke unit or to reduce its facilities.
</p>

<a name="60523-30_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a>Rosie Winterton now says that the hospital plans,

</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-30_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a>&quot;redesign&quot; is a familiar euphemism&#151;and to reduce the number of designated stroke services, which seems quite contrary to the advice of the National Audit Office report. She also promised that the chair of the Royal Free Trust would provide me with new information. She wrote to me on 29 April but, three weeks later, I have heard nothing at all from the Royal Free. I would be very grateful to be told what is really happening to the Royal Free, whether it is the case that no cuts are being made in NHS stroke services in England and Wales as a result of overspending, and whether any other changes arising from overspending are consistent with the recommendations of the audit report, as in paragraph 9 of the report&#039;s summary, for example.
</p>

<a name="60523-30_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a>I welcome the improvements in stroke services made by the Department of Health over the past few years. I am glad that we now have a dedicated stroke unit in many hospitals and I was delighted to open the new stroke unit in the North Middlesex Hospital last year. I recognise that the Department of Health has a national strategy for the next stage of stroke development, although I am cautious about &quot;strategies&quot;&#151;a buzzword that sometimes avoids or delays necessary action. But overall, given that it is careful, disciplined and restrained, the National Audit Office report is very disturbing. The Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons goes further; it calls the report &quot;scathing&quot; and &quot;deeply shocking&quot; and says that there have been,

<p><a name="stpa_381"></a>Over 100,000 strokes occur every year and stroke accounts for 11 per cent of deaths in England and Wales. Between 20 and 30 per cent of people who have a stroke die within a month, and many others suffer moderate or severe disability. In comparison, more than three times as many women die of stroke than of breast cancer. The key findings of the report say that the Department of Health has not given as high a priority to stroke as to other conditions and that an emergency response to stroke, with efficient and effective acute care, is lacking. Services for coronary heart disease have been well established for many years, but stroke services are still in their infancy, revealing disproportionate differences in resources and status. Rapid admission to hospital and access to <br>&nbsp;<br>

specialised stroke care, including brain scanning, is vital for ensuring the best possible outcome for patients. For many it is a matter of life and death.
</p>

<a name="60523-30_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a>It is not enough for the Department of Health to say that there have been real improvements over recent years and that it hopes to make further progress. It is urgent now to accept all the recommendations of the audit report and to implement them without delay. I understand that the Public Accounts Committee will report in three or four weeks&#039; time, in the middle of June, but I hope that the Minister can reassure me tonight that the Secretary of State is already acting on the audit report.

<a name="60523-30_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Clinton-Davis: </b>   My Lords, I am delighted to follow the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, whom I would claim as a friend of mine for many years. I am particularly pleased that he chose this subject for debate; it is worth while, for several reasons. And I am glad to hear that he has led an exemplary life, as he pointed out.
</p>

<a name="60523-30_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a>I declare my own interest, as I speak in part from an experience that I have undergone, which was partly good and partly not so good. I suffered a severe haemorrhagic stroke in December 1999, which was probably the worst time to have been hospitalised, as the millennium celebrations loomed, depriving hospitals of some of their regular staff. Therapists form a crucial role, especially in the early stages following the attack. But I was lucky, too&#151;and so were the pedestrians whom I managed to avoid in my car that day. How I got into the House of Lords car park I really do not know. I was driving over Westminster Bridge on my way to speak at a parliamentary dinner when it all occurred. When I was here, I was immediately rushed to a good hospital, diagnosed and treated early enough to have been spared to participate in this debate today, albeit that I had to spend 10 weeks in hospital at that time. I thank all my parliamentary colleagues from all parts of the House for the support that I received through these difficult years, which undoubtedly encouraged my rehabilitation.
</p>

<a name="60523-30_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a>Many victims, very young as well as old, are not so fortunate. Sadly, a good outcome is all too often subject to a postcode lottery. According to the Stroke Association, lack of awareness and lack of resources are responsible for hundreds of needless deaths and serious disability in countless patients who might otherwise have made a full recovery. As the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, has eloquently drawn attention to, stroke is one of the top three causes of death in England, possibly in the United Kingdom, and a leading cause of serious disability.
</p>

<a name="60523-30_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a>Many do not realise that there is only a small window of opportunity after suffering a stroke and that it is imperative that victims have rapid access to the highest quality diagnostic and treatment services. Technology, in the form of CT scanners, is a vital modern medical tool, but therapy services are <br>&nbsp;<br>

undervalued and play a pivotal part in the patient&#039;s potential recovery. Speech, and clarity of speech, preserve communication without which life may simply not be worth living. Physiotherapists facilitate immobile limbs to regain some, if not full, function, and occupational therapy encourages independence in daily tasks. Some patients may even obtain access to a neuro-psychologist. I know from my own experience, particularly in this House, that at first people do not understand what you are trying to say. Gradually that impairment is reduced for many, including myself, and now, of course, many simply disagree with whatever I have to say. These dedicated therapeutic professionals leave the NHS in considerable numbers and sometimes have to be contracted back from the private sector, where their earning capacity more realistically reflects their value to society. I again have to declare an interest&#151;I have speech, physio and occupational therapists as close family members, and am very proud of them. I hope that, occasionally, they are proud of me.
</p>

<a name="60523-30_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a>Thankfully, after so many years of ignorance and neglect, the Department of Health is now beginning to treat this sudden affliction with the priority that it deserves and to develop a nationwide approach to address these concerns. The initiative of the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, to encourage speedier action is much to be welcomed.
</p>

<a name="60523-30_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a>More efficient and more effective practice would, according to experts, save at least &#163;20 million annually. On that basis as well as on the alleviation of potential physical and psychological suffering, we must all strive to keep the Government on their toes.
</p>

<a name="60523-30_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a>Finally, I owe a tremendous debt to the group at the Royal Free Hospital&#151;to which the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, referred&#151;most but not all of whom have suffered strokes. I look forward to our meetings on Wednesday mornings. I have gained enormously from what its members have said and done, and I thank them for it. Long may that continue.

<a name="60523-31_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Murphy: </b>   My Lords, I add my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, for initiating the debate. I pay tribute to him and to the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, for giving us the benefit of what it feels like to have had a stroke and for enabling us to hear first hand from people who have survived the experience.
</p>

<a name="60523-31_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a>I declare an interest as a psychiatrist and gerontologist who has treated many stroke patients in the aftermath of their incident, and now as an outgoing chair of a strategic health authority monitoring the implementation of the National Service Framework for Older People.
</p>

<a name="60523-31_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a>First, I acknowledge the recent, if very belated, progress that the Government have made in developing a strategy to improve stroke treatment. There is no doubt that there has been a lot more action recently. We still have no measurable targets, however, such as every stroke patient should have a scan within three hours of their incident to see whether they can <br>&nbsp;<br>

benefit from thrombolysis treatment. We are way behind Canada and Australia, and that means lost lives and very significant economic and human disaster for those who would otherwise have been saved. We still monitor mainly service process measures in the national framework, which is regrettably incapable of measuring anything very useful except the &quot;creative writing talents&quot; of PCTs and trusts.
</p>

<a name="60523-31_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_391"></a>About two years ago I visited every stroke unit in my own strategic health authority area in east London and found to my dismay that while some were exemplary&#151;Tower Hamlets stroke service is an excellent example of the best&#151;not all services were as advanced by any means, and none was getting every stroke patient in its patch into a specialist unit immediately as a medical emergency. It was pretty hit and miss whether people got specialist care. Many so-called &quot;special stroke units&quot; comprised merely a handful of allocated beds in a general ward, with no dedicated team or specialist staff, just identified persons known to have &quot;an interest&quot; in stroke. Those of us who can interpret NHS lingo will know that that usually means a person who has a major interest in doing something else. The pleasure I had felt at the apparent progress on the paper returns that we received at the SHA, and which I proudly sent on to the department, did not last when I saw the reality in some trusts and PCTs.
</p>

<a name="60523-31_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a>Why has stroke until now not got the attention of other medical emergencies? It is due to ageism. Stroke is seen as an old person&#039;s misfortune and an irremediable one at that. While overt age discrimination may be less acceptable than it used to be, there is still thoughtless neglect and passive lack of thought given to older people&#039;s disorders. Cardiovascular disease has a separate national framework and a national network but stroke was shoved in with the older people&#039;s framework. Stroke demonstrates a serious dilemma in the provision of services for older people. Unless they have access to the same acute diagnostics and treatment as younger people, and unless access is constantly audited to eradicate ageist clinical decision-making, very often they will receive an inferior standard of medical care, often in non-acute geriatric units. Often those units are provided with the best but, in my view, misguided paternalistic intentions. Gerontological practice can get rapidly isolated from the mainstream and stroke care is a good example of how slow we can be in using the existing technological kit properly and in implementing good clinical practice.
</p>

<a name="60523-31_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a>One aspect of the National Audit Office report disappointed me, though. There was reference to emotional and social problems but practically none to the fact that the main long-term outcome of a stroke in terms of social and occupational rehabilitation is the extent of mental health problems, in cognition, perception, emotions, severe depression and other distressing mental symptoms. In this House there are many people with profound physical disabilities. Their presence reminds us that it is your brain that counts, not your muscles, when it comes to contributing to society and maintaining social relationships. With <br>&nbsp;<br>

stroke the success of cognitive and emotional rehabilitation determines the eventual level of social reintegration, and whether a person can return home.
</p>

<a name="60523-31_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a>I want especially to mention severe depression after stroke. Between 15 to 20 per cent of stroke patients&#151;depending on which surveys you look at&#151;experience a major depressive illness within two months of the stroke. This usually lasts just under a year. Those who suffer from severe depression are 50 per cent more likely to suffer another stroke than those who do not. You hear people say, &quot;Well, they would be depressed wouldn&#039;t they?&quot;. It is true that people will experience terrible feelings of sadness, loss and anxiety, and will struggle to cope, but most people do not develop a formal depressive illness. The sad thing is that depression is highly treatable, even when&#151;as is so often the case with stroke&#151;it is the direct result of organic brain damage. The problem is that once you have had a stroke, your chances of being referred to a specialist mental health service are somewhat less than if you were to experience the same problems without a stroke.
</p>

<a name="60523-31_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a>Insufficient attention, too, is paid to the cognitive, perceptual and speech deficits we have heard so much about from the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, and the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis. There is such a lot that can be done in the early days and there are natural improvements that occur very quickly. But we must get appropriate and highly specialised rehabilitation into the field, especially mental health professionals such as treatment-orientated neuropsychologists and psychiatric nurses who understand cognitive problems in stroke and, as we have heard, some of the speech rehabilitation required. I fear that stroke services and psychiatric services are often so far removed from each other, geographically and philosophically, that this is unlikely to happen without central support and guidance.
</p>

<a name="60523-31_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a>I would like to ask the Minister what the Government are doing to combat the ageism which is still endemic in hospital services, and which has led to this very poor situation. It is not only endemic in hospital services, but in medical research funding. The focus of research is very much determined by ageism. What numerical measures of outcomes will be introduced to ensure that the departmental strategy will work this time?

attack is of the utmost usefulness, but the slower process of stroke prevention is equally important. I would like to ask my noble friend whether Her Majesty&#039;s Government are aware of the need for more regular screening of patients: at least an annual check-up by GPs, to include monitoring of blood pressure. Ideally, this should apply to all patients over 40. Does my noble friend agree that people in middle age and older might be encouraged to buy a now easily obtainable blood pressure monitor for their own use? With an ageing population, the burden of stroke care will most likely increase in the future.
</p>

<a name="60523-31_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a>Professor Paul Durrington, professor of medicine at Manchester Royal Infirmary, advises a far more widespread use of statins, the cholesterol lowering drugs, than is presently the case. He suggests that all middle aged men and older women should be on statins, not merely the 2.5 million for whom they are currently prescribed, if the United Kingdom is to have any real success in combating cardio-vascular disease, the probable precursor to heart attacks and stroke. One low-dose statin is presently available over the counter in high street pharmacies. It will be interesting to hear the attitude of Her Majesty&#039;s Government to this.
</p>

<a name="60523-31_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a>There is a widespread belief that only those who have grown heavier with age have raised cholesterol levels and therefore need statins. I used to have a high level of cholesterol, and have been on a low-dose statin for the past seven years. I also have a sphygmomanometer and monitor my blood pressure regularly. Both my parents suffered strokes, resulting in my mother&#039;s death and leaving my father severely incapacitated. Neither of them ever smoked and I cannot remember alcohol ever being in our home, except perhaps at Christmas. I doubt that either of them ever had their blood pressure monitored until they became ill.
</p>

<a name="60523-31_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a>Stroke costs the NHS nearly &#163;1 billion more per annum than heart disease and has an impact of nearly &#163;7 billion on the wider economy. Why, then, has it not been given a higher priority by the Government, given this evidence of its high cost? Appropriate early treatment can save the Health Service money. A campaign to raise awareness of what stroke is, and the importance of urgent early treatment, might rapidly alert the public to the dangers. It should address those groups at higher risk, such as those of Afro-Caribbean descent.
</p>

<a name="60523-31_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a>At present, according to the findings outlined in the report of the National Sentinel Audit for Stroke, only 30 per cent of patients registered for an urgent CT scan had the scan on the same day. &quot;Time lost is brain lost&quot; is a terrible commentary on this situation. Mortality from both coronary heart disease and stroke has fallen over the past few years, but the decline has been more rapid in the case of heart disease. Until prompt treatment becomes the rule it would be too brutal to remind the public in any campaign that may be launched that, heavy and painful burden though the after-effects of heart attack may be, stroke will very likely leave the sufferer incapacitated.

<p><a name="stpa_402"></a>Health experts also blame the United Kingdom&#039;s unhealthy diet and lack of encouragement of physical exercise. One in three of Europe&#039;s obese children are British. Although too many schools still adhere to unhealthy and fat-laden meals, bad diet begins at home. It is heartening to see that some schools are writing to parents about their obese children and advising attention to diet for the evidence is that a greatly overweight child will grow up to be a greatly overweight adult. These people may grow up liable to heart attack. Will they also be candidates for stroke, with all its consequent suffering and disability?

<a name="60523-32_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </b>   My Lords, it was very interesting to hear the history of his stroke from the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers. I am delighted that he has introduced this debate this evening. I remember the recovery of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, how patient the House was, and how rapidly and determinedly he recovered. The noble Lord&#039;s speech came back to what it is now, but it was a difficult time for him.
</p>

<a name="60523-32_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a>My husband had a stroke in 2003. The interesting thing is that whereas the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, gets his words backwards, Kevin&#039;s problem is that he sees things backwards. The problem depends on where in your brain the damage is. He can go to a great deal of trouble to set his pullover out carefully, the way he has been taught, in order to pick it up and put it on. This week he coped brilliantly with this, but then I looked over and said, &quot;That is marvellous. It is on the right way, but happens to be inside out&quot;. He had not noticed. Obviously he has suffered loss of orientation to a degree. Sadly, he tells me that he has also lost his sense of taste, which he really regrets.
</p>

<a name="60523-32_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a>He was fortunate enough to be under a marvellous consultant: Doctor Pelly at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, which has a very good stroke unit. Dr Pelly has no permanent registrar. The reason is not that there is no post; there is a post and there are people who would like that post. However, the rotation is so badly organised that it is shared between the central London post in Fulham and other places way outside London. So no registrar, who is going to have to do a bit here and a bit there, can decide where to live; it is quite impractical and no one wants that job. If only the medical school, or someone, would take the trouble to rearrange the rotation there could be a permanent registrar, which would be a great help to Dr Pelly, who is the splendid consultant in charge of the stroke unit.
</p>

<a name="60523-32_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a>It is interesting that when my husband had his stroke, he had no idea that he had it. As a trained dentist, I did not really know what had happened to him. I phoned him and said, &quot;How are you?&quot;&#151;because I was thinking of going home at that time&#151;and he said, &quot;I am not myself. I dropped my wallet, and then I lost my bus pass. I went to get a new photo for a new bus pass, and I hit a taxi&quot;. I said, &quot;What do you mean you hit a taxi? A taxi hit you?&quot;. He said, &quot;No, I hit a taxi. I walked right into the taxi&quot;. I said, &quot;How could that be?&quot;. He said, &quot;I got the photo for the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_805"></a>

bus pass, and I hit two more taxis on the way home&quot;. I said, &quot;I am coming straight home&quot;, which I did, and I could see that there was something wrong with him. There was blood all down his forehead in the photo that he had taken for the bus pass. The taxi driver had pulled up and said, &quot;Are you all right, guv?&quot;, as obviously he realised something was a bit wrong, but no one picked it up.
</p>

<a name="60523-32_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a>We had our very good cleaner there that day, and I asked her whether she had noticed anything. She said, &quot;Yes I noticed that he was a bit funny. I thought maybe he was drunk&quot;. She has never seen him drunk. In all his life, I have only seen him drunk once in 50 years. She did not think of it. The noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, did not spell this out in words, but I will spell it out in words. FAST is the slogan of the Stroke Association&#151;F for facial weakness; A for arm weakness; S for speech problems; T for test all three.
</p>

<a name="60523-32_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a>As a dentist, I have a modicum of medical training, and I said, &quot;There is something wrong; we are going to the hospital&quot;. He said, &quot;I do not know that is necessary&quot;. That is the sort of reaction people give. I should have been able to recognise it, as I knew that something was wrong. We went to the hospital, which admitted him, and it still took a good many hours to do the scan. He was at the hospital within four or five hours, but the scan was not done until the next day. People must be available to operate the MRI scanners at any time that a patient arrives, because until they know whether it is a thrombosis or a haemorrhage they do not know which way to treat it, and if you treat it the wrong way you will kill the patient. That is the most basic and essential first step. I support the view of the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, that prevention is the ultimate; if we could prevent everything, that would be marvellous. But following that, the next answer is fast&#151;not only in the sense of the slogan of the Stroke Association&#151;assessment of the condition, so that they know what it is and how to treat it.
</p>

<a name="60523-32_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a>Willpower is very important in recovery. Points have been made about frustration, and there is a degree of frustration. Kevin never suffered depression, but he does suffer a degree of frustration. For someone who had marvellous manual dexterity, his left hand can no longer do what it used to do. Anyone who loses any degree of capability is very conscious of that, perhaps more so than those who never had that ability. The statement that impressed me in the speech made by the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell&#151;of course she can always turn a good word&#151;was, &quot;Time lost is brain lost&quot;. That is absolutely true, and we must develop a rapid response. FAST is the word for diagnosis and assessment.

one. So I know a bit about it from that respect, and because of that experience, I have taken a particular interest. I have sat in A&E departments watching A&E doctors trying to make that FAST diagnosis in the middle of a very busy A&E ward.
</p>

<a name="60523-32_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a>My noble friend Lord Rodgers has organised this debate in a timely fashion. Not only do we have the National Audit Office report from November 2005, we have the report of the Public Accounts Committee of 8 February 2006. Furthermore, we have Professor Ian Philp&#039;s report on the first five years of the implementation of the NSF for older people, which includes a standard on stroke care.
</p>

<a name="60523-32_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a>Of all those documents, the most interesting and revealing issue to arise&#151;from the NAO report&#151;is the model of care adopted in Australia, where stroke is classified as a medical emergency and medical teams are organised to treat it as a fast stream disease. Were it to be replicated here, it would not only save patient lives, as has been said, but it would decrease the number of people who are left with dependencies and disabilities after a stroke. Moreover, that approach would save the NHS a great deal of money. That ought to be the key factor that the Government pay attention to.
</p>

<a name="60523-32_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a>The national audit of stroke was due to start collecting data in April this year. Even without the benefit of that information, it is clear that there has been a great deal of improvement in stroke care over the past decade; not as much as there has been on chronic heart disease and cancer, but there has been less investment in stroke care. Between 1992 and 2002, stroke mortality declined by about 30 per cent in people aged under 75, but the chance of a stroke being fatal has remained constant at about 25 per cent. The average length of stay in an acute hospital bed has declined from 34 days to 28 days, but at any one time 20 per cent of acute beds are occupied by people who have had a stroke.
</p>

<a name="60523-32_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a>The key problem is accurate diagnosis before a patient enters an acute hospital. The new GP contract specifies that people who have had strokes should be identified and treated within protocols agreed with specialists. Have those protocols been developed and implemented? Furthermore, do they include ambulance staff, who are often the people who spend time with stroke patients during the critical first few hours? I am concerned because last week NHS Direct announced several thousand job losses. What impact will those cuts have on people who are trying to get information and make the sort of diagnosis that the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, talked about?
</p>

<a name="60523-32_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a>Anyone who has had a stroke, or cares for someone who has had one, knows that agonising period when you wait to find out what type of episode has happened and what the consequences are likely to be; whether it is a blood clot or a cerebral haemorrhage. The NAO report identified that failure to have rapid access to a scan is a major cause of delay in treatment. The Public Accounts Committee report showed more clearly that it is not always about access to the machinery and the <br>&nbsp;<br>

kit; it is about having access to the staff who have the capacity to understand and read the scans and to interpret the data. Where those staff are available in A&E departments, the whole care pathway becomes much faster and people get much quicker access to appropriate care. I say that from experience. It makes a huge difference when the scanning equipment and the staff are in the A&E department and there is quick access to DVT nurses, for example. I have experienced that at St George&#039;s when I have been accompanying people. It is part of its ground-breaking work on hypertension, and it proves the benefits of having an integrated care pathway.
</p>

<a name="60523-32_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a>In evidence to the Public Accounts Committee, Professor Roger Boyle, national director for heart disease at the Department of Health, referred to a stroke research network. Will the Minister give further details of that? How will it be organised and resourced? Will the development of the network be dependent on the support and involvement of PCTs and ambulance trusts as well as acute trusts? If so, will the current restructuring of PCTs and ambulance trusts delay or impede the network&#039;s development? Will it all be caught up in that magical, although frightening, phrase used by my noble friend Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank&#151;&quot;service redesign&quot;?
</p>

<a name="60523-32_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_415"></a>I want to pick on one point in the report of the Public Accounts Committee. There was great discussion about the high incidence of strokes among certain communities&#151;particularly the African-Caribbean population. I was struck that Professor Boyle reported that people from those communities appear to have a disposition towards high blood pressure and a higher resistance to treatment compared with other groups. Therefore, there is a far greater need to ensure that people in those communities are aware of the risks and that they take the sort of prophylactic action that the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, talked about. Professor Boyle talked about the difficulty of reaching those communities. Has the department considered the extent to which it is possible to get messages to people through community networks and groups within those areas and to get specialists from the health service to work alongside the people and community groups there?
</p>

<a name="60523-32_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_416"></a>Finally, I want to touch on the issue of rehabilitation. Anyone who has had a stroke&#151;we have heard some tremendous examples this evening&#151;or anyone who has cared for someone who has had a stroke will know that there is huge scope for recovery. People can relearn speech, regain mobility and learn new mechanisms for coping with the tasks of daily living, but that takes an awful lot longer than a six-week intermediate care package. It is possible to regain one&#039;s facilities and abilities to an extraordinary extent. Without that possibility, people would never be able to stand up and speak with the eloquence of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, or my noble friend Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank. But one of the most difficult things for people who have had a stroke is the ability to regain their confidence&#151;confidence to stand up and speak; confidence to get on a bus; and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_808"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 808</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

confidence to have a bath when there is no one around in case they fall. It is possible to do that with time and help.
</p>

<a name="60523-32_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_417"></a>One of the key points in effective rehabilitation in the future will be the extent to which specialists within the NHS are willing to share their knowledge with those of us who are amateurs but who have time. I once heard a gerontologist at a conference say that we know that in stroke rehabilitation going for a walk is extremely beneficial. Doctors and nurses do not have time to take people for walks. Volunteers and carers do have time but no one has ever told them that that is a good thing to do. Communication between professionals and those who will be there throughout the long period of regaining skills will be the key to the future management of this condition, which will affect many people.
</p>

<a name="60523-32_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_418"></a>It is true that a stroke can be devastating, but it is equally true that great minds need not be damaged by a stroke. It is possible, with help, for someone who has had a stroke to lead a life which is a great example to others, and I thank my noble friend Lord Rodgers very much for the opportunity to make that clear.

<p><a name="st_222"></a>
<a name="60523-33_spnew0"></a><b> Lord McColl of Dulwich: </b>   My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, on initiating this very timely debate. Noble Lords have already dealt with most aspects of stroke in a comprehensive and often moving way, so I shall focus on the mini-stroke, known as the transient ischaemic attack&#151;TIA&#151;having been put into Latin and Greek. &quot;Ischaemic&quot; means &quot;holding back the blood&quot;, and this impairs the part of the brain supplied by the artery in question. The main arteries to the brain can become blocked by fatty deposits known as atheroma. &quot;Atheroma&quot; is Greek for porridge. It may be Greek porridge but it is certainly not like Scottish porridge.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_419"></a>The surface of these bits of atheroma may become roughened and covered by platelets, which are responsible for clotting in the blood. These clumps of platelets may become detached and end up in a part of the brain which stops working for about 15 to 30 minutes. In any patient, the mini-stroke always tends to present in the same way: one patient may have transient weakness of the right arm; another may have transient weakness of the left arm; and another may lose his sight for 15 to 30 minutes.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_420"></a>In order to shed light on the mechanisms of these transient attacks, the late Dr Knight of Guy&#039;s Hospital carried out an interesting experiment. He was an outstanding physician and an enthusiastic and inspiring teacher. He took his team of students and nurses to &quot;Pooh Bridge&quot; in Ashdown Forest, where Winnie the Pooh had carried out an important experiment about 100 years before. Standing on one side of the bridge, they dropped brightly painted cones into the water and established where they went. Of the 100 cones that were dropped, 31 per cent arrived at one destination and 23 per cent at another. That is a very good example of what happens in the brain. These <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_809"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 809</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

clumps of platelets tend to arrive in the same part of the brain, causing the same set of symptoms in any particular patient. The treatment is simple: the patient is given a small dose of aspirin&#151;an eighth of the normal dose&#151;and that tends to reduce the amount of platelets adhering to the fatty deposits and so reduce the number of mini-strokes.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a>As has been said already, there is a tendency to regard a stroke as an incurable problem of old age, and these people do not receive the attention that they require. It is possible to limit the damage done by strokes provided that an accurate diagnosis is made within the first few hours. There are enough scanners throughout the country to make this emergency scanning possible, but the problem is that in many hospitals the scanners are used for only eight hours a day. If you tell captains of industry about that, they are horrified. The idea that huge pieces of machinery should lie idle for most of the time is an anathema to them. Some hospitals use their scanners for 24 hours a day, instead of the usual eight hours. Noble Lords will be comforted to know that St Thomas&#039;s Hospital across the river has in the emergency department a scanner which is in use 24 hours a day. That is the way to do it.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a>If, as has been mentioned, there is a simple blockage of an artery, that can be dissolved with the appropriate treatment. If, on the other hand, the stroke is due to a haemorrhage into the brain in substance, not a great deal can be done at that stage. But when the haemorrhage is outside the brain, just underneath its delicate covering&#151;a so-called sub-arachnoid haemorrhage&#151;emergency surgery is required if there has been a demonstrable rupture in the wall of the artery, which is called an aneurism. Although it is perfectly possible to arrange for everyone to have an emergency scan within three hours, as has been mentioned, there is a problem if we do not have sufficient staff to interpret the results, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, said.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a>What could be the solution to that? The radiographers could easily be trained to interpret scans. Again, however, more resources are required to train them. Then, there is telemedicine, whereby scans can be transmitted to any part of the world and interpreted by experts. I spend my holidays working on a hospital ship in west Africa. We can spread a piece of tissue on a slide and put it into a machine called a Coolscope, which is a computerised microscope. The image can be beamed anywhere in the world. We beam ours to Bristol and get the answer back in five minutes. More of that needs to be done. My noble friend Lord Swinfen and his wife run a charity promoting telemedicine in many parts of the world.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a>Our present mortality rate is too high, as has been mentioned; it is about 30 per cent. There is no reason why we cannot get it down to 15 per cent, as it is in many European countries and in north America, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, emphasised.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a>Then, there is the problem of rehabilitation. There is no doubt that rehabilitation services are not nearly as good as they should be and that many patients have <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_810"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 810</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

felt isolated and neglected. They know only too well that if they had expert help they could return much more rapidly to as normal a life as possible.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, pointed out, his stroke was not due to any fault in his lifestyle. However, many strokes are due to preventable conditions such as high blood pressure. I was interested to hear the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, say that you can buy your own blood pressure machine and monitor your own blood pressure. It is easy to do, and it is very revealing. In between cases in my operating list at Guy&#039;s I went into an empty theatre, lay down on the table and wired myself up to the various monitors, including blood pressure and pulse. I then told myself to relax. You can talk to your blood pressure and bring the thing down. It is amazing. You have a measurement of your blood pressure, so you can see it. You can talk to it and teach yourself how to relax and reduce your blood pressure. I was amazed to see it come down to below 100 and the pulse below 50. I suddenly thought that if somebody came in and read those things, they would think that I needed resuscitation and probably do cardiac massage and break all my ribs. So I left the theatre rather rapidly. Those sorts of simple things are so important.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a>Then there is the question of obesity. We are what we eat. It is amazing how many extraordinary diets people try, including the Atkins diet and so on. At the end of the day, however, you are what you eat and if you eat less, you will lose weight. I had a patient&#151;a man&#151;who was very overweight. He tried everything but it had not worked. I noticed that his wife was nice and thin, so I suggested that he should try eating the same quantity of food as his wife ate. He did not like that idea very much. Three months later I asked his wife how things were going and she said, &quot;He&#039;s the same weight but I&#039;m putting on a lot of weight&quot;. He was obviously getting at her to eat more.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_428"></a>Checking cholesterol levels and getting people to live a healthy lifestyle with plenty of exercise, avoiding smoking and excessive drinking of alcohol are other things that should be encouraged. Of course, we cannot force our views on patients. After all, we are simply advisers and in the end it is their choice.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a>A patient said to his doctor, &quot;Will I live longer if I stop smoking and drinking?&quot;. &quot;No&quot;, said the doctor &quot;but it will seem longer&quot;. That is not true but it is true that the number of strokes can be reduced if healthier lifestyles are encouraged.

<p><a name="st_223"></a>
<a name="60523-33_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Royall of Blaisdon: </b>   My Lords, I am truly grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, for securing the debate and enabling us to discuss stroke services. The noble Lord speaks from great experience, sadly, but I particularly welcome his personal insight and all that I have learnt from his experience and courage, and that of my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a>It is a significant time in the development of stroke services with the National Audit Office report bringing increased attention to the opportunities available, as <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_811"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 811</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

well as the challenges to deliver high quality stroke services. Indeed, I think that the NAO report has acted as a healthy catalyst for change.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_431"></a>Many noble Lords, including my noble friend Lady Rendell, asked why, given the scale of the problem, we have not done more to give stroke a higher priority. We should recognise that for too many years stroke was viewed as an inevitable part of getting old. We should recognise that it is only in recent years that experts have come to a consensus that much can be done to prevent and treat stroke. The growth of stroke medicine is a recent phenomenon and we welcome that.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_432"></a>It is important to recognise the scale of the problem. Each year more than 110,000 people in England have a stroke. Every five minutes someone in the UK has a stroke. In England more than 900,000 people have had a stroke. It is expensive to treat and there are high costs to the wider economy through lack of productivity and informal care. I understand the concern expressed by noble Lords about the NAO report. It made 10 sets of recommendations for improving stroke prevention, treatment and care. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, that the Department of Health is committed to taking all those recommendations forward. The comprehensive response will be through a new stroke strategy currently being developed with the help of six expert project groups chaired by leading figures in the stroke world.The department is also pursuing changes ahead of this strategy; for example, through a new toolkit developed for use by acute trusts which demonstrates the benefits of improved stroke care on an individual hospital basis.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_433"></a>On prevention, the NAO recommended that there should be explicit references to stroke in the department&#039;s public health campaigns and that primary care trusts should ensure access to transient ischaemic attack services. The department has already included more on stroke in its websites, in campaigns such as &quot;five-a-day&quot;, for example, which encourage the consumption of more fruit and vegetables, so that perhaps husbands and wives will both grow thinner. It also has a project group dedicated to making specific recommendations on public awareness-raising and prevention issues. Indeed, this Friday, the department is running a workshop with a range of campaigning experts to produce a menu of ideas for taking this forward. There are already points available in the quality and outcomes framework for GPs about access to specialist out-patients services. Of course, they now have to monitor blood pressure on a more regular basis.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a>In the White Paper <i>Our health, our care, our say</i>, the department is committed to making a life check for everybody at key life stages. The department is working to set up pilots to explore how these will be most effective. My noble friend Lady Rendell asked about the wider use of statins. NICE has recently produced guidance recommending that people with a 20 per cent risk of cardiovascular disease should be treated with statins. We are also considering <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_812"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 812</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

recommendations from the National Screening Committee about improving the detection of cardiovascular disease and diabetes at an earlier stage.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a>On the subject of GPs, the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, asked whether the correct protocols have been implemented. Locally, yes, but they have not yet been set out nationally. Project groups on TIA and emergency response will make recommendations in this area. The Royal College of Physicians&#039;s stroke guidance sets out what should happen, and the Department of Health accepts the need for a further push to ensure that it really does. The department&#039;s TIA project group meets this week to set out detailed recommendations for improving rapid access in every health community. The department is also funding a campaign run by the Stroke Association to raise awareness of stroke symptoms.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a>My noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis spoke movingly of the need for a high standard of acute treatment of stroke and ensuring a rapid response, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes. The National Audit Office has recommended that NICE should produce guidance on delivering thrombolysis, that scanning capacity should be improved&#151;including by providing training for stroke consultants in reading scans&#151;and that access to stroke units should be improved. These recommendations are being taken forward through implementing the toolkit, detailed work with the professional bodies for radiologists and radiographers, and the work of a project group looking at acute care. NICE will produce guidance on managing acute stroke and an accompanying technology appraisal of alteplase, a clot-busting drug.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_437"></a>On post-acute support, the NAO recommended that the quality requirements of the National Service Framework for Long-term Conditions should apply for stroke patients, and that the voluntary sector should be involved in working more closely with the Government. The principles and guidelines set out in the long-term conditions NSF focus on patient-centred care for people with neurological conditions and are highly pertinent to stroke. Professor Ian Philp, the national clinical director for older people, has been promoting their use in stroke care, and the department will build on this through the developing strategy. Indeed, Professor Philp also has a programme of action under way to root out ageism in the NHS and ensure dignity for life.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_438"></a>The voluntary sectors involved in stroke, to which I pay tribute and thank for their untiring work, including the Stroke Association, Different Strokes and Connect, already play a vital part in delivering services to stroke survivors; for example, in running conversation groups for people who experience speech problems after their stroke. Indeed, my own grandmother, who had a couple of strokes, recovered her speech when my daughter was a baby learning to speak. My grandmother had confidence to speak to my daughter, because she knew that she could practise her speech on her. They both learned to speak together. I am delighted that it worked well for both of them. All these voluntary groups are helping the <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_813"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 813</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

department to frame the new strategy, and the contribution of the voluntary sector will be pivotal to implementing it successfully.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a>The department has already, as recommended by the NAO, brought stroke within a new unified framework for vascular disease management, with an integrated policy team across heart disease, diabetes and stroke, and Dr Roger Boyle is now the national clinical director for both heart disease and stroke. We are looking, with the Healthcare Commission and the Royal College of Physicians, at the next steps for improving stroke audit, building on the excellent basis of the sentinel audit. Already, we have agreed that the use of the FAST&#151;face weakness, arm weakness, speech problems test&#151;stroke symptoms protocol should form part of the Healthcare Commission&#039;s assessment of ambulance trusts.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a>We know what the challenges for stroke services are; the NAO report brought them clearly into focus. For example, not enough people really understand what a stroke is or would recognise the symptoms, as noble Lords have said. The noble Lord, Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, and my noble friend Lady Rendell were absolutely right about the need for better communication on the realities of stroke, a point that the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, also made graphically.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a>The Stroke Association has recently been allocated a Section 64 grant to assist with communication. Its campaign, entitled &quot;Stroke is a medical emergency&quot;, urges people to know the warning signs. We fully support its excellent work but we need to make more efforts to explain that a stroke is a brain attack that needs urgent medical attention. We need to ensure that people who experience a mini-stroke seek help straight away rather than risk a really serious stroke later, and that the people with them understand what is happening and how best they can help them.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a>Too many patients are not getting the scans they need as a matter of urgency, as many noble Lords have said. Although progress has been made, many patients still spend less than half their stay in hospital on a stroke unit, and the services are not always there to support patients and their carers when they leave hospital. Much has been said about rehabilitation, about which much more needs to be done.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McColl of Dulwich, will be glad to know that the department is developing a picture archiving and communications system (PACS), which will be rolled out by spring 2007 and will provide opportunities to read scans remotely&#151;rather like what he is doing on his Mercy Ships. Stroke scanning is complex; no one form of scanning provides perfect results. As many noble Lords have said, we must ensure that the appropriate individuals are available to interpret the scans. That is why the Department of Health will include training for a range of professionals as part of the stroke strategy framework that we are developing. Safe delivery of thrombolysis will be supported by NICE guidance on the management of acute stroke and its forthcoming technology appraisal of alteplase, a thrombolytic or <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_814"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column 814</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

clot-busting drug. It will give the NHS a clear steer in the interim, building on the existing guidance from the Royal College of Physicians.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a>The White Paper that we published at the end of January addresses many of the issues faced by stroke patients. It aims to ensure that services are integrated and built around the needs of individuals, with more services delivered in the community or at home. It includes a new deal for carers, a commitment to integrated care plans and a range of measures to ensure that health and social services work more closely together. We must also ensure that those integrated services also address depression.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a>On 1 March we held a national stroke conference, attended by more than 150 people, who will begin developing a new stroke strategy. We demonstrated the toolkit that I mentioned earlier, which brings together the key actions that hospitals can take. It calculates the benefits that taking certain actions can lead to for patients and the hospital itself. It also provides examples of teams that have been through radical change and how they went about it. For example, the Royal Free Hospital used to have one of the worst performing stroke services in the country, but in five years it turned that around and in the 2004 audit it was the best in the country. I understand, therefore, the specific concern that the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, expressed about deficits at the Royal Free Hospital. I am pleased to say that one of its stroke doctors is working with the Department of Health on its hospital care project group. That doctor will be very happy to speak to the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, to give him a more detailed briefing about the planned service developments at the Royal Free Hospital and more widely. I will seek to ensure that that happens soon.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, asked about the UK Stroke Research Network. Apparently, we are giving &#163;20 million over five years to the network, which is headed by Professor Gary Ford, a stroke physician in Newcastle who has trail-blazed thrombolysis, and who will oversee the local research networks. The network is at the very beginning of its exciting work, and I will be very happy to provide noble Lords with further details on it.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_447"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, also asked whether restructuring of PCTs would delay developments. The department is absolutely determined that it will not. We will do our utmost to ensure that services are not disrupted in any shape or form, but if noble Lords find that they are disrupted, I am sure that we will be pleased to hear of those instances.
</p>

<a name="60523-33_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a>I have described today just a few of the steps that we have taken in what will be a sustained and co-ordinated approach to improving stroke services. The challenge now is to spread this nationally so that all patients can benefit. We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but I am confident that we can produce a comprehensive and effective strategy for delivering real improvements in stroke services.

<p><a name="gc_st_1"></a>
<a name="60523-34_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </b>   moved Amendment No. 1:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_0"></a>Page 1, line 19, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

&quot;(   )   Before making regulations under subsection (3), the appropriate national authority must consult&#151;

<br>
(a)   such persons appearing to them to represent relevant interests, and


<br>
(b)   such other persons,


<br>
as they consider appropriate.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="gc_st_2"></a>The noble Baroness said: I am pleased that we have reached the Committee stage of this Bill and I am certain that we have an interesting set of issues to explore. The first amendment that I have tabled seeks to probe exactly what the Government intend to do when they come to make regulations. This Bill essentially paves the way for secondary legislation. During its consideration in another place, the EFRA Committee&#039;s report made it quite clear that there were widespread concerns about the scope of the legislation to be introduced by the Bill and expressed the wish that all the issues be thoroughly explored. So this amendment seeks to examine the power in Clause 1 to use regulations in order to extend the provisions of the Bill&#151;for example, to protect invertebrates or animals still at the embryonic or foetal stage of development.
</p>

<a name="60523-34_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_2"></a>I shall be interested to hear from the Minister precisely who is to be consulted when those regulations are made. It is important that it is made clear who will be involved in the consultation, in what capacity and what interests they represent so as to ensure that all the relevant considerations are taken into account. This Bill is being considered against the background of what, of course, has been deep concern in the other place about the provisions of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, so I suppose that we are particularly sensitised to the issues surrounding secondary legislation. Therefore, a theme running through the amendments that I have tabled is that we shall want to know exactly what the Government intend in secondary legislation. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_3"></a>
<a name="60523-34_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for opening our discussions on the Bill today. We share <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC146"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC146</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

her concern that so much of this Bill is left to Henry VIII clauses and hence to regulations. I want to put that on the record because I feel strongly about it.
</p>

<a name="60523-34_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_3"></a>As we are discussing legislation on animal welfare, I declare an interest as an associate member of the British Veterinary Association. I think that that ought to be recorded and I suspect that other Members of the Committee will at some stage want to record their interests, too.
</p>

<a name="60523-34_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_4"></a>The point that I want to raise with the Minister&#151;it was not touched on by the noble Baroness&#151;is that I presume that the people to be consulted within the remit of Clause 1 will be those with science-based knowledge. Obviously, a great deal of scientific research is carried out into when an animal does and does not feel pain, and I assume that the people involved in that research will be consulted. Those one would naturally consult would be members of the British Veterinary Association or the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, although there must be many others involved in this kind of animal research. In supporting the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, I ask the Minister to say whether the Government have yet formed a view on exactly who is to be consulted and to outline for us what kind of scientific knowledge those people might have.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_4"></a>
<a name="60523-34_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior: </b>   In declaring an interest as a veterinary surgeon and a former president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, I support the amendment. I have little more to say except that the noble Baroness has put it very well.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_5"></a>
<a name="60523-34_spmin1"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Rooker): </b>  I am grateful to the noble Baroness for bringing forward the amendment. I think that I can satisfy the Committee. The Government have said throughout the development of the Bill that we are committed to consulting before using the delegated powers in it and will in practice always do so. For that reason, we do not feel that the amendment is necessary, as it would not alter the way in which the Government will use the powers in Clause 1 in any event.
</p>

<a name="60523-34_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_5"></a>In some ways, the Government cannot be circumscribed in this way in consulting, because, once we consult and put out a document in hard copy and on the website, it is a free-for-all out there for everyone to say their piece&#151;and quite right, too&#151;whether they be individuals, learned institutions or people working in particular sectors. Obviously, we will take account of the results of the consultations.
</p>

<a name="60523-34_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_6"></a>When the Select Committee in the other place conducted the pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Bill, it recommended the insertion of a duty to consult before issuing regulations to promote welfare or to exempt certain procedures from the prohibition on mutilations. We accepted that recommendation and noble Lords will find it included in the Bill at Clause 12(6) and Clause 5(5). To that extent, we have embraced exactly what was required.
</p>

<a name="60523-34_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_7"></a>Clause 1 is slightly different from the clauses on mutilations and the promotion of welfare in that there is already a requirement for some level of consultation. <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC147"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC147</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Clause 1(4) specifies that the appropriate national authority can use the power to make regulations only if it,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_1"></a>&quot;is satisfied, on the basis of scientific evidence&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-34_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_8"></a>that the species being protected is,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_2"></a>&quot;capable of experiencing pain or suffering&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-34_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_9"></a>That requirement to base a decision on scientific evidence ensures that the appropriate national body must, before taking any decision, take account of the views of scientists in the field.
</p>

<a name="60523-34_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_10"></a>Further, as extending the scope of the Bill beyond vertebrates would be a highly significant step, the affirmative regulation-making procedure has been chosen to allow for the proper degree of parliamentary scrutiny. That is important, as there will have to be a debate in both Houses, which would have to actively approve the regulation. In effect, that adds a further level of consultation. Once one has put a debate on the Order Paper, other people can lobby and put their views to noble colleagues and to honourable Members in the other place.
</p>

<a name="60523-34_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_11"></a>The report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of your Lordships&#039; House agreed with our assessment that the powers in this clause are &quot;sufficiently circumscribed&quot;. In other words, the Government cannot do what they want; they have to consult. As I said, our intention will always be to do so.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_6"></a>
<a name="60523-34_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   Before the noble Baroness comes back on that, perhaps I can ask the Minister whether the Government have any time schedule for this procedure to go forward. I remind him gently&#151;because he was very genuine in what he said&#151;that, although we can talk about any order that comes through, we can very rarely, even under the affirmative procedure, alter it once it has been set in stone. Therefore, we shall continue to express worries as the Bill progresses. As he knows, we take lots of statutory instruments and we debate them fully, but it is very rare that they get changed at all.
</p>

<p><a name="gc_st_7"></a>
<a name="60523-35_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I fully accept that. They are just not amendable once they are up for debate. The important stage is while we are getting them up for debate. Like our predecessors in some ways, the Government have tried to issue as much as possible in draft and to have a consultation prior to the final decision. I have no information on the timetable, but I assure the noble Baroness that our intention is to make sure that we do not present Parliament with a <i>fait accompli</i>, because that would not allow for scrutiny. The scrutiny has to lie in what you have done before you get to the point when Parliament acts as the final arbiter. I fully accept that this is a common problem with secondary legislation and that it is a bone of contention and a matter for discussion between your Lordships&#039; House and the other place in due course.

for her last point, which I think is very interesting and to which the Minister gave a frank response. Obviously, that is the background against which we shall argue that some of the later amendments are essential, because if these provisions are not in the Bill now, we will not have any chance in practice to amend them. Indeed, that brief exchange highlights the fact that the convention about statutory instruments was brought in when they were rarely used. The Joint Committee, when examining the various powers and so on, might want to look at this area of work. It can be hard to make sense of this sort of Bill. If the Bill were not amended at all, we could not then amend what will be very extensive secondary legislation. I am glad for the brief debate on that. I thank the Minister for his very helpful reply. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<p><a name="gc_st_10"></a>The noble Duke said: Like my noble friend Lady Byford, I should declare one or two things, such as being associated with the British Veterinary Association and owning a property which has all kinds of animals running around. I gather that this Bill will not affect farm animals in any way, although it might be interesting to see what happens about sheepdogs&#151;they certainly come under the provisions on dogs.
</p>

<a name="60523-35_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_15"></a>Clause 2 consists of three conditions, any one of which may define a protected animal. The third is simply that,

<a name="60523-35_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_16"></a>If we do not have an amendment along the lines of Amendment No. 2, we would find ourselves having to ask the Government to produce a list of what are commonly domesticated animals.
</p>

<a name="60523-35_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_17"></a>I cannot remember the title, but some years ago a documentary film was made for television following the antics of some urban foxes in Bristol. These animals lived in back gardens and created dens under sheds. They ate what they caught but benefited from the local dustbins. The point of the film was that this lifestyle was no longer wild. I have a near neighbour who has a pet fox. We are concerned to know exactly where the dividing line is between a protected and a non-protected animal.
</p>

<a name="60523-35_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_18"></a>Are we in danger of moving to a position where the population feel that they should cease to feed birds and non-domesticated animals for fear of being held responsible for their welfare? For example, domestic dogs kill rats without being encouraged or trained to do so&#151;given half a chance, they would even chase a fox. Does this clause pose the risk of prosecution for a <br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="gc_st_11"></a>
<a name="60523-35_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   This is a very interesting area of debate. My Amendments Nos. 45 and 46, which we will consider later, are relevant to exactly where the lines are between domesticated, non-domesticated and wild animals. The noble Duke has given us some useful examples of problem areas that could arise if those lines are not clearly defined.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_12"></a>
<a name="60523-35_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   In speaking to Amendment No. 3 in this group, I will add to the examples of where it is difficult to be sure of the meaning of the definition. What about New Forest ponies and other animals that are essentially kept wild? Are the Soay sheep wild or domestic? What about the sheep that wander into that village in the West Country? Or is it goats? The noble Baroness will know better than I do.

<p><a name="gc_st_15"></a>
<a name="60523-35_spnew6"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I add my voice to this debate only to reiterate that this is a very difficult problem. I am reminded that my noble friend Lord Arran, whose father introduced the Badgers Bill into your Lordships&#039; House for the first time, tells me that he remembers occasions as a young man going into his parents&#039; room to find that there was a pair of terriers on the bed and a fox and a badger under the bed. The smell was unbelievable, but it demonstrates that even foxes and badgers can, at times, be semi-domesticated.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_16"></a>
<a name="60523-35_spnew7"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I am grateful to the Committee. I realise that there is a fine point about the stage at which the animal may be classified, but I hope that I can give a satisfactory response. I do not have much to declare but, at my previous home in Birmingham, I regularly fed the foxes in Handsworth Wood. There was a block of flats with a little lake from a blocked-up stream. It was very urban. The foxes cleared the plates, and the grass. Everything disappeared and I was happy. I did not consider that I was responsible for the foxes, I must say.
</p>

<a name="60523-35_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_19"></a>In most cases, the fox or rat would not be a protected animal and would be outside the protection of the Bill. Neither is commonly&#151;I use the word carefully&#151;domesticated in this country and they are not protected while living in a wild state and not under the control of man. However, if a fox or a rat were brought under the control of man, it would become protected. It is right that any animal should be protected by the Bill in those circumstances and there is no case for specifically <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC150"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC150</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

exempting foxes or rats. The consequence of their protection is simply that there is an obligation not to cause the animal unnecessary suffering. If a previously wild animal has been made dependent on man or has been domesticated, it may no longer be living in a wild state and could be protected. In those circumstances, we again consider it right that man has an obligation not to cause the animal unnecessary suffering.
</p>

<a name="60523-35_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_20"></a>The drafting of the amendment would not prevent such animals from being classed as protected animals. Rather, it would mean that any animal which was not a fox, rat or wild animal adapting to domestic circumstances would always be a protected animal. That would greatly expand the scope of the Bill to include all other wild animals, such as pheasants and deer. I shall return to the question about pheasants in a moment. We consider such a widening of the Bill to be undesirable, as the Bill is aimed primarily at regulating conduct towards animals over which man has control or responsibility. Wild animals are already protected by other legislation, such as the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996 and, for birds, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.
</p>

<a name="60523-35_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_21"></a>On Amendment No. 3, under Clause 2(c) an animal will be protected if it is not living in a wild state. Several examples of that are given in the Explanatory Notes. For example, if an animal from a non-domesticated species escapes from a zoo or a circus, it cannot be said to be living in a wild state. It would be unfortunate if by virtue of its having escaped the control of man it ceased to be offered the Bill&#039;s protection. The rationale behind Clause 2 is that, if a person has taken an animal, rendered it under his control, and thereby rendered it incapable of fending for itself in the wild, that animal should be offered the protection of the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60523-35_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_22"></a>Amendment No. 3 would exclude from protection an animal released into the wild where it appears to be no longer dependent on man or where animals of the same species have not been under the control of man during the past 18 months. The amendment is misguided because it does not give sufficient regard for the unique circumstances of an individual animal, independent of the state of other animals of the same species in the locality. We would say that the presence of the same species of animal in the locality is, frankly, irrelevant to an animal&#039;s individual need to be protected or, indeed, to whether it is in a wild state.
</p>

<a name="60523-35_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_23"></a>It may be helpful if I give some examples, because that is the best way to explain how the Bill is intended to operate. If a fox is released from a sanctuary and has only briefly been in the custody of man&#151;for example, for a day or two&#151;it is likely to be considered to be in a wild state as soon as it is re-released. It will probably not have become dependent on the sanctuary and those who release it should not be accountable under the Bill for what happens to it. But if a fox has been in the custody of a sanctuary for many months, experience would indicate that it will not be capable of looking after itself in the wild. In that case, it will need a rehabilitation programme that gradually re-accustoms it to the wild. For the majority of that programme, it should still benefit from the protection of this clause.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC151"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC151</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60523-35_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_24"></a>If a fox is just cast out and it suffers unnecessarily, under this amendment an irresponsible sanctuary will have the opportunity to argue that, notwithstanding what good practice should dictate, the animal is not protected because other animals of the same species in the locality happen to be living in a wild state. That may be an extreme case and I am not arguing that sanctuaries are irresponsible, but it provides an example of the different status of such a fox.
</p>

<a name="60523-35_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_25"></a>Amendment No. 3 would lead to uncertainty as to what the clause means and, as a result, the scales would be tipped firmly in the favour of those showing irresponsible behaviour towards wild animals. Under the Bill as drafted, we would expect a court to conclude that, by the stage an animal was roaming widely and obtaining its essential feed by itself, it would be considered to be in a wild state. It might still suffer for a range of reasons, but that would be little different from a fox in a similar position that had never been in the custody of man. It would be in a similar position to a bird that comes each day to a bird table for food. For the avoidance of doubt, such a wild bird would not be protected, even if the bird table had helped it to survive in cold winter months. So feeding a bird would not impose that responsibility.
</p>

<a name="60523-35_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_26"></a>There is an interesting point with regard to the life of a game bird and the ending of its life. Game birds are clearly in the custody of man when in a rearing pen. They are then subject to a process of introduction to the wild, which is accomplished by placing them in a release pen. Methods vary, but in many cases the birds are free to fly from the moment that they are put in the pen. Initially, they might spend long periods in the pen and, even after they have started to roam during the day, they will return at night, encouraged by the keeper. That ensures that they have a guaranteed food and water supply and that predators cannot reach them. At that stage, they are clearly not in a wild state, but, under this amendment, they would not be protected by the Bill. As the Bill is drafted, it is only by the time that they are free to roam at will 24 hours a day that they can be considered to be in a wild state and no longer a protected animal.
</p>

<a name="60523-35_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_27"></a>We think that striking the right balance is important: a keeper should be able to be held accountable in the early stages for ensuring that the game birds do not suffer unnecessarily. But once all he is doing is trying to ensure that they do not stray beyond the boundaries of his shoot by providing food at dispersed sites around his land, the released pheasants are in a comparable position to pheasants on the same land that have never been, or have not been within the previous 18 months, in the custody of man.
</p>

<a name="60523-35_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_28"></a>Amendment No. 3 unnecessarily tries to define &quot;a wild state&quot;. That term is widely understood and, in the overwhelming majority of cases, it will be clear to anyone whether an animal is wild&#151;although if that was always the case, we would not need a lot of legislation, would we? That is why it is important for us to write things down. I agree that animals that are in transition from being in the relatively long-term <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC152"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC152</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

custody of man to being in a wild state pose particular issues. There is a grey area on the borderline, but we believe that it is preferable to trust the courts to exercise their discretion&#151;as in my earlier example&#151;than to try to pin down an exact definition in the legislation. There are too many scenarios to address in a single definition, and there would be a high risk of failing to account for situations that we, the parliamentary draftsmen and our experts do not know about&#151;you can bet that in a country of 60 million people there will be someone, somewhere, doing something that we had not thought about. It would be unfortunate, if we are being prescriptive, to leave animals at risk in that way.
</p>

<a name="60523-35_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_29"></a>Having listened to the points raised by noble Lords and Baronesses, I believe that we have a reasonable argument to cover these issues, and it is an argument that we justifiably have to give. These are areas where animals that would normally be wild vary their status over a period of time. At some points, they clearly need the protection of the Bill; at others, the person in charge&#151;if I can put it that way&#151;would not be committing an offence, because the animal would be back in the wild.

<a name="60523-36_spmin0"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  We have opened up a very interesting topic. As the Minister says, it goes into realms that are very hard to encompass altogether. From what the Minister says, the topic covers the two pigs that escaped from an abattoir and took weeks to be caught. At that point, someone owned them and probably wanted to get them. There are other areas where wild boar escape and no one ever catches them; they presumably end up living in a wild state.
</p>

<a name="60523-36_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_30"></a>One interesting aspect of the Bill is something that I have come across myself. We go around shooting foxes at night. One night, the light was shone into a field and there were about five or six foxes sitting around in a rather startled state just inside the door. I am afraid that they were all shot, but what had obviously happened was that someone in the town had been catching foxes and had then released them in such a way as to fail to make provision for their welfare. Whether these people could then be charged is an interesting aspect of this Bill. We all need to take this away and look at it further in the light of what the Minister said.

<a name="60523-36_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   Before the noble Duke sits down, I want to raise a few points with the Minister for clarity. First, regarding the connection between control and responsibility, those two concepts are in Clauses 2 and 3, and the noble Lord linked them in his reply to me. Am I right in thinking that if an animal is under the control of man, someone will always be responsible for it? Obviously you can have an animal that is not in the control of man, such as an escaped pig, for which someone is none the less responsible. Am I right in that understanding of the link between the two concepts?
</p>

<a name="60523-36_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_31"></a>Secondly, am I right in thinking that someone who traps a mouse using a &quot;humane&quot; mousetrap, which merely drops a door behind them, and then releases the mouse a couple of miles away from their house will be <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC153"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC153</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

committing an offence under the Bill? They will be releasing a mouse into the wild in circumstances where it is likely to die very quickly, as it is in totally unfamiliar territory.
</p>

<a name="60523-36_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_32"></a>Thirdly, we discussed at Second Reading whether the use in uncontrolled circumstances of mouse papers sold through ordinary hardware stores is likely to be outlawed as a result of this legislation. I very much hope that it is.
</p>

<a name="60523-36_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_33"></a>Lastly, to be clear on the issue of pheasants, are the Government saying that if the only methods of restraint used are feeding and beating-in&#151;in other words, doing everything that you can to encourage a &quot;wild&quot; animal to occupy a particular wood but not actually physically restraining it&#151;then under those circumstances the pheasant is a wild animal?
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_19"></a>
<a name="60523-36_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   On the last point, I think that the answer is yes, bearing in mind what I have just read out. In those circumstances, if the animal is free to roam and to come and go 24 hours a day, that would be the case.
</p>

<a name="60523-36_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_34"></a>On the issue of the mouse, it would not be an offence because the mouse is wild when caught. The noble Lord&#039;s implication was that the mouse had been domesticated in the house, but the person in the house would not know how long the mouse had been there and the mouse would not have been domesticated under the control of anyone. That is the point. What the person did not want to do was kill it; they gave it a fighting chance. The point is that the mouse is wild when it is caught, and then it is released again. It would not be classed as domesticated just because it was living in a house.
</p>

<a name="60523-36_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_35"></a>The Bill will not affect legitimate pest control activities and so it does not prohibit the humane killing of an animal. Pest control using other animals would not be an offence under Clause 8 because the use of animals in legitimate pest control falls outside the definition of an animal fight.
</p>

<a name="60523-36_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_36"></a>As to the noble Lord&#039;s first question in regard to control and responsibility, a person is responsible only if he meets the conditions set out in Clause 3. The clause quite specifically sets out that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_5"></a>&quot;references to a person responsible for an animal are to a person responsible for an animal whether on a permanent or temporary basis&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-36_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_37"></a>So if they fall under Clause 3, they become responsible; if they do not fall under the clause, they are not responsible. However, they are responsible if they are the owner, or have assumed responsibility or are in charge of the animal. So a person may have an animal under his control but not necessarily be responsible for it. There is a distinction.

<a name="60523-36_spnew2"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   Perhaps I may seek clarification from the Minister. My noble friend the Duke of Montrose made reference earlier to the question of dumping foxes in the countryside. This is a real issue which I wish to put to the Minister, because in my part of the world, in North Yorkshire, we have had many&#151;anecdotal, <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC154"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC154</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

admittedly&#151;cases where urban foxes have been gathered up, put into some mode of transport, a truck or whatever, and then dumped unceremoniously in the countryside, where quite clearly they are unable to cope because it is an environment that is completely alien to them. Is the Minister saying that that would be an illegal act under the Bill? If it is not, I am minded to bring an amendment at the next stage of the Bill to cover that point.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_21"></a>
<a name="60523-36_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I will take advice on that. The urban fox probably would not have been under the control of the person. I am well aware of the activities of urban foxes in my former, built-up, constituency; they are all over the place and are a real nuisance to many people. There would be a duty not to cause the animals any unnecessary suffering because they would not be living in a wild state&#151;I hope that that point is clear&#151;and for someone to gather them up would be quite irresponsible. This might be a moot point, because it could perhaps be argued that there are two wild states, but being wild in an urban state and being wild in a countryside state is not quite the same. Urban foxes have easy access to food from dustbins and so on and are not trained to hunt for other food, so the countryside would be an alien environment.
</p>

<a name="60523-36_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_38"></a>What was done would amount to abandonment because the urban fox would have been under control at the point of its release. Even though it had not been looked after, someone would have gathered it and taken responsibility for transporting it, and so at that point what was done would amount to abandonment. Locating the individuals responsible and ascertaining where the foxes came from in the urban environment&#151;they are not exactly tagged&#151;would be extremely difficult. So this is not an easy and clear-cut matter. If people were seen doing it, action could probably be taken, but that would be a matter for the courts. If the animal is not living in a wild state, then, of course, it will be protected. The argument will depend on its individual circumstances in the urban environment. Just because it is urban does not mean that it is not wild, but that would be a matter for the courts to decide.

<a name="60523-36_spnew4"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   Is the Minister saying that it would amount to abandonment and therefore the matter would be covered by the Abandonment of Animals Act 1960, or is that Act repealed by the Bill?

<p><a name="gc_st_26"></a>
<a name="60523-36_spmin1"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  That raises an interesting point about whether we want to put in the Bill the number of days you can hold a wild animal without its becoming under your control. I very much doubt whether five or six foxes are all caught in one night&#151;I would think that it would probably take a couple of weeks. If you can hold a wild animal for some time, we need to know how long that is.

<p><a name="gc_st_27"></a>
<a name="60523-36_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I would appreciate a clear statement of the Government&#039;s policy on mouse papers. I regard them as a hideous cruelty, to be used under very strict and proper supervision only. There are many ways of killing mice that cause them pain, but mouse papers are quite extreme.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_28"></a>

<a name="60523-36_para9"></a>

</p>

<a name="60523-37_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_44"></a>The reason for the amendment is quite simple. People under the age of 16 can be very mischievous at times and are quite likely to produce animals. I remember my son arriving one day with worms squiggling out of his pocket, or trying to frighten us with little mice he had found. He thought it was a great joke.
</p>

<a name="60523-37_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_45"></a>The amendment would clarify who is in control or has temporary care of an animal. We would not like these provisions to add to the burden of teachers, teaching assistants or volunteers who run Beaver, Brownie or Cub groups if, for example, one of the <br>&nbsp;<br>

children produced a white rat, a ferret or a kitten unexpectedly, in circumstances which were not in the animal&#039;s best interests. As the Bill stands, I do not know what their position is, because they are not in care technically, although at that moment they might well be.
</p>

<a name="60523-37_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_46"></a>Secondly, I refer to the policeman who was prosecuted for killing an injured animal to spare it further suffering. This case, which received wide coverage in the press and other media, has caused many people to reconsider whether the alleviation of suffering is any longer any part of humanity unless one has a suitable qualification, a practising certificate or a licence so to do.
</p>

<a name="60523-37_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_47"></a>This definition of responsibility is very tightly drawn and may even result in someone with responsibility for animal welfare being obliged to prosecute someone in the circumstances that I have described. It is not possible to dismiss this hypothesis on the ground that it is ridiculous, precisely because the prosecution of that policeman was brought. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_33"></a>
<a name="60523-37_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   The amendment of the noble Baroness raises an interesting thought. For example, when under-16s for some reason experience great disruption in their lives and are, perhaps, taken into foster care, their animals will often be an issue, too. I understand the sentiment behind the amendment, but if we were to include it, what would happen, given that the household is likely to be stressed anyway? Although the children would come first, would it be wise to provide exemption from responsibility for animals in such circumstances?

<p><a name="gc_st_34"></a>
<a name="60523-37_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </b>   I have been faced with ferrets as pets and even lugworms&#151;where I drew the line&#151;as pets on their way to becoming angling bait; I was told that they could live happily in the fridge. So I understand the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, about who brings what home.
</p>

<a name="60523-37_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_48"></a>Where a person under 16 has responsibility for an animal, the Bill allows that someone else will also be responsible for the animal. For example, if a 15 year-old keeps a pet cat or goldfish, they would be responsible for those animals. However, it is important that an adult is also considered responsible for the animal so that they can ensure that its welfare needs are met. I think that we all have experience of young people who leave home and leave behind their pet animals for the parents to look after.
</p>

<a name="60523-37_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_49"></a>Concerns were expressed in another place over whether a teacher, for example, who has temporary care and control of a child, should also be considered to be responsible for the child&#039;s animals. Where such a person has care and control of a person under 16, he or she takes on responsibility for that child&#039;s animals, but the precise extent of that responsibility will depend on the circumstances. The important thing to remember is that that responsibility obliges the person only to take such steps as are reasonable to ensure that the animal&#039;s needs are met. If, for example, pupils are allowed to bring their pets into school for a day, the extent of that obligation will be minimal. However, we <br>&nbsp;<br>

believe that it is right that there is an obligation. If you take on the care and control of a child&#151;and this, I hope, covers the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer&#151;knowing that they have an animal, then it is right that you also take on some responsibility for that animal. By the same token, if a child brings the school hamster home for the weekend, then the parents will become temporarily responsible for the hamster while it is in their care.
</p>

<a name="60523-37_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_50"></a>I am seeking advice on the alleviation of suffering and the case that the noble Baroness referred to. Having been in the countryside, I recall coming across rabbits with myxomatosis. Under the 1911 Act and the current law on cruelty, a police officer may put an animal out of its misery if that is necessary and it is not possible to call a vet. People are not obliged to put animals out of their misery, and there is no responsibility on anyone other than those responsible for the animals. If a person is responsible, they may have to take an animal to a vet to determine what action is appropriate, or, if they are competent to do so, they may be able to put the animal out of its misery themselves. I hope that that covers the points that have been raised. I can see that there remains a question as to whether the police officer in the case to which the noble Baroness referred, which I am afraid I do not know about, would have been deemed to be competent under this legislation. I shall look into the matter and, if there is anything that I can add between now and Report, I shall do so in writing.

<a name="60523-38_spmin0"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 40 and 44, which are grouped with this amendment. As Members of the Committee will see, we are considering introducing a new clause later. Although someone who abandons an animal where suffering could occur or was occurring would be guilty of an offence under the Bill, there is no specific offence of abandonment. Perhaps the Minister can tell us her interpretation of abandonment.
</p>

<a name="60523-38_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_53"></a>The specific issue of abandonment was raised by some of my colleagues in another place. We want to bring it back in this House because the response of the Minister in the other place was not fully satisfactory. As the Bill stands, some people who have abandoned an animal will be prosecuted under Clause 4 for inflicting unnecessary suffering, whereas others will be prosecuted under Clause 9, which concerns the duty on someone responsible for an animal to ensure its welfare. Not only does that leave some ambiguity, but it suggests to me that the double importance of abandonment ought to be covered by abandonment constituting its own offence. The application of these clauses arises as a result of the consequences of abandonment, not of abandonment itself. My honourable friend Jim Paice said that,


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_8"></a>&quot;we still believe that abandonment should be treated as a separate offence&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report, </i>Commons, 14/3/06; col. 1394.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-38_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_54"></a>He said that abandonment used to be a very serious offence&#151;it was covered by a separate Act of 1960&#151;but that this Government do not deem it so important, otherwise they would surely have put in a separate section in this Bill.
</p>

<a name="60523-38_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_55"></a>If a person abandons an animal, Clause 9 would apply only where the animal ceases to be able to fend for itself, but in that case the damage would already have been done. Clause 4 would apply only if suffering <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC159"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC159</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

occurred as a result of the abandonment. Abandonment is not a problem that begins and ends with an act contravening welfare or cruelty laws. The consequences of abandonment stretch to those individuals or to sanctuaries that take an animal in after abandonment without the involvement of an inspector or constable. Amendment No. 40 not only deals with the event of abandonment, by providing a deterrent, but also provides for the transfer of ownership of an animal that has been abandoned.
</p>

<a name="60523-38_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_56"></a>On Amendment No. 44, the duty of care for the animal is currently open-ended. Simply releasing an animal into the wild opens up an individual to potential prosecution under either Clause 9 or Clause 4. Abandonment and release are extremely different actions with opposite intentions behind them. The abandonment amendment would ensure that the specific act of abandonment was defined so as not to capture those who correctly release animals into the wild. The amendment supports that definition.
</p>

<a name="60523-38_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_57"></a>The Countryside Alliance was very worried about this topic. It pointed out that the Explanatory Notes state:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_9"></a>&quot;The Abandonment of Animals Act 1960 is repealed and effectively replaced by this clause, and anyone who leaves an animal without taking reasonable steps to ensure that it is capable of fending for itself and living independently will commit an offence under clause 9&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-38_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_58"></a>However, it seems that, once a person becomes responsible for an animal and thus has a duty of care for that animal, that duty is open-ended. Simply releasing the animal into the wild, whether or not it is capable of fending for itself, could lead to a prosecution for abandonment. The Abandonment of Animals Act 1960 contained an important caveat. It said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_10"></a>&quot;If any person being the owner or having charge or control of any animal shall without reasonable cause or excuse abandon it, whether permanently or not, in circumstances likely to cause the animal unnecessary suffering . . . he shall be guilty&quot;.</p>

<p><a name="gc_stpa_62"></a>is sufficient to prevent an attempted prosecution. It cannot be Defra&#039;s intention to prevent the responsible release back into the wild of injured wild animals cared for in an animal sanctuary or hospital, or indeed to prevent the reintroduction of important species or the release of non-target species from traps. Our amendment would give much needed clarification in terms of the scope of the clause in so far as it covers an offence of abandonment.

an animal, they would continue to be legally responsible for it indefinitely. We believe that this is unnecessary and could have adverse effects.
</p>

<a name="60523-38_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_63"></a>As we have said consistently, at the point of abandonment a person will commit an offence under this Bill. If someone abandons an animal for which they are responsible and it is unable to fend for itself, he or she will have failed to take all reasonable steps to ensure that its needs are met. Consequently, they are likely to have committed the welfare offence in Clause 9. Also, if as a result of the abandonment suffering had actually occurred, the Bill&#039;s cruelty provisions in Clause 4 would be engaged.
</p>

<a name="60523-38_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_64"></a>We believe that to amend the Bill so that that person continues to be responsible for the animal indefinitely would be unenforceable and undesirable. We are aware of some issues of definition that would arise from the inclusion of the term &quot;abandonment&quot; in the Bill. Trying to draft a definition that does not catch the release of game birds, of fish into a stream or pond or of animals on to common land is exceptionally difficult. Consequently, the amendment could have the effect of making a gamekeeper permanently responsible for all the game birds that he releases and may lead to his committing a welfare offence at any time in the future. We are sure that that is not the intention behind the amendment.
</p>

<a name="60523-38_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_65"></a>Amendment No. 44 seeks to ensure that, if someone releases an animal into the wild in circumstances that are unlikely to cause it unnecessary suffering, they will cease to have responsibility for that animal. We consider that when someone releases an animal into the wild, they need to ensure that the animal is not just being released in circumstances that are unlikely to cause it unnecessary suffering. They would also need to ensure that the animal&#039;s needs have been met in order to prevent themselves from falling foul of the welfare offence.
</p>

<a name="60523-38_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_66"></a>There are important differences between abandoning an animal and releasing it into the wild with the realistic intention that it will be able to fend for itself. Examples have already been referred to, such as animal rehabilitation centres returning an animal to the wild, and the release of pheasants. When those activities are undertaken properly, there is a realistic expectation that the animals will be able to fend for themselves, because they have been released in circumstances that would be expected to ensure their survival&#151;for example, suitable environment and diet&#151;in terms of their ability to feed themselves. We consider that the Bill makes it clear when either the welfare offence or the cruelty offence will apply in these types of circumstance.
</p>

<a name="60523-38_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_67"></a>Amendments Nos. 40 and 52 would make it a specific offence to abandon an animal. This is not necessary. Abandonment is merely one way in which the welfare or cruelty offences can be committed. Under the amendments, all acts of abandonment will be treated equally. The Government prefer the approach in the Bill, which makes it clear that it is a more serious event if the animal suffers as a result. To respond to the noble Duke, this is not a question of the Government <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC161"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC161</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

believing that abandonment is less important; rather, we believe that there are gradations, and it is important that they are taken into account.
</p>

<a name="60523-38_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_68"></a>We do not consider the explicit considerations in subsection (3) of Amendment No. 52, proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, to be necessary, as Clause 9 of the Bill already provides for this by ensuring that owners and keepers must provide for an animal&#039;s needs.
</p>

<a name="60523-38_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_69"></a>Subsection (3) of Amendment 40 provides that someone who finds, or is handed, an animal that seems to be have been abandoned can claim ownership to a court after three months of its being abandoned. By definition, it is likely to be impossible to tell precisely when an animal has been abandoned. It would therefore be difficult to judge when the three-month period should start.
</p>

<a name="60523-38_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_70"></a>The Bill provides powers that will allow regulations to be made concerning the reallocation of ownership rights when an animal is abandoned. That involves human rights issues, and very careful thought will need to be given to the way in which the powers given in the Bill are exercised. I look forward to discussing this further when we consider the regulations. In the mean time, the determination of ownership can be left to the courts. That is at least human rights compliant, although we acknowledge that it is far too cumbersome to be used as a general mechanism, hence the procedure that I have just described. I hope that this response satisfies noble Lords.

<a name="60523-39_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I thank the Minister and others who have spoken in this debate. However, I am afraid that I am not altogether satisfied with the Minister&#039;s response, and I will briefly explain why. The first problem arises where the Minister considers that abandonment is more serious if the animal suffers as well. Certainly that is serious and it could be argued that it is adequately covered in the Bill, but there are other serious consequences, such as for taxpayers. For example, local authorities have to employ dog wardens to deal with abandoned dogs and there is a heavy burden on animal charities in having to deal with these animals. If abandonment was becoming a less serious issue and there were fewer abandoned cats and dogs than was the case 20 years ago, I could see why the Government are taking this approach, but I am told by everyone working in the area that the problem is serious and growing&#151;by &quot;everyone&quot;, I mean not only animal welfare groups, but insurance companies and so on. Across the board, this is seen as an increasingly serious problem.
</p>

<a name="60523-39_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_71"></a>I am also not convinced by the Minister&#039;s argument about the different definitions needed, and that if this amendment were adopted we might catch within it game birds or fish. The Government have the ingenuity of civil servants and Ministers at their disposal. If they chose to devise a clause to cover abandonment, I am sure that they could cover quite adequately the release into the wild of the species that she mentioned. So I do not accept that as a reason for not trying to address the issue in a positive way rather <br>&nbsp;<br>

than taking a sideways approach&#151;addressing people who have not provided for an animal adequately when they ought to have done.

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_45"></a>
<a name="60523-39_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </b>   moved Amendment No. 6:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_14"></a>Page 2, line 20, after second &quot;act&quot; insert &quot;where such an act can reasonably be expected&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_46"></a>The noble Baroness said: Clause 4 addresses the duty of care and is a good addition to the duty placed on people to look after animals, but again I have some concerns over the wording. Subsection (1)(b) sensibly includes a proviso that a person has to know about a problem in order to be expected to deal with it. But what it does not do is define adequately the limits of the expectation in the clause.
</p>

<a name="60523-39_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_76"></a>I shall mention a couple of examples. The first is what I would call the &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; case where someone passes an injured cat at the side of the motorway&#151;or perhaps a quieter road, because on a motorway one might not see the cat at all. If you notice an injured animal as you drive along, should you stop and take care of it? The second example that comes to mind is of an animal owner with mental health problems. This is a fairly common occurrence. I have come across several cases personally of someone who has a collection of animals and looks after them adequately, but for one reason or another&#151;through ageing or an unforeseen event in their life that makes them less capable&#151;they cease to care for the animals properly. In those circumstances, can it be said that they should have reasonably known what was happening? I suppose the defence of diminished responsibility could be deployed in those instances, as it can be for a crime. However, I should like the Minister to put on the record the exact position regarding such people. I think that my amendment puts forward a reasonable compromise whereby people would be required to help an animal in distress, even if they are not responsible for it, but not to an unreasonable or impracticable extent.
</p>

<a name="60523-39_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_77"></a>Amendment No. 11 in this group covers a point raised by my honourable friend in another place, Norman Baker. Clause 4(3)(c) provides that the protection of property should be taken into account when considering the reason for animal suffering. He made the observation that this could provide a loophole for defending instances of unnecessary suffering in animals. I accept the assurances of the Minister in the other place that this would not be an absolute defence, but the issue has not been considered here. It is therefore reasonable to raise it and ask whether there should be some qualification of the word &quot;property&quot; to make sure that that reason arises <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC163"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC163</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

only in extreme circumstances. The Government have rightly introduced a Bill to prevent animal suffering, so perhaps we should not list so early in the legislation a number of reasons why we might expect animals to suffer, particularly if it was simply in defence of some minor piece of property. I beg to move.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_47"></a>
<a name="60523-39_spmin0"></a><b>The Countess of Mar:</b>  On the second argument put forward by the noble Baroness in support of her amendment, she spoke of people becoming too old or frail to look after their animals. I had just such an instance with a goat. My first goat was bought in the market and had been quite severely neglected because its owner, a veteran of the Korean War, suddenly developed what today we would call post-traumatic stress disorder and became incapable of looking after the animal. It is important to distinguish between someone who is willing to allow an animal be sold on or given away and one who stubbornly refuses to do so and maintains an animal in a poor condition. That needs to be taken into consideration.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_48"></a>
<a name="60523-39_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I have a few amendments in this group. Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 would insert the word &quot;substantially&quot; after &quot;suffer&quot;. My terriers would say that they suffer if I do not feed them on time or if I leave them at home when I go for a walk. We need some recognisable quantum of suffering in order to avoid the ordinary and minor mishaps that certainly affect any dog that is allowed to run loose in the countryside. A terrier running fast under barbed wire is likely to cut itself from time to time. It is what they do and I have no wish to keep my dogs on leads. We need to provide for a quantum of suffering.
</p>

<a name="60523-39_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_78"></a>Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 have been tabled to look at the reasons given under subsection (3)(c). Nothing here would cover the tigers kept, say, at London Zoo. It is quite clear that they suffer. They live in extreme confinement for such animals and look as if they are having a pretty miserable time of it, but no purpose is explicitly provided in this clause to allow that suffering to be excused. I could cite other examples: why does one stock a river or rear pheasants? What benefit does that bring to offset the suffering? The argument there might be that the benefit goes to the environment. In these amendments, I am looking for specific exceptions or matters to be taken into account under subsection (3)(c) to cover particular circumstances where we ought to allow some offset against the cruelty that may be caused.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_49"></a>
<a name="60523-39_spmin1"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  I am interested to note that my noble friend Lord Lucas has raised some of these issues. Here we are getting into the whole question of judgment, which is a difficult area of legislation. The question raised is whether or not substantial suffering has been caused. The same is possibly true with subsections (1)(d) and (2)(d), in which provision is made for where the suffering is unnecessary. Can the Minister tell us whether the word &quot;unnecessary&quot; is defined somewhere? Certainly it is true to say that in the treatment of farm animals there is a definition of <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC164"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC164</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

what is necessary, but are we entering here into an area in which a judgment will have to be made on what is &quot;unnecessary&quot;?
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_50"></a>
<a name="60523-39_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   The answer to the last question is no, and I shall explain the reasons in a moment. I shall deal first with one or two of the points that have been put to me so as to give some clarity here. There is currently a legal requirement to report to the police a road accident involving a dog; there is no such requirement for other animals. That refers specifically to road accidents. I was asked whether a motorist who passes an injured cat on the road is required to stop and look after it, and the answer is no. That also applies to a badger, which, of course, has special protection anyway. Even if a motorist saw a badger in the last throes of TB and clearly distressed dragging itself across the road and not quite making it, there would be no requirement on him to stop and he would not commit an offence if he did not do so.
</p>

<a name="60523-39_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_79"></a>As to the point about mental problems raised by the noble Countess, there will be a power to seize an animal if an offence has been committed, but it is unlikely that the person will be prosecuted, depending on their degree of mental incapacity. One does not wish to be unreasonable about this, but we could solve the problem, first, by taking the animal into care and, secondly, by not prosecuting the person depending on their degree of mental impairment.
</p>

<a name="60523-39_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_80"></a>Zoo animals, including tigers, are covered under the Bill, both in relation to cruelty and welfare. Zoos, of course, are also licensed under the Zoo Licensing Act and are inspected by approved inspectors. This Act also includes provisions relating to welfare. I hope that that puts into context some of the points with which I will deal in my formal response to particular amendments.
</p>

<a name="60523-39_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_81"></a>Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 seek to raise the threshold so that the offence is committed only where unnecessary, substantial suffering has occurred. I can understand the concern that it would be possible to prosecute someone under the Bill even if the animal&#039;s suffering had been minimal. However, I suggest that the concept of suffering has a fairly high threshold, and if an animal has experienced unnecessary suffering, then frankly, regardless of the degree of suffering, why should a prosecution not be brought? That is the point.
</p>

<a name="60523-39_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_82"></a>There is no such additional threshold in existing legislation. The concept of unnecessary suffering is not a new one. It was present, in particular, in the 1911 Act, under which a person is guilty of an offence if he causes any unnecessary suffering. I do not have details of any problems caused by enforcement that would justify the introduction of additional requirements here.
</p>

<a name="60523-39_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_83"></a>Clause 4(3) sets out the considerations which it is relevant to have regard to when determining whether suffering was unnecessary. We think that it would be unwise to tie the court&#039;s hands in deciding what is unnecessary. As I say, it is not defined in the 1911 Act, which is the current law. This has worked well and has not caused problems in case law. Obviously the court would adjust any sentence imposed on conviction to <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC165"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC165</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

take account of the severity of the suffering caused. That is the point at which the matter would be taken into account. The sentencing guidelines available to magistrates make it clear that the harm caused and the harm intended are relative factors in assessing an offender&#039;s culpability. So that aspect is taken into account in the guidelines.
</p>

<a name="60523-39_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_84"></a>As to Amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 in relation to the considerations that the court may take into account in determining whether suffering is unnecessary, I have referred to Clause 4(3) as a whole before dealing with the specific amendments. Subsection (3) contains a list of relevant considerations; it is not a list of absolute defences. The opening wording of subsection (3) makes that very clear. It states:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_15"></a>&quot;The considerations to which it is relevant to have regard . . . include&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-39_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_85"></a>It then gives a list of factors which a court may or may not take into consideration when determining whether the suffering was unnecessary. Furthermore, the court may take other factors into consideration. The list is not exhaustive.
</p>

<a name="60523-39_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_86"></a>Subsection (3) sets out the considerations to which the court could have regard. These focus on the necessity, proportionality, humanity and competence of the conduct. All relevant considerations should be taken into account and weighed against one another as appropriate. Courts have to consider the extent to which the suffering could reasonably have been avoided or reduced. Where suffering occurs in the course of complying with any regulations, licence or code of practice, an offence would not normally be committed. For example, where a horse suffers while it is being used for riot control, this may be considered necessary for the purposes of protecting persons or property.
<a name="gc_time_4"></a>

</p>

<a name="60523-39_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_87"></a>Amendment No. 9 seeks to clarify that any conduct associated with a legitimate activity can be considered, as well as conduct for legitimate purposes. We have not found any examples where such a change to the clause would excuse legitimate conduct that would not otherwise be excused under the present draft. I question whether the amendment is necessary.
</p>

<a name="60523-39_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_88"></a>On Amendment No. 11, I assure Members of the Committee that the inclusion of the protection of property in Clause 4(3) does not mean that protection of property becomes an absolute defence to the offence of cruelty. It merely means that protection of property is one factor that a court may, at its discretion, take into account in determining whether suffering was necessary. That does not indicate a belief on our part that property rights should in any way trump animal suffering. The provision is not to be read in that way; it reflects the reality that in some circumstances the protection of property may justify some level of suffering.
</p>

<a name="60523-39_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_89"></a>Two examples were given in the other place by my honourable friend the Member for Exeter of situations in which this consideration might be relevant&#151;the use of riot horses by police and guard dogs by <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC166"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC166</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

homeowners. The police use riot horses as the most effective means of protecting people and their property from damage and destruction. Sometimes, unfortunately, the horses will be injured. Likewise, guard dogs are used by private individuals to protect their property and may be injured by a potential or actual burglar who threatens that property. In principle, both the police and the homeowner who put these animals in those situations could be held responsible for their unnecessary suffering by virtue of Clause 4(2). But I hope that Members of the Committee agree that both situations are examples of the protection of property being a legitimate purpose. We do not want police officers and homeowners to be held responsible under Clause 4(2) as long as the court feels that the balance of factors used in Clause 4(3) weighs in favour of the owner&#039;s conduct.
</p>

<a name="60523-39_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_90"></a>Amendment No. 6 seeks to clarify that no liability for failing to act will be imposed under Clause 4 in circumstances where it would not be reasonable to expect a person to act. We intend Clause 4 to operate as expected. If the noble Baroness withdraws the amendment, I hope to contact her before Report about whether an amendment to Clause 4 is necessary to ensure that we achieve this aim. In other words, we want the clause to operate in the way that is intended and are prepared to have discussions before Report to see if we need to bring forward an amendment to put that beyond doubt. We are rowing the same boat here.
</p>

<a name="60523-39_para20"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_91"></a>I hope that that answers the point; I will come back if need be but, as we can see from the examples given, this is a very sensitive issue. We have laboured the point about the protection of property; it is important, but it is not an overriding factor that justifies the unnecessary suffering of animals. No one is saying that. The Bill&#039;s inclusion of property is in the context that I have set out in my examples.

&quot;CIRCUS ANIMALS

<br>
(1)   No person shall carry on the activity of training, keeping or using an animal for the purposes of, or as part of, a travelling circus.


<br>
(2)   For the purpose of this section, a travelling circus is a circus which operates from no single place of establishment.

<p><a name="gc_st_53"></a>The noble Baroness said: With Clause 12 we move to a completely new issue, which my amendment proposes a new clause to deal with: circus animals. Of all the topics in the Bill that we are likely to debate, this one arouses strong feelings, both among us here and among the general public. I would not claim that all those feelings were one way.

<a name="60523-40_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I shall try to carry on from where I left off. Circuses raise strong feelings. In the other place, the Minister assured the House that regulations would be used to,


</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_17"></a>&quot;ban the use of certain non-domesticated species in travelling circuses and to impose zoo standards on circuses&#039; permanent premises&quot;.&#151;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 14/3/06; col. 1404.]</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-40_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_96"></a>My amendment aims to move beyond that statement in two ways. First, it puts the provision in the Bill, ensuring that the Chamber has some control over what I believe is a very important matter of principle. The Minister has said all the way through that this is an enabling Bill which looks to secondary legislation. I believe that the use of animals in circuses needs to be debated and resolved.
</p>

<a name="60523-40_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_97"></a>Secondly, my amendment requires a positive endorsement for the use of any animals in the circus. It will alter the burden of proof. For an animal to perform in a circus, it must be proved that the five freedoms for the animal&#039;s welfare&#151;all the things that are laid out in the Bill&#151;can be met. That shift in the burden of proof is a shift in favour of exactly what the Bill seeks to achieve in animal welfare terms.
</p>

<a name="60523-40_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_98"></a>I anticipate that this provision will result in a list of approved species. I am not trying to list in my amendment what would be acceptable and what would not, as I do not believe that that would be constructive. I envisage that such a list would include domestic species&#151;for example, dogs, for which it is pretty easy to cater for the five freedoms, even within a travelling circus. It would certainly exclude non-domesticated species and species with more complex needs.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_99"></a>Public opinion is an important guide, although I accept that that is not always the best way of legislating. In the MORI poll of 2005, 80 per cent thought that the use of wild animals was unacceptable and 65 per cent thought that the use of any animals was unacceptable. I am in the second group. Having seen the amazing entertainment that human-only circuses can offer, I think that it has become widely accepted over time that the use of animals is unnecessary in order to have an extremely exciting and entertaining circus.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_100"></a>Deciding which species could be compatible with those five freedoms is an issue for the regulations. Issues raised about the animals still used in circuses in the UK&#151;lions, tigers, zebras, camels and, I believe, one elephant&#151;relate to inadequate space and long periods of isolation, which produce all sorts of abnormal behaviour, such as the characteristic pacing of animals kept in small cages or the rocking to and fro, which is a well recognised symptom of trauma.
</p>

<a name="60523-40_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_101"></a>If the Bill seeks to ensure that those five freedoms&#151;those basic needs&#151;are met at all times, it follows that the Government must regulate so that species can be included in a circus only if it is clear that those five needs can be met. I cannot see how the spatial or social needs of animals such as big cats could ever be met, particularly in itinerant circuses. I seek a commitment from the Minister to ban the inclusion of certain species by regulation. I know that the Government have made a statement about that, but my amendment would put the onus on proving that the use of certain species that may be required to perform for the public can fulfil the conditions set out in these provisions. I beg to move.

<a name="60523-40_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Kirkhill: </b>   I support the amendment of the noble Baroness; indeed, I have put my name to it. As an aside, I am about to give my noble friend the Minister a great deal of political hope, if he wishes to look at it in that light. It was 30 years ago that I sat where he sat in the first Grand Committee held in the Moses Room. Believe it or not, we were considering the Licensing (Scotland) Bill in 1976. There you are, you have 30 years of this in front of you&#151;and that is an awful thought, I am sure.
</p>

<a name="60523-40_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_102"></a>The noble Baroness carefully and in explicit terms talked about the Bill in its true context. I wish to express an aspect of public opinion. I am opposed to the use of performing animals in circuses. I believe that they are trained cruelly&#151;in fact, I know that they are and I have seen some absolute evidence to that end, although I will not go into that today. They travel in restricted circumstances. Their exercise, such as it is when it is available, is limited. In the 21st century, we should turn away from that altogether as a means of entertaining people. I do not wish to say more at this stage, because I do not have anything useful to add to the more detailed points made so succinctly by the noble Baroness. But today, in the 21st century, there must surely be a chance to put this provision on the face of a new Act.

<a name="60523-40_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior: </b>   I support the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and echo what the noble Lord, Lord Kirkhill, has just said. It is long past the time that we should think about getting rid of performing animals, especially in travelling circuses. As a young veterinarian many years ago, one of my jobs was to examine animals in a travelling circus. It was appalling to see the state that they were in. There was little that one could do to ensure that the welfare of the animals was improved, given that they were automatically licensed, because the circus was a source of revenue for the local authority. But we have moved on since then.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_103"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned the five freedoms of such animals. With the exception of a few animals referred to in subsection (4) of the proposed new clause, there are no five freedoms. We know so little about the physiology and the sentience of the exotic species that often used to be seen&#151;and still are&#151;in some travelling circuses. We should admit that we are not in a position to confine them and allow them to travel in such circumstances. There is every opportunity for such animals to have inadequate exercise, inadequate care and inadequate healthcare.
</p>

<a name="60523-40_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_104"></a>I notice that subsection (4) provides for the possible exemption of particular species. I suppose that horses and dogs may come into this category, as has been mentioned; we seem to know more about their physiology, their relationship to man and how to look after them than we do about any of the other species. Therefore, I am hopeful that the noble Baroness will stick to her guns. My comments are also applicable to Amendment No. 13, in the names of my noble friends Lady Byford and the Duke of Montrose.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_57"></a>
<a name="60523-40_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I should like to speak to Amendment No. 13. Amendment No. 12 would provide a total ban on animals performing in circuses, whereas Amendment No. 13 concerns wild animals only. I acknowledge, as the noble Baroness and others have done, that this is a very emotive subject. Many people believe that animals and wild animals should be allowed to be in circuses and to be seen by the public directly. Many argue that it is the only time they have a chance to see some of those animals performing. I take a slightly different view in that I think zoos still have a great part to play. People can go to see animals in zoos, where they are free to roam. They are not trained to perform but are there to be seen in as natural an environment as possible&#151;it is not possible to have a true natural environment.
</p>

<a name="60523-40_para13"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_105"></a>I have concerns about the use of wild animals. This is very much a personal view. When we debate this issue again, as I suspect we shall at Report, there will be a variety of views expressed around the Chamber. But I am particularly concerned about the use of wild animals. I understand that only three out of the remaining 10 British circuses actually use them and I am sure that those who work there do everything they can to ensure the safety and welfare of their animals. I would not like to suggest that our amendment is saying that they are not doing what they should. But concerns are raised from time to time that some facilities and freedoms are not as good as they might be if those wild animals were free.
</p>

<a name="60523-40_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_106"></a>I have one or two specific questions. While I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for introducing her amendment, I do not share her wish for a total ban on circuses using animals. That makes it more difficult to explain why I am sticking out for banning the use of wild animals only rather than all animals. From a personal, practical point of view, horses and dogs are used in everyday life and are trained in everyday life; I do not see the same problem there as exists with wilder animals, although there could be.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_107"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said, quite rightly, that when this was debated in the Commons, a commitment was given for some form of regulation. Perhaps the Minister can tell us more about that. The matter was considered by the EFRA Select Committee in the pre-legislative scrutiny to the Bill. The committee expressed concerns that Her Majesty&#039;s Government&#039;s proposals did not go far enough to protect wild animals used in circuses and commented that Defra should state the difference between the use of wild animals and the use of domesticated animals in circuses, with a view to prohibiting wild animals and licensing domestic ones. It stated:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_18"></a>&quot;The welfare needs of wild animals are obviously very different from those of domestic animals, and more difficult for circuses&#151;which are, by their nature, itinerant&#151;to meet&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-40_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_108"></a>The heart of the problem lies in the fact that many of those circuses&#151;particularly on the Continent, although we are not considering the Continent with this Bill, which deals with the UK&#151;are travelling. It is more difficult to impose welfare regulations on a body that is often on the move.

<a name="60523-40_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_109"></a>The debate in another place and here has focused on whether animals should or should not be used in circuses. My ban would be different from the ban of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, in that it would prohibit only wild animals in circuses. I gather that such a provision already exists in several countries, including Austria, Israel, Costa Rica and Singapore.
</p>

<a name="60523-40_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_110"></a>I have some questions for the Minister. If the Bill stands as it is and is not altered and circuses visit this country, would the rules that affect us be different from those that people are used to overseas? The feedback that I have had from people who have followed this aspect of the Bill is that the welfare side of circuses is not as readily observed overseas as it is over here. We would be very interested to hear from the Minister about what is happening on the international front. Again, I quote from Ben Bradshaw. He said:


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_19"></a>&quot;I sympathise with the view that performances by some non-domesticated species in travelling circuses are not compatible with meeting their welfare needs&quot;.</p>

Presumably, before they bring any regulations before this Chamber or another place, they would go out to consultation.

Will the Government consider looking at wild or exotic animals separately from what I would call domesticated animals within circuses? If so, how long will this consultation take to come into being? Have <br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60523-40_para22"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_114"></a>I realise that this is a very difficult issue. I am not belittling it. There are those who are in favour of having animals in circuses and those who are not. I assure noble Lords that were the matter to go to a vote&#151;which obviously it cannot today as we are in Grand Committee; I wish to make it clear that there is no vote&#151;it would very much be a free-vote issue for our party and, I am sure, for all parties.

<a name="60523-41_spmin0"></a><b>The Countess of Mar:</b>  I support what both noble Baronesses and the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, have said. There are one or two things that I would like to have cleared up. Can the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, make it clear whether her ban would include horses? For example, would horses from the Spanish Riding School be included in this ban? They are not necessarily circus animals, but they travel around and perform.
</p>

<a name="60523-41_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_116"></a>It is not clear whether the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, seeks to exclude second-generation animals&#151;those that have been bred in the circus&#151;from subsection (3) of her amendment. As the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, made very clear, we do not understand the physiological and mental aspects of such animals. My feeling is that they retain many of their wild genes, so to speak. The amendment of the noble Baroness does not make it clear whether all wild animals&#151;whether they are bred in captivity or in the wild&#151;will be excluded. It would help if those points could be clarified.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_59"></a>
<a name="60523-41_spnew0"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   I thank the noble Countess for her question and for giving me the opportunity to spell out exactly what I mean. Subsection (4) of my amendment states that the regulations will exempt particular species of animals in specific circumstances. So, if it was felt that the five freedoms could be met, for example, for the Spanish Riding School horses&#151;and the likelihood is that they could be, because we are not, after all, seeking to ban all dressage and show-jumping events, or anything of that kind&#151;subsection (4) would enable the regulations to exempt such species. I should say to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, that my amendment does not envisage a total ban because it leaves it open for the regulating authority to consider what species of animals it may be appropriate to exempt.
</p>

<a name="60523-41_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_117"></a>I reiterate the question of the noble Countess about what is &quot;wild&quot; because of my concern about the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. There could be many circumstances in which circus <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC172"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC172</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

owners may say, &quot;But this is a third-generation tiger. It is not wild and so it is fine to carry on using it&quot;. Is that what the noble Baroness intended?
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_60"></a>
<a name="60523-41_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Christopher: </b>   I apologise for arriving in the middle of the debate and so I shall confine my few remarks to the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. I share, in a sense, the anxieties about what is &quot;wild&quot;. I have two thoughts on this. First, is a Dartmoor pony wild? Is an Exmoor pony wild? What is wild? Secondly, and slightly anecdotally, some years back I was on an extended tour of China&#151;indirectly paid for by the Chinese Government&#151;and, among many other things, I was taken to a circus where one of the acts consisted of performing domestic cats. It was only because of the sense of courtesy that I felt obliged to observe to those who had taken me that I stayed&#151;it was appalling. So what is &quot;wild&quot;? That is my question.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_61"></a>
<a name="60523-41_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   Indeed. What is a circus? I do not know whether there is any definition of it. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, seemed to be spreading it fairly wide to include dressage, so why not horse racing for that matter? I hope that we will not legislate on the basis of the Napoleonic model that only what is permitted is allowed. I prefer our arrangement of banning specific things and allowing people the freedom to do what they want outside that.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_62"></a>
<a name="60523-41_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </b>   Perhaps I may clarify that point. I was replying to the reference by the noble Countess to the Spanish Riding School. My amendment does not at all envisage drawing in anything as wide as dressage and show-jumping events, which Spanish Riding School horses could also take part in.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_63"></a>
<a name="60523-41_spnew4"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   Clearly this is a very emotive issue. On principle I find it fairly unattractive when I see what I regard as non-domestic animals being made to perform acts that are alien to their natural behaviour. However, we have to accept the fact that circuses are part of national life and bring a great degree of pleasure to many people. But, of course, we come back to the question of what is &quot;wild&quot; and, on balance, my sympathies lie very much with the amendment of my noble friend Lady Byford.
</p>

<a name="60523-41_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_118"></a>When the regulations are drawn up as to how circuses are going to operate, how does the Minister envisage the question of what is &quot;wild&quot; being determined? For example, a second-generation tiger may be regarded as wild and a third-generation tiger may or may not be regarded as wild, so surely it will depend very much on the nature of the animal itself. These are difficult subjects to address but, on balance, my sympathy lies with the notion of maintaining the principles of the circus, provided that we can deal with this rather vexed question. I know that the Government will have some difficulty in dealing with this, but it will be interesting to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter.

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_64"></a>

performing. As regards the two amendments, it seems to me that we will potentially run into some difficulties. As I understand the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, certain things that would be permitted to be done with horses outside a circus will be forbidden inside a circus, however you define it. That will cause a terrible problem.
</p>

<a name="60523-41_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_119"></a>As my noble friend Lady Byford said on her amendment, the definition of a wild animal is crucial to the entire meaning of the proposed clauses. I have come to the conclusion that whatever we decide to do, we should make sure that the definitions are accurately delineated. In English law there is much learning about the difference between domestic animals and wild animals which may or may not be relevant in the context of tigers and lions which, to the best of my belief, were not commonplace in the Middle Ages when the definitions started to be formulated.
</p>

<a name="60523-41_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_120"></a>If we proceed in this direction, it is important to ensure that the definitions are more sharply described than in the current text.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_65"></a>
<a name="60523-41_spnew6"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   Perhaps I may come back before the Minister rises to speak. I well appreciate that my description of wild animals is wide and not sharply defined; for which I can only apologise to noble Lords. With this amendment we are trying to force a debate around the whole issue and to differentiate between domesticated and what I would class as non-domesticated animals. However, that is not a proper answer. I need to put my thinking cap on between now and the next stage. For example, I believe that there is only one circus elephant left in this country. You could argue that an elephant is a wild animal, but you could also argue that in some countries an elephant is considered to be a domesticated animal. The problems get more and more difficult. But we are in Committee and we wanted to have a proper debate around the whole issue.
</p>

<a name="60523-41_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_121"></a>So I apologise to noble Lords that I did not define the term; I think I felt inadequate to define it better. One could ask, &quot;What about reptiles?&quot; and lots of other different sorts of animals. The amendment seeks to tease out whether noble Lords had any thoughts or guidance that we could give to the Government, because obviously the Bill is at an early stage in this Chamber. That is why we made the distinction with &quot;wild&quot;. I realise that it is not a good answer, but at this stage it is all that is on offer. We are really saying that we have one amendment which is clearer.
</p>

<a name="60523-41_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_122"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, quite rightly said that if one reads her amendment carefully, one sees that it gives the national authority an opportunity to include or exclude animals which our amendment specifically would not. I am grateful to noble Lords who have commented on the amendment; I am even more grateful to the noble Minister who will reply to both of them.

definitions. That is so in some ways. It is right that the Bill is properly scrutinised. I do not think that anybody should apologise for creating this debate about circuses. The public would think we had gone bananas if we dealt with the Bill and did not discuss these issues.

Whether we will get clarity I am not so sure, because as has been made clear during the past few minutes, there are different definitions.

<a name="60523-42_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_124"></a>Obviously, the issues were debated in the other place, so the Government are more than aware of the strength of feeling about the issue of circus animals. Campaign groups and others are vocal on the subject, as is their right. We have listened carefully, but we are not convinced that circuses are by their nature cruel or that the welfare needs of certain species cannot be met in a circus environment. However, we sympathise with the view that performances by some non-domesticated species in travelling circuses are not compatible with meeting their welfare needs, and have concluded that a regulation under Clause 12 would provide much-needed clarity for circus proprietors and enforcers so that animals&#039; needs can be adequately met in a travelling circus environment.
</p>

<a name="60523-42_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_125"></a>As the noble Baroness said in introducing the debate, my honourable friend the Member for Exeter gave an undertaking in the form of a Written Statement in another place on 8 March to introduce a regulation under Clause 12 to ban the use of certain non-domesticated species in travelling circuses, and to impose standards equivalent to those required of zoo premises on circus winter quarters. That meets many of the concerns raised, if not all.
</p>

<a name="60523-42_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_126"></a>Amendment No. 12 would write my honourable friend&#039;s commitment into the Bill. We do not think that that is necessary or appropriate. The Government are seeking Parliament&#039;s permission to use delegated powers to deal with these matters in a flexible manner so that we do not end up with a rigid and unwieldy piece of primary legislation. If we get it wrong in the Bill, it could take years to sort out. Primary legislation of this kind does not come along on a regular basis. The flexibility afforded by being able to repeal or reform secondary legislation is a useful and practical way to deal with such issues. We can handle much better the myriad incidents and practices that may <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC175"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC175</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

occur, whether they concern circuses, pet fairs, greyhounds or sanctuaries in discrete pieces of secondary rather than primary legislation.
</p>

<a name="60523-42_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_127"></a>We think that Clause 12 is sufficiently wide to enable us to achieve the result being sought by the noble Baroness through secondary legislation. There is no reason why Clause 12 regulation could not take the form of a ban plus exemptions. I note from the proposed new clause that the noble Baroness would be content with a species-specific approach dealt with in secondary legislation. We are actually in agreement on this point. I simply suggest to her that the ban itself could and should be in secondary legislation as well.
</p>

<a name="60523-42_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_128"></a>Amendments Nos. 168 and 169 would again write my honourable friend&#039;s commitment to ensure equivalency in standards between zoos and circus permanent premises into the Bill. It is possible that that will be achieved through the Zoo Licensing Inspectorate as it takes on the work of inspecting circus&#039;s permanent premises. We do not rule that out. It could be the ultimate answer; that is possible. However, there has been no opportunity yet to consider the feasibility of the proposal. The task might be better handled by local authority inspectors or the State Veterinary Service.
</p>

<a name="60523-42_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_129"></a>The noble Baroness&#039;s amendments would bring circus premises under the zoo licensing system immediately. At some point in the future that could prove to be the desirable means of achieving the objective so it is not ruled out of our discussion, but we would pre-empt proper consideration of the options by amending the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60523-42_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_130"></a>Amendment No. 13 is a little different. It would ban live public performances by wild or wild-caught animals. I see what the noble Baroness is trying to achieve in terms of the ethics of those animals performing; it is a point of principle. It has nothing to do with welfare, it would just stop it happening, which is a legitimate proposal. The amendment applies only to wild and wild-caught animals. As has been clear from some speeches, it is an attempt to get at the issue of circuses, but it fails as most circus animals are captive-bred. Other words would be required to cover them.
</p>

<a name="60523-42_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_131"></a>The amendment is quite wide in that it would ban such performances in zoos as well as in circuses. There is no stipulation that the animals should have been trained for the purposes of the performance, so, for example, the amendment would ban the show at London Zoo where the penguins are fed. It might also be argued that, for example, the primates on show at the sanctuary Monkey World are &quot;performing&quot; within the scope of this amendment, as they are given food or specific environmental enrichment devices which the public observe for entertainment, and frequently there are film cameras as well. I see no reason to ban either kind of performance, even if the animals are wild-caught.

<a name="60523-42_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_132"></a>There is strength of feeling on this issue and we certainly agree that the existing regulation of the industry is insufficient. The industry itself agrees with campaign groups on that point. The Government have given a commitment that we will address the issue, as set out by my honourable friend.
</p>

<a name="60523-42_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_133"></a>I turn to some of the specific points raised in the debate. &quot;Commonly domesticated&quot;, for example, includes animals whose collective behaviour, life cycle and physiology have been altered as a result of their breeding and living conditions being under human control in the British Isles for multiple generations. That has been included to ensure that dogs and cats in particular are always covered, even if they are stray or feral. It is often not easy to tell whether they are stray, feral or owned.
</p>

<a name="60523-42_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_134"></a>On the issue of Spanish riding horses, they would not be impacted on by a ban because it relates to wild animals. They would not be affected at all. Visiting foreign circuses would have to comply with our legislation relating to animal welfare. Where certain species are banned here, foreign circuses would not be able to exhibit them. I make that absolutely clear. I was going to say, &quot;When in Rome&quot;, but it is our law so when they are here, it is our law that counts. There are some EU sensitivities about member states banning animal acts and circuses and we must ensure that any ban is compatible with Community law, so there is some issue there and I know that questions have been raised.
</p>

<a name="60523-42_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_135"></a>Visiting circuses would need to do all that is reasonable to ensure that the circus environment was capable of meeting animals&#039; needs. Following the statement of my honourable friend about the working group considering wild animals in travelling circuses, some work will need to be done. No final decisions have been made, but it is essential that we include representatives from central government, the veterinary profession, welfare organisations and the circus industry. When deciding whether types of wild animals are suitable for performance in travelling circuses, decisions will need to be anchored in what the available scientific evidence tells us, but we recognise the need to listen to those with experience of wild animals in circuses. That obviously includes those in the industry, as well as welfare organisations and people who have gained evidence and experience from direct observation. Just because they are not commercially involved in running a circus does not mean to say that they do not have a view that is worth taking into account.

</p>

<a name="60523-42_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_136"></a>In terms of cracking on with this, I have to say that the working group will be set up shortly. Let me put it this way: I hope that I do not have to say that again when we reach the Report stage. In the time-honoured way, as the Minister responsible I know that I will be pressed on it. By the time we reach the Report stage when the House may want to make decisions on these issues, while I can make the case again that I have today, and perhaps in more detail, it will be difficult to do that if I cannot give an indication at least of progress towards setting up the working group, even if it has not actually started work.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_137"></a>I was asked whether Defra has done any species research. No research has been commissioned on particular animal species within the circus environment at present, but we will look to a wide variety of experts in the field to advise us on the continued use of certain non-domesticated species in circuses and keep the policy under review. As I have said, we hope that those discussions will begin shortly.
</p>

<a name="60523-42_para14"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_138"></a>More than one reference has been made to something that I was not aware of: the fact that there is only one elephant in the circuses referred to. I understand that the animal does not perform, and I leave to one side the point that the animal lives on its own and the issues related to that. No doubt we can come back to this.
</p>

<a name="60523-42_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_139"></a>Questions were also asked about the evidence required to ensure a ban on the use of a particular species. It is a fair point and I shall focus on it in my conclusion. The Government are willing to consider any evidence that has a sound scientific base, preferably peer-reviewed and conducted in an environment where the animals were performing and travelling. We acknowledge that there is likely to be a lack of scientific evidence related to animals used specifically in entertainment, and we would be willing to consider sound scientific results obtained on species kept in different conditions, if we can establish that those results could reasonably be extrapolated to other circumstances. We do not consider photographic or video evidence to be sufficient to base policy decisions on. Such evidence can be open to misinterpretation and gives only a snapshot in time. A film showing a lion pacing up and down may indicate evidence of stereotypical behaviour, but equally the film may have been shot when the lion had seen its keeper approaching with food. So the context in which the film was made is important and the evidence has to go wider.
</p>

<a name="60523-42_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_140"></a>On evidence of particular instances of cruelty, while that is distressing, it is of course not sufficient to demonstrate that a particular environment necessarily causes animal suffering. Animals in any environment may be subject to particular instances of cruelty&#151;private pet ownership is the most common example, even though one assumes that animals are safe and well looked after in those circumstances. In order to establish that a certain environment inevitably causes suffering or distress to an animal, supporting scientific evidence set out in published papers that have been peer reviewed would have to be submitted. The point here is that it must be demonstrated that animals suffer and are in distress simply by being in a certain environment, and that is why it is not something that can be proved with a snapshot.

Taking it at face value would suggest that I did not believe that any wild animals should take part in any performances at all.

Amendment No. 13 should have been worded: &quot;Wild animals in performance in circuses&quot;. As it was grouped with the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, I assumed that it was, but clearly there is an error on our part. That is what the amendment refers to, not to performing animals outside circuses.

is a jolly hard thing to prove. It reminds me of many other debates that we have had in your Lordships&#039; House, which I shall certainly not go into now. Is it not better for the burden of proof to be on those running the circuses to prove that the species that they are using can happily perform within the confines of the five freedoms?

</ul>
<p>


</p>

&quot;ELECTRIC COLLARS

<br>
(1)   A person commits an offence if&#151;


<br>
(a)   he attaches an electric collar to an animal if he knows it to be an electric collar; or
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<br>
(b)   he knowingly uses or permits the use of any electric collar on any animal.

<br>
(2)   A person commits an offence if he has in his possession or under his control, or offers, exposes, or advertises for sale or supply, or sells or supplies, any electric collar intended for use on any animal.


<br>
(3)   In this section, &quot;electric collar&quot; means any collar or other device which is made, designed or adapted to transmit electric current or other electric impulse to cause shock, pain or other stimulus to an animal wearing, or otherwise in contact with, the collar but does not include a proximity collar.


<br>
(4)   In subsection (3), a &quot;proximity collar&quot; means a collar or other device which is made, designed or adapted to be used so that an electric current or other electric impulse is transmitted automatically when the collar is near to another device in order to prevent or deter the animal in question from entering or leaving any land.&quot;</p>



<p><a name="gc_st_85"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment deals with quite a different and much more confined issue than that of circuses. I refer to electric collars. When I was first asked to table the amendment, I said certainly not; I thought it was the sort of attachment one could put on a dog that would work in the same way as an electric fence. If the animal goes to a certain point, it gets a little shock, in much the same way that a sheep or a cow does if it touches an electric fence. I declined to table the amendment because I think the use of electric fences and similar controls is reasonable. There would be enormous implications for stock management if we were not able to use such devices. However, when I saw one of these collars and its use was demonstrated to me, I realised the vast difference between a shock collar and the sort of collar that you can put on your dog so that it will not stray out of your gate because every time it gets near it gets a little ping.
</p>

<a name="60523-44_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_152"></a>When a remote shock collar is put on a dog, you are holding a handset and you are &quot;training&quot; the dog not to chase livestock, for example. That was how it was put to me: there are problems with dogs chasing livestock, and this is a way to teach them not to. That is a fairly poor argument; if a member of the public is out with their dog anywhere near livestock, the dog is supposed to be on a lead.
</p>

<a name="60523-44_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_153"></a>A shock collar might also be used is when a dog is barking all the time. When a shock collar is put on, you turn up the electric shock it gets every time it barks and eventually it probably will learn not to bark. But the whole point of the Bill is to introduce better animal welfare standards. We should not allow training through pain infliction to be part of any sort of training regime. I heard what the noble Earl, Lord Peel, said about training to a reasonable degree and needing to impose discipline. I do not disagree with him about his gun dog training methods, and I hope that one day I shall see his gun dogs in action. However, I think that shock collars are an entirely different kettle of fish.
</p>

<a name="60523-44_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_154"></a>One issue is the studies that have been done to prove that shock collars are an unacceptable method of training. Some work has been done by Bristol University&#039;s veterinary school on the physiological and behavioural effects of aversive stimuli such as electrical shocks on different species. This work has been peer reviewed, but it is difficult to conduct many experimental studies on the effects of shock collars on <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC182"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC182</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

dogs; you need to inflict pain on the dog for no particularly good reason, other than wishing to permit the use of those collars. Therefore, the university&#039;s ethics committee would not allow further research to be undertaken. I think that that will be the case across a wide range of academic institutions. Would allowing the continued use of such an implement be reasonable within the context of a Bill that is trying to move animal welfare standards in the opposite direction?
</p>

<a name="60523-44_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_155"></a>Finally, it is interesting to note that neither the police nor the Armed Forces use shock collars, although their animals have to be trained to the highest standards of all. The leading countries in animal welfare terms, Austria, Switzerland and Australia, have already banned the use of these collars and I urge the Committee to follow their example. I beg to move.

<a name="60523-44_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </b>   I rise to oppose this amendment, and do so from long personal experience of training dogs, particularly German pointers as gun dogs. This experience leads me to believe that the introduction of the electric collar has made dog training much easier and quicker than it used to be, and very much more pleasant and rewarding for the dog. I have read the memorandum from the Kennel Club, for which like other noble Lords I have much respect, but I fear that its wish to ban electric dog collars is simply too extreme.
</p>

<a name="60523-44_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_156"></a>From my infancy I have always been surrounded by dogs at home, and some of my earliest memories are of my father beating them when they had not come back when called, having preferred to continue their chase of some unfortunate animal. I admit that many of our dogs over the years have displayed what the Kennel Club is pleased to call &quot;behavioural problems&quot;. In other words they had pretty strong characters, allied of course to great charm and affection for their master and, I am glad to say, his children. I suppose that my father also suffered from behaviour problems, if by that it is meant that he was an exceptionally irascible man, used to getting his own way in life.
</p>

<a name="60523-44_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_157"></a>My mother, on the other hand, was a somewhat milder creature who hated seeing the dogs beaten when they eventually returned from the chase. She put forward and tried to practise the theory, now advanced by the Kennel Club, that my father&#039;s violence was unnecessary and that our dogs would have been as good as gold if they were constantly rewarded for good behaviour and never chastised when they went astray. The Kennel Club claims to have scientific research to back this up, but I fear that the researchers cannot have met our dogs and many others like them. That fact is that over a period of at least 10 years, my mother&#039;s methods failed with all our dogs of strongish character. I do however accept that dogs of a fairly sensitive nature can be trained by a reward-based system only, but my remarks are not about those dogs or their trainers. I am talking about dogs with strong characters, and it is with these dogs that the electric collar has proved to be such a boon.

</p>

<a name="60523-44_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_158"></a>I should point out that the modern electric dog collar has two devices which make it possible to administer the mildest possible inconvenience to the dog consistent with stopping it doing what it is not supposed to be doing, such as pursuing any form of mammal which may now fall foul of the unfortunate Hunting Act, or any other act of indiscipline which will earn it the disapproval of its owner. The first device is a button which allows the shock to be turned up from the mildest tickle to whatever strength is necessary to check the dog. The pain is never anything like the average thrashing administered by my father or, I fear, by several keepers and dog handlers today. I have to say to the noble Baroness that the shock of a cow or a deer touching an electric fence with its wet nose delivers an altogether different level of pain, as I am sure she is aware. In my experience, you only have to use the electric collar in this way, turning the current up until it has the desired effect, two or three times for the dog to desist from doing whatever it is that is wrong. You do not just loose off a strong charge; you turn up the current as slowly as you can until you see the desired effect.
</p>

<a name="60523-44_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_159"></a>The other most important device in the modern collar is the warning signal. This is a high-pitched whine which is emitted from the collar before any electric charge is released. In my experience, even a fairly headstrong dog quickly learns that the whine is about to be followed by a growing shock, and you very soon do not have to do any more than press the whine button for the dog to stop doing something wrong. In fact, you soon do not have to do any more than put the collar on even the strongest character, and it is remarkable how well behaved it becomes.
</p>

<a name="60523-44_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_160"></a>Of course, I admit that there may be irascible or ignorant people who may send out too strong a charge and I imagine that that could do lasting damage to a particularly sensitive dog. But those are the same sort of people who will beat their dogs when they return from bad behaviour, which, I submit, is likely to be just as painful and damaging as is an electric shock. I would have thought and hoped that nowadays, such people are in a dwindling minority.
</p>

<p><a name="gc_stpa_161"></a>Perhaps the greatest advantage of the electric collar over traditional training methods is that you can apply the brakes while the dog is committing the offence. You do not have to wait until it returns to you for it to be deprived of its biscuit under the Kennel Club&#039;s rules, or be beaten under my father&#039;s. The trouble with both of those systems is that most dogs have largely forgotten what they have just done wrong, and so the lack of reward or punishment loses much of its effect. With the collar, you bring home to the dog what it is doing wrong while it is doing it, so it learns very much more quickly what it is supposed not to be doing, and reacts accordingly. Here, of course, I agree with the Kennel Club when it says that dogs have strong bonds with humans and can be at their happiest when they are working together as a team with us, and earning our admiration and affection.

<a name="60523-45_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Inglewood: </b>   I hope that I will not bore your Lordships with the story of my dog, Prospero. About six weeks to two months ago, when I rang home to speak to my wife, she was in a considerable state, because she had been out that afternoon in the garden and the dog had wandered off in the way that dogs often do. In the adjoining field, which was mine, were some sheep with young lambs that were mine. If an unattended lurcher is next door to a field with sheep and a lot of young lambs, it is like putting a small child in front of an open box of chocolates&#151;the consequences are reasonably predictable. Prospero forgot his training, chased the lambs and helped himself to one of them. As everyone knows, that behaviour is unacceptable for a dog in the countryside, whoever the lambs might belong to.
</p>

<a name="60523-45_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_163"></a>What should we do? I sought advice and was told that probably, in all the circumstances, it was worth trying to see if we could instil a bit of discipline into the dog to make him remember that such behaviour should not be repeated. I was told that we had three choices. Either we could use an electric collar, we could put him in with the tup, or we could put him in with an old ewe and a lamb. My farm manager was reluctant to do either of the latter two, because, as he rightly said, particularly with a lurcher, one strong kick on the ribcage would probably puncture the lung and that would be the end of the dog. So he used an electric collar sparingly, with the dial set to a low level, and I believe, and we hope, that sufficient discipline has been instilled into the dog&#151;and the evidence shows that it has&#151;and that, for the time being, the future should be satisfactory.
</p>

<a name="60523-45_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_164"></a>If we had not used the electric collar, my dog Prospero would be dead&#151;just like one of his predecessors, Samson. If it is a choice between the humane application of a small electric shock or killing the dog, there does not seem to be much argument about which is in the best interests of the dog. The crucial point was that made by my noble friend Lord Pearson of Rannoch. On such devices, there is a dial that determines the strength of the shock. It is clearly unacceptable to induce a charge such that it might seem that the dog is going to be electrocuted. It is simply a matter of ensuring that devices of this kind cannot give a charge greater than is appropriate and acceptable. If they are completely banned, you are throwing the proverbial baby out with the bathwater and you are probably condemning quite a lot of dogs to a premature death.

<a name="60523-45_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I have never used an electric shock collar, but I have been through a course of Kennel Club behaviour training, because a few years ago my dog won the Westminster &quot;woofer of the year&quot; competition and you then have to appear at Crufts and demonstrate how well the dog behaves so that it can receive a small certificate that states that it is a beautifully behaved dog.

dog was not sufficient to alert the judges to its character, so they gave it the award; but soon afterwards, they realised that it required training, so I was sent to their approved and best trainer in west London. We went through an extensive period, a couple of months, of reward-based training. We appeared at Crufts, we did not get the reward and the dog has not behaved any better since under any form of inducement, except that, being a fairly tough terrier, he went through the tup method of aversion to sheep&#151;which has been successful.
</p>

<a name="60523-45_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_165"></a>The idea that behaviour training will deal with the type of misbehaviour that my former noble friend, but my current friend, Lord Pearson of Rannoch calls a dog with a &quot;strong character&quot;, or that training is available at a reasonable cost to most citizens, is unrealistic. A properly used electric training collar achieves something that cannot be done reasonably in other ways. Although it can be misused, so can many other things. I grew up in a family that believed in beating dogs&#151;I suspect that most families believed in beating dogs and, indeed, women and walnut trees from time to time. We can have regulations that cover the way that one can administer pain or discipline in training a dog, but to pretend that you can train a strong-willed dog without that sort of application of force is just lulu.

<a name="60523-45_spnew2"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   As I have already stated, I have been involved in the training of spaniels and Labradors for many years, but I confess that I have never, as yet, resorted to an electric collar, although I know people that do&#151;but only as matter of last resort. When I originally read the noble Baroness&#039;s amendment, I opposed it wholeheartedly; but having listened carefully to what she said, I realise that it is not quite as dogmatic&#151;if I may use that term&#151;as it appears to be on the Marshalled List.
</p>

<a name="60523-45_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_166"></a>It is difficult for me to accept the Kennel Club&#039;s argument that such methods are innately cruel, or that what it describes as the &quot;reward system&quot; will inevitably lead to all dogs abiding by the reasonable wishes of an owner. If only that was the case. However, I do agree with the Kennel Club&#039;s statement that the marketing of such dog collars can easily convince people that they are a fast cure to all problems. Clearly they are not, and they should be used only judiciously. However, as my noble friend Lord Inglewood rightly pointed out, electric collars that are used properly can enhance the life of the dog, because it becomes less of a problem, more acceptable to its owner and a happier relationship evolves as a result.
</p>

<a name="60523-45_para4"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_167"></a>Like children, dogs will develop unacceptable habits from time to time and occasionally will require an extra force of discipline.

disturbed everyone, including the trainer, and the neighbours were not too appreciative of that. He told me that he had resorted to using an electric collar, which had done the trick. I saw the dog, which was full of the joys of spring and clearly adored his master. In no way could he be described as cowed. For me that was a clear example of how the judicious use of an electric collar can be very effective.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_169"></a>Inevitably, over the course of the Bill, scientific evidence will be cited time and again, although I suppose it will depend on which side of the argument you want to be. But as the Minister, Ben Bradshaw, has stated, there is no evidence to substantiate claims that such mechanisms are harmful. If that is the case, we need to be careful about the route we take on this subject.

<a name="60523-45_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_170"></a>I shall finish by saying that I understand the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and perhaps it is necessary to look at the mechanism of these collars to see whether they may need to be moderated. I am happy to enter into that debate, but as a matter of principle, I think that they are a clear advantage to dog training, resulting in a happier relationship between the dog and its master.

<a name="60523-45_spnew3"></a><b> Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior: </b>   Despite the comments made by noble Lords on electric collars, or what I prefer to call electronic training aids, there is still a lot of confusion. I am glad that the noble Baroness brought up the subject of proximity collars. They are used in conjunction with an electric fence so as to restrict a dog to its own territory. Those noble Lords who have visited the suburbs of the United States will know that there are no fences between the properties, so dogs can roam quite freely within their own territory, but they cannot stray over into another one. I do not think there is any problem with those collars, and the majority of people accept them. It is the other types of collar referred to in the debate that have a potential for misuse. I think that that is what bodies like the Kennel Club are concerned about.

<p><a name="gc_stpa_171"></a>Mention has been made of the necessity to carry out research into this matter.

that this was not an ethical piece of work to undertake; that is, to deliberately inflict pain on a dog wearing such a collar. As a result, Defra has approached the Companion Animal Welfare Council, of which I am chairman, to undertake an objective and balanced review of the use of electronic training aids. We have agreed to do this, and we estimate that it will take us somewhere between six and nine months to assess all the evidence.

<a name="60523-46_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_175"></a>Perhaps I can refer to the way dogs are treated. I think everyone who has spoken would work from the premise that you try and persuade an animal to do what it should do in the most gentle way to start with. I do not think there is any question about that. We inherited a Labrador rescue dog which was not big and bold enough to make the working dog she should have been. We have had her for six and half years, and she is still a very nervous dog. Whatever background she came from&#151;and I do not suppose electric collars were in being in those days in the way they are now&#151;a dog&#039;s training makes a huge impression on that dog for the rest of its life, and I bitterly regret the fact that somewhere along the line she had been very ill treated, not only by humans but also by other dogs. She is now much more comfortable with humans, and that is not a problem, but so far as other dogs are concerned she tends to sit down in the road and put her tail between her legs. Quite clearly, her life has not been an easy one. I say that as background. We have had different sorts of dogs over many years.

<a name="60523-46_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_177"></a>All Members of the Committee who spoke earlier who have had difficulty or experienced challenges when training their dogs have ended up nearly being sympathetic towards electronic collars. I will not call them &quot;shock collars&quot;, because I realise there are clearly different degrees. My worry is that they will only be as good or successful as the person operating them. You could say that everyone will be mild, sensitive and understanding, but unfortunately it is all too easy to activate things to respond in a greater degree than is necessary at that moment. I also appreciate that many dogs are trained to stay within their territory and are acting as guard dogs. If a total ban were brought in I do not know where on earth that would leave them. There is potential for misuse, however, and I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Soulsby for what his committee proposes to do.
</p>

<a name="60523-46_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_178"></a> Having trained horses and ponies many years ago, I would go from being gently rewarding to taking a quick check if the animal was not responding, so please do not think I am a soft push, because I am not. I do worry, though, about the ability these collars will have if they are not used correctly. I am not suggesting that any noble Lord who has spoken would not use them correctly, but out there is a wider world, and I am not sure how carefully some people might use those bits of equipment.

I found it interesting that the police do not use these collars in their training methods. That was quite an eye-opener for me, as I had not seen any reason why they should not, but there must be some clear reason why they have decided not to do so.
</p>

<a name="60523-46_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_180"></a>While I accept the expressions that have been made by many noble Lords, I have reservations on the use of electric collars, unless it is within a very defined area, which would be extremely difficult to enforce. How could you enforce it, unless you had a total ban? There is a big grey area out there. I suggest that the Minister might well accept Amendment No. 64, which would make provision for the specification of training methods and devices to be used in the training of animals.

<a name="60523-46_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_181"></a>I also do not want a nanny state, so the issue is quite difficult. Each of us has to decide whether the way we are dealing with our animal constitutes the best welfare possible, and whether we are using things that could be used differently and better. At the end of the day, however, whatever legislation we bring in will be hard to control and observe, and bringing prosecutions will be difficult. I find that worrying.

<a name="60523-46_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_182"></a>The noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, have both spoken about the potential for misuse of these collars. As presently constructed, if the collars can send a strong enough shock, there is that potential. We are all worried about misuse in this area and none of us wants to be cruel to a dog, especially our own dogs, but if these collars are banned you will not be able to stop people carrying sticks. The sort of character who, were he to be in charge of one of these collars, might abuse it, is also likely to be the sort of person who will use his stick on a dog, as my father did.
</p>

<a name="60523-46_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_183"></a>I say to the noble Lord in passing, with some trepidation, that the idea of spraying citronella&#151;which is a sort of lemon-based spray, isn&#039;t it?&#151;on a dog&#039;s nose may not be all that pleasant an experience for the dog. After all, dogs live largely by their noses and their power of scent. Some kinds of dog use their noses far more than their eyes or hearing. So that method is not necessarily kinder to a dog than a mild electric shock, but no doubt that is something his panel will look at in due course.

I want to confirm the Government&#039;s commitment to conducting research into these training devices. That is the important point the noble Lord was making, and others have referred to the fact that an attempt to set up a study to assess the effects of both electronic and non-electronic training aids was unfortunately unsuccessful. It has been explained today why that happened.

In response the council has set up a working group to consider all the evidence currently available on electronic training aids and to report on its findings. We will ensure that any research into these areas commissioned by the Government will be put in the public domain.

improperly, and there are existing powers to deal with individuals who mistreat animals in this way. However, the key issue here is to see whether electronic collars themselves are harmful to welfare. I have no experience in this area, but I will be interested to find out&#151;I have not asked the officials, as I have just been told it&#151;why the army and the police do not use these devices.

It is a matter that is not necessarily contentious but is very important, and we need some evidence on it. We do not want to go around simply banning equipment, because whatever equipment is sanctioned can always be abused by someone.

I welcome that. I thought the debate also showed us how wonderfully we have evolved, because we no longer as often hear, &quot;A woman, a dog and a walnut tree&quot;.

Now that he has caught up with it, I hope all noble Lords have now seen the draft of the Mutilations (Accepted Procedures) (England) Regulations. As set out, certain methods of identifying animals are considered mutilations, and we propose to exempt them from the mutilations ban. If any of these procedures are considered controversial, the debate can be had later in some detail, as the noble Baroness admits. The regulations will have a full 12-week consultation after Royal Assent has been given to the Bill.

<br>
(1)   A person commits an offence if he performs an operation on a protected animal without due care and humanity.

<a name="60523-47_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_201"></a>The current Bill does not contain this offence as we have concluded that performing an operation without due care and humanity will necessarily cause an animal unnecessary suffering and can be prosecuted under the cruelty offence. Should there ever be any cases where unnecessary suffering is hard to prove, the welfare offence may instead have been breached. It is therefore unnecessary to have a separate specific offence of performing a cruel operation on the face of the Bill.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="gc_brev_27"></a>Page 3, line 41, leave out subsections (3) to (6).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<a name="60523-47_para15"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_205"></a>The noble Lord said: I am aware that should the amendment be agreed to it may mean a return to the situation whereby certain breeds of dogs can be docked whether or not they are likely to become working dogs. Cosmetic docking is, of course, already prohibited. This is a probing amendment in order to put down markers should we return to this issue in due course, as I hope we will.
</p>

<a name="60523-47_para16"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_206"></a>As a pointer in this direction, I understand that the Scottish Executive is about to recommend that tail docking should be completely banned in Scotland. That raises the interesting situation whereby there may well be movements of puppies from Scotland to England in order that they may be docked legally.
</p>

<a name="60523-47_para17"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_207"></a>Most certainly the governing bodies of the veterinary profession in the United Kingdom&#151;the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and the British Veterinary Association, as well as the British Small Animal Veterinary Association&#151;are all against docking other than for therapeutic purposes. This has been the opinion of the profession for some 20 years since, as president of the RCVS, I chaired a heated debate on the subject.
</p>

<a name="60523-47_para18"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_208"></a>The crux of the issue is that certain working dogs may supposedly damage their tails when working in closed environments, in brushwood, in thickets or in other confined spaces if they are not docked. However, the evidence for that is not strong. In countries where docking has been banned there are no reports of significant increases in tail damage to working dogs. The working dogs listed in Clause 6 include emergency rescue dogs such as those used by RAPID UK, which go overseas to search collapsed buildings, and by NSARD, which usually work within the United Kingdom but not in collapsed buildings; they may work in thickets and premises, where they look for bodies, armaments and so on. I have been advised by <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC194"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC194</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

the people concerned with these organisations that in no instance is docking required of such dogs. Indeed, they very strongly object to it.
</p>

<a name="60523-47_para19"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_209"></a>At Second Reading I dealt with the aspect of pain. I do not want to go into that further here, but there remains the question of asking a veterinary surgeon to certify that puppies less than five days old are likely to be used as working animals based on evidence produced by the owner. I think that issue, which is dealt with in my Amendment No. 20&#151;I do not know whether the Minister wishes me to deal with it now or at a later stage&#151;will be resolved under the Docking of Working Dogs&#039; Tails (Certification Requirements) Regulations 2007. So that aspect, of asking a veterinary surgeon to certify something that he cannot himself be aware of, will be dealt with. I beg to move.

<a name="60523-48_spmin0"></a><b>The Deputy Chairman of Committees  (Viscount Ullswater): </b>  I must advise the Committee that if this amendment is agreed to, I shall be unable to call Amendments Nos. 18 to 23.

<p><a name="gc_st_111"></a>
<a name="60523-48_spnew0"></a><b> Lord Lucas: </b>   I declare an interest as the owner of two terriers, both of which have docked tails. I am very interested in finding out the answer to this question. The noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, says, quite accurately, that the veterinary profession has said for a long time that docking is not required. He will be equally aware that the countryside lobbying bodies say it is required, and presumably various other people have lobbied the Minister to get, for instance, the dogs that sniff round the Chamber exempted from this regulation. I do not know what the situation is and I would love to know the real answer. If it is right that a prophylactic operation is required to prevent considerable suffering in later life of working dogs, then we should allow it and it should not be a problem for anyone. If it is the case that it is not required and is merely an old wives&#039; tale from the past, we should know that too because it is a bit of unnecessary mutilation&#151;and when it comes to paying the vet, unnecessary expense&#151;that we could all avoid.
</p>

<a name="60523-48_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_210"></a>I have two amendments in this group. I suspect one will be beaten by Amendment No. 19, in that the Government will have something better to propose to deal with what a vet can practically be asked to certify. The second amendment is based on the premise that if certification goes ahead, the current position, where a vet who is known to have docked a dog&#039;s tail can be censured by his professional body for so doing, should not continue. If we are to put a requirement in law that a vet should certify these things, he should not be subject to censure for doing it.

<a name="60523-48_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Laird: </b>   I have an amendment in this grouping. It is purely a probing amendment, because one of the most emotional of the very interesting debates which we have had today was about tail-docking. I tried to understand the protracted wording in the Bill. If I understand it correctly&#151;perhaps the Minister will confirm it&#151;a certified working dog can be docked and be shown simply for the purpose of demonstrating its ability to work, and not for any other purpose. Is that what the Government are trying to get at? Does that <br>&nbsp;<br>

mean a dog that has been legally docked cannot be shown for any other purpose than to show his working ability? What is the rationale for that?
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_113"></a>
<a name="60523-48_spnew2"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I would like to take up some of the matters that have been raised by noble Lords so far. I shall express a personal view, as any vote on the matter would be a free vote. I am quite satisfied with the arrangements that have been made in the Bill as it stands. The Government have recognised the difficulty relating to working dogs and have identified those dogs which will be exempt from the regulations.
</p>

<a name="60523-48_para1"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_211"></a>My noble friend Lord Soulsby was right that some vets find this a very difficult part of the Bill to deal with. Quite clearly, some of them do not wish to perform this type of operation. Other vets do not hold that view. I would hate the Committee to think it was a view held by every vet, because it clearly is not. Many vets have been in touch with me who do not necessarily share the same view. They need the Bill, if it remains as it is, to make it clear that they would be well within the law in performing tail-docking on those categories of dogs which are defined in it.
</p>

<a name="60523-48_para2"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_212"></a>As my noble friend said, the difficulty is that very little research has been done. One of the ways forward might be for the Government to revisit this issue in three or five years. This section of the Bill was discussed in great detail in another place. One can merely make the case for or against, according to the way one looks at it. Unless we are to return to the status quo, which no one on the Committee has called for today, I believe the Government have got it right. While we should take into consideration the contributions that have already been made, I hope we will manage to stick with the Bill as it is.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_114"></a>
<a name="60523-48_spnew3"></a><b> Earl Peel: </b>   I appreciate that my noble friend&#039;s amendment is a probing amendment, but I make the perhaps obvious point that if such an amendment were to be accepted, it would create enormous disquiet and frustration among those involved with working dogs. I appreciate that they and others have been in lengthy discussions with the Government. Such an amendment would completely undermine the concessions that have been so laboriously achieved. I pay tribute to the noble Lord and his fellow Ministers in the other place for having listened to the arguments and come forward with a pretty sensible compromise. I just hope that we do not unravel that.
</p>

<a name="60523-48_para3"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_213"></a>My information is that the Kennel Club seems fairly content. Most breeders that I know are content about it, and certainly most rural vets. I have only spoken to two, but they seem satisfied with the outcome. I cannot believe that such people would support the continued docking of tails for certain working dogs unless they thought there was a very good reason to do so, and that it would not be debilitating for the animal concerned. From a personal perspective, I have witnessed the docking of the tails of spaniels that I have bred and I have never seen any signs of adverse effects. I certainly would not subject my dogs to anything I believed would inconvenience them or harm them in any way.

</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_116"></a>
<a name="60523-48_spnew5"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   Long before my little job swap a fortnight ago, like other noble Lords I had a fairly full postbag on this issue. So I am well aware of the concerns. There were concerned debates and a free vote in the other place. It was a key issue, and a considerable amount of time was spent on it. We have got to the stage where there is a solution in sight. I want to comment briefly on some of the amendments standing in my name, and on Amendment No. 20 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby.
</p>

<a name="60523-48_para5"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_215"></a>I should make it absolutely clear that the amendments I am proposing on behalf of the Government do not in any way deviate from the policy which was agreed in the other place. On the contrary, the proposed amendments are necessary to give full and proper effect to the policy that was described in the other place. They are technical amendments to address an oversight whereby the drafting of the delegated power did not completely allow us to achieve the policy which my honourable friend the Member for Exeter described during the debate in advance of the free vote. So, in effect, to make into reality the issues that Ben Bradshaw committed to and promised, and for which there was a free vote and support, we need these technical amendments. Specifically, he committed to restricting the types of dogs which can be docked to only spaniels, terriers, hunt-point-retrieve breeds and crosses of those dogs. The amendments are necessary to achieve that restriction.
</p>

<a name="60523-48_para6"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_216"></a>We cannot accept Amendments Nos. 17 and 18. The intention of the other place was that a dog should only be docked if it is of a specified type and the owner can demonstrate that the dog is likely to work. Amendment No. 18 would remove the second of these tests and allow the cosmetic docking of dogs where there was no intention whatever that they would work. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, seeks to overturn the decision of the other place.
</p>

<a name="60523-48_para7"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_217"></a>I appreciate the attempts of both noble Lords to remove the words &quot;likely to work&quot; from the clause and I know that the royal college has some reservations about it. However, the intention is, and always has been, that a vet would simply make an objective judgment about whether he had seen certain specified evidence. I am pleased that I have been able to share with the Committee the first draft of the regulation we intend to make under the clause. Noble Lords will appreciate from this that we are not asking the vet to make a subjective judgment. He or she will be guided <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_GC197"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column GC197</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

through a very detailed and rigorous tick-box system to arrive at a much more objective assessment of whether or not the dog is likely to work.

</p>

<a name="60523-48_para8"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_218"></a>However, if noble Lords still require the provision, after consideration of the clause and regulation in tandem, I am prepared to accept that the formulation proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby in Amendment No. 20 potentially provides an alternative framework with which to achieve that goal. On that basis, I urge the noble Lord not to press the amendment and to allow the Government to bring forward their own amendment at Report stage which will achieve the same goal. Obviously, we will discuss the amendment with the noble Lord before we bring it forward.
</p>

<a name="60523-48_para9"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_219"></a>On Amendment No. 22, I am aware of the concerns which have been expressed that the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons might take disciplinary action against a vet for docking, even if he had done so in line with the requirements of the Act. I believe these concerns are misplaced. We have worked closely with the RCVS on this matter and, while it is no secret that a working dog exemption was not the preferred policy choice of its council, it has no desire to frustrate the will of Parliament, and in particular the elected House. Therefore, Amendment No. 22 does not add anything to the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60523-48_para10"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_220"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 24, the restriction on showing was not included because of any distaste for showing; it was included because experience from other countries suggests that such a restriction may help to make the restriction on docking more effective. Allowing any docked dogs, even those docked legally, to be shown for cosmetic exhibition purposes might create an incentive for people to try to exploit the working dog exemption to get a dog docked for purely cosmetic exhibition reasons. You could see through that. That is why the other place voted to include this provision in the Bill.
</p>

<a name="60523-48_para11"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_221"></a>Showing to demonstrate working ability, such as field trailing and police dog displays, will not be affected. The kind of exhibitions given by dogs at a game fair to show their speed and so on proves that they are working dogs and that they are not being shown for exhibition and cosmetic purposes. Given the voices here and the point I have made in respect of Amendment No. 20, it may be that Parliament has a practical consensus on which we can go forward.
</p>

<a name="60523-48_para12"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_222"></a>I hope that the issue of tourism will be dealt with by Report stage. I do not seem to have an answer on that and I do not know what the situation is in Scotland. I was asked a question about tourism but it was not specific as to a country. I am not aware of the Scottish legislation but I will get it in writing before we meet again tomorrow. Dog owners will still be able to get their dogs docked in other EU countries where it is still allowed, which I understand includes the Republic of Ireland. So there is an issue there. As to Scotland, I am unaware of what the legislative proposals will cover there. I believe I am going to get an answer now.

So I would not be able to answer the question anyway.
</p>

<a name="60523-49_para0"></a>
<p><a name="gc_stpa_223"></a>We have to somehow ensure that we do not get tourism of that kind because it would be an abuse of what Parliament intended. We can be absolutely clear about that, but how we go about it from a practical point of view I do not know. I do not think that the Scottish Parliament would want to allow it. We certainly cannot allow that kind of thing to go on across the border because that would frustrate the will of Parliament. The point about devolution is that things can be done differently. If a devolved Parliament chooses to legislate differently from here, that must be respected. It is not an invitation for people to use the tourist trade to get around the will of the Parliament of the jurisdiction they are in.

<a name="60523-49_spnew1"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   Before my noble friend comes back on this, perhaps I may make a few comments. The Minister said that field trials can continue&#151;which obviously we welcome&#151;so I presume that the only restriction will be on what I would call proper dog shows, and the one particularly affected would be Crufts.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_120"></a>
<a name="60523-49_spnew2"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   That is perfectly correct. I did not mention Crufts but that is what I intended when I referred to tails being docked for exhibition or cosmetic purposes. So, in effect, Crufts.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_121"></a>
<a name="60523-49_spnew3"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   But I think that even within Crufts there are field trials which, while not held out in a field, are used to test expertise. Presumably that would still fall within the restriction. Can I also ask the Minister about the position of dogs which have been docked coming in from abroad and which would normally have shown at Crufts? I assume that they will not be able to be shown in the future.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_122"></a>
<a name="60523-49_spnew4"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I have never had the privilege of going to Crufts. I understand that working dogs take part but basically they are shown for exhibition. They are not shown for their training. Obviously there will be borderline cases but it is not intended to allow people to get round this provision so that tails can be docked for exhibition purposes.
</p>




<p><a name="gc_st_123"></a>
<a name="60523-49_spnew5"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I was not suggesting for one moment that people should do so because clearly there are different roles for both. However, perhaps I may put the question again to the Minister: Crufts is a very big international show, so presumably anyone wanting to bring over a foreign dog to show in that competition will be unable to do so if this provision goes through.

an interesting problem will arise on pointer and setter trials. In Britain, pointers and setters do not have their tails docked on the whole, but German pointers do. If they wish to run their dogs in trials that take place in both Scotland and England, I presume the owners will have to determine whether or not they should have the dogs&#039; tails docked.

<a name="60523-49_spnew7"></a><b> Baroness Byford: </b>   I am grateful to my noble friend for allowing me to intervene once more before he withdraws the amendment. I thank the Minister for producing the statutory instrument, which has proved very helpful. If the regulation comes into force as it is, will the Government consider the possibility of microchipping and thus identifying the dog at the same time as it is docked? I do not think it is covered in the statutory instrument, but I understand that it is possible so to do. It seems logical to identify the dog at the same point.

<p><a name="gc_st_127"></a>
<a name="60523-49_spnew8"></a><b> Lord Rooker: </b>   I understand that it would be perfectly possible but it is our wish that the microchipping should be done at a later age. It is our view that microchipping should not be done at that point in time.

<p><a name="gc_st_136"></a>
<a name="60523-49_spmin2"></a><b>The Duke of Montrose:</b>  It is certainly helpful to have this provision added to Clause 7 on the administration of poisons. The ultimate horror, which people wish to resist, is poisoned baits, which are probably banned even now and have been the cause of death in dogs. There is always the problem of the dog getting at the rat poison, either when people employ others to exterminate rats or attempt to do it themselves and do not adequately covered the baits, in which case the dogs can eat the rat poison. Those people could, and perhaps should, be charged, but at least if the Bill provides for a reasonable excuse, the court will be able to consider whether the people concerned were taking adequate precautions.

This follows a recommendation in April 2004 in an NAO review of the Public Trustee&#039;s stewardship of client funds that he should establish a proactive strategy for divesting himself of trusts and estates work, particularly in terms <br>&nbsp;<br>

of becoming a trustee of last resort and outsourcing his investment activities.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a>Where cases cannot otherwise be closed during that period, the OSPT proposes to invite expressions of interest from a private sector corporate trustee to take over and administer his cases in accordance with best market-regulated practice. The OSPT will work to ensure that the interests of beneficiaries will be secured through this process. The proposals will be designed to deliver the administration of their trusts in the future in accordance with best practice standards. There will be full consultation with those affected, who will be able to put forward any alternative solution more appropriate in their particular case than that which the OSPT proposes. If agreement is reached with a private sector corporate trustee, or on an alternative solution in a particular case, the OSPT will retire from these cases in favour of the new trustee.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a>As announced in April 2000 in <i>Making Changes: The Future of the Public Trust Office</i>, since the Official Solicitor was also appointed Public Trustee in 2001 he has only accepted any new trust and estates case where he has been satisfied that, in accordance with strict &quot;last resort&quot; acceptance criteria, a public sector trustee is required. In 2005-06, for example, only 13 cases were accepted by him as Official Solicitor, and one as Public Trustee. He is, however, currently responsible for administering about 1,750 trusts and estates, mainly taken on before the last resort criteria were applied.

<a name="60523-51_head3"></a><h3 align=center>Prisoners: Foreign Nationals</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_6"></a>
<a name="60523-51_spmin3"></a><b>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (John Reid) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a>I would like to provide an update on the issue of foreign national prisoners. As my predecessor promised, I will set out the latest information I have on the foreign national prisoners released without consideration of deportation having been made since February 1999. I will set out eight priority areas for management action to achieve our long-term policy goals on foreign national prisoners. And I will set out two immediate changes to current guidance which I now believe are necessary to deal with the present serious situation.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a>I would like first, however, to set the handling of the consideration and deportation of foreign national prisoners into context. The context is the backdrop of mass migration prompted by the end of the Cold War and other global changes. The effects of this can be seen in the huge increases in the past decade in asylum-seeking, in immigration, and generally in the numbers of passenger journeys all over the world.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a>Against this backdrop, our immigration and asylum systems have secured notable achievements in recent years: the number of asylum seekers has been reduced by 72 per cent from its peak in 2002; we now decide 73 per cent of asylum cases within eight weeks compared to the 22 months it took to decide asylum cases (including older cases) in 1997; and I can say that February and March were the first months in which we have achieved the target known as the &quot;tipping point&quot;, with removals running at the highest rate ever. It is in this context that the issue of foreign national prisoners should be considered.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_73"></a>My first priority has been to protect the public by identifying, controlling, considering for deportation and, where appropriate, deporting the foreign national prisoners who were released without due consideration of deportation having been made. I am today reporting on progress since my Written Statement to the House on 15 May (<i>Official Report</i>, House of Commons; col. 40 WS).
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_74"></a>Analysis of these cases has, as I indicated in an Oral Answer in the House on 15 May, revealed some duplicate files and the total overall number of these cases currently stands at 1,019, although it is possible that this figure may either reduce further due to the discovery of additional duplicates as the process of analysis is completed; or rise as the Immigration and <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS42"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column WS42</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

Nationality Directorate re-checks that it has captured every relevant case.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_75"></a>In sharing information on these cases with the House, I would like to add the caveat that the investigative process has uncovered flaws in data collection, not least the lack of a unique personal number for use by the Home Office, prisons and the police to identify an individual. An additional factor rendering the information subject to change is the continuing examination of the records by all relevant agencies, including for re-offending. I can therefore only give the best information available to me as of today on the 1,019 foreign prisoners.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a>Subject to these caveats, the figure for the number of offenders convicted of a serious offence, as defined in my Statement of 15 May, now stands at 186. As I said at that time, the previous figure of 179 was liable to change since the scrutiny of around 200 of the 1,019 cases was yet to be completed. That has so far resulted in an additional seven cases being identified in this category.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"></a>Of these 186, 37 have been convicted of the most serious offences, defined as murder, manslaughter, rape and child sex offences. This is an increase of two since 15 May as a result of the scrutiny of past offences. All four of the murderers are now detained in prison. Of the other 33 most serious cases which include rapists and child sex offenders, two are believed dead and 23 are in prison. We have so far identified that eight of these 37 have re-offended since release (of which six have been convicted) but no offence discovered so far has involved violence or a sexual element.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_78"></a>Of the 149 &quot;more serious&quot; offenders, 66 are now under our control and six have been deported. Of these 149, 13 have re-offended following release (of which 11 have been convicted) with a crime involving violence or a sexual element.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_79"></a>All of the 1,019 have now been assessed and consideration of the case for deportation has started in 999 cases. There has been an initial decision to deport in 778 of these cases. Of these 778, 197 are detained, one is electronically tagged, 10 are reporting regularly to the Immigration Service or Prison Service and 37 have been deported or removed.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_80"></a>As police and agencies focus hard on these cases, I believe it is essential to be clear about our long-term policy. My objectives are straightforward: all non-EEA nationals who are given a custodial sentence should face deportation; and deportation should happen as early as possible in that sentence. But to achieve these long-term objectives, I believe management must address eight priority areas.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_81"></a>First, there is today no unique personal number for individuals who come into contact with the criminal justice, immigration and asylum systems. I have instructed management to tell me how this can change.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a>Secondly, as my predecessor has already set out, there are prisoners within the system whose nationality is not known. There is currently no legal obligation on people who are suspected, charged or convicted to declare their nationality and no sanction against them <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS43"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column WS43</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

if they refuse to co-operate or they declare a nationality falsely&#151;I have tasked management to come up with a way of stopping this, even if it needs legislation.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a>Thirdly, there have almost certainly been foreign nationals whose nationality was known but who were not referred to Immigration and Nationality Directorate for consideration for deportation. For example, before September 2004, guidance to prisons on which cases to refer to Immigration and Nationality Directorate covered only those cases which were subject to a court recommendation and omitted to cover other categories of case which should have been considered by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. In addition, a Home Office circular to police of December 2004 sets broad criteria by which the police should refer cases to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. It is not clear enough that this circular has been systematically implemented. I have demanded therefore that management ensure all future instructions are given to all agencies of the criminal justice, asylum and immigration systems and are both consistent and fully implemented.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a>Fourthly, the criteria governing which individuals should be considered for deportation appear to have been varied over time on authority which is unclear. They have then not been consistently applied. For example, the derivation of the inclusion of those convicted of three or more offences over a five-year period in the criteria, as set out by my predecessor on 3 May, is unclear. I have ordered the policy officials to audit trail all policy criteria and the process by which they ensure that guidance is both clear and consistently applied.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a>Fifthly, there are foreign national prisoners who were considered for deportation under the current criteria, but where the decision was made not to deport, or where a decision to deport was frustrated by difficulties over return to the home country. I have ordered that all decisions on deportation are now made according to the most robust interpretation of the requirements of our international obligations.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_86"></a>Sixthly, I have instructed managers to work with colleagues in Scotland and Northern Ireland to audit the numbers of foreign national prisoners released in Scotland and Northern Ireland and to establish how many of these were referred to IND for consideration of deportation. I have demanded that clear procedures for dealing with foreign national prisoners held in Scotland and Northern Ireland are written and followed.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_87"></a>Seventhly, historically there have never been systematic arrangements in place for collecting information on the nationality of mentally disordered offenders, referring them to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and considering them for deportation. This is a hugely difficult group to deal with. But I have tasked officials to construct arrangements for considering deportation where appropriate for people in this group taking account of their very specific circumstances.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS44"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column WS44</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60523-51_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_88"></a>Finally, as my predecessor set out in his Statement of 3 May, I have demanded enhanced arrangements to facilitate the return of prisoners earlier in their sentence, including prisoner transfer agreements.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_89"></a>These eight management priority areas will form the basis of a long-term &quot;agenda for change&quot; to deal more effectively with foreign national prisoners. However, there are also two immediate steps which are forced on me by the urgency of the present problems and the constraints on the system. Those constraints include both the trained caseworking resource available in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate to consider cases for deportation, despite the steps we have taken to reinforce the criminal casework team, and detention capacity. To enable them to deal effectively with the current flow of cases, I have agreed two immediate changes to the system.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_90"></a>The first change is to prioritise cases for consideration according to the degree of risk a person poses to the public. At present the criteria for consideration for deportation includes people who have committed several minor and non-violent offences, but excludes those who have had two custodial sentences of under a year for, say, actual bodily harm. This is a perverse outcome in public protection terms. I have therefore authorised that instead of considering for deportation those with three convictions regardless of seriousness or risk, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate will now consider for deportation all non-EEA nationals who have been given a 12-month prison sentence, either in one sentence or as an aggregate of two or three sentences.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_91"></a>The second immediate change is to tighten the guidance given to caseworkers in deciding whether or not an individual should be deported. Rule 364 of the Immigration Rules, which sets out the criteria which officials should weigh in the balance against a person&#039;s crime in taking the decision whether to deport and which dates back to 1994, currently goes wider than the requirements of the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights would stipulate. It is not right that the system should tilt the exercise of discretion in favour of the criminal rather than public safety in this way. I have therefore approved the issuing of new guidance to caseworkers which interprets the decision-making criteria much more tightly.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_92"></a>I believe that these immediate measures will help to ensure that more of those offenders who pose a risk to public safety are dealt with fairly and efficiently, and will face deportation where that is appropriate.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_93"></a>None of the reforms set out above, in particular the long-term agenda for change, will be delivered unless the right leadership is in place across the system. I have therefore instructed the new Permanent Secretary of the Home Office to address the following issues as a matter of urgency: performance; weak services, because not every field of our operations matches the standard of the best; leadership and skills, where we have under-invested; fragmentation and silos, exacerbated by communications which are too weak; <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS45"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column WS45</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

and systems and processes, which simply need to be stronger.
</p>

<a name="60523-51_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_94"></a>And finally, I announced yesterday that the honourable member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill will be taking overall responsibility for this reform agenda, reporting to me. I have told him I want to consider any option he believes feasible, however radical it may be. I intend to report back to the House on progress and proposals for change before the Summer Recess.

<a name="60523-52_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60523-52_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_97"></a>On 17 May 2006, I visited:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_4"></a>Wajid, the United Nations&#039; logistics hub for the drought relief operation in southern Somalia to which DfID has contributed &#163;12 million; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_5"></a>Baidoa, the temporary seat of the Somalia Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP) and Government (TFG).
</p>
</ul>
<a name="60523-52_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_98"></a>In Wajid, I saw at first hand the effect of the drought; first in an Action Contre La Faim (ACF) therapeutic feeding centre for malnourished children brought from distances of up to 50 kilometres, and then in a camp occupied by about 11,000 people who were living in terrible conditions under very basic shelters, and being fed by the World Food Programme. Now that some rain has arrived, the menfolk have returned to their homes to begin cultivation. However, the harvest will not come for several months, and the families in the camps will need to be cared for in the mean time. I was also able to visit a UNICEF-organised tent school in the camp, where about 300 children and an equal number of boys and girls are enjoying very basic primary education for the first time in their lives. UN agency and non-governmental organisation representatives told me that despite the logistical and security problems of working in Somalia, the relief effort had averted a humanitarian disaster, and while I was there I committed a further &#163;2 million to support what I hope will be post-drought operations.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS46"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column WS46</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60523-52_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_99"></a>In Baidoa, I called on President Abdulahi Yusuf Ahmed, Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi, and Parliamentary Speaker Sharif Hassan Sheik Adan, the leaders of the transitional institutions. I was struck by the warmth of their welcome, and how, having earlier this year buried their differences, they are trying to build a new administration from absolutely nothing, working from loaned properties including a warehouse converted into a parliamentary chamber. Despite their great fragility, these transitional institutions represent the best hope for taking Somalia forward from over 15 years of internal conflict, which sadly has continued with recent fighting in Mogadishu. The President and Prime Minister emphasised the urgent need for support to education&#151;not currently available to the vast majority (about 80 per cent) of children&#151;and I was able to announce plans for a new &#163;6 million DfID partnership programme with UNICEF and others over three years.
</p>

<a name="60523-52_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_100"></a>Building the new institutions, and the systems to bring internal reconciliation, security and stability as prerequisites for development, will take time, but some progress is being made. I committed a further &#163;1.5 million to the UNDP-led institutional support programme to the transitional institutions.
</p>

<a name="60523-52_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_101"></a>We must all hope that the political transition in Somalia, fragile though it still is, will start to bring the stability and security for which the ordinary people of that country have been yearning for so many years. The UK will continue to provide support to the Somali transitional institutions to that end.

<a name="60523-52_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_103"></a>Deferred fee loans will be made available in 2006-07 for EU students who are accepted at our universities with the first full cohort eligible to repay from April 2010. Repayments will be collected directly by the Student Loans Company (SLC) and, as for students who stay in the UK after finishing their course, will remain income-contingent with repayments based on 9 per cent of income over an earnings threshold.

</p>

<a name="60523-52_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_104"></a>Our policy is for repayments to be fair and affordable and that on leaving their course, all those who can contribute to the costs of their higher education, should do so.

From 2007, students planning to move overseas after finishing their course will be required to sign a repayment agreement with the Student Loans Company that establishes how they will repay their loan once they have moved overseas. This means the SLC will be able to take action to enforce the debt in the courts both in the UK and abroad if necessary. We intend to make use of EC Regulation 44/2001 which will allow the SLC to enforce a judgment made in the UK courts in the rest of the EU.

<a name="60523-52_head3"></a><h3 align=center>Transport Innovation Fund</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_10"></a>
<a name="60523-52_spnew1"></a><b> Lord Davies of Oldham: </b>   My honourable friend the Minister of State for Transport (Dr Stephen Ladyman) has made the following Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60523-52_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_108"></a>In July 2004 the Secretary of State for Transport announced the creation of the Transport Innovation Fund (TIF). The fund will support:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_6"></a>the costs of smarter, innovative local transport packages that combine demand management measures such as road pricing with measures to encourage modal shift, and better bus services;

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_7"></a>local mechanisms which raise new funding for transport schemes; and

</p>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="wms_brev_8"></a>regional, inter-regional and local schemes that are beneficial to national productivity.
</p>
</ul>
<a name="60523-52_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_109"></a>Today I am publishing further guidance on our approach to the first of these objectives, setting out the criteria we intend to use to assess bids for a second round of pump-priming to support scheme development. Copies of the guidance are available from the Department for Transport (DfT) web site at www.dft.gov.uk and in the Library of the House.
<br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS48"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column WS48</b><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<a name="60523-52_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_110"></a>The TIF represents a new approach by the Department for Transport to the allocation of some of its budget. Through the TIF, resources will be directed towards the achievement of two high priority objectives&#151;specifically, tackling congestion and improving productivity. The principle underlying the TIF is that resources should be allocated on the basis of an assessment of how these objectives can be most effectively and sustainably met. The provision of pump-priming funding only applies to congestion TIF schemes.
</p>

<a name="60523-52_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_111"></a>The <i>Future of Transport</i> White Paper identified the risk that, despite effective policies to promote smarter choices and network management, without radical measures, including more effective demand management, road congestion will spread over time to longer periods in the day, and to more road users. This would have negative impact on both quality of life and on the economy. Local road pricing schemes are also important in order to pilot technology and systems and to inform the decisions on the development of national road pricing in the longer term.
</p>

<a name="60523-52_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_112"></a>We recognise that the development and appraisal of such packages will be a complex and costly process for many local authorities. That is why the Government decided to offer a limited number of local authorities some financial assistance with scheme development in advance of substantive congestion TIF funding. In July 2005 it was announced that up to &#163;18 million was set aside between 2005-06 and 2007-08. The first allocations were made to seven areas in November 2005. The guidance published today covers the second allocation of funding.
</p>

<a name="60523-52_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_113"></a>The guidance explains the basis on which DfT intends to allocate this pump-priming funding for the second round and sets out the information that will be required from local authorities intending to bid. The guidance applies both to authorities considering putting forward new proposals and to authorities that successfully obtained funding in the first round of pump-priming and that wish to apply for further funding. Eligibility for funding is restricted to local authorities in England.
</p>

<a name="60523-52_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_114"></a>The process for allocating pump-priming funding is separate from the process of allocating the main TIF. Full guidance on the TIF was published in January 2006. It is not necessary to have had a successful pump-priming bid in order to apply for funding to the TIF through the congestion entry point. Nor does a successful pump-priming bid offer any guarantee of success in a bid for main TIF scheme funding.

<a name="60523-53_head0"></a><h3 align=center>Uganda</h3>






<p><a name="wms_st_11"></a>
<a name="60523-53_spmin0"></a><b>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </b>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
</p>

<a name="60523-53_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_115"></a>I visited northern Uganda on 15 and 16 May to look at the situation on the ground and to discuss the conflict and other issues affecting our development <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS49"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column WS49</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

partnership with President Museveni and his Foreign Minister, Sam Kutesa.
</p>

<a name="60523-53_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_116"></a>The security situation in northern Uganda has improved over the past year, as Lord&#039;s Resistance Army (LRA) numbers have declined in the face of better performance by Uganda&#039;s army and less freedom of movement for the LRA in southern Sudan. LRA attacks have fallen, and some of those displaced by conflict in the eastern part of the region have started to return home. But there are still 2 million people displaced, 1.7 million of whom are living in camps. Fear of the LRA remains strong, especially in the Acholi districts of Kitgum, Gulu and Pader. One young girl I spoke to still walks four hours every day there and back to sleep at a night centre as she has done since 2003 for fear of abduction. People will not go home until they are quite certain it is safe to do so. A significant number of the LRA are now active in Garamba national park in the north-eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), including leaders who have been indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC). This adds to regional insecurity.
</p>

<a name="60523-53_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_117"></a>The humanitarian effort, including the &#163;20 million provided by DfID in 2004-05, has improved conditions in the camps. But the camps are crowded and there are major challenges in providing essential services. I visited Padibe camp in Kitgum district where 35,000 displaced people still live. In the health centre, there were only a handful of health workers, no doctor present, beds had no mattresses to hand, there was a shortage of drugs, and no ARVs for HIV-positive patients. Less than six litres of water are available per person per day compared to a <br>&nbsp;<br>



<a name="column_WS50"></a>

<b>23 May 2006 : Column WS50</b><br>&nbsp;<br>

humanitarian target of 15 litres per person per day. There is a cholera outbreak in the region. The humanitarian situation continues to demand our attention.
</p>

<a name="60523-53_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_118"></a>In my discussions with President Museveni and his Foreign Minister, I emphasised that greater effort was needed to address the humanitarian situation and, as security allows, to help people return home. We agreed that the joint monitoring committee recently established by the Government and including the core group of bilateral donors (UK, US, Netherlands and Norway), the UN and civil society should help achieve this provided there was an agreed and effectively monitored plan. I made a commitment to continued substantial humanitarian assistance from the UK and for help with recovery when this becomes possible.
</p>

<a name="60523-53_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_119"></a>I welcomed President Museveni&#039;s discussions with the government of southern Sudan about tackling the LRA, but emphasised that ICC&#039;s warrants against the LRA leadership had to be enforced. I also emphasised that the regional integrity of the DRC must be respected. We agreed that a special envoy could have an important role to play in achieving the regional co-operation required to deal effectively with the LRA.
</p>

<a name="60523-53_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_120"></a>I also emphasised the importance of the government working with the opposition in the new Parliament to strengthen political pluralism and to help achieve an effective and accountable parliamentary process. I raised the care of Dr Kiiza Besigye and President Museveni assured me that due process will be followed in his High Court trial. I also discussed the President&#039;s commitment in his election manifesto and subsequent public statements to tackle corruption. Promoting good governance in Uganda is an important priority for the UK.

<p><a name="wa_st_17"></a>
<a name="60523w02_spmin2"></a><b>The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Lord Rooker): </b>  Whether or not a substance is &quot;waste&quot; within the meaning of Article 1(a) of the Waste Framework Directive (WFD) (75/442/EEC as amended) is a matter that must be determined on the facts of the case and the interpretation of the law is a matter for the courts. It is not a function of the Government to classify or to declassify any particular substance as waste or non-waste. The Government&#039;s understanding of the facts is that the EU animal by-products regulation ((EC) No.1774/2002) requires a range of animal by-products, and substances derived from them (for example, tallow) to be disposed of as waste.

<a name="60523w02_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a>On 21 December 2005, the European Commission published its <i>Thematic Strategy on the Prevention and Recycling of Waste</i> together with a proposed revision of the WFD. The draft revised WFD contains a proposal which would enable the Commission to adopt environmental and quality criteria for specified waste streams. Where these criteria are met, the effect would be to deem that the recovery of the specified waste had been completed and that it had ceased to be waste. The Commission&#039;s thematic strategy proposes that, subject to the outcome of an environmental study which the Commission is currently undertaking, the waste streams addressed by this system should include the use of tallow as a fuel.
