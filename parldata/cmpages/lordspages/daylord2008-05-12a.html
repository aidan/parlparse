We have consolidated our scholarship programmes and are focusing on the Chevening and Marshall schemes. While the FCO&#146;s support to Commonwealth scholarships is ending, the Government&#146;s overall contribution is increasing through funding from the Department for International Development.</p>

I also declare an interest as chief executive of Universities UK. How does he reconcile the cuts made by his department with the Prime Minister&#146;s initiative, which is intended to enhance higher education globally and not just in certain countries? In taking that decision, did his department make any assessment of the impact of these cuts on the competitiveness and reputation of British higher education?</p>

I am sure that many of us benefited from scholarships of these kinds. Certainly I was lucky enough to go to the United States on such a scholarship. There is a growing number of sources of such scholarships both from the British Government but more generally from foundations and others, and we felt it important to consolidate the programme at this point and to focus on countries that are not so well imbued with such opportunities and where the prospect of bringing students from those countries to the UK would contribute to strategic relationships in the long term. I mean countries such as China and Brazil.</p>

As I understand it, the Chevening scholarships are not affected by the announcement on 13 March that there would be cuts. At any rate, they do not have the Commonwealth as their priority, but the FCO scholarships did, and it

If the United States took that view, the Minister would not have been awarded a scholarship to go there because it would have said, &#147;Oh, Britain&#146;s a developed country and it doesn&#146;t count any more&#148;. Could we please rethink a system that will work very badly against this country&#146;s interests?</p>

It will, however, be targeted more at developing countries. Until now, 90-plus per cent of the funding went to the old Commonwealth countries whereas the DfID funding will be aimed at new ones. Therefore, while there will be losses in countries such as Canada and Australia, we will be targeting those Commonwealth countries where the need is the greatest.</p>

I declare an interest as it costs less than &#163;9,000 to educate a specialist in palliative medicine or in dermatology using distance learning and supervision. In many cases, they have been the only specialist in their country following education from the UK.</p>

We understand that the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer did not like the Foreign Office and that that is part of the shift. However, we have important political relationships with a number of other developed countries in the EU in what we have to call the developed Commonwealth. The small political investment required for those seems to be worth while and in the national interest in building relationships with future political, economic and social elites in those countries. Will the Minister encourage his Secretary of State gently to remind the now Prime Minister that these matters are politically important?</p>

However, will he confirm that the FCO funded 40 Marshall scholarships in 2006, is offering to fund only 31 in 2008 and, on present assumptions, that the figure will drop to 28 by 2010? Is it not shameful to repay the single most generous act in this country&#146;s diplomatic history by such penny-pinching economies?</p>

However, the increased cost of providing them due to the increase in tuition and other fees in the US means that the same money will buy slightly fewer scholars. However, the numbers are coming down from around 43 to 38 and, therefore, it is not the rapid descent that the noble Lord described.</p>

Does my noble friend agree that, whatever the Government&#146;s intentions, this will enhance scepticism in many quarters about real political commitment to the Commonwealth? Does he further agree that, if the Commonwealth is not to be anything but a hollow and expensive edifice, it is essential that in its declared commitments to human rights, democracy, the rule of law, good governance and to being a world leader in this respect, the interchange of education at the university level is an absolutely essential priority?</p>

DfID moneys mean that the budget will increase, not shrink. I acknowledge that this is leading to a deployment of scholarships away from old Commonwealth to new Commonwealth countries in the hope that other sources of funding will be available to make up the difference. I completely agree that scholarships of this kind are not only a critical part of this country&#146;s future in a global world but critical for students everywhere.</p>

I know of the particular case to which the noble Countess refers and we have tried to deal with it. I reiterate that this is the responsibility of Ministers. As noble Lords will know, the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, has been assiduous over the years in examining this matter. He did me the honour of attending a Front-Bench meeting and making the point clearly that it is the role of your Lordships to hold the Government to account via Questions, debates and so on.

Noble Lords who have been in departments will know that a process has to be gone through, which relies on civil servants, and often other Ministers who are not in your Lordships&#146; House, to clear and deal with policy Questions. As noble Lords will know, sometimes Questions are complicated. In the 1996-97 Session, there was a total of 1,247 Questions. That figure has now risen to 5,702 Questions, so there is also the issue that we have to deal with many more Questions. That is a good thing&#151;it is a sign of a healthy House of Lords in operation&#151;but it puts on pressure. It is no excuse, but I wanted to mention that in passing.</p>

They also lead to unintended consequences. In particular, they restrict access to essential credit for the poor and the vulnerable and therefore do not help the people that we are seeking to help. There is evidence from, for example, Germany and France, where these restrictions sometimes apply, of an increased resort to illegal lending with very inappropriate levels of interest rates. In states of the United States where there are caps there is evidence of decreased products for the poor and the vulnerable relative to states which do not have caps.</p>

For example, when a trader was selling a new car on credit he would artificially inflate the value of the old car that was being traded in. Such controls are really too easy to evade to make them worth while. Is it not much better, as the Minister implied in her first Answer, to use the increased powers under the Consumer Credit Act 2006 so that irresponsible lending is treated as an unfair or improper practice&#151;I forget the appropriate word&#151;and the licence is then at risk?</p>

In the 1950s and 1960s they were not really used for consumer credit but for controlling inflation and the balance of payments, and we simply do not live in that kind of economy right now. However, the Consumer Credit Act 2006 brought in a large number of powers, now in the process of being embedded in regulation, which will help with responsible lending and ensure that the licensing regime helps consumers.</p>

It is important to note that in the current climate we face a very different environment from the one we faced in the early 1990s: inflation is low at 2.5 per cent, compared with 7.5 per cent then; interest rates are at less than 6 per cent, compared with 15 per cent; and we have had 64 consecutive quarters of growth and a record level of employment.

<p><a name="0805123000244"></a>rather than &#147;enhanced co-operation&#148;. This is a probing amendment to generate debate. We do not believe the Government should ever have accepted this provision. Indeed, back in 2003 Peter Hain said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="0805123000269"></a>&#147;The UK has made it clear that it cannot accept the proposed ESDP reinforced co-operation provisions&#148;.</p>

At least 9 Member States must participate initially and other Member States may participate following the initial authorisation&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0805123000076"></a>We do not object to defence co-operation between the nations of Europe. Indeed, we welcome it and we would wish to encourage it. For such co-operation between one nation and one or more others to be enhanced would be a move in the right direction, but why do nine nations have to get together? Why does their co-operation have to be organised through Brussels? Why should they be exercising EU competencies?</p>

<a name="80512-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0805123000077"></a>The provision as it now stands points towards an inner core of countries capable and willing to participate fully in an integrated European defence. Other member states that choose not to join will be able thereby to opt out. They will thus be able to take a minimal role, both in self defence and in collective defence. That is how it works out and NATO&#146;s overall defence capability will not be improved as it needs to be. That capability will be damaged as some&#151;perhaps the smaller countries&#151;exclude themselves from such co-operation and decide to take no further part in either European defence integration, or more worryingly, NATO. They will be able to meet minimal EU military commitments, shifting the burden of fulfilling meaningful NATO expectations on to the larger EU members such as France, Germany, and of course, the UK.</p>

<a name="80512-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0805123000078"></a>Outside these three countries, EU countries spent an average of 1.7 per cent of GDP on defence in 2006. If permanent structured co-operation goes ahead there will be even less incentive for these countries to increase their military capabilities than is currently the case. NATO already suffers from a lack of military capability among its smaller members. This provision will make this worse. The treaty provides no reassurance as to how the PSC will operate. As with so much else, nothing has yet been finalised. Everything is to be decided after ratification. We have no idea of how many troops or how much money will be committed. Will the Minister tell the House what discussions have been had with other likely participants as to their plans for PSC? What other countries have stated their intention to join?</p>

The provision for permanent structured co-operation between a smaller group of member states is laid down in Article 28A(6), which allows greater co-operation in the area of capabilities. Article 28A(7) establishes a clause for mutual defence but without a security commitment along the lines of NATO&#146;s Article V.155.

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0805123000082"></a>The criteria and capability commitments for doing so are set out in the protocol on permanent structured co-operation. Article 1(b) of that protocol states that participating member states should have the capacity to supply by 2010 at the latest, either at national level or as a component of multinational force groups, combat units and supporting elements, including transport and logistics. Those would be capable of deployment within five to 30 days, in particular in response to requests from the UN. They would be sustained for an initial period of 30 days and extended up to a period of 120 days.</p>

<a name="80512-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0805123000083"></a>The protocol also sets out provisions in the area of capability harmonisation, the pooling of assets, co-operation in training and logistics, regular assessments of national defence expenditure and the development of flexibility, interoperability and deployability among forces. The possible review of national decision-making procedures with regard to the deployment of forces is also emphasised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0805123000087"></a>Our discussion last week highlighted that capability development remains at the heart of being able to address effectively the security challenges facing us. As my noble friend Lord Robertson reminded us in his graphic phrase, we cannot send a wiring diagram to a crisis. Permanent structured co-operation is a new mechanism that is designed to address precisely that need, and it is focused solely on military capability development, as set out in the treaty article that has been referred to and the accompanying protocol. I underline that it is not about a smaller inner grouping undertaking operations. There do not have to be nine member states involved in PSC.</p>

<a name="80512-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0805123000089"></a>As one of the foremost capability players in the EU, we would expect to see the UK playing a key role in establishing and leading permanent structured co-operation. This provision is a good example of a pragmatic, UK-inspired initiative that is focused on producing practical improvements on the ground. There is danger of confusion between enhanced co-operation and PSC. They are separate mechanisms. The main difference is that PSC is confined to military capability development, and it has nothing whatever to do with some inner group co-operating on defence issues, whether those issue be common defence or anything like it. I think the noble Lord, Lord Lee, was making that point.</p>

<a name="80512-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0805123000090"></a>As has often been said, there is but a single set of forces in Europe. Investments to European military capabilities benefit not only ESDP but NATO. The EU-NATO capability group will provide a mechanism to ensure that capability improvements leveraged through permanent structured co-operation are compatible with capability development in NATO.</p>

<a name="80512-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0805123000091"></a>Permanent structured co-operation involves some QMV decision-making: to establish permanent structured co-operation; to confirm participation of a member state that subsequently wishes to participate; and to suspend participation of a member state. This is in line with our objective to make PSC easier to set up and easier for member states to join&#151;and to make it easier, frankly, to suspend member states that do not perform and do what they have signed up to do. All other decisions will be taken by participating members by unanimity.</p>

Until the treaty is ratified, we will not engage with partners in detailed discussions on how to implement the provision, but we expect to do so once the treaty is ratified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0805123000093"></a>The European Union Select Committee considered carefully the PSC provisions in the treaty in its deliberations and in its unanimous report.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="0805123000272"></a>&#147;Permanent Structured Cooperation is a form of enabling framework allowing the Member States who so wish to co-operate more closely in the area of defence capabilities development&#148;.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="0805123000273"></a>&#147;Permanent Structured Cooperation is not a major departure from current practice. Rather, it represents a continuation and deepening of current forms of co-operation. Its objective is to create a political dynamic among Member States towards the improvement of European defence capabilities. Most of these new capabilities should be available to both NATO and the EU and could therefore serve to strengthen both organisations&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805123000248"></a>The committee concluded that,</p>

We are concerned that the details of how the provision will work will be decided only after the treaty&#146;s ratification. We do not believe that it will help to expand European military capabilities and we worry that it will undermine NATO&#146;s attempts at improving its future military capabilities.

They raise a number of issues that need careful scrutiny, in accordance with our remit and the recognition that we have the task of line by line scrutiny to perform on this complex and wide-ranging Bill, and on the treaty it embodies. Here, once again, we are largely in the hands of the lawyers&#151;which may be nice for the lawyers&#151;and of the Court, as we are on many issues in the treaty. This is because the treaty, which is almost word for word the constitution, lacks in itself the safe, secure legal provision to circumscribe and define the powers of the EU institutions, as opposed to the powers of member states. We will come to this debate later, when we look at competencies. All the while, we have to be aware that it is legal decisions and lawyers&#146; judgments and assessments, views and counterviews that will decide how these things work out.</p>

Indeed, even the European Union under the previous treaties had a treaty-signing power, which automatically gave the EU a kind of legal personality, which has been recognised by a number of professors and legal experts. Now the difference is a big one&#151;with the collapse of the Third Pillar into the combined new constitutional structure of the Union, this power extends considerably from the limits of old Pillar 1 issues, mainly on trade, which the European Community possessed, to foreign policy, defence, crime and judicial issues, and covers all the

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0805123000100"></a>This is a big change. We will have different views on whether it is good or bad, but we must recognise that it is there. It will be, in the words of the former Commission President and former Prime Minister of Italy, Romano Prodi,</p>
<ul><a name="0805123000297"></a>&#147;a gigantic leap forward. Europe can now play its role on the world stage thanks to its legal personality&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805123000250"></a>Something very big is happening and we cannot be blind to that. The French authorities helpfully went on to explain that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="0805123000275"></a>&#147;The European Union naturally has a vocation to be a permanent member of the Security Council, and the Constitution will allow it to be, by giving it legal personality&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805123000251"></a>Even the present Labour Government choked on this one, because this is going very far. I do not know about the position of the Lib Dems obviously, because that is never too easy, but the Government found this very awkward.</p>

That is argued by learned professors in lengthy papers. I hope that I understood the probably very deep question of the noble Lord, but that is what I said and that is the position. The clarification that I now seek from the Government on behalf of Parliament regards exactly what is implied in the future manufacture, construction and architecture of treaties that are negotiated and put together by the European Union. Obviously, some new questions arise.</p>

<a name="80512-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0805123000103"></a>I was referring to the past views of the Government, because those views have changed. Mr Hain, on behalf of the Government, said that we can support a legal personality for the Union only if the special arrangements for CFSP and some aspects of justice and home affairs have been protected. In our view, they certainly have not been protected. The previous Prime Minister, Mr Blair, specifically told the other place at the beginning of his premiership that,</p>
<ul><a name="0805123000276"></a>&#147;others wanted to give the European Union ... legal personality across all the pillars of the treaty. At our insistence, that was removed&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 18/6/97; col. 314.]</ul>
<p><a name="0805123000252"></a>It seems that that insistence has evaporated and some very important questions arise, which I want to put to the Minister. The first is: what powers will the high representative&#151;the Foreign Secretary of the Union&#151;have in negotiating major new international treaties, particularly those governing, as all international treaties do, important areas of foreign policy? What will be the national parliamentary check on Ministers where major positions are taken up or conceded? I realise the difficulties involved as they have always

I do not deny the difficulty, but we have heard a lot about giving Parliament a bigger say in decisions&#151;about going to war, for instance&#151;so what about powers over binding treaties in our name that could lead to major commitments in the future? Just what are we in for on that front?</p>

<a name="80512-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0805123000104"></a>At the very least, as our Amendment No. 26A proposes, both Houses need a clear report before the Bill rolls forward and it comes into force as an Act, setting out how the independent or interdependent representation of our national interest and purposes in international bodies and other international arrangements&#151;arrangements that we value greatly in this country, giving us considerable sway on and entr&#233;e to the global scene&#151;are going to be upheld once the extended legal personality power for the whole Union is in place. We believe that a report of that kind should require the affirmative resolutions of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0805123000105"></a>There was a time when arguing that Parliament should have a greater say in treaties before they were finally signed was a bit out of fashion. We were told that it was all a matter for the Executive and the royal prerogative and so on. I remember many decades ago being impertinent and bold enough as a young Member of the other place to argue that I was a Parliament man. Most people had no idea what one was talking about, but nowadays things have changed and it is all the rage to call for more parliamentary powers over the Executive and the royal prerogative, and for a greater say in all aspects of executive decisions. Indeed, as I have already mentioned, the proposal that Parliament should have a say in the declaration of war is now before us. However, there is a clear move in the treaty, alas, to make for fewer parliamentary powers by our Parliament over executive action, as competence passes elsewhere and accountability is obviously diluted. That trend, as in so many spheres that we are debating in the Bill, is not toward a stronger and more democratic Europe closer to the people but is in the wrong way. It needs to be resisted. For those reasons, I beg to move.</p>

The Union is clearly proceeding towards making comprehensibility a factor. I believe that recognising that the new treaty will spell this out will end the oddity of the situation in which explicit legal personality is provided for in respect of the trading matters under the original European legislation, the European Act and other international matters. The question of whether this has, as has been suggested by some anti-Europeans, the significance of conferring on the Union the attributes of a state has also been bluntly and clearly answered by the report of the European Union Select Committee. In answer to a question from the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, whether de facto possession of a legal personality makes the Union a state, Professor Dashwood answered:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="0805123000279"></a>&#147;No it does not. There are many international organisations that have international legal personality. States are in the unique position of being full subjects of the international legal order ... In the case of the European Union, the European Community has legal personality, so does the European Central Bank, so does Euratom&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805123000254"></a>It is clearly nonsense to suggest that the explicit conferral of a legal personality on the Union in any way makes this a conferral of a state on the Union.</p>

<a name="80512-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0805123000110"></a>It has been suggested that in some way this muddies the waters so far as concerns the representation of the Union in international organisations, such as the Security Council of the United Nations. Once again, the evidence is absolutely clear from all witnesses that this House has heard. The noble Lord, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, asked questions about this and was again clearly answered that the status of individual member states was unaffected by the conferral of a legal personality on the Union as a whole. At any time, two permanent members or other members of the European Union may sit on the Security Council, and their role is in no way affected or diminished by the conferral of a single legal personality on the Union.</p>

Nor does it affect the relative competences of the European Union and its member states, as summarised in the opinion of the European Union Select Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0805123000118"></a>In making my final point about the issue of single legal personality I want to reflect briefly on the reasoning already expressed by the Government, which it is perhaps better for the noble Baroness to express for herself and for them, but there were earlier stages in the discussion of this issue when the single legal personality was not explicitly endorsed for inclusion in the treaty because the Government, in their diplomatic exercise, were seeking to put beyond doubt that the retention of the common foreign and security policy would be a separate matter requiring unanimity in the Council before international agreements were entered into. They wanted that to be clearly defined, as it has been, in a separate treaty. That makes it understandable that the Government took the position that they did.</p>

<a name="80512-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0805123000119"></a>That position has changed and the Government have&#151;to my mind, sensibly&#151;accepted that there is a need to bring together the actuality&#151;the existence of de facto legal personality&#151;with a juridical legal personality in respect of other matters, such as trade. That is a sensible clarifying move, and one that I hope will now be considered to be beyond dispute, at least by lawyers. I find the hesitation about lawyers rather surprising, because I am not entirely clear who else the noble Lord believes we should turn to for expert advice on interpretation of the language of treaties.</p>

There is no question but that Romano Prodi jumped with joy when he saw the article appearing in the constitution, now transferred to the Lisbon treaty. He said that this is a gigantic step forward. Where a chap like Prodi speaks like that, we must take some notice of him. When he is supported in that view by the French during the referendum and then when you listen to people in this House, we are entitled to ask what the position of Her Majesty&#146;s Government really is. Did they oppose it in the first place? Have they opposed it at any stage? Did they oppose it during discussions on the constitution? Did they oppose it during discussions on the treaty?

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0805123000124"></a>Legal personality is, to some of us, the most important aspect of the new treaty. Today, Bruno Waterfield of the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> quotes from various bureaucrats involved in drawing up the new constitutional position. He quotes one of these bureaucrats as saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="0805123000280"></a>&#147;A lot people are just beginning to realise what they have signed up to&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805123000255"></a>One EU official said that the Lisbon treaty was,</p>
<ul><a name="0805123000298"></a>&#147;more profound and far-reaching than anything else in the EU&#146;s 50 year history ... for us here it is the most important time in our lives. There has never been such a constellation of jobs and institutional changes aligned at the same moment. A lot of people are talking about a new epoch&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805123000256"></a>That is what is going on in Brussels. It is underlined and supported by the new legal personality, which is regarded as the jewel in the crown in many of the corridors there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0805123000125"></a>I do not know whether the Leader of the House is aware that the proposal for legal personality for the whole European Union&#151;as opposed to just for the Commission in trade matters and so on which we agree has been there since 1972&#151;was vetoed by Chancellor Kohl at Maastricht. He thought that it gave the European Union too much power. That power will, in the end, be exercised by the Luxembourg Court of Justice on whose judicial activism we have already commented in these proceedings and doubtless we will return to them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0805123000126"></a>In the draft constitution, the wording for legal personality was that the EU,</p>
<ul><a name="0805123000299"></a>&#147;shall have legal personality superior to that of the member states&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805123000257"></a>However, in the final version the last seven words were amended, in order, I understand, not to expose this huge advance of the EU&#146;s power too clearly to the unhappy public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0805123000127"></a>Can the Minister tell us what limits are put on this new legal personality? The noble Lord, Lord Howell, has already mentioned that the pillars&#151;justice and home affairs, and the common, foreign and security policy&#151;are now gathered under this legal personality. Perhaps the best way of asking the Minister that question is to quote two Written Answers she sent to me on 28 February this year when I asked:</p>

<p><a name="0805123000259"></a>The noble Baroness has not yet answered that question. It would be helpful if she did so this evening, because it would enable us to define the borders of this new power, which we maintain do not exist. In the end, this power confers on the European Union, supported by the Court, almost unlimited power, bearing in mind the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and various other aspects of the treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0805123000128"></a>I will quote the noble Baroness&#146;s Answer to her, in case she does not have it to hand:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="0805123000283"></a>&#147;For the first time the Lisbon Treaty defines the Union&#146;s competences, setting out where the EU can and cannot act&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805123000260"></a>We will come to that later. Then she says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="0805123000284"></a>&#147;These competences are set out in Article 2(12) of the Treaty of Lisbon ... presented to Parliament in December 2007. The treaty explicitly states that competences not conferred on the EU remain with member states&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/2/08; col. <I>WA</I> 133.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805123000261"></a>What are those competences? What remains with the member states in which the EU cannot interfere at all when it has this new overarching legal personality that is superior to that of the member states?</p>

What we have is much more precise than the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, would have us believe. The whole question of legal personality is not a new phenomenon in international organisations; it is a constancy. It applies in the United Nations and in the International Criminal Court. It even applies in the Universal Postal Union. All these bodies have legal personality.</p>

<a name="80512-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0805123000130"></a>The change that has been made, bearing in the mind the need to clarify &#147;legal personality&#148; for the European Union, is very simple and quite clearly backed up by Declaration 26 of the Intergovernmental Conference. For the sake of everyone having the same song sheet, I will briefly read one sentence from Declaration 24 on the legal personality of the European Union:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="0805123000285"></a>&#147;The Conference confirms that the fact that the European Union has a legal personality will not in any way authorise the Union to legislate or to act beyond the competences conferred upon it by the Member States in the Treaties&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80512-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0805123000131"></a>That will satisfy the overwhelming majority of people. I do not expect it to satisfy the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch. He will continue to tell his fairytales, and the rest of us will continue to ignore them.</p>

As I asked the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, if all this is just clarification and the EU has had this personality before, why is it necessary to have this in the treaty?

The fact that many international organisations have legal personality shows that it is not an attribute of statehood.

The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, would rather be out of it altogether but, for those of us who wish to remain in the European Community, there is the model that sees it as an organisation in which there is co-operation between member states and there is the Liberal model, which is basically about creating a federal state and a federal Europe.</p>

It is difficult to know what the Liberals think on these matters because they have not tabled amendments; they are simply acting as cheerleaders for the Government and are not providing any detailed scrutiny. However, I thought that there was support for European federalism. If you are a federalist, you want to create an organisation that has a legal personality because you want to create a country called Europe. Those of us who think that that will destroy Europe see legal personality as a particularly sensitive issue. That is why my noble friend Lord Howell is right to move this amendment.</p>

However, two or three years down the line, we will find that it means considerably more than that and that there is no going back. If this is just a matter of clarification, taking it out will not make any difference to the progress of the European Union. The reason why Mr Prodi was so ecstatic is that he is a member of the group that sees Europe as having a federal structure and wants a constitution accordingly.</p>

The answer given by the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, was that many thought it right to make this explicit. My answer is that many think it right to make it clear that we are no longer talking about legal schizophrenia. There was a time&#151;from the beginning&#151;when the European Communities had an acknowledged legal personality, which was recognised by all, and a treaty-making power. From about the time of Maastricht, when the party of the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, was in office, it became clear that the European Union had a legal personality. It was running cities in Bosnia and had to be capable of being sued for its deeds or misdeeds. So it is clear that it had a de facto legal personality from the early 1990s. However, some still argued that it had two personalities: when it was the European Union it had one; when it was the European Communities it had another. The discussions in the first months of the convention, in which the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, took part, established that there was no need to maintain this schizophrenia.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Howell, asked precisely the right question: what does that mean for the powers of the high representative? What can he do with the single legal personality? The answer is, of course, exactly the same as the rotating president of the Council could do. It is not the legal personality that confers new competencies or powers; it is what the rest of the treaty says.</p>

I do not wish to be a party to criticism of the membership of any committee of the House, but we are not dependent on this report.

Therefore the concern at the heart of my noble friend&#146;s amendments, as my noble friend Lord Campbell indicated, is precisely what this legal personality will be used to achieve and what it will mean in the longer term. It is an important matter and should not be rushed through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0805123000145"></a>I have spoken to noble Lords about how far we might get today and, as there are so many noble Lords who reasonably wish to speak in the debate, whether we could keep our remarks succinct. I rise only when I think that we have said everything that can be said and are in danger of saying it again. At that point, it benefits us all if I at least give my response to what has been said. Often noble Lords wish me to do so.</p>

<a name="80512-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0805123000146"></a>We have to be careful that no one impugns the integrity of anyone in the House. The committee did a fantastic job in looking through the treaty and I pay enormous credit to it. I also pay credit to all the noble Lords who spent an enormous amount of time and energy reading the treaty and coming to their own opinion on it.</p>

<a name="80512-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0805123000147"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, does not need to interrupt me. I am not impugning his integrity. I am simply saying that I think that we should, as a general way of operating, regard all that is done to improve the clarification of this treaty as being positive. In no way does that prevent noble Lords from disagreeing with conclusions that have been reached. I do not accept that, just because one holds an opinion, one cannot look at information properly.</p>

My question is about the use of this phrase &#147;impugning the integrity&#148; when looking at the views on a committee. Let us take as an example the committee with which the noble Baroness is involved that is looking at the future of this House. I think that I can say that all the people on that committee have a view on the reform of this House that is not in line with the feelings in the rest of the House. Her committee represents a particular view and, when it reports, I think that we will be entitled to say, &#147;Well, they would say that, wouldn&#146;t they?&#148;.</p>

The noble Lord may wish to disagree, but I suggest he takes it up with his own party. The shadow Leader of the House in another place is clear in her representation of the policy.</p>

<a name="80512-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0805123000150"></a>However, let us not get involved in that. Of course, the noble Lord is right that noble Lords can disagree with the conclusions of a committee. That is my point. What I am arguing is that we have to be a little bit careful, particularly in your Lordships&#146; House, that we do not, by accident, impugn anyone&#146;s integrity. That is all that I want to say on that. The noble Lord was clever in getting the issue of Lords reform into this debate.</p>

<a name="80512-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0805123000151"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, on his non-lawyer point. I am a non-lawyer, too, so I am in the happy band of people who wish to look at these issues from that important perspective. I begin by addressing the concern that noble Lords have raised about the position of the Government in 2004 and of my right honourable friend Peter Hain in his then capacity as Minister for Europe. The great concern of the Government at that point was the potential impact on the separate intergovernmental nature of CFSP&#151;common foreign and security policy. Once safeguards had been agreed&#151;and within the Lisbon treaty we are very comfortable with the distinct nature of CFSP&#151;our concerns went away. Noble Lords are completely right that the Government raised concerns. The concerns, as far as we are concerned, were addressed. Once we had the present position, we were content to move towards a single legal personality.</p>

<a name="80512-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0805123000152"></a>Noble Lords have indicated far more eloquently than I can that this is not a new or particularly unusual concept. Lots of different organisations carry legal personality. My favourites are Vine and Wine and the Western Indian Ocean Tuna Organisation Convention. There is a raft of different organisations&#151;some very familiar to noble Lords, some less familiar&#151;that have legal personality. It is a standard characteristic of many international organisations, including the UN, and enables them to conclude international agreements where those are necessary to carry out their work.</p>

<a name="80512-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0805123000153"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, said in his opening remarks, the European Community has had legal personality since the treaty of Rome in 1957. It has concluded hundreds of international agreements that cover all fields of Community activity&#151;trade and development with third countries and international organisations, for example. As the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, knows and as the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, described&#151;and I will not put it in terms of schizophrenia&#151;the European Union was not expressly given legal personality when it was set up. As the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, said, it has always been regarded as having legal personality in that it now has the power to conclude agreements in its own name. It has concluded about 100 such agreements in its own right.</p>

<a name="80512-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0805123000154"></a>Since the treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, it has had the explicit power to do that in CFSP and in police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. So, for example, agreements with the United States of America on extradition and mutual legal assistance  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_819"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column 819</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>were made in 2003, a co-operation agreement with the International Criminal Court was made in 2006 and there have been a number of agreements concerning EU police missions referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, to operate in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Afghanistan.</p>

<a name="80512-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0805123000155"></a>What would happen at present&#151;this is the simplest way of describing why we need to move to the single legal personality&#151;is that the European Union and the European Community would need to accede separately to agreement, each within their own area of responsibility. That inevitably creates a degree of complexity, particularly for the third country or organisation concerned when, instead of concluding agreements with one organisation, it has to do so with two. The treaty simplifies the existing position, where there are two bodies, the EU and the EC, by providing that there will just be one body&#151;the European Union. We believe that that will enable it to operate more effectively internationally and will help to make the actions with regard to third countries and organisations more coherent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0805123000156"></a>My noble friend Lord Tomlinson has already read out Declaration 24, which expressly says that the treaty will not create any new powers for the European Union. As the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, and others have said, the EU Select Committee of your Lordships&#146; House made it clear in its impact assessment that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="0805123000286"></a>&#147;The Lisbon Treaty confers legal personality expressly on the EU, giving it the capacity to enter into legal relationships with other parties in its own right&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805123000262"></a>It goes on to say that the European Community expressly and the European Union implicitly have had legal personality before.</p>

<a name="80512-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0805123000157"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, asked whether the legal personality would somehow allow the European Union to become a member of the Security Council or be more involved in it. The answer is no. As I have indicated, a vast range of international organisations have legal personality but none of them can join the UN, let alone the Security Council. As noble Lords who are more familiar with this subject will know, under the UN charter, membership of the UN and of the Security Council is open only to states, so the only way in which the European Union could join the Security Council would be by amending the UN charter itself.</p>

<a name="80512-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0805123000158"></a>Noble Lords have asked what this means for the high representative. The noble Lord, Lord Kerr, indicated that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, had asked the right question. As the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, said, the high representative will take over the role of the rotating presidency in negotiating, where mandated by the Council, in the area of common foreign and security policy. It is for the Council of Ministers to mandate the negotiation of such agreements and to conclude them. In the area of common foreign and security policy, that would be by unanimity within the Council. We have already discussed that at some length in Committee with regard to the relationship between the high representative and the Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0805123000159"></a>On parliamentary control of treaties, the position will be exactly the same as at present: where the EU, rather than the UK, is a party, the decisions are subject to parliamentary scrutiny in the usual way that has applied for many years. There is no change on that. As with all international organisations with legal personality, the EU can act only within the limits of the powers conferred on it by the treaties.</p>

<a name="80512-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0805123000160"></a>Because this is, one could argue, a way of tidying up and making it easier to conclude agreements with other organisations and states beyond the European Union, we see no reason to lay a report about this before your Lordships&#146; House or another place. We think that this is an important way of ensuring that the treaty deals with outstanding issues where business could perhaps be transacted better by taking us forward into a single legal personality, but it is nothing more than that. It is an important step, and one that I hope noble Lords will support. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0805123000162"></a>I notice that the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, was quoting great legal authorities giving views in one direction, but there are views in another. Mr Neil O&#146;Brien has pointed out that the Government have traditionally resisted the conferral of a legal personality on the Union. The Minister tried to explain why, but there are some big gaps. It was not only traditionally resisted; the Prime Minister said that the Government were not having it and that the idea of EU legal personality would not be accepted and had been stopped. Of course, in the end, it had not been stopped.</p>

There are deeper and more important reasons, which I would like to hear. We are not going to hear about them now, I realise. All I ask of the Government at the end of this short debate, and I shall probably ask it at the end of others, is please do not tell us that nothing has changed when it clearly has. In the excellent EU report, the last, quite long, sentence of paragraph 2.58 begins:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="0805123000287"></a>&#147;Conferring legal personality expressly on the Union&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805123000166"></a>I will not read it all out, but it points out that it will apply to the EU and the areas currently covered by the Second and Third Pillars. That may have nothing to do with competence. It may not change even the underlying pattern of behaviour&#151;although who is to know, when the whole process is step by step, over the years, and one thing grows from another&#151;but it is a change. So please do not tell us that nothing has changed when it has. In the same way, over the whole constitution and the word-for-word translation of it, please do not tell us that something has changed when it has not. If we follow those two precepts, we will get on a lot quicker with processing this Bill. I have finished, but I think the noble Lord wants to speak.</p>

We were asserting&#151;and the committee asserted&#151;that there was de facto legal personality in respect of matters that did not fall within the European Community treaty.

At the moment all that is necessary to leave the European Union is for Parliament&#151;the House of Commons and your Lordships' House&#151;to repeal the European Communities Act 1972, thus also repealing all the subsequent treaties which have been passed since as amendments to it. That is simple and highly desirable. I should be grateful to know if the noble Baroness the Leader of the House disagrees with that analysis. If we want to get out now, all we do is repeal the 1972 Act and we are out. But if we are forced to follow the arrangements set out in Lisbon, we have to go through a rigmarole lasting up to two years and we would be able to leave only on conditions agreed with the Council whose meetings about our withdrawal we would not have been able to attend. I call that much less satisfactory and much less convenient, and that is why we want to remove it.</p>

I appreciate that we like respecting our treaty obligations and all that, but surely if Parliament decided that the UK should leave all it would still have to do is what it has to do now, which is to repeal the 1972 Act. Since the Government have agreed in these proceedings that one Parliament cannot bind its successors&#151;and I ask the noble Baroness to reconfirm that briefly and clearly&#151;surely a simple cancellation of the 1972 Act, and subsequent and depending Acts, would do the trick and set us free. What is the new position? I beg to move.</p>

I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, said a single word about the amendment&#151;he went off slagging off Eurosceptics and talking about conspiracy theories that people may or may not have. Perhaps I may draw his attention back to the amendment, which concerns the withdrawal provisions in the treaty. Speaking for UKIP, as my noble friend Lord Pearson did, I can say that we are at one with the Government on this. I say that because, a few years ago, the former Foreign Office Minister, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, stated our position exactly. In January 2000, she said:</p>
<ul><a name="0805123000300"></a>&#147;We see no need for the Treaties governing membership of the Union to include a specific provision on unilateral withdrawal. It remains open to Parliament to repeal the European Communities Act 1972, the logical consequences of which would be to withdraw from the EU. The terms of such a withdrawal would be for the Government to negotiate with the other member states &#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/1/00; col. WA 96-97.]</ul>

The reason why I support it is that the treaty appears to put a constraint on our ability to withdraw by repealing the European Communities Act 1972 as and when we wish to, without any constraint by the European Union and its institutions. I would like to have the assurance that once Parliament has repealed the European Communities Act 1972, that is the end of it. There may be further negotiations with the EU, but they would be on our terms and not on its terms.</p>

I find the amendment mischievous, because the European Union is in fact doing what I think noble Lords opposite wished it to do, which is to systematise the possibility for a member state to leave if it wished and decided so to do. The doctrine that the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, is adumbrating is the doctrine of unilateralism in regard to international obligations. You enter into them when you feel like it, you tear them up when you feel like it and you tell everyone else to go to hell when you feel like it. I do not happen to think that is a very good way of running international affairs, whether in the European Union or anywhere else, and I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn, because it is totally mischievous.</p>

That is what I came up with, with the help of my noble friend Lord Bach. I apologise for smiling when that was said.

<a name="80512-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0805123000194"></a>I will try to be brief, because I think that everything that needs to be said has been said. The first time that we have the opportunity to consider as a group of 27 states the possibility that a member state might wish to leave is through the Lisbon treaty. It is right and proper that rules to enable people to leave should be properly considered in the treaty and delivered appropriately. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddard, is not completely right in saying that repealing the 1972 Act is all that has to happen. That is true for domestic law but, as a consequence of being part of the European Union, we have entered into treaty agreements of many different kinds from which we would also have to withdraw. We would have to do so in a way that did not detrimentally affect our national interests. We need to consider that.</p>

<a name="80512-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0805123000195"></a>The decision to leave the European Union is for the member state and the member state alone. It is its decision to do so. There is no question of seeking permission to withdraw, which noble Lords might have been concerned about. It is simply about notifying that the member state has decided to withdraw. The European Council would provide guidelines for withdrawal, and the Union would negotiate an agreement with the withdrawing member state because, as noble Lords will be aware, there are issues to be resolved beyond treaties, such as what happens about arrangements for Members of the European Parliament from nation states, for officials in the Union institutions from the withdrawing member states and so on. There are people who would need to be considered in that process. Making sure that was done properly and in an orderly fashion is important.</p>

<a name="80512-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0805123000196"></a>There may be financial implications, as noble Lords have said, of not contributing to the European Union. Equally, there might be financial considerations of other kinds. It is important to have a mechanism that could ensure smooth withdrawal. Noble Lords

In our case, the repealing of the 1972 Act would be the domestic way in which we would do it, but there would be much more to do. This sets out a process to make that happen as smoothly as possible. I hope that we would never leave the European Union, but&#151;as I hope noble Lords will agree&#151;if a member state chose to leave, this is a very good way of making sure that it happened properly.</p>

I am grateful for the rest of her reply&#151;it is very helpful to have that on the record. In the 15th minute of this debate, which I think is near to setting a record in our proceedings, I feel that I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, who entered into a debate about defence, that in our most recent proceedings, I merely queried the present status of the Farnborough agreement. I named the countries involved, I named some of the provisions and I asked what its present status was&#151;no more than that. It is not a fairy tale&#151;the noble Lord even found it on Google.</p>

I hope that, in discussing this horizontal issue, we do not drift into all the specific areas of new competences, which are listed fully in the treaty and in other documents, because we are going to debate some of those competences later on. That would be unnecessary duplication. Nevertheless, the competences issue is sitting there in the middle of the treaty, and it is an area where the UK Government used to be deeply worried&#151;and rightly so&#151;about creeping competences and the extension of the areas

There they all are, on page 53 of the treaty&#151;Article 2B for exclusive competences and Article 2C for shared competences, which are substantially extended. They were all in the constitution document and are replicated in this one. They are intended to clarify, but do they?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0805123000204"></a>The point of the Laeken declaration, which gave birth to the plan for a new constitution, and to the disastrous and mismanaged convention that all ended in tears, was to clarify the different layers of power, and to stop the bit-by-bit erosion of what I call the coastal rock cliffs of national interest by the ceaseless pounding sea of Brussels power&#151;the late Lord Denning had even more emotive and evocative words to describe what he thought was happening. That was the intention behind the convention, the constitution treaty and its replica, the Lisbon treaty. However, even the most objective reader, and certainly 1,000&#151;or 100, I must not exaggerate&#151;different authorities throughout the European Union have had to admit that it does the opposite. This is a very confusing document. More powers are now shared. The sharing concept has come to the centre of the treaty yet no one is clear what the sharing means. The phraseology is that it allows member states to act only if the EU chooses not to do so.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0805123000205"></a>The treaty states that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="0805123000290"></a>&#147;The Member States shall exercise their competence to the extent that the Union has not exercised its competence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805123000263"></a>With the best will in the world, there is a lot of room here for misunderstanding, subjective judgments, legal interpretations, analysis and argument. Certainly, clarity comes at the bottom of the list. It is no surprise that when these texts were drafted at the time of the convention for the previous treaty, the UK argued, first, that shared competence should be a residual category, but of course it is not; secondly, that the idea of an indicative list of competences and shared competences would be the &#147;worst of all worlds&#148;, which is exactly what we have; thirdly, that competition should not be an exclusive competence, which it is; fourthly, that employment, public health and consumer protection should not be shared competences, which they turn out to be in the treaty; and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0805123000206"></a>I shall not delay us any more than is necessary by listing all the new competences. They are extensive and go into areas that were vigorously opposed by the Government, yet there has been a change of heart without any reasonable explanation so far. I hope that we will now hear one. All this badly needs to be clarified. I beg to move.</p>

We will hear both arguments about this use of language.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0805123000208"></a>In my view, the definition of shared competences was, in the words read out by my noble friend, that the EU can legislate in any area where there is a shared competence with unlimited scope. Once the heading is there&#151;and he did not quote an exhaustive list&#151;the treaty prescribes that, as long as the EU can make some tangential reference to the matter in hand as being related to one of the headings, the EU can claim the competence to legislate in that area. We know that as a result of the extensions that the treaty brings in, the EU will have a right in most of those areas to legislate by qualified majority voting. Therefore, these provisions open up almost any area in which the EU might want to legislate as being accessible to it through an extension of these so-called shared competences.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0805123000209"></a>It is notable that the wording of the treaty states that national Governments can&#151;it does not include the word &#147;only&#148;, but it might as well do so&#151;legislate in areas where the EU has not legislated. In other words, we have given the EU the first right to legislate in all these areas. Our national Governments are allowed scope to legislate only in areas where the European Union has not legislated. If those were only a few tight areas related to the working of the Common Market or trade policy, one might think that that was reasonable, but when the headings are as broad as they are, covering just about every conceivable area of domestic policy&#151;whether economic, social, political, environmental, or on justice and home affairs&#151;you realise that we are creating a European Union that has carte blanche to legislate in all those areas. The few areas that were not thought of to be included under those headings are then put in another category of supporting legislation, whereby the EU can act to support or complement the laws of nation states. It does not take too much insight to understand that most of these areas will rapidly be turned into areas where the support and complementarity of the European Union is also becoming a major driving force for legislation.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0805123000210"></a>There is a genuine concern that this aspect of the treaty gives the European Union carte blanche. It is a significant innovation and needs further explanation.</p>

I must say that, over a long career, I have never read a plain sentence that opponents of the treaty have found clear. I have found the competences very clear and some have always maintained that they are not. These elements in the Bill are perfectly clear and I think that the actions taken by member states and the European institutions over a long period&#151;at least 35 years, and before our membership&#151;have made them clear. If, 20 years ago,

Over 20 years, they are exactly what I have understood to be the shared and exclusive competences and supporting actions of the European Union. Those who have read the innumerable booklets, pamphlets, books and other things written about the European Union would have found them there very many times.

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0805123000215"></a>I suppose that there is an understandable anxiety about the inevitably complex appearance of legalistic language, when treaties are drafted, of the relationship between individual member states and the Union itself. This is a codification exercise that is bound to be progressive. If you consult carefully the leading representatives of the 10 member states that have joined recently&#151;and the two others following them, including the two Mediterranean islands, of course&#151;you will notice an enthusiasm always expressed by them for the fact that, as the Union is becoming bigger, allocation of competence, power and duty at the margin is bound to be increased to make the whole thing capable of going forward. If you do not do that, it would stall. The new member states wanted that when they signed up to the treaties and the acquis communautaire.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="0805123000216"></a>Once again, if you are an enthusiastic member of the club, the old example of that is that you have to occasionally do what the other member states say. In fact, I distinctly remember a former senior Minister of the Conservative Government, the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, actually saying that in the House of Commons many years ago. It was quite a surprise to hear him say that, and I was very pleased at the time. It is a reality that we have to accept.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="0805123000217"></a>The anxieties of the Conservative spokesman and the succeeding speaker, supporting Amendment No. 28A, would have been more justified if there had been any increase in the exclusive competences. As the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, rightly said, they are very brief. Of course, they cover major areas of collective endeavour&#151;I certainly would not deny that.  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_830"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column 830</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Nonetheless, it is a very short and modest list that we have all tended to accept, with the exception of monetary union in this country of course&#151;and I regard it as a great pity that we have not yet joined what is rapidly developing as the most successful currency in the world, at least for the moment. It may not always be like that but it is obviously an impressive currency in international terms.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="0805123000218"></a>However, with regard to the other matters, the list of exclusive competences does not create anxiety at all. It includes the customs union under Article 19 of the treaty of Rome 1957, and the competition rules, which I am sure most Members of this House would support. The only way in which there can be a completely free market with an open competition policy is for the Commission to have an exclusive competence to decide that in a European-wide sense, while not in any way infringing on the right of the member states to have their own national competition procedures and frameworks. The list also includes monetary policy, to which I have just referred. We are not yet members of that; we are part members of part of the consultative process but I hope that one day we will be full members. Although this may sound more unusual and esoteric, the list also includes the conservation of marine and biological resources. Perhaps that will be referred to later when we discuss common fisheries policy. One can see that that issue had to be exclusive because the conservation measures could operate only on sea areas that were wider than one member state&#146;s ownership. Also included are the common commercial policy under Articles 110 to 116 of the treaty of Rome 1957, and the international agreements whereby it has been agreed that in future the Union can sign on behalf of all members.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="0805123000219"></a>The areas of shared competence and supporting competence are more interesting from the point of view of those who have reservations or are not such enthusiastic Europeans as most members of the Liberal Democrat party in this House and, I hope, the other place. However, again, here the treaty simply sets out rationally the relationship between the Union and the nation states making up membership of the Union where those nation states, in free discussion in the Council of Ministers and the European Council, and by signing treaties on previous occasions, have agreed in a sovereign way that they are prepared to let the Union have some of that competence. Therefore, we on these Benches cannot understand the anxieties, and we hope that the amendment will not be pressed. </p>

I want to express some sympathy with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, but it would be nice if we could table amendments to the treaty itself. Unfortunately, our procedures do not allow us to do that and therefore we can only amend this short Bill. That is why those of us who want to make amendments have to say, &#147;Okay, you can have the treaty except this&#148;. I agree that that is not a satisfactory way to proceed.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="0805123000221"></a>I have just one question for the noble Baroness the Leader of the House. Up until now, replies to Written and Oral Questions have stated that about 70 per cent  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_831"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column 831</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of our legislation emanates from Brussels. Will that figure increase&#151;or perhaps even decrease&#151;as a result of this treaty? Some of us believe that the European Union is doing far too much. If this treaty is to increase the percentage of legislation that comes from Europe, rather than decrease it or leave it as it is, one begins to wonder what on earth this Parliament is here for. Why do we need 649&#151;I think that is the figure; it goes up and down&#151;Members of the House of Commons and why do we need 750 people in this place if the European Union is responsible for at least starting the legislation and powers which we then have to enact?</p>

With respect, the important question that he addresses is not actually relevant to the articles of the treaty on which these amendments focus. If the noble Lord looks at article 2A, paragraph 6 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="0805123000291"></a>&#147;The scope ... and arrangements for exercising the Union&#146;s competences shall be determined by the provisions of the Treaties relating to each area&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805123000264"></a>That is why the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said quite correctly that he did not intend to focus on the definitions in each case because we will come to debate them in subsequent amendments; he was concerned simply with these broad categories at the start. The proportion, amount and focus of legislation will not be affected by these articles, which are headline articles that describe categories of competence but do not affect the content of competence at all.</p>

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="0805123000223"></a><a name="80512-0006.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80512-0006.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="0805123000432"></a>Lord Stoddart of Swindon:</b> That was the question I was asking the Minister. I appreciate what the noble Lord says; his intervention is very helpful, but because I wanted to save time I had not entered into the specifics of the competences. All I wanted to know was whether this treaty would increase the percentage of legislation coming from Brussels&#151;a simple question, to which I hope to have a simple answer.</p>

<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="0805123000224"></a><a name="80512-0006.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80512-0006.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="0805123000433"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart. I did not see him stand up; I was not trying to cut him off in his prime from our discussions.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="0805123000225"></a>The categorisation of competences does not do anything new. The Committee will be aware of exclusive and shared competences, and areas where the EU can &#147;support, co-ordinate or supplement&#148; national actions. No change of substance is being proposed here; the categories reflect existing case law and, I believe, provide greater clarity than we have had before. The Select Committee said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="0805123000292"></a>&#147;We consider that setting out the categories and ... listing ... areas of competence is a useful clarification&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0805123000265"></a>I hope that all noble Lords will agree with that quite important point.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="0805123000226"></a>It is also explicit in the Lisbon treaty that powers are given to the European Union by its member states, not the other way round. Again, it is important to clarify that that is how this works. It sets out exactly  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_832"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column 832</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>where the European Union has a power to act and in what way, and that it has only those competences expressly conferred on it by the treaties. I would describe that as making it absolutely clear that the member states are, importantly, in control of the treaties&#151;&#147;masters of the treaties&#148; is how the German constitutional court put it.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="0805123000227"></a>Another important clarification is that the treaty also specifically recognises that competences can be transferred back to member states. If it is better that one be taken away from the European Union and go back to member states, that can now happen. It is important to recognise that, as Chancellor Merkel said, it is no longer a one-way street; that is absolutely right when there is the ability for things to be returned. Also, in the area of shared competence, if the Union ceases to exercise its competence it reverts back to the member states.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="0805123000228"></a>First, then, this is a clarification of what is exclusive and shared, and where the EU is acting to support member states. It is important to say that that is the extent of what the European Union can do, that competencies can be returned to member states and that those are conferred on the Union by member states. I should have thought that all noble Lords would welcome those important points of clarification.</p>

First, have any powers been returned to nation states since 1972 and, if so, can she identify them? Does she agree that the word competence is very unfortunate, because competence usually means an ability to do something and to do it well? We have come to use the French word &#147;competence&#148;, which means power, so perhaps we should use the word &#147;power&#148; in future when we discuss these matters.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="0805123000230"></a>What will be the procedure for returning those powers in future, which I maintain have never been returned in the past? Will that be by qualified majority voting or unanimity? Supposing that the other member states do not want to return powers that we might want returned, how will that work?</p>

<p><a name="st_113"></a>

Competence is a word that, as I understand it, has a legal meaning; that is why it is used. Words in the European Union often have meanings that are understood across all member states. I do not know of any powers that have been returned; the noble Lord may well be quite right. If I can get the answer to that now, I certainly will.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="0805123000232"></a>I do not know what procedure would be used, because that has not has yet been determined. My point was different; it was to say that the treaty recognises the possibility that powers could be returned. That of itself is novel and not to be underestimated as a potentially important aspect of thinking about the role of the European Union now and in future. As noble Lords have said, we are not going to get into the detail of what those competencies would be today. If noble Lords read the evidence given to the Select Committee by my honourable friend Jim Murphy,  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_833"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column 833</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they will see set out the areas of difference in competences relevant within the Lisbon treaty; for example on sport, which is new; on space, which noble Lords have mentioned; on energy, tourism and so on.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="0805123000233"></a>When, as we will, we come to debate the issues raised in some of the amendments about specific policy areas, we may as part of that deal with the competences in the treaty. My point on this amendment is simply to say that we believe that categorisation is positive, that it is important to list the competences to understand the limits and parameters of the role of the EU and, as I said, to recognise that this is power&#151;if the noble Lord wishes to use that word&#151;conferred on the European Union by member states, not the other way round. I can confirm to him that no powers have been returned thus far.</p>

He came back to this country and declared, &#147;Game, set and match&#148;, because he had got that introduced into the Maastricht treaty. Since then, no powers or competences have been returned to this country at all, as the noble Baroness has just confirmed.</p>

The noble Baroness has just confirmed that not one such power has since been returned.</p>

<a name="80512-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="0805123000236"></a>Finally, I put this to the noble Baroness. She says that these powers are conferred by treaty on the European Union by the nation states. If she cannot tell us how those powers are eventually to be returned, and if no powers ever have been returned, does this not confirm that we are dealing with a one-way ratchet? We are dealing with the acquis communautaire. The treaties, the protocol on subsidiarity and all the rest confirm that once a power has been passed, it cannot be given back without unanimity in the Council, which is unrealistic. I do not think that it helps to say that these are merely conferred powers.</p>

As we move forward with the European Union of 27 member states, and begin to think about how it is going to operate in the future, one of the interesting points in the treaty is the recognition&#151;whether or not it has been recognised before&#151;that powers could be returned if that were most appropriate.

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="0805123000240"></a>My mind has been set to the question of what competence really means. It is defined in the 10th EU Committee report, where there is an excellent piece on the whole issue of competences which answers most of the questions. It is clear that competence defines certain areas in which the EU institutions have conferred on them by member states the powers&#151;if they were to use them and if the processes, whether vetoed, unanimous procedures or procedures that could not be vetoed, were launched&#151;to make laws and regulations and interest themselves in these areas. I notice that in the excellent report from our committee, Professor Chalmers said that there was,</p>
<ul><a name="0805123000301"></a>&#147;nothing in the Lisbon treaty which would prevent or limit the European Court of Justice from extending competences from the base established by the Lisbon Treaty&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805123000266"></a>We are on the edge of a very fuzzy, permeable line. It is right that, as parliamentarians, we should seek to get a little more precision into the limits which ought to circumscribe the use of power by those who hold it. </p>

<a name="80512-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="0805123000241"></a>Beyond that, I was pleased to hear the noble Baroness talk about the provisions for transferring back certain competences. She was asked which competences. She did not immediately have an answer from the past and, by definition, we obviously do not have an answer from the future yet. But that is the spirit. That is what many of us have been asking for all along&#151;let us look in the 21st century at all the powers that piled up in the EU institutions during the 20th century. Let us re-examine them and see those that need unravelling, the acquis that needs unscrambling and the possibilities of decentralisation in an age of decentralisation, the reassertion of the democratic national parliaments as the anchor elements in the entire structure of the European Union. Let us look at those things, work on them and make suggestions about them.</p>

I hope that that will be useful. In my zeal to do so, however, I should point out that the group includes Amendment No. 80, which unfortunately it should not, so I shall not speak to it. If other noble Lords agree, I will endeavour to do so later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08051213000003"></a>Amendments Nos. 29A and 29B are not wrecking amendments but follow very closely the arguments that were pursued in the other place, in particular those of Philip Hammond and Vince Cable on the alteration of the wording on competition. Amendment No. 32A deals with the internal market. We have the benefit of a European Union Select Committee report, <I>The Single Market: Wallflower or Dancing Partner?</I>, to which I shall refer in a moment. Amendment No. 39 deals with customs co-operation; Amendments Nos. 62 to 64 deal with state aid, competition and warnings on economic policy; Amendment No. 71 deals with common commercial policy; Amendment No. 72 deals with intellectual property and foreign direct investment; and Amendment No. 163 refers back to Amendments Nos. 29A and 29B.</p>

<a name="80512-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08051213000004"></a>I recall that, back in 2000, the Lisbon strategy set out its aim of making the European Union,</p>
<ul><a name="08051213000115"></a>&#147;the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world ... by 2010&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051213000085"></a>so it is a good moment to work out where we are today and what this treaty will do in taking us to that goal. I regret to say that, as we look across the European Union today, we find a shaky, diverse economy. The nation states in the eurozone, which are forced to have the same interest rates, are suffering to varying degrees from that situation. The Minister may seek to persuade us otherwise, but an immediate case cannot be evolved for the management of the economy to move to Brussels. Certainly so far as the treaty is concerned, there are signs that the nations that agreed to the treaty have decided to move in that direction.</p>

<a name="80512-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08051213000005"></a>What do I mean? I am talking about free trade and open markets. I have always regarded those markets as crucial to creating an outward-looking Europe that can compete on the global economic world stage. It is sad that, in the treaty, there is so little about the single market and helping us to achieve those open markets. There is plenty in the treaty about EU values, but nothing about what was, after all, a founding principle of the European Union.</p>

The one good thing in the treaty&#151;the clause allowing free and undistorted competition&#151;was struck

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="08051213000105"></a>&#147;Competition is now just a means, not an end in itself. This opens the way to a different jurisprudence, one that favours European champions and brings a true industrial policy&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051213000087"></a>He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="08051213000106"></a>&#147;We have obtained a major reorientation of the objectives of the Union&#148;.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="08051213000107"></a>&#147;Competition is no longer an EU objective or an end in itself ... The word &#145;protection&#146; is no longer taboo&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051213000089"></a>I hope that the Minister will explain why the Government agreed to that deletion. Peter Mandelson has already responded in strong terms. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="08051213000108"></a>&#147;Competition is how we keep our markets efficient and dynamic; keep prices low for the consumers and maintain innovation. Competition is a source of creativity. Without it, our economies would stagnate&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051213000090"></a>I agree with Mr Mandelson, but why don&#146;t the Government?</p>

<a name="80512-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08051213000007"></a>Why are the objectives of full employment and social progress now going to have a higher legal status under European law than free competition? What has caused the Government to agree to this move? We need to know. I recall Commissioner Mario Monti, seen as one of the great prophets of competition, responding:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="08051213000109"></a>&#147;If this goes through, it&#146;s the first step towards disintegration&#148;.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="08051213000110"></a>&#147;I am deeply surprised that the British are allowing this to happen&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051213000092"></a>Well, so I am and I think that the Minister has to give us an explanation.</p>

<a name="80512-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08051213000008"></a>I read in the press at the time that our Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, had &#147;hit the roof&#148; when he heard about the concession on the Sarkozy clause. The <I>Sunday Times</I> said that the Prime Minister &#147;went ballistic&#148; when he heard. From the plethora of memoirs at the moment, we are led to believe that that is a frequent occurrence. However, I am particularly concerned about this instance. If the Minister is going to tell us that very little has changed, why did the Prime Minister go ballistic?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08051213000009"></a>There is so much else that I could deal with, but I want to try to conclude my remarks. However, I will say that, on this occasion, I am looking for support from my noble friend Lord Dykes, as much of what I have said was echoed in the other place by Vince Cable, who said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051213000116"></a>&#147;the concession made by the British Government ... is rather damaging ... the concession represents a step backwards in political terms, and that is why we have tabled some amendments to ensure that that aspect of the treaty is monitored as it proceeds&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051213000093"></a>Sadly, his colleagues in this House did not table amendments. However, I have and these are those amendments. Vince Cable continued:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><a name="08051213000094"></a>I look forward to hearing whether my noble friend Lord Dykes will support Vince Cable&#146;s amendment. I am particularly attracted by Amendment No. 29B,

<ul><a name="08051213000117"></a>&#147;before each House of Parliament a report setting out the arrangements under the Treaty for securing an open market economy and requiring free and undistorted competition throughout the European Union&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051213000095"></a>What could be less wrecking than that? All it requires is for the Government to focus on what they have done&#151;or is it what they have not done? Perhaps they should have focused a little bit more on the effect of what has happened in the treaty.</p>

<a name="80512-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08051213000010"></a>The protocol, no doubt the Minister will say, should do much to reassure us. However, there has already been extensive debate in this House about the difference between what is in the protocol and what is in the treaty. I am concerned about the changes that have taken place. I hope that the Minister will explain why she supports them.</p>

<a name="80512-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08051213000011"></a>We also have the report of our European Union Committee on the single market. Much of what it says is very worrying. On page 19, paragraph 59 states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="08051213000112"></a>&#147;We believe that the Single Market has great potential to deliver benefits to consumers and businesses, and yet, despite its impressive record, its future appears at risk. We are concerned that the momentum behind the Single Market has been weakened. We therefore call on the Government and the Commission to instil a sense of urgency into the review of the Single Market&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051213000096"></a>On page 20, paragraph 71 continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="08051213000113"></a>&#147;The Minister for Europe assured the Committee that the removal of the words free and undistorted competition from the text of the Reform Treaty had not led, and would not lead, to a change in policy ... We call for a renewed commitment to the importance of competition and the need to complete the Single Market for the benefit of consumers and businesses alike&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80512-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08051213000012"></a>We also need to hear from the Government about the effect on customs co-operation, state aid and common commercial policy. How will this affect our ability to continue to secure for our Commonwealth partners their rightful historic concessions? Over the years, these have slowly diminished in their effect, but they are still vital. We need to know what the Government will do under the new provisions to continue to secure them.</p>

<a name="80512-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08051213000013"></a>On Amendment No. 64, can the Government say who is going to define the warnings on economic policy? Who is going to be the arbiter? Who is going to set the benchmark against which nations will be judged? No doubt the Minister will seek to reassure us on intellectual property and foreign direct investment, too.</p>

<a name="80512-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08051213000014"></a>I hope that the Minister is happy that I should have brought together so many amendments in one debate. I hope that she will be able to respond to all the questions that I have raised and to all the amendments. I beg to move.</p>

It was not only Peter Mandelson who spoke out against it; my noble friend Lord Brittan&#151;with whom I do not always agree on  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_838"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column 838</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>European affairs, although he is a good friend of mine&#151;also spoke out strongly against this change being allowed. It was also roundly and firmly condemned by the <I>Financial Times</I>, which, in general, is supportive of the Government&#146;s policy.</p>

<a name="80512-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08051213000016"></a>The removal of the words to which my noble friend referred is seen as a big reversal for competition policy. As everyone in the Committee knows, it has always been an objective of French economic policy to get this power in Brussels modified so that the strain of French policy that has always favoured the backing of national champions could continue. Those of my noble friends and noble Lords opposite who heard the speech of President Sarkozy in the Royal Gallery will remember that when he spoke about competition he referred to it being accompanied by support for national champions.</p>

<a name="80512-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08051213000017"></a>In this country and in other parts of Europe, we have got used to there being a strong competition authority in Brussels to police the internal market and to ensure that there is no backsliding to the long-past, long-discredited era of subsidies and backing national champions. Alas, in recent years, there has been some evidence that Governments in Europe are increasingly resisting the powers of the Commission. Noble Lords may remember that, after the troubles at Soci&#233;t&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale, the French Minister of Finance declared that the French Government would not let the bank be taken over by another European bank or another bank from elsewhere. It was only when Brussels started making some noises that that was not within the power of the French Government that they decided to say that they had never said this at all. Similarly, there were instances in Spain where, in contested bids for companies in the energy sector, the Spanish Government indicated that they did not wish the full flow of market forces to have effect.</p>

<a name="80512-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08051213000018"></a>The amendment that my noble friend has put down is extremely important. These powers are needed more than ever today because of the way in which Europe has been slipping away from what we call the internal market, which is always said by the Government and others to be the great achievement of the European Union. Nobody would applaud the internal market more than me. However, I have heard it declared many times that the internal market has been completed, whereas it is never completed but goes on and on. Anybody who knows anything about takeovers in the financial sector with countries such as Germany knows that the internal market is not the reality that people always claim that it is. The removal of the powers at the centre of the European Union to police competition and to ensure the full play of market forces is extremely important. I put it to the Government that it is a most retrograde step that the treaty was altered in this way. I strongly support the amendment of my noble friend.</p>

I have to ask the Minister whether she still believes that that is the vaguest of possibilities when we consider the emerging economies of China, India, Brazil, Russia and so on.</p>

<a name="80512-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08051213000020"></a>One has only to look at the European Union&#146;s financial services action plan, a group of some 41 directives that appear to be aimed at making the City of London uncompetitive with the rest of the world. If that is not a deliberate aim, it will certainly be the effect. If the Minister and her advisers have not seen it, I suggest that they look at Open Europe&#146;s analysis of the financial services action plan, <I>Selling the City Short</I>, which analyses all those directives: the market abuse directive, which we certainly do not need, as we can do it ourselves, the markets in financial instruments directive, the prospectus directive and so on. Open Europe, which we have prayed in aid before in these proceedings and on the whole found to be extremely accurate, estimates the cash cost of implementing these regulations at some &#163;23 billion over the next three or four years. But it is the knock-on effect from this regulatory atmosphere that is already beginning to drive valuable businesses in the City overseas.</p>

<a name="80512-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08051213000021"></a>Through its competition policy and its economic policy generally, the European Union imposes the Franco-German social and labour model on the rest of us. This does not suit the United Kingdom; it suits us less than anyone else. As I have mentioned before, only some 10 per cent of our economy trades with the single market, another 10 per cent, roughly, trades with the world outside the single market and 80 per cent stays here in the domestic economy. That gives the lie to our Europhile friends who constantly tell us that, if we were not in the European Union, we would have to obey its regulations but we would not be able to take part in making them. The 9 or 10 per cent of our economy that trades with the European Union would indeed have to obey the rules set by the single market just as, if one is selling a motor car to the United States of America, it helps to put the steering wheel on the left. It is precisely that analogy.</p>

<a name="80512-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08051213000022"></a>The overregulation of the single market has been recognised by Competition Commissioner Verheugen, who, about a year ago, put the cost of EU regulation at some 6.5 per cent of GDP. That is a colossal figure and higher than figures that have been produced by various British analyses of our position in relation to the single market. It is not just the rabid Eurosceptics who are saying this. No less a body than the Conseil d&#146;Analyse Economique, the top French economic think tank, which reports directly to the French Prime Minister, said some 18 months ago that the single market had done nothing for the French economy. It also said that the euro had done nothing positive for the French economy. It is true that this institute, having carried out this accurate analysis to say why the single market had done nothing for the French economy, went on to say that of course the answer is &#147;more Europe&#148;. It is at that point that we Eurosceptics part company.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08051213000023"></a>In conclusion, it gives me great pleasure to agree with your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on the European Union when it says that the future of the single market appears at risk. I very much hope that it

I merely pointed out that, if 23 people out of 24 are on the whole passionately in favour of the project of European integration and only one is fairly strongly against it, it would not be human unless that committee produced a report that was favourable to such integration and not favourable in the other way. I hope that that does not impugn the integrity of anyone and I certainly would not want to impugn the integrity of its chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, of whom I am extremely fond.</p>

I begin by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, on a skilful speech in which he cleverly mentioned the key point&#151;that there is a legally binding protocol&#151;at only the very end. Everything that has been said would stand. It is perhaps a pity that we no longer have the wording about the free and undistorted competition as one of the constitutional treaty&#146;s objectives. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt said, and he is always an honest man, there is this legally binding protocol to the treaty of Lisbon which ensures that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051213000118"></a>&#147;the internal market ... includes a system ensuring that competition is not distorted&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051213000097"></a>That is the key quote. The protocol says that the single EU market, which is a clear objective in Article 3 of the new treaty, includes a system ensuring undistorted competition. There are references to competition in the existing treaties, and they all remain in Articles 4, 27, 34, 81, 89, 91, 96, 98, 105 and 157. The idea that competition has somehow been wiped away from the whole of the European Union is way over the top, and is not true. When this legislation goes through, the legal position in relation to competition will remain unchanged.</p>

It is exactly the same question that the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, put earlier to the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan. What is the point of doing this if it does not make any difference? Is he sure, and can he assure the Committee, that when a case comes before the Court of Justice it will not use the fact that free and undistorted competition has been taken out of the main body of the treaty and put in a protocol at the back as an indication of intention for its judgment?</p>

The French may take a different view, but that is what has been incorporated in the treaty.

I stress that in any one period there are a large number of decisions, not just the important ones on competition issues that we need to have taken in order to protect the free market. The consequence of the large number of decisions, many of which are directed to one country only, is that they are mostly short-lived because action is taken, but generally there are six to 10 times more decisions in a year than there are directives in the European Union. In consequence, a large number of them are withdrawn. Those who quote figures about legislative Acts might bear in mind what a large number are withdrawn; for example, in 2006, 943 European legislative Acts&#151;that is, directives, regulations and decisions&#151;were repealed, withdrawn or expired, and 532 of those were decisions. As a matter of interest, because I am sure we can put anything into the debates here, in 2006, 264 Council decisions were adopted while 296 decisions expired or were withdrawn or repealed, so the net effect in 2006 was minus 32 decisions from the Council. We have to be careful how we handle this issue to continue benefiting from the competition rules, and we want to see those fully carried forward in the Lisbon treaty.</p>

Those, at least in the shape of the Common Market, have been part of the European Union since its foundation. Before we nod these changes in the treaty through, however, we need to consider whether they take those two institutions in the right direction and whether we are close to the point where they may no longer be acting in our best interests. One has to compare anything that is bound up in these treaty structures with the alternatives of simply adopting a system of free trade and free capital movement. We may be moving in the wrong direction because the treaty&#151;as we have heard from its objectives, which introduce the objective of a social market economy&#151;is moving the regulations and apparatus of the single market further away from free trade and free competition and closer to the objectives of a protectionist, high-cost, uncompetitive market structure that may not be in our best interests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08051213000035"></a>We no longer have dedication to liberal markets in the European Union. The movement towards a social market, as opposed to a liberal market, is an explicit adoption of a political philosophy that ends up producing harmonisation by legislation and regulation that is not always intended to achieve the most competitive outcome for our businesses and our competitive standing in the world. The alternative is to have harmonisation driven by market forces, by businesses adopting those standards and regulations that they believe it is in their interests to adopt to be able to sell in those markets that they want to sell in. Increasingly, those markets are not in the European Union but, by selling into those markets, our businesses are now burdened by the costs and regulations imposed by this protectionist market in Europe. We are reaching the point where the balance of costs from the single market, as it has evolved, is too high. A number of noble Lords have mentioned aspects of that. The City of London is an

We are reaching the point where we need to take stock of whether further moves in the direction that this treaty takes us in, towards a social-market view of the single market, are in our interests.</p>

<a name="80512-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08051213000036"></a>Similarly, the customs union has increasingly become a protectionist vehicle, where deals which we might have done and supported to open up free trade to benefit third-world countries as well as our own economy have been blocked because of the CAP hostage that the European Union has put as a blockage to any further trade liberalisation. Again, this is not necessarily in our interests. While I understand the point that will be made&#151;that the customs union and the single market are, in essence, part of the foundation of the European Union and are not introduced by this treaty&#151;we need to consider that the changes this treaty is bringing about, and the objectives that it puts into the European Union in the operation of those aspects of the Union, are taking us in the wrong direction. It is, at best, a missed opportunity for the Government not to use this treaty to try to get those reforms. At worst, it takes us in a direction that may be very damaging for the UK.</p>

When I began in this business 30 years ago I never thought it would be possible for UK governmental regulatory software to be used by the French Government. Such things are quite normal now. They are stimulated by the EU. Talk to businesspeople, scientists and technologists across Europe about this world we are in, and the difference in attitudes is extreme.</p>

We are grateful for what he did in the clustering of the amendments, because the clustering was re-formed, if I remember rightly, following the change in the list. We are also grateful for the fact that the Conservative Opposition are withdrawing amendments, or reducing their number occasionally, to try to speed up the process, which we need to do in Committee. It is necessary to register that point.</p>

<a name="80512-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08051213000043"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Williamson, or another noble Lord, may have said that this was not a wrecking amendment. In a way, it is the first one of this kind. We understand the natural enthusiasm of the Conservative Benches for open competition and free markets. That is axiomatic. Indeed, an aspiration to, and affection for, that philosophy is shared in all parts of the Committee. The tone has changed and I welcome that. The previous kind of amendment was not so much in that category. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, quite rightly said, the Liberal Democrats proposed a particular amendment because the anxiety over President Sarkozy&#146;s intervention was enormous at the time, and it was necessary to make sure that that was clarified. It has been partly clarified in quite a positive way, but perhaps not quite enough. We need further clarification when the noble Baroness the Lord President has time to refer to it tonight.</p>

<a name="80512-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08051213000044"></a>Coming to the main point of the amendments, I do not find it easy to understand the anxieties that have been expressed by certain Members. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, in his own words, referred to Mario Monti as one of the people who was, perhaps, a bit difficult on this score, from the general British viewpoint in this area. We remember a previous, far nobler episode when, at the time the Labour Government were new, Mario Monti was the Commissioner who insisted that duty free be abolished. There was ferocious opposition from British sources, including large corporations in Kent and elsewhere, who said that 100,000 jobs would be lost in Kent if duty free was abolished. Germany supported from behind with less strength. The British led that campaign to keep duty free. A more restrictive practice I cannot think of. We proudly did that and many people supported it. The Conservative Party was enthusiastically trying to make sure that Mario Monti was defeated. With enormous courage, he stuck to his guns and insisted that duty free be abolished. We saw the benefits of that process. It did not in any way dent the ability of each member state to charge its own indirect taxes, levies and duties on alcohol and other goods.</p>

<a name="80512-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08051213000045"></a>It goes to show that there is always a package of aspirations and impressions, does it not? Some countries have good examples and bad; we all have good examples and bad. The other countries quite

British Ministers in the previous Conservative Government used to say repeatedly that one could not, in essence, have a real single internal market without a single currency. That is the reality for those counties that had the courage to join the euro, which they have done with increasing success. You can tell because it is mentioned less and less in British newspapers, which is always the yardstick of success.</p>

<a name="80512-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08051213000046"></a>On these Benches we recognise that, in practice, the primacy of Community competition law inevitably restricts the ability of member states to legislate for additional competition and controls. In cases where those controls may directly or indirectly affect interstate trade within the market, that is an important part of the panoply of the European Commission&#146;s powers. I hope that the British national Parliament, in both its Houses, will make sure that it continues to support the Commission in creating that Europe-wide competition and, indeed, in ensuring that international competition spreads beyond the boundaries of the EU itself. After all, we are the major supporter of this much more active and effective competition policy under Wim Kok, and Lisbon mark 1 and mark 2, which are reinforced.</p>

<a name="80512-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08051213000047"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, that the idea that the European economy is not successful is absurd. It is very successful in many ways. Unfortunately we only have 110 kilometres of high-speed track. Even Spain is now aiming for 10,000 kilometres by 2014. France already has 7,000. There are many examples either way, some initiated by the state sector. The first very successful people carrier on the Continent was the French Renault Espace, which was produced by a public sector corporation. So the idea that one has to be ideological about all these points is incorrect. However, we need a very strong internal market and we welcome the opportunity for the noble Baroness the Lord President to explain the Sarkozy syndrome to us again.</p>

During those four years we knew when we had won an argument and when we had not. I agree that some victories are not clear cut. In the War of the Spanish Succession, Ramillies and Bleinheim were clearly profound victories, Oudenarde and Malplaquet were more doubtful. But nobody has ever suggested that the Battle of Waterloo was other than a victory, even if Prince Bl1/4cher sought to persuade Wellington in the picture that looked down on President Sarkozy when he made the speech to which my noble friend Lord Lamont referred, that the title should be changed to the name of the pub, the Belle Alliance, in which Napoleon ran his campaign during the battle and which is in the background of the picture.

How can the position which we were defending as we went into that meeting&#151;like the Duke on a ridge in front of the village of Waterloo&#151;have been reinforced by making the concession that we did?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08051213000055"></a>I shall deal with the amendments in order to ensure that I cover them all. Amendment No. 29A has two parts. The first relates to the confirmation that the Union has exclusive competence to establish competition rules. Noble Lords will know that this competence is not new; it simply confirms the current position. By definition, rules necessary for the operation of the internal market&#151;an EU-wide market regulated at EU level&#151;must be an exclusive competence of the EU. If rules necessary for the operation could be set aside, it is hard to see how it would function effectively. The reason there has not been a change in terms of the single market in this amending treaty is because we believe that the arrangements and the rules that are staying in force are appropriate and good and there is  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_847"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column 847</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>no need to tinker with them. We believe that our access to the single market makes the UK such an attractive destination for investment. With that access comes certain common rules that are necessary for the functioning of the single market. Competition rules are among the most fundamental of such essential rules. As noble Lords will know, that does not mean that the whole area of competition law is an exclusive competence. The UK can, and does, set additional competition rules for other purposes that do not obstruct the operation of the EU&#146;s rules.</p>

Can the noble Baroness tell us why we would be any worse off if we had a simple free trade agreement with the single market as opposed to being in the Customs Union that is a single market?

From his perspective the noble Lord sees that that is an adequate and appropriate relationship with other member states. That is his opinion. In the opinion of the Government and, I think, that of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat Front Benches, and probably that of many Members who have had the privilege and pleasure of being involved in the European Union, it is much more than that. The noble Lord believes that that is as far as he wishes to go and, indeed, his political party would say so. That is for them to put forward. The Government&#146;s contention is that the EU brings much greater benefits, not least, as we mentioned in earlier discussions and will do so again, in terms far beyond simply trade; for example, in terms of how we tackle some of the big issues that face our countries such as climate change. The noble Lord and I differ on that principle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08051213000058"></a>The second part of the amendment concerns the publishing of the report. The European Commission publishes its annual report on competition policy which we ensure is deposited with explanatory memorandum for scrutiny by the relevant European Committee of both Houses of Parliament. We do not as a matter of policy comment on the competition enforcement activities of independent competition authorities, be they at national or European Union level. It is important that they are able to carry out their function free from political interference. I hope that the noble Lord will consider that I have addressed that amendment.</p>

Noble Lords identified the importance of President Sarkozy&#146;s position in this regard and the importance of the change that was made within the treaty. First, negotiations are negotiations. Many noble Lords present this evening and in the House overall have been involved in negotiations and will know that they are a give and take process in which it is often important to look at the domestic

The second element to a negotiation is to look at what would be the impact of that negotiated position. As I said in response to an Oral Question by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, I cannot read President Sarkozy&#146;s mind but I know that in putting forward his own negotiating position he will be very mindful of his domestic position. That is what Heads of Government must always be aware of. Therefore, I presume that the President of France put forward a proposition that he felt would find favour, and which he has subsequently said does not have legal force. I believe those were his words. I promised that I would not quote overseas leaders but I think that is a particularly relevant symbolic comment. I believe that the President of France made a symbolic gesture without legal force that was important in terms of his domestic circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08051213000060"></a>The response of the UK Government and the other member states involved will be to look at what is being proposed and assess its relevance and importance in terms of what was being negotiated. As the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, and other noble Lords said, this is a very important aspect of the functioning of the European Union and of the Lisbon treaty. As noble Lords will know, we considered carefully the other articles to which my noble friend Lord Radice referred: articles 4, 27, 34, 81 to 89, 96, 98, 105 and 157, where references to competition remain as they were. We will also have looked at the protocol strongly supported by the then-Prime Minister Mr Blair and the now-Prime Minister Mr Brown. I have no idea whether Mr Brown was upset, but I know that he supported fully the ambition of getting a protocol.</p>

It is a consequence of what happened. The point that I was moving on to is, having got that, it is important to see what the effect of what is being put forward would have.

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08051213000064"></a>The question for the Government is simple. President Sarkozy has put forward a proposition for his own reasons. I do not pretend to suggest that I want to interpret them. Having put forward that proposal, which is important to the President of France, the responsibility of the UK Government is to consider whether it has an impact on the functioning of the European Union and national interest. Looking at the treaty, taking the right kind of legal opinion, it is clear that it does not. Noble Lords might have preferred to have the original text within the treaty but the bigger question for the Government is whether it makes any difference. The answer is no.</p>

<a name="80512-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08051213000065"></a>Therefore, in the spirit of negotiation, it is reasonable for the UK Government to say that, provided we have all the other articles and the legally binding protocol, we believe that the position remains as it did. That is the position that the Government took and stand by.</p>

<a name="80512-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08051213000066"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 63, which seeks to introduce co-decision for the proposals to address distortions in competition. We support that shift and we believe that it is important to involve the European Parliament in the process. It adds to democratic accountability and transparency.</p>

<a name="80512-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08051213000067"></a>Amendment No. 62 relates to EU state aid rules intended to ensure fair competition and a single common market. Noble Lords know that the rules prevent state aid that would seriously distort competition. It is not in the UK&#146;s interest. We should have to notify all UK aid to and seek approval from the Commission before the aid could be given, not least because that could result in a delay of up to a year and hold up aid being given to small-scale projects that are unlikely to distort competition.</p>

<a name="80512-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08051213000068"></a>Amendment No. 64 refers to the promotion of structural reform, the core of the Lisbon agenda which the UK has championed since 2000, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral. Those treaty provisions introduced by Maastricht set a framework by which member states can co-ordinate their economic policies in order to boost competitiveness and productivity, which is a UK interest. The Lisbon treaty makes only limited changes to that framework. It retains the existing provisions for the co-ordination of economic policies by Ministers within the Council. That ensures that it is the member states themselves that remain responsible for their economic policy. It allows the Commission to address a warning to a member state on the same grounds on which the Council can address recommendations. It is an extra procedural step but a warning carries no legal force. It is another route by which our common approach to achieving economic reform could be held up to the light and examined.</p>

<a name="80512-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08051213000069"></a>Amendment No. 32A refers to the confirmation in the Lisbon treaty of the fact that the single market is a shared competence. In order for the single market to operate effectively it is essential that some activities are managed at EU level to make sure that we have coherence, fairness and transparency. Amendment

There is nothing new in customs co-operation. We participated in it before we joined the European Union. We carry out important co-operation work with member states and the Commission. As the noble Lord will know, that is to do with money laundering, counterfeit goods and illegal meat products. Those are important areas in which we would wish to continue to be involved.</p>

I am particularly grateful to my noble friend Lord Lamont for pointing out once again that there is some evidence that Governments are resisting the Commission&#146;s competition policy. He instanced in particular France and Spain, and a number of my other noble friends have given other examples. I certainly agree with my noble friend Lord Blackwell that we are probably looking at more than a missed opportunity&#151;it is an indication that things are moving in the wrong direction. My noble friend Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville told us about the Napoleonic war, which the noble Baroness referred to as &#147;a classical education&#148;. It was a classic example of exactly what we have been talking about; I agree with that. My noble friend Lord Forsyth instanced a number of questions that were aimed really at the Liberal Democrat Benches, and I shall come to that in a moment.</p>

My concern is with the provisions that are no longer there and the replacement with the protocol which I was just referring to the noble Lord, Lord Radice. I cannot agree with the noble Lord, Lord Pearson. I think that he has already identified me as a Euro-enthusiast, which in his view is a derogatory term.

He said that the problem with Amendment No. 29B was that it would impose a hurdle. What is the nature of the hurdle? It is that the report must be approved by affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament. To a bureaucrat, that is a hurdle. To a democrat that is exactly what should happen. What is the point of being in this House if we do not from time to time affirm important resolutions? I find his comment slightly mysterious; no doubt he will explain it to me in greater detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08051213000081"></a>What lies behind this debate is the worry&#151;a deep sense of foreboding&#151;that it is not exactly just symbolic. Charlie McCreevy, the Commissioner for the single market, recently said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051213000121"></a>&#147;in reality, many countries give lip-service to open and free competition&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051213000101"></a>I agreed with the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, on financial services, because we urgently need in that arena a more efficient and integrated market. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, I want to consider Amendment No. 29A, which has no mention of a hurdle. On an area on which I think all sides have reflected concern, it merely says that the Secretary of State should report annually to Parliament,</p>
<ul><a name="08051213000122"></a>&#147;on the operation and application of European Union competition policy according to the principle set out in the Protocol on the Internal Market and Competition&#148;&#151;</ul>

Since then, a proud industry has been decimated. This is particularly true in regard to the management of fish and marine stocks around these islands. It is incontrovertible that, so far as conservation of marine biological resources is concerned, if the common fisheries policy has existed at all, it has been an unmitigated disaster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08051217000009"></a>When debating this issue in another place, my honourable friend Bill Wiggin pointed out that the Minister had affirmed that the EU competence on marine biological resources and fishing derived from Article 102 of the UK treaty of accession, which said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051217000088"></a>&#147;the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, shall determine conditions for fishing with a view to ensuring protection of the fishing grounds and conservation of the biological resources of the sea&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051217000084"></a>Until now, that is the sole text to which the UK Government have signed up. This wording was found to be unclear, and a ruling passed by the European Court of Justice in 1979 said that:</p>

Between the six-mile and the 12-mile limits of our territorial waters, the rules have to be acceptable to all member states. Defra has the responsibility for policing the area, and this is where it can impose its own regulations on British fishermen, but not on the vessels of other member states who have not given agreement. The type of thing that happens is that British fishermen, if they catch crabs that are below a certain size, have to put them back. However, if the

After this treaty, will this derogation be renewed under the codecision procedure or by the Council of Ministers? Whichever, it is bound to be an open question as to what new rules will be agreed under a regime that is founded on unrestricted access to the seas. Surely, when asked to clarify our treaties, we should consider going back to the original document before we sign up to any rewording of the provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08051217000012"></a>The proponents of this treaty tell us that they wish to bring clarity to all European arrangements. In this case, clarity consists of adding to the heading of Article 1, Title II, which is &#147;Agriculture&#148;, the words &#147;and Fisheries&#148;, and then going on to codify the powers in Article 2, paragraph 12, Articles 2B and 2C, by saying that in the area of conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy, the Union will have exclusive competence. The treaty goes on to say that the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy will be areas of shared competence. So much for increased clarity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08051217000013"></a>Does the Minister know what marine biological resources do not come under the common fisheries policy? Is it oil or something else? He will be aware that when an amendment on this topic was discussed recently in the other place, MPs who know the fishing industry&#151;Members of all parties&#151;expressed dismay at this allocation of competences. They all know that, at a time when it has been found in most countries that the success of the fishing industry is highly dependent on having reasonably local control, our Government have been prepared to sign a treaty which amounts to a power grab by the European Union of the management for all time of our considerable marine resources.</p>

<a name="80512-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08051217000014"></a>Anyone would think that the UK would be in a very strong position when it comes to discussing fishing. Within the EU, some 70 per cent of fish landed come from within our 200-mile fisheries limits, although only 12 per cent are landed by British boats. The Minister will be aware of the importance of fishing to the Scottish economy. I believe that 65 per cent of fish landed come ashore in Scotland. Under the devolution settlement, Scotland administers the area of sea from Scotland out to the six-mile limit, but it is the control of the highly productive area between six miles and 12 miles that raises most concern and is the responsibility of Defra. Unless the UK is prepared to take a very strong stand on the issues in this area, one can see why the Scottish Executive will be demanding to take the prime negotiating responsibility in any future negotiations on the CFP. Even the European Parliament&#146;s Committee on Fisheries voted against the proposal in the treaty. The committee stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051217000089"></a>&#147;within the context of the other exclusive competences of the EU which are detailed in the draft Constitution, the inclusion of the conservation of marine biological resources is anomalous and unjustified&#148;.</ul>

Fishing is bound to be an area of great interest and importance regarding marine biological resources, but there are many other areas, of course. What effects will these powers have on the Government&#146;s much vaunted marine Bill? It really looks as if all the questions of special protection areas and marine reserves will be dealt with at the say-so of Brussels. There will be spillover into permits for the abstraction of minerals. It looks as if, unless some other directive intervenes, the only areas on which we will have sole competence are the quality of the water and, possibly, leaving minerals undisturbed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08051217000016"></a>What will the standing of the six regional advisory committees for fishing be? They have recently been set up and have been seen as a reasonable step towards resolving some of these issues on the waters around England.</p>

<a name="80512-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08051217000017"></a>The main part of the common fisheries policy that has destroyed any credibility in its efforts at conservation has been the total allowable catch regime and the inevitable consequence of discards. The latest EU publication on this topic gives figures of the discards of flat fish in certain areas by beam trawlers at an estimated 70 per cent by weight and 80 per cent by number. Overall, it is an estimate of five tonnes of fish discarded for every tonne landed. Where can one see conservation in that? Even then, the EU has to admit that its knowledge of discards in some areas is poor, let alone the lack of accurate information on the catches of foreign vessels within the six-mile to 12-mile area. No wonder the fishermen out at sea all the time reckon that they have a much more realistic estimate of the status of the stocks than that obtained from the official statistics.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08051217000018"></a>There is some comfort for us in the determination of the present Commissioner for the CFP that, by the end of his term of office in 2010, there should be a new regime on discards for all countries. However, the record so far does not give us grounds for great optimism. Can the Minister say if and when the UK reckons to be able to submit its proposals for meeting this deadline?</p>

<a name="80512-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08051217000019"></a>A properly managed and sustainable fishery is in the interests of all fishermen, and the fact that Britain should argue that it should manage its own fisheries does not mean that all the fishermen would have to be British. The only way that properly managed fisheries could be ensured would be to remove our waters from exclusive EU competence, as the amendment proposes. The only other solution would be an insistence on having the same powers that we have for six miles extended uniformly to 12 miles in the next EU derogation. But I think that we would have to wait an awfully long time before we could expect that concession. I beg to move.</p>

That seems pretty straightforward. Biological resources clearly do not

We on these Benches would support the status quo. I was for five years on the European Parliament&#146;s fisheries committee, which it was good of him to mention. We were very clear about these issues of where the current treaties and practice actually stood.</p>

<a name="80512-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08051217000021"></a>It is absolutely right that the common fisheries policy does not work. That issue is not one of biological resources. The Conservative Government in 1973 overwhelmingly handed a huge proportion of their allocation of channel stocks to the French and the Belgians. During their most recent period of government the Conservatives made no effort whatever to change the common fisheries policy, much to the dismay of other colleagues of mine in the European Parliament. I am delighted that the Conservatives are now repentant and that they have changed their minds on that policy&#151;and that we might have from their Front Bench an apology for the misallocation that started back in the 1970s.</p>

<a name="80512-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08051217000022"></a>Yes, the common fisheries policy needs to be radically changed and needs to become a regionally managed policy that involves not one member state and its national territorial waters, but nation states around natural fish stock areas. It is clear that renationalisation of the seas does not work. We have marine biological resources&#151;mainly, but not exclusively, fish&#151;that strangely do not have passports, despite e-borders programmes. They go from one national territory, sea or EEZ to another without any hindrance whatever. We can control our fish stocks as tightly as we might wish to nationally, but when the fish cross a boundary, another member state can take those fish stocks. That is why regional management around areas such as the channel, the North Sea and the Irish Sea is the basis on which the common fisheries policy should change, not the principle of a common biological resource.</p>

<a name="80512-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08051217000023"></a>One of the things clear to me in terms of my fisheries work was that the states and regimes particularly successful at fisheries included New Zealand and Iceland, which had exclusive control and sovereignty over a continental shelf. That is not physically possible in the countries of the European Union, but we can get somewhere towards that if we have&#151;as we have had since we joined the European Economic Community in 1973&#151;at least a basis on which we can change the common fisheries policy to something far more satisfactory. To move it back to a sort of exclusively national regime would be a disaster for the fishing industry generally. I absolutely agree that we need to keep control of coastal waters and I am sure that that derogation will be renewed in the future, as it has been in the past. It is in the interests of all member states to do that.</p>

<a name="80512-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08051217000024"></a>Therefore, from these Benches we see no problem with the status quo as it is described now, but I absolutely welcome the Conservative Party&#146;s determination to change fundamentally the common fisheries policy. It is a pity that they never lifted a finger to do so in their last Administration.</p>

That seems a rather odd position to be in.</p>

<a name="80512-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08051217000026"></a>I remember being on the Environment and Agriculture Sub-Committee, Sub-Committee D. We studied the common fisheries policy on several occasions. I remember members of the committee and the Opposition making passionate speeches about how dreadful the policy was. We had evidence from fishermen whose livelihoods were being taken away from them by the provisions of the common fisheries policy. I think that everyone agreed about it then, as they seem to now. The noble Duke who moved the amendment made that clear.</p>

<a name="80512-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08051217000027"></a>I was shocked to hear that discards seem to have gone up rather than down during the intervening period. I think that the general discards are something like 60 per cent of the total catch and I cannot believe that the Government believe in retaining or pursuing a policy where 60 per cent of the catch is thrown overboard or, as was said, where 5 tonnes are discarded for every one sold. That seems to be an absolute monstrosity.</p>

<a name="80512-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08051217000028"></a>Yet this policy is supported. It is not working but we do not want to change it, according to the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, because it is all part of the treaties and we should not have given it away anyway. Of course, I agree that we certainly should not have given our fisheries away. We managed them perfectly well before we handed them over to the European Union and, of course, countries manage their fisheries individually far better than the Union is able to do. Examples include Norway, Iceland and even Namibia, as well as New Zealand and Canada. They can manage their fisheries in an exemplary&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08051217000031"></a>The fact is that the common fisheries policy simply is not working, yet we seem to go along with it as part of the deal. There are passionate speeches made about how deplorable it is and Ministers make speeches saying that they do not agree with it, but it carries on and there is no sign of improvement. The Fisheries Commissioner may wish that things will change, but they do not seem to. Therefore, the amendment is definitely worth pursuing. If something is not working, why continue banging your head against a brick wall? Why not try to change and return to where we were, in control of our own fisheries? When we had a proper fishing industry, we could easily police our territorial

I am not persuaded by the arguments that, because we have handed over our fishing industry to the European Union, we should go on doing so even though it is not working. Everyone admits that it is not working, so why do we not change and do something different?</p>

<p><a name="st_156"></a>

Perhaps I may add an interesting statistic to the figures given by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, who estimated that for every tonne landed some 5 tonnes are discarded. Another way of putting that is that some 30,000 articulated lorriesful of dead fish are thrown back into the sea every year. That is about the measure of the problem; indeed, it is the lowest estimate that we have from the European Union. Other estimates put the figure at 50,000 articulated lorries, quite enough fish to fill the Palace of Westminster and the whole of Whitehall several times over&#151;and there must be a number of fishermen who have lost their livelihoods who might feel that that would be a more positive use of those premises.</p>

<a name="80512-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08051217000033"></a>The argument put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, that fish do not have passports and do not respect national boundaries does not work for the United Kingdom. I think that, the night before Edward Heath signed away our fisheries in a side agreement to the treaty of accession in 1972, we owned 70 per cent of the fish that swim all year round in European waters. Of course, that is why our dear partners-to-be in the European Union were so keen to get hold of them.</p>

<a name="80512-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08051217000034"></a>Again, Canada is not a good example. One has only to look at the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Norway to see how a fishery can be successfully managed by a democratic nation state on its own. The average take-home pay of a Faroe Islands fisherman has become &#163;45,000 a year under the islands&#146; policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08051217000035"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson and, I have no doubt, the Minister will say that the common fisheries policy requires radical change. I believe that the words &#147;and fisheries&#148; were added at the end of the heading on the common agricultural policy chapter in the Maastricht treaty. If you read on through the treaty as it was before those words were added, you will see that everything refers to agriculture&#151;merely &#147;and fisheries&#148; was added at Maastricht. Now, in the treaty of Lisbon, there is an attempt to adjust that by saying that any phrase that comes in that part of the treaty and sounds as though it is to do with agriculture also covers fisheries.</p>

<a name="80512-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08051217000036"></a>My question to the Minister is: why is it impossible to change this policy? Does it require unanimity? Can we not get a famous qualified majority vote? Who is it who opposes change to this scandalous policy? It must be one of the most destructive environmental policies on the planet, yet we are told that we need to be in the European Union to benefit from its environmental wisdom, weight in international negotiations and all the rest of it.</p>

<a name="80512-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08051217000037"></a>Is it true that the bureaucrats who designed this policy in the first place had never been to sea? They had probably never seen a ship, let alone a fish unless

Is it true that they did not realise that when the nets come up from the sea most of the fish in them are already dead? The attempt to practise conservation by limiting the number of fish that are landed in port was the mistake that caused the discards.</p>

<a name="80512-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08051217000038"></a>I trust that that was a refreshingly brief intervention, but the question remains: why cannot this policy be changed? How is it possible that the nations of the European Union cannot come together and make discards illegal, as is done in these other countries, and simply eat or otherwise use all the fish that we have taken out of the sea and which are dead? Why do we have to throw them back?</p>

That seems to be an unfair distribution of a resource which this country used to own absolutely and which, generally speaking, it fished well.

They have been allowed to fish when our own fishermen have been told to stay at home. As I know, because I have been down there and talked to them, fishermen in the south-west are sitting in their houses having been banned from fishing. They see Spanish fishermen catch the fish that they used to be able to catch but can no longer because of some bureaucratic decision made in Brussels. What sort of policy is that?

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08051217000047"></a>I am coming to an end but I should like to say something to the Conservative Front Bench. The Conservatives once had a very good idea. They said that the common fisheries policy was bad for our fishing industry and that when they got into government they would withdraw from it. Unfortunately, having said that they would withdraw from the policy, they then withdrew from that promise. If they examined the matter again and said, &#147;In spite of this treaty and in spite of what the article says, if we get back to power&#148;&#151;they can get back to power if they have the right policies&#151;&#147;we are going to take back our fishing waters&#148;, that would be very popular; I assure them that it would help the Conservatives a great deal in the south-west of England. I do not expect a reply tonight of course but I think that it is something on which the Conservatives should reflect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08051217000049"></a>The Lisbon treaty makes no changes to the competence of either member states or the Commission when it comes to fisheries. Community competence over fisheries is shared, except for conservation measures, where, as we have been told, it has been the exclusive competence of the Community since the UK&#146;s treaty of accession came fully into force in 1979. The treaty merely codifies this.</p>

<a name="80512-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08051217000050"></a>Judgments of the European Court of Justice in the 1976 Kramer case and the 1979 case of the Commission v UK have established that the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy falls within the exclusive competence of the Community. The Lisbon treaty reflects that judgment by expressly stating that the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy is within the exclusive competence of the European Union&#151;in other words, it codifies existing case law. Fisheries will continue to be managed by the EU&#146;s member states and the European Commission, working together. The Commission will continue to have the lead on conservation measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08051217000052"></a>Concerning the common fisheries policy, everyone understands the wish to protect fish stocks in our waters and ensure that the benefit of them goes to the UK. However, what the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said was absolutely right; fish do not respect national boundaries and our fishing interests extend well beyond the 200-mile limit. We need to have a policy based on the shared interests of countries that exploit the stocks in European waters. For better or worse&#151;</p>

We have to co-operate with those countries that share the fish stocks with us, and as a member of the EU we can, and do, negotiate improvements to the policy. Where there are problems with the common fisheries policy, the answer is to negotiate improvements to it, as we did in the common fisheries policy reform of December 2002, and as we continue to do.</p>

Our national resources, all the year round, amounted to some 70 per cent of the fish that swam in European waters. Why, then, did we need to bring anyone else in to share them? Why could we not manage them ourselves for the benefit of our own fishermen, then lease out any surplus fish to foreigners?</p>

We would have to negotiate, talk and work with other European countries. I want to put one thing to rest.

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08051217000062"></a>Unilateral withdrawal from the CFP, which some have suggested, would do a number of things. First, it would leave the UK in breach of its treaty obligations. Infraction proceedings could then be commenced against the UK at the European Court of Justice and, if that Court were to find against us, we would incur a fine on a daily basis while the breach continued. Even more importantly, perhaps, withdrawal would not solve the fundamental problem of low fish stocks and the tough conservation measures required to restore them to healthy levels.</p>

That is what we have been doing, first, by getting the instruments of the CFP improved in the 2002 review, and by working to secure better decisions since then under the improved mechanisms.

I am delighted that the noble Duke was fair and reasonable, as he always is, about the operation of regional advisory councils, where the kind of co-operation I am talking about has begun. Those regional bodies represent a wide range of stakeholders, who provide advice to the Commission on the common fisheries policy and its implementation.</p>

There are others, which can afford protection to the marine environment, including the habitats and species directive and the marine strategy directive. The CFP does not cover issues unrelated to marine biological resources, such as oil exploration.</p>

<a name="80512-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08051217000065"></a>On discards, withdrawal from the CFP would not address the issue of discarding fish. Everyone agrees that that is a real waste of a valuable resource and no one wants to see it. Because of the mixed nature of a wide variety of UK fisheries, with large and small fish and various species of different sizes all swimming together, discarding would be an inevitable consequence of any limitation on fishing activity designed to protect particular stocks, whether under a CFP management regime or otherwise.</p>

<a name="80512-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08051217000066"></a>For that reason, we believe the focus of attention should be on working within the established mechanisms of the common fisheries policy to make fishing activity more selective, so that unwanted fish are not caught in the first place. The worst management measures that would lead to discarding would be no measures at all. The key indicator is fishing mortality, or the proportion of the stock removed by fishing&#151;for cod in the North Sea that is, thankfully, now at its lowest since 1969.</p>

<a name="80512-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08051217000067"></a>There will be no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem, and we are seeking targeted solutions. We have worked with the industry on ways to avoid North Sea cod but still allow fishermen to continue to fish stocks that are sustainable, such as North Sea haddock. We are currently operating a system that provides additional fishing days, which are otherwise restricted, to fishermen who adhere to closures to avoid spawning or young cod and are willing to change to gear that catches fewer young fish&#151;and such gear does exist&#151;or to introduce fishing plans that commit to significant reductions in cod discards. We are also funding a range of further work to assess the value of other options.</p>

The Minister has not answered the question I put to him, which is very important: why can that policy not be changed? What is the position between the Commission and the Council of Ministers?

We would not. We would simply tell them to leave our waters while our fish stocks recovered and work for the benefit, in the first instance, of our fishing industry, which would recover. We would address discards in that way; like other countries, we would simply ban them. With our growing fishing industry, we would land all the fish that we catch. We would eat those that we want for human consumption; we could use some for animal consumption; and we could use the rest for fertiliser. We would not have to throw 30,000 articulated lorries-worth of fish dead back into the sea every year if we were managing our own fish.</p>

I suppose that one could say that until the point when a fish is caught, it is part of the marine biological resources, but the minute that it is in the net it becomes part of the common fisheries policy, but someone will have to work out how those two elements could go together. His remarks about the question of individual national management were a bit sweeping. Certainly some very successful countries control all their continental shelf. Norway does not have sole rights to the whole of its continental shelf, but that does not mean to say that some countries cannot do quite well managing a larger share of their inshore fisheries.

<a name="80512-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08051230000005"></a>Noble Lords may recall that the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 created a regime for the regulation of donations to UK political parties. However, the scheme did not extend to Northern Ireland at that time because special arrangements needed to be made in relation to donations to Northern Ireland political parties.</p>

<a name="80512-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08051230000006"></a>For that reason, the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 amended the provisions of the 2000 Act to allow for Irish citizens and prescribed Irish bodies to make donations to Northern Ireland political parties. It also contained arrangements for the Electoral Commission to hold reports on donations confidentially until 2010. That Act contained the broad outline of the special arrangements that were needed in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08051230000007"></a>However, the detail of the scheme was set out in secondary legislation: the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (Northern Ireland Political Parties) Order 2007.

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08051230000009"></a>Noble Lords may&#151;as everyone else associated with this does&#151;understandably ask why two orders are required. We have consulted the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments on the matter, and have concluded that two orders must be made in sequence. That is because the power to make the second order is contained in the order before us. It is not possible for the material in the second order to be made directly under the original statute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08051230000010"></a>The order before us will allow Irish citizens and prescribed Irish bodies to make loans to Northern Ireland political parties. We intend to set out the conditions that an Irish citizen or body must meet to make a loan to a Northern Ireland political party in the second order&#151;which, of course, will be debated in your Lordships' House. Those arrangements will acknowledge the special place that the island of Ireland and the Republic of Ireland occupy in the political life of Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08051230000011"></a>The order also addresses potential concerns relating to the possible intimidation of persons and businesses that wish to make loans to Northern Ireland political parties. Northern Ireland has rejected the path of violence and embraced a peaceful and democratic future. However, a small minority still uses violence and intimidation to attempt to achieve its ends.

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08051230000012"></a>For this reason&#151;as with the regulation of donations&#151; the order provides for legitimate loans to the Northern Ireland political parties to be reported to the Electoral Commission in confidence.

Otherwise we support the order.</p>

I wish to speak in broad agreement, as has the noble Lord, Lord Laird.</p>

<a name="80512-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08051230000025"></a>I do not want to revisit any issue from last July when we talked about the family legislation which dealt with donations. It is now 10 months on. It is now May 2008, and there is an awkward symbolism in the fact that the Government are telling us that they still believe that it is necessary to keep donations or loans secret because of the safety factor for individuals. At the same time, this is the month that our Government had said was in principle the right moment for the devolution of policing and justice for Northern Ireland. There is an awkward symbolism there. There is nothing to be done about it, but I think it should be noted this evening.</p>

<a name="80512-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08051230000026"></a>There is also the fact that this issue is becoming more important in Northern Irish politics because of the increased discussion of the role that Fianna Fail might play in the politics of Northern Ireland. Some of our concerns regarding donations and loans from outside Northern Ireland seemed somewhat academic 10 months ago but now seem considerably less so. We are in a new place in both those respects. None the less, broadly, I have to concede that there are anomalies in life and particular anomalies in the peace process, and what the Government are doing tonight is acceptable. I only ask the Minister to reassure us that the intention is for the Government to look at this again in 2010 and that their view at this point is not that these arrangements are in any sense permanent.</p>

<a name="08051230000027"></a><a name="80512-0012.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80512-0012.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08051230000124"></a>Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> My Lords, I would like to reassure the Minister that my contribution will be no longer than that of any other noble Lord who has spoken.

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08051230000028"></a>Since I am by nature an optimist, and since I recall with vividness the remarkable way in which the late great Lord Williams of Mostyn, who was once responsible for Northern Ireland affairs in your Lordships&#146; House, turned the Bill on voting, postal votes and registration in Northern Ireland electoral matters totally around between Second Reading and Third Reading in this House, the Bill having already gone through the House of Commons where Mr Desmond Browne was not able at that stage to exercise the degree of influence that Lord Williams of Mostyn used, I believe the tremendous success of that legislation in regulating Northern Ireland affairs could very well be emulated

In this legislation we are seeking to catch Northern Ireland up with what currently happens in Great Britain. I love the phrase in my speech&#151;I am trying to stick to the brief&#151;which says that we now enjoy the benefit of donation and loans regulations. It was not always considered a benefit, but it was certainly found to be a necessity. From that point of view, there is a different experience in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80512-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08051230000030"></a>I do not have the title of the second order as it is not ready yet. There is still some drafting work to be done and some discussion to be had, although it is our intention to lay the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (Northern Ireland Political Parties) Order 2008 as soon as we can. It is our intention for all the orders to be enforced by 1 July so there will be no undue delay and there will be plenty of time for debate in your Lordships&#146; House. It will therefore be laid as soon as possible after this first order is agreed by Parliament. This first order has of course already been through the other place&#151;I think it was last week or the week before.</p>

<a name="80512-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08051230000031"></a>We have also had the benefit of the donations legislation for Northern Ireland for a short period; it came into force last year. There is nothing for me to report from the Electoral Commission on using the new legislation. Procedures in that legislation prevent leakage from Northern Ireland to Great Britain&#146;s political parties to prevent the brass-nameplate operations in Ireland being used as a front for money to the north. The rules about substantial functions of a business or other organisation are all there.</p>

<a name="80512-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08051230000032"></a>There is also the citizenship issue. The noble Lord, Lord Laird, asked in a roundabout way&#151;I think I have got his question right&#151;whether UK citizens resident in Ireland can make donations to parties in Northern Ireland if they are on the UK electoral register. The answer is yes. If they are not, however, they cannot. That would count as a foreign donation because those are the rules; you must be on the electoral register. I was about to say that it is as simple as that, although from one or two cases that we have read about recently, people are learning from experience. There is this sensitive issue&#151;I appreciate that&#151;but the rules are quite clear; we are talking about Irish citizens. That was defined in the other legislation and it will be set out in some considerable detail in the second order that I will lay before the House.</p>

You can do so if you are eligible to be on the UK register. If you are not eligible, your donation does not count. So far, as I said, I have nothing to report from the Electoral Commission about donations. The rules will be broadly&#151;I cannot say exactly&#151;the same for loans as they are for donations.</p>

<a name="80512-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08051230000035"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bew, mentioned time. I fully accept his point. He mentioned that this month was forecast in the original legislation for the possible devolution of policing and criminal justice, which clearly is not taking place. We do not see this as a permanent arrangement. The confidentiality of loans and money to political parties must be temporary; otherwise there is no transparency in democracy. Therefore there is that limit. It can be extended, but it is not our intention either to extend the limit that we have now or to wish to do so when the time comes. There is a finite date of 2010. We are in a transition period in which Northern Ireland can enter normal civil society, which it is doing very fast. Part of that involves transparency in funding to political parties. We see no difficulty in the parties coming to the table in 2010 and being fully transparent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08051230000036"></a>Unless I have missed out anything, I think I have covered the central thrust of the questions. As I said, the House will probably have the other order in a few weeks&#146; time, when we can debate the detail and the nuances of the nature of the society and the organisations that will be eligible to make loans.</p>

Perhaps the Minister can write to me. The noble Lord, Lord Laird, asked about British people living in Ireland and how they can donate funds to Northern Ireland political parties. If they are living in Ireland and maintaining a British passport, and bearing in mind that they are entitled to have two passports&#151;an Irish one and a British one&#151;I would be surprised if they were not entitled to the same benefits or rights as other Irish citizens in this context. I have not thought this through before, but when I listened to the small debate between the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Laird, I was left a little uneasy that there might have been some confusion.</p>

As far as I can see, the position is absolutely clear. In order to donate, or indeed to loan, to a political party, you are required to be on the electoral register. It is a mechanism to stop any attempt to channel money to Great Britain. In other words, there is a ring-fence around Great Britain for all the main parties. Some of the main parties in Northern Ireland operate legally, although they may not put up candidates. This is an attempt to ensure that money is not passed from one to the other to undermine the GB restrictions, as much as anything else. It is quite clear that if you are eligible to be on the UK electoral register but are not on it, you still cannot donate. You must be on the UK electoral register to make a donation. If you are an Irish citizen living in Ireland, the order will allow you to donate as long as you are an Irish citizen or an Irish organisation&#151;a

It is not a question of being on the electoral register. This is special legislation to facilitate people in the Republic of Ireland financing political parties in Northern Ireland. It is totally discriminatory. It allows Irish citizens living in the Republic of Ireland to finance and support parties in Northern Ireland that are generally nationalist and anti-British, and it forbids British citizens living in the Republic of Ireland to support other parties that may be pro-British.</p>

The Orange Grand Lodge of Donegal cannot give money&#151;it operates in the Irish republic but is maintained and operated by people from a British background who consider themselves to be British&#151;while its next-door neighbours, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, can.

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08051230000052"></a>However, things are changing fast and I am far from sure that politicians are changing fast enough. Almost certainly, Europe&#146;s common agricultural policy is too inflexible and hidebound in national self-interest to change fast enough. What have the Government been doing to force the pace of change? For what reason did we give up our rebate? It was in direct return for reform of common agricultural policy. Where is that reform? I have no doubt that the Minister will refer to the health check, but Miss Mariann Fischer Boel, the Agriculture Commissioner, expressly stated that it is not reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08051230000054"></a>Recent changes in market conditions have alerted all and alarmed some. They are not brought about by poor harvests alone but are also consequent on demand-led changes&#151;global economic changes and the new demands of renewable energy and biofuels. All this has led to a realisation that all is not well in the world of the common agricultural policy. Stuck as it is in the political philosophies which gave it birth, it is overcentralised, overbureaucratic, inflexible and wasteful. The current health check is a long overdue investigation into where this policy is leading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08051230000055"></a>It was originally envisaged that the CAP would support the interests of farmers and the rural community and, at the same time, look after consumer interests, but it is in danger of doing neither. It has become the creature of national Governments operating in their own self-interests and the victim of the trade-off policies which, more than anything, have destroyed the idealism that lay behind the formation of the European Community, now the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08051230000057"></a>Amendment No.40 is designed to resist moves to weaken control of national Governments over important framework laws governing the CAP and the CFP. The Committee will know that many reforms have been suffocated by the inability of European institutions such as the European Parliament to come to grips with change. It has consistently opposed reforms such as those affecting the wine industry or increased modulation&#151;that is, the transfer of budgets&#151;whereas this country and Portugal have been alone in initiating them on a voluntary basis. Indeed, the Parliament has vouched to lock many of its current policies after 2013. Amendment No. 40 is designed to exclude codecision-making powers from the European Parliament, for it can be easily seen that it is likely to become a roadblock to reform and a second line of defence for protectionists.</p>

It is true, as the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, has pointed out, that the definition of agriculture includes fishing. Additionally, &#147;agricultural products&#148; means the products of the soil, livestock farming and fisheries and covers the first-stage processing of all these products.

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08051230000060"></a>Amendment No. 41A seeks to make sure that Parliament here in Westminster still retains a role in the development of the CAP. I hope the Minister is able to reassure the Committee that this will be the case should the Lisbon treaty be ratified. I remember assurances that the whole purpose of the treaty was to engage national parliaments in codecision-making. Perhaps I have misinterpreted this proposal. It is certainly important to know that CAP reform would involve a role for Westminster.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08051230000061"></a>Perhaps I may conclude by making a particular observation. The Lisbon treaty makes provision for the common organisation of agricultural markets in one of the following forms: common competition rules, compulsory co-ordination of national market organisation or a European market organisation&#151;different structures for different products. It is not difficult to see that this could lead to a considerable tightening of the interference and control in the marketplace. I am minded that the drafters of such proposals need a seminar on the operation of the market from the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham, who, although not in his place, instructs the House as a Minister on this subject regularly and

Regulation and control have no relevance for a world which has become anxious about food security and where land-use prioritisation, following the development of biofuels, is creating powerful pressures to increase capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08051230000062"></a>The Government have presented us with a Bill which they say is designed to set the pattern for the future of the Union. The reality is that it avoids issues such as the CAP, or where it includes them does so in such a way that it makes them irrelevant to the greater challenges facing Europe&#146;s farmers and the anxieties of Europe&#146;s citizens. Our amendments recognise this. I beg to move.</p>

He is suffering from a slight attack of hopefulness after dinner because, no matter which colour they are, all British Governments have suffered from delusions over the common agricultural policy and its reform.

Our last shot at reform was during the EU presidency when the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, agreed to give up quite a lot of our hard won rebate in return for reform of the CAP. Of course the reform just turned into a &#147;health check&#148;. Our partners in Europe must have had their fingers crossed. The health check consists at the moment of: &#147;Let us see the colour of British taxpayers&#146; money. Yes, that is okay; they are still paying a whole lot of money. What about French agriculture? Open wide. Yes, that is all in perfect working order as well. Health check complete&#148;. We are still paying and the French agriculture sector is still receiving. The result is that British taxpayers are still shelling out enormous amounts of money, still shovelling billions a year into the EU budget that is so riddled with fraud and irregularities that its accounts have not been signed off by its own auditors for 13 years. That looks like another classical government winner on the lines of Gordon Brown&#146;s sale of gold at the lowest point in the market for 100 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08051230000065"></a>The French are a little bit more rational about this sort of thing&#151;or self-interested, depending on your point of view. The French Minister Michel Barnier is on record as opposing any reform to the CAP. Using food security as an excuse for more protectionism, he has gone as far as suggesting&#151;I think I saw this in the <I>Financial Times</I>&#151;that the CAP should be taken out of the Doha round of the WTO talks. He is on record as saying that the CAP is a good model and that the CAP should return to its food production subsidies. Do the Government agree with Mr Barnier or do they think that the N in his name should be replaced with an M and agree that it is absolutely barking mad to spend 45 per cent of the EU budget on the 5 per cent of the population that produces 3 per cent of the EU output? I should like some idea of whether the Government think it is still a very good idea to spend this sort of money.</p>

A report in the <I>Times </I>on 26 April noted that Germany is backing French proposals to maintain direct agricultural subsidies after 2013, which is when Britain and some other more market-minded EU member states want total reform of the CAP. The German Minister of Agriculture, Herr Seehofer, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="08051230000105"></a>&#147;Food security is a demand of our population&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051230000100"></a>He did not see how this could be done,</p>
<ul><a name="08051230000112"></a>&#147;by taking away subsidies from European farmers&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051230000101"></a>Absolutely no surprise, then, that Germany has joined France in opposing the concessions on farm subsidies that Mr Peter Mandelson, our very own Trade Commissioner, is proposing to make at the Doha round. That is now being opposed by the French and German Governments. I do not know whether the British Government are in a strong position to argue that one through and get their way.</p>

<a name="80512-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08051230000067"></a>The French press agency, AFP, tells us that Berlin and Paris are ready to join forces in opposing British attempts to reform the CAP. This is welcomed by a spokesman for the European Commission, who said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41"></a><a name="08051230000106"></a>&#147;When the French and the Germans talk on European issues and European interests, it is always good for Europe&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051230000102"></a>Note that they did not say that it is always good for Britain. For those self-deluding British politicians who for years have been telling us that Europe is going our way, this must be something of a wake-up call. This is state intervention and state protectionism all rolled into one&#151;these so-called reforms of the CAP which are being opposed by France and Germany, who have always called the shots. But this is the CAP, invented as a conduit for pouring money into French agriculture. It is entirely predictable that the Franco-German motor is exploiting a perceived food shortage to continue to advance an agenda which has existed for decades and which shows no signs of running out of energy or of money, even if it is our money.</p>

<a name="80512-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08051230000068"></a>These are the CAP chickens coming home to roost at last. Successive Governments have handed over our agricultural, farming and food policies to the European Union. We are now at the mercy of the Commission, the European Parliament&#151;if this treaty goes through&#151;and the Council of Ministers.</p>

<a name="80512-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08051230000069"></a>I speak now not as a swivel-eyed Europhobe but as an advocate for the Government&#146;s position, as I understand it from today&#146;s <I>Financial Times</I>, which says that the Chancellor, Alistair Darling, wants to scrap EU external tariffs, which inflate prices for commodities such as beef and dairy products, and end all direct payments to farmers. The <I>FT</I> quotes him as saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42"></a><a name="08051230000107"></a>&#147;It is unacceptable that, at a time of significant food price inflation, the EU continues to apply very high import tariffs to many agricultural commodities&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051230000103"></a>Mr Darling is right in saying that, but it does not end there. He goes on to say that the CAP costs consumers in Europe billions of pounds a year in higher food bills while hurting farmers in the developing world. The German Agriculture Minister has dismissed that as &#147;complete rubbish&#148;. Do the Government agree with Mr Darling, the Chancellor, or with the German Agriculture Minister that the reforms of the CAP that Mr Darling is proposing are complete rubbish?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08051230000070"></a>The amendment is sensible. It is crazy that the Government can support the idea of giving the European Parliament, which is currently mired in sleaze&#151;brilliantly exposed by the Liberal Democrat MEP Chris Davies, and I am still waiting for a tribute from the Liberal Democrat Front Benches to his energy and bravery in exposing that corruption&#151;any role at all in a co-decision on the CAP. It has historically been against reform, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said, and has blocked it, so to allow this to go through would be completely crazy.</p>

<a name="80512-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08051230000071"></a>This is a classic argument for getting out of the mess of the EU. We are never going to get anywhere on agricultural reform while we remain bound to the ruinous, discredited policies of the CAP. I warmly support the amendment put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor.</p>

The expenses regime in the European Parliament, as in the House of Commons, needs to be changed and made transparent; I agree with the noble Lord on that. I was with Chris Davies MEP at the end of last week and congratulated him on his good work.</p>

<a name="80512-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08051230000073"></a>We agree on all sides of the Committee that there needs to be continued reform of the common agricultural policy. As the noble Lord has said, the Government themselves have a fairly radical agenda in that area. It would be useful, though, if we got some of the historical facts and the context right at the same time. First, the common agricultural policy is, wrongly, a huge proportion of the total EU budget. It has gone down&#151;currently it is around 40 per cent&#151;but it is important to remember that the EU budget is something like 1 per cent of the total EU GDP, which makes agricultural support throughout Europe from all nation states something like 0.5 per cent of GDP. That is probably significantly less than in some areas of industry where the single market, competition policy and state subsidy have not worked well enough.</p>

<a name="80512-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08051230000074"></a>I agree with a number of the criticisms that the Conservative Front Bench made of the single market and its inability to complete the process that started some time ago. That needs to continue. We have to accept that if we are in a single market for agricultural produce, the last thing that I would want for farmers in my area, the south-west, is greater inequality in subsidy between agricultural regimes. Within a single market it is quite clear that states such as France and new states in eastern Europe would subsidise agriculture far more than any UK Government ever would. That would be to the direct detriment of British farmers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08051230000075"></a>There is another area, which we have to put in some context. All of us would probably agree that the reforms of the CAP have not gone far enough, but

The European Union has moved substantially away from production subsidies, to other areas in terms of environmental cross-compliance and rural policy. All of us, particularly on these Benches, would agree that that process has not gone far enough, but to say that there has been no reform of the common agricultural policy would be absolutely wrong. What we do not have now, in terms of the food security issue, are grain mountains and butter mountains. With the change of the Common Market organisation on wine, a number of those areas are changing as well. Do they go far enough? No, they absolutely do not. I think we would all agree with that. While there is a single market, and some payment to farmers, I would be interested to know if other political parties are advocating a total free market in agriculture, with no subsidies whatever. If that is the case, they should make that very clear in their manifestos at the next general election, whenever that is.</p>

<a name="80512-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08051230000076"></a>I am particularly struck by the Conservative Front Bench view on the involvement of Parliament in the common agricultural policy. From the standpoint of the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, the European Parliament is probably an institution beyond redemption because of corruption, so he would have a valid argument. I cannot understand why any party that fundamentally agrees with democratic accountability would not agree that something as central to the European Union&#151;outside the areas that are always exclusive for policy, such as defence and foreign policy&#151;should not be part of the European Parliament&#146;s serious responsibility. That denies democratic accountability; it denies the fact that there is no taxation, or expenditure of tax by budgets and institutional budgets, without democratic accountability. I cannot see how you get away from that.</p>

Of course, I am not. I am UKIP. The noble Lord, Lord Lamont, has asked me to make that clear, which I do with great pleasure. Secondly, I do not see why the European Parliament should have a role at all in democratic accountability. It is not its money. It is our money that is being disposed of, so cavalierly, by the Commission and, under these proposals in the treaty, by the European Parliament.

It is taxpayers&#146; money, whether it is that of the Exchequer within the United Kingdom, or at the discretion of the Scottish Parliament or that of the European Parliament and European institutions. Clearly, the money comes from us as individuals, whether as businesses or other legal entities. I think that we agree on that.

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08051230000080"></a>I believe strongly that there needs to be democratic accountability at European level. The European Parliament is a great institution. It is not a perfect institution by a long way, as the noble Lord said. During my time as an MEP, I remember that the noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, was one of the most effective MEPs, especially with regard to the Committee on Budgetary Control, calling to account the expenditure that we are discussing. It is absolutely wrong that some 40 per cent of the European budget is not fully accountable to the European Parliament. That will change under the treaty of Lisbon.</p>

<a name="80512-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08051230000081"></a>There is a real issue about the agriculture committee, which is chaired by a Conservative Member of the European Parliament, Neil Parish, and any criticism of that committee must reflect on him. If you do not give a committee of a Parliament any real power, you should not expect it to attract the most competent MEPs. It will not exercise authority because it does not have great authority. The same is true of the Committee on Fisheries, of which I was a member. Perhaps I was not the right person to undertake that task. We need democratic accountability. It is not just about committees driving decisions. All committee decisions on legislation, and certainly on budgetary matters, are examined in different areas but all come before the Parliament. I do not believe that the European Parliament holds the agriculture interest groups in particularly special regard. This change in the way in which Europe works will result in greater democratic accountability and greater accountability of the agriculture budget.</p>

<a name="80512-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08051230000082"></a>As I said on Second Reading, if any European Union institution acts behind closed doors and in a non-transparent way, which is to be changed under this treaty, it is the Council of Ministers, where even in legislative session deals can be done that are not made public. That will change and this whole area of agriculture and fisheries will become far more transparent and accountable. Better decisions will be made. It may take time but I am sure that these bodies will become far more democratically accountable than they are at present.</p>

He explained the policy areas in the CAP extremely well. I merely emphasise one of his challenges. The Opposition criticise this area, but are they in favour of a complete free market in agriculture or do they see any role for subsidies? If they are in favour of subsidies, should they all be done at the national level or is there room for a European Union subsidy, albeit of a different nature to what we have today?

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08051230000086"></a>The point that I was trying to make is that nobody in this House defends the CAP as it stands. It is clearly not a sensible mechanism with which to organise European agriculture. It was a sensible mechanism in the days when the treaty of Rome was written, when the greatest geopolitical problem that Europe had was the security of its food supplies. As we moved towards self-sufficiency commodity by commodity and failed to change the CAP, it became a less and less relevant way of organising European agriculture.</p>

<a name="80512-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08051230000087"></a>However, whether we should support the CAP today is not the question in the amendments. The most important question being raised in the amendments is whether there should be a role for the European Parliament. One of the important things that the treaty of Lisbon does is abolish the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure. As soon as that happens, for the first time ever a real power is being given to the European Parliament, which has been able to indulge in every sort of unaccountable nonsense discussion because it had no power whatever over non-compulsory expenditure. In the debate so far, we have failed to realise that the people who have had the exclusive priority of determining agricultural policy&#151;the Council of Ministers&#151;have made a mess of it and have largely to be held to account by a European Parliament that will have equal say over the distribution of agricultural expenditure.</p>

<a name="80512-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08051230000088"></a>The CAP is not supported by anyone. It needs to be reformed. I believe that the engagement of the European Parliament through the abolition of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure will be the greatest impetus for change that we have before us. In those circumstances, for noble Lords to describe the European Parliament as the last bastion resisting reform&#151;or, as one noble Lord said, as totally against reform&#151;is a caricature of the reality. Once the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure is abolished, the European Parliament will see agriculture in contraposition to all the priorities that it espouses&#151;environmental policy, social policy, regional policy and so on&#151;and on which it has been pressing for greater expenditure. It will realise that, with a capped budget, the only way in which it can gain more expenditure on social policy, on common foreign and security policy and on regional policy is by making sure that it exercises its responsibility for adequate controls on agricultural expenditure. That policy will be the driving motor for the necessary change in that area.</p>

I take the view that the European Parliament&#146;s intervention in agricultural matters as a result of changes in the budget system that give it some real power that it did not have before is likely to be positive for changes in the agricultural policy of the Union. I do not take the view that the European Parliament is a wholly conservative body that wishes to retain exactly what we have now. The facility to

<a name="80512-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08051230000090"></a>We are out of date in looking at the Parliament as a body that will retain the agricultural policy exactly as it is now. I attended more than 100 meetings of the Agriculture Council and eight marathons normally lasting two or three days and nights and I am still here, but not much change was made in the common agricultural policy in consequence. I would have expected to have a bigger change as a result of parliamentary input. We are out of date and we should welcome parliamentary input.</p>

<a name="80512-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08051230000091"></a>Finally, it is important while criticising the agricultural policy, as many of us do, to be realistic about one or two of the changes that have been made. There is quite an important change in the agricultural policy, in that it was a market intervention mechanism practically across the board, which pushed up prices to consumers. That happened over many years. That element has practically vanished. If you look at the accounts now, you will see that the amount of money devoted to intervention in the market is extremely low and that there is little intervention in the market.</p>

<a name="80512-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08051230000092"></a>The gainers are the consumers, who are not penalised as they were in the past by elements of the common agricultural policy. I attach a lot of importance to that; I think that it is just as important as the argument about taxpayers&#146; money. They are both important points. There is still a heavy amount of taxpayers&#146; money being put into agriculture&#151;in my view, too much&#151;but the intervention in the market has been sharply reduced compared to the situation before the changes were made. We should recognise that, because it is an important element for our consumers and for others in the European Union.</p>

It may very well be that that is another policy that the Conservative Party will put forward before an election before the Labour Party gets hold of it.

I remember when we were fighting those battles long ago about whether we should join the Common Market that the people who were most in favour of our joining were the farmers. They were in the vanguard. The NFU was a government supporter and helped the Government to persuade farmers, who were much more important then in our economy than they are now, that they should go in.

I refer to the article in the <I>FT </I>today. I have been itching to find something with which to support the Government and this article gives me the opportunity. I will quote three paragraphs. The headline is, &#147;Chancellor fires blast at EU&#146;s farm policy&#148;. The article says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="08051230000108"></a>&#147;The chancellor will urge fellow European Union finance ministers to support the dismantling of the CAP, saying it is costing EU consumers billions of pounds a year in higher food bills, while hurting farmers in the developing world.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="08051230000110"></a>The chancellor also repeats Britain&#146;s insistence that Europe must review its target to increase the use of biofuels to 10 per cent of fuel use.

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08051230000098"></a>That is one of the best condemnations of the CAP that I have heard for a long time&#151;and hooray for that. It would appear from what the Chancellor is recommending to his European colleagues that he, too, believes in a free market in agriculture. We are moving together. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, who should know what he is talking about and in my view does, is talking sound sense that many of us agree with&#151;including some on the Liberal Democrat Benches, who are very well disposed to the European Union. It seems that all sides are coming together to the view that the CAP is a ruinous policy&#151;for Governments, for people and for the developing world. We are coming together in the hope that we can get rid of this absurd policy and find a market solution to the agricultural problems that we have, and to the food shortages and price increases that we will face in future, which cannot be found as long as we have the CAP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08051234000002"></a>Noble Lords may have noticed a quotation in the <I>Times</I> on 21 April, from an unnamed British diplomat who is supposed to be close to these matters in Brussels. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a><a name="08051234000069"></a>&#147;You cannot spend 45 per cent of the EU budget on 5 per cent of the population who produce 3 per cent of the EU&#146;s output&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051234000061"></a>Economically, as other noble Lords have said, the CAP is madness. The Government have said that it costs the average British family about &#163;1,000 a year in higher food costs. We should not forget that those higher food costs come through the increased price of milk, sugar and bread, and hit the poorest hardest.</p>

<a name="80512-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08051234000003"></a>However, it is beyond our shores that the CAP must be held to account. If we are to believe the Trade Justice Movement, CAFOD and Oxfam, the common agricultural policy has been killing untold numbers of people in the developing world, mostly children, by dumping its unwanted produce on those impoverished people, because they cannot sell their products in their local markets. I have a question for the Minister: have Her Majesty's Government made any estimate of the extent of this suffering? What is the number of people who have been affected in this way in recent years? I accept that US grain subsidies and grain exports compound the problem, but we are responsible for the common agricultural policy, because we are part of the European Union and, therefore, we support that policy.</p>

<a name="80512-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08051234000004"></a>Then of course biofuels come on top of all this. They are perhaps not strictly part of the common agricultural policy, but the EU, in its absurd quest for environmental change and altering our carbon footprint in the useless pursuit of affecting global warming, is clearly proposing to use land that would be better used for growing food. I say &#147;useless&#148;, because we now know that the planet is cooling down, and will be for at least the next 12 years&#151;maybe the next 50 years. I pray in aid the Hadley curve. Anyway, we are not talking about that now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08051234000007"></a>I have another question for the Minister.

I ask the noble Lord, Lord Bach, to answer the same question in relation to the common agricultural policy that I asked on the common fisheries policy, which he did not answer. Why can this wicked policy not be changed? What is happening in Brussels with the common fisheries policy and this policy? Which countries are holding up that change? Such discussions may well be secret in the enclaves and procedures of Brussels, but it would be helpful to the British people if they knew why this policy could not be changed.</p>

But, surely, if change were to come, it would have to be proposed by the Commission in secret. It would have to be negotiated in COREPER and then passed by the Council. The noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, shakes his head but I have to ask him whether that procedure occurred with proposed reform of either the common fisheries policy or the common agricultural policy. I suggest that it has not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08051234000012"></a>The position of the UK Independence Party is that if we left the European Union, which we should do, we would run our own agriculture to suit ourselves and stop being part of this evil on the face of the planet. I simply ask: how dare the European Union propose to lead the way on environmental policy for the good of the planet when it has been responsible for this for so many years&#151;and why can it not be abolished?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08051234000014"></a>Amendments Nos. 40 and 41 refer to the extension of codecision to certain aspects of agriculture and fisheries policy-making. The ordinary legislative procedure&#151;qualified majority voting and codecision&#151;will now be the default decision-making procedure for agriculture and fisheries matters, as it has been for the environment for some time. Agriculture and fisheries policy is already subject, as the Committee will be aware, to qualified majority voting.

Even those who are sceptical about the role of the Parliament should be grateful for that because they are even more sceptical about the role of the Commission. MEPs are increasingly effective, both at raising issues of key concern&#151;for example, climate change in recent times&#151;and at scrutinising and improving legislation.</p>

<a name="80512-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08051234000016"></a>Strengthening the European Parliament&#146;s role increases transparency and democratic accountability. Our EU Select Committee report noted in paragraph 10.36 in relation to moving to codecision on agriculture and fisheries that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a><a name="08051234000070"></a>&#147;It will bring more transparency and accountability to the policy-making process, allowing third parties to raise concerns more easily with policy makers and facilitating national parliamentary scrutiny&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051234000062"></a>Experience in areas already subject to codecision&#151;I have mentioned environmental policy already&#151;has shown that proposals can be improved by the involvement of MEPs. The additional scrutiny and debate in the European Parliament will offer new opportunities for us and other member states to secure, frankly, better regulation.</p>

<a name="80512-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08051234000063"></a>If I may walk down memory lane for a brief moment, in a previous role as a Defra Minister I saw for myself the valuable input that can be given on legislation by the European Parliament. There are people in Committee tonight who will well remember REACH, which implements a new EU regime for regulating the risks to human health and the environment from hazardous chemicals. That was greatly improved through the interplay between the Council and the Parliament.</p>

<a name="80512-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08051234000064"></a>Thanks in part to codecision, the final REACH proposal was more in line with the principles of better regulation and provided higher protection against the most harmful chemicals. The procedure also provided greater opportunity for scrutiny and a wider debate than would have taken place between industry and the interest groups involved. We as a country have a lot of experience of dealing with the European Parliament and will certainly draw on that&#151;and, indeed, on what we consider our good reputation&#151;when it comes to engaging it on agriculture and fisheries.</p>

<a name="80512-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08051234000065"></a>Of course, it is too early to say what the precise effects of these changes will be on reform of the CAP, animal health and welfare or fisheries policy in the EU. The reason for that is that, to be successful, the reform must take into account the political make-up of the European Parliament as well as the Governments of the member states that sit in the Council. However, the current signs in relation to the common agricultural policy health check are promising. The draft opinion of the Parliament&#146;s rapporteur on the health check includes many issues with which the UK would agree, including some dismantling of market-supporting regimes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08051234000017"></a>I note that the weight of evidence given to the EU Select Committee was favourable. Professor Simon Hix of the LSE, a leading expert on European Parliament voting patterns, suggested that surveys of MEPs had shown that in fact an overwhelming majority in the European Parliament was in favour of reforming the CAP. Professor Helen Wallace agreed

Yet the fact will remain that that Parliament, with its limited budget, will not be able to do the things that it wants if it continues to agree to spend too high a percentage of its expenditure on agriculture. We think that the pressures will be there on the European Parliament once it has some responsibility. So far, it has had none at all and its Members can say whatever they like; it does not matter.

On the agriculture side, these include the fixing of market support measures such as intervention prices and import levies, while for fisheries these include limitations in the form of total allowable catches. Those are all responses to acute economic circumstances and inevitably require rapid reactions, which could not be guaranteed under the co-decision process. If the fisheries measure agreed annually in December were to be delayed then implementation in the January immediately following would be severely compromised and the measures unenforceable, threatening the long-term

That envisaged a future for EU agriculture as a fundamentally sustainable industry, integral to the European economy. It ought to be internationally competitive without reliance on subsidy or protection; it should be rewarded by the market for its outputs&#151;not least for good, safe food&#151;and by the taxpayer only for producing societal benefits that the market cannot deliver. It should of course be environmentally sensitive. It should be socially responsible to the needs of rural communities. It should produce high levels of animal health and welfare and the non-distortion of international trade and the world economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08051234000035"></a>Our vision&#151;our domestic view for farming&#151;is of an industry that by 2020 is, first, profitable in the marketplace and continuing to produce the majority of the food we consume; secondly, making a positive net environmental contribution, particularly in respect of climate change, but wider than that; and, thirdly, managing the landscape and the natural assets that underlie it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08051234000036"></a>Here the Committee will be at one. Further CAP reform is a key element of achieving both our domestic and our European visions for agriculture. Despite recent improvements, the CAP remains expensive, wasteful and inefficient at providing ongoing support to farmers. It distorts global markets, weighs farmers down with regulation and acts as a disincentive for farmers to improve their competitiveness.</p>

<a name="80512-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08051234000037"></a>We call for an end to the market support and direct payment elements of the CAP by 2015-2020, because they damage developing countries, as has been said, are expensive and wasteful&#151;costing approximately &#8364;50 billion per year&#151;deliver poor value for money, and stymie the ability of EU farmers to respond to market signals and become truly competitive. That would represent a radical further evolution of the CAP: price support would gradually diminish as would other direct support to farmers; agricultural markets would progressively open up; and there would be a central rather than a peripheral role for rural development measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08051234000038"></a>CAP reform is currently being pursued on two key tracks. The health check, which has been referred to, promises worthwhile adjustments to current CAP mechanisms and should be concluded before the end of the year. It will not in itself reduce overall CAP spending, but the health check has the potential to deliver some beneficial change that clearly signals the ongoing nature of CAP reform in the direction of market liberalisation and the delivery of public benefits.</p>

<a name="80512-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08051234000039"></a>In the longer-term, the EU budget review, which follows on from the health check, will consider all EU spending post 2013&#151;the end of the financial perspective&#151;and is likely to result in a high-level Commission White Paper in late 2008 or early 2009, before the Commission change-over, which will inform the negotiations for the next financial perspective, which ought to begin in 2010-11. Due to its size, the CAP will rightly be a key focus for the budget review, as will the UK and other countries&#146; abatement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="08051234000040"></a>We want the CAP health check negotiations this year to play an important part in the reform process by reducing regulatory burdens and giving farmers greater control over their business decisions; cutting further the trade and market-distorting nature of the CAP; and directing public spending more towards delivery of targeted public benefits, particularly environmental ones. The Commission is due to publish its legislative proposals for the health check on 20 May. The noble Lord asked me about what would happen next. The proposals are due on that day. The Government will run a full consultation and the legislative proposals will be subject to the usual domestic scrutiny procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08051234000046"></a>Finally, in a <I>Financial Times</I> article today my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer is quoted calling for an end to direct support for European farmers and the abolition of all measures that keep farm prices above world market levels. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, was kind enough to commend the comments that were quoted at any rate. I think that that shows quite clearly that the Government mean business. But as far as the Lisbon treaty is concerned&#151;and I have to keep reminding myself that that is what we are debating in this House&#151;I would invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

As a former Defra Minister, he knows very well what goes on in discussions in the channels across the water. The countries that he named as sympathetic, or as sharing similar aspirations to ours, did not include France. France clearly has a very different view on protecting its farming and agricultural industry, or it certainly did in years past. How does the Minister think the European Parliament will overcome that particular problem? The representatives there will be equally difficult and will rightly be fighting for their own farmers. That is not for us because we have gone down a different route. However, France is a big player among the other countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08051234000048"></a>I apologise to Members of the Committee; as I have not been participating in the debates I have not heard the earlier discussions on fisheries. One of the problems with the fisheries policy is that although there has been review after review, every time a committee in this House or the other place comes up with recommendation, nothing happens, or at least nothing successful. So we still have loads of discards. Is the Minister confident that the proposals in the treaty will achieve this, or will we continue to go down that particular route? It is a very unsatisfactory route and has not improved much over the years. There is still abuse out there and not much being held to account.</p>

Co-decision, on balance, is certainly a good move and may help to break what has obviously been an unsatisfactory position until now. I can tell the noble Baroness that as the Marine Bill is national legislation, it will have nothing whatever to do with the European Union. On the health check, I said that it would not bring budgetary reductions. We will have to wait until the next financial perspective for substantial budgetary reductions to show themselves, but it is very important that the review in 2008-09 shows the way towards them.

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="0805131000001"></a>If the changes in decision-making do not improve the operation of the CAP, noble Lords are right to point this out. It is interesting that the Minister has adopted a wait-and-see&#151;a sort of hope-over-experience&#151; policy. My noble friend Lord Lamont had it right. This issue stretches right across our relationship here, in this Westminster Parliament, with European institutions.</p>

<a name="80512-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="0805131000002"></a>It is interesting that, in our discussion about a subject on which there is a large degree of consensus in the Committee, I have not heard a single noble Lord say that the common agricultural policy is underregulated. I have not heard a single noble Lord say that it is spending too little. We are all agreed that it desperately needs reform. When I asked about the role of this House and the debate that we might have on the health check, I got, quite rightly, a technically correct answer. However, when the Lord President introduced the Bill at Second Reading, she mentioned&#151;I am sure that I did not mishear&#151;that the role of national parliaments would be enhanced through the operation of this treaty. I hope that I am correct in that. If that is the case, why is it that we find ourselves unable to have much influence over this important area of policy?</p>

<a name="80512-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="0805131000003"></a>That is why these amendments are important. The Westminster Parliament, both this House and the other place, has a role to play. I ask the Minister: what is the role of this House and the other place in CAP reform? Perhaps he might answer that question before I determine the future of my amendments.</p>

Both Houses have an important scrutiny role. No doubt the views expressed both in this House and in another place on the issues that we have been debating tonight are listened to carefully by those in the Commission, by Ministers who represent this country on the Council of Ministers and, I am sure, by Members of the European Parliament.

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="0805131000032"></a>As I was about to say, under the Maastricht treaty Home Office, justice and police matters were dealt with under what was then called the Third Pillar, and that pillar was intergovernmental in character. The treaty of Amsterdam, as many of your Lordships may recall, moved immigration, asylum, border control and civil and family law from the Third to the First Pillar, which operates, as every one of your Lordships participating in these debates over the past weeks must know, on the basis of co-decision by the European Parliament, qualified majority decision-making in the Council and subject to the ultimate jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. As a consequence of this, the Third Pillar was renamed Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters and has so remained for the past decade. The treaty of Lisbon brings all the remaining Third Pillar matters under Pillar 1 and that is the central issue that your Lordships have to consider tonight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="0805131000033"></a>The great political philosophers tell us that fundamental to the creation of states is the need for individuals in societies to be secure. That security is achieved by the prohibitions of the criminal law  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_896"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column 896</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>enforced by the police. For the European Union to take upon its own institutions the responsibility of passing criminal legislation and ensuring that it is implemented in member states on the scale suggested in the Lisbon treaty will have a defining impact on the European Union&#146;s ultimate political character. We therefore have to ask: what is motivating those who press for these radical changes?</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="0805131000034"></a>The new provisions are set out in Articles 82 to 89 of the new treaty. It is simply not possible to deal with all of them without occupying your Lordships for several hours. I shall just draw your Lordships&#146; attention to a few of the more alarming proposals.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="0805131000035"></a>Article 83(1) provides for the adoption of European Union legislation to establish minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences in areas of particularly serious crime with a cross-border dimension. The list includes terrorism, trafficking in human beings, the sexual exploitation of women and children, drug trafficking, arms trafficking, money laundering, corruption, counterfeiting, computer crime and organised crime. Moreover, the Council may, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, adopt a unanimous decision to include other areas of crime as well.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="0805131000036"></a>Article 83(2) provides for other criminal offences and sanctions where this proves, in the words of the new treaty,</p>
<ul><a name="0805131000050"></a>&#147;essential to ensure the effective implementation of a Union policy in an area which has been subject to harmonisation measures&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805131000048"></a>The treaty goes on to specify that directives under this article are to be adopted by the same legislative procedures as are stipulated for the adoption of the harmonisation measures in question. So if a harmonisation measure were adopted by qualified majority voting, so would the related criminal offence and sanctions be.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="0805131000037"></a>Article 85 provides, inter alia, that Eurojust may be given the task, by the Council and the Parliament, of initiating criminal investigations as well as proposing the initiation of prosecutions and co-ordinating such investigations and prosecutions. Article 86.1 permits a European Public Prosecutor to be established in order to combat offences and acts against the financial interests of the Union. That decision would be taken by a unanimous vote in the Council. The related Article 86(2) provides that the European Public Prosecutor&#146;s Office shall be responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgment the perpetrators of offences against the Union&#146;s financial interests. Article 86(4) allows the European Council, acting unanimously, to adopt a decision extending the powers of the EPP to include serious crimes having a cross-border dimension.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="0805131000038"></a>Lastly, Article 82 lists three aspects of criminal law that could be subject to harmonisation: the mutual admissibility of evidence, the rights of individuals and the rights of victims of crime. This latter category goes to the heart of individual liberties. It has a substantial overlap with the rights laid down in the ECHR and falls within an area where our own common law traditions differ substantially from the civil law provisions of our continental counterparts.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_897"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column 897</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80512-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="0805131000039"></a>All this represents a remarkable break with the Maastricht model. Why has the Community&#151;or those who have been driving the policy behind the treaty&#151;made this radical break with the past? Many people in the European Commission, I understand, argue that this expansion of criminal responsibilities in the Community is the logical corollary of the freedom of movement of people. Without Community measures in this area, they argue, people would be able to escape justice by exercising their power to move freely throughout the Community. However, surely that task is addressed by the European arrest warrant. Its admittedly unattractive and unnecessarily draconian provisions nevertheless ought to solve 99 per cent of this problem. There is no logical reason for any harmonising measures.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="0805131000040"></a>Not surprisingly, the scope of these provisions has made some of the member states&#151;that is to say, member states other than ourselves&#151;hesitate as well; hence the emergency brake provision. Measures proposed under certain articles in the Lisbon treaty, where decision-making is enacted by qualified majority voting, are subject to these brake provisions. In these circumstances, any member state can pull its emergency brake where it considers that the draft legislation would affect fundamental aspects of its criminal justice system. As a consequence, the matter is then referred to the European Council and the legislative procedure is meanwhile suspended. Where no agreement is reached in the Council, the legislative procedure remains suspended; but if at least nine member states wish to proceed, then after notifying the Commission, the Parliament and the Council, authorisation for enhanced co-operation is deemed to have been granted.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="0805131000041"></a>If these measures go ahead in their current form, we are likely to see the enhanced provisions used frequently. This will lead to many member states in the European Community operating a set of criminal justice rules that are different from the remainder. Would it not be much better to proceed, as indeed we did under the old Third Pillar arrangements in Maastricht, with negotiations going on until consensus is reached? In those circumstances the Community would have a level playing-field in matters of criminal law.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="0805131000042"></a>The relevance of the emergency brake procedure is reduced in the case of the United Kingdom, because of the protocol negotiated, which gives us the right not to opt in to individual measures. At present, the unanimity requirement in criminal justice obviates the need for any opt-in in this area. Under the treaty of Lisbon, as noble Lords are aware, the United Kingdom and Ireland have secured the right to choose whether opting in to all proposed measures falling within the field of freedom, security and justice is an appropriate approach in any given set of circumstances.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="0805131000043"></a>The protocol also confirms the right of the United Kingdom to choose whether or not to participate in the proposed amending measures. Opt-in provisions will apply to amending measures, as well as the original measure itself. However, by Article 4a(2) of the protocol, when the Council determines that the United Kingdom&#146;s non-participation in an amending measure makes the existing measure inoperable for other member states, it may, by qualified majority,  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_898"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column 898</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>require the United Kingdom to reconsider its decision not to participate. If the United Kingdom maintains its position, the existing measure shall cease to apply to the United Kingdom. But, by Article 4a(3) of the protocol, the Council may, again by qualified majority, determine that the UK shall bear the direct financial consequences necessarily and unavoidably incurred as a result of its exclusion from the existing measure. I should like to ask the Minister how we came to agree to this. Quite apart from the desirability of having a measure of this sort in the protocol, how on earth could we possibly know in advance what the likely scale of our liability could be? Can the Minister be confident that the scale would be small, if not derisory?</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="0805131000044"></a>The other problem in relation to the opt-in which is extremely vexing is that we have to take the decision to opt in at a very early stage of the negotiations. The early negotiations in relation to a particular measure may make what is likely to be the end product desirable. We exercise the opt-in and then the whole character of the negotiations changes and we realise that, for one reason or another, it would be damaging to the interests of the United Kingdom to exercise our opt-in. By then it will be too late to think again. As a consequence of this aspect of the opt-in provisions we are likely to be exceedingly hesitant to get involved at all in most circumstances.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="0805131000045"></a>Your Lordships will be extremely relieved to hear that I am turning to the final matter, which is the protocol on transitional provisions. Article 9 of this protocol provides that the legal effects of the measures adopted under the old Third Pillar, such as the arrest warrant, shall be preserved until those Acts are repealed, annulled or amended. Following the coming into force of the Lisbon treaty&#151;if that ever happens&#151;it is likely that the Commission will move swiftly to convert many such measures into directives under Title V of the TFEU. The transitional arrangements upon which the UK Government have insisted&#151;inexplicably in my view&#151;will last for only five years. We have apparently negotiated these special arrangements to ensure that where measures have not already been converted from the Third to the First Pillar, the Government can exercise what they describe as a block opt-out with respect to the remaining unconverted measures. Under Article 10(4) of the protocol, the United Kingdom may, six months before the expiry of the transitional period, notify the Council that it does not accept the new extended competences of the EU institutions over any outstanding Third Pillar matters.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="0805131000046"></a>Once again, though, we are faced with a system of financial penalties in this area. I pose the same question to the noble Baroness as I did earlier in relation to the opt-out protocol. How can the Government be so confident that these financial requirements that will be imposed on us will not be extremely expensive?</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="0805131000047"></a>I think I have said enough to indicate that the scale of these new provisions in comparison with what has gone before is immense. The new powers of the Community are of particular concern when it is taken into account that their ultimate character will be determined not by our own courts but by the European Court of Justice. It is for those reasons that we have tabled these amendments. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="08051310000002"></a><a name="80512-0016.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80512-0016.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08051310000116"></a>Lord Blackwell:</b> I have no doubt that the measures that my noble friend has just explained are some of the most far-reaching and chilling proposals in the whole treaty. As they are understood by the population at large, they will cause outrage. What my noble friend described was, as he said, the abolition of the intergovernmental nature of these justice and home affairs measures and their incorporation into the main treaty in a way which will bring in QMV, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and co-decision by the European Parliament.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="08051310000003"></a>Matters of criminal justice and policing are matters for a nation where the electorate can elect or de-elect the Government who are responsible for those matters. The electorate can hold that Government to account. They can elect or de-elect the parliament that makes those laws on their behalf. I do not believe that a European council voting by majority is democratic representation of a nation. Nor do I believe that a European Parliament, however much language is used about it directly representing European citizens, represents a national voice on these matters or is an appropriate forum to decide the national laws that apply in this country.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="08051310000004"></a>The European Union is not a nation. The United Kingdom is a nation. Its Parliament is the place where criminal laws, policing laws and the role of justice in this nation are decided until such time as the Government tell us that we are no longer a nation and the European Union has become that nation&#151;a proposition which, thankfully, they continue to deny. The fact that this treaty moves us away from a nation having control over its own laws in this area is a hugely significant matter. In support I quote a much-quoted report from the European Committee of this House, which has made some salient points on the matter. It said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a><a name="08051310000101"></a>&#147;The move to QMV in almost all areas of FSJ is a significant change ... It is likely that one effect of the change will be an increase in Union activity and the volume of legislation agreed in this area&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051310000093"></a>The European Union has not brought in these measures in this treaty to sit on the sidelines; it has brought them in to legislate in these areas. That is what it intends to do. The report continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="08051310000102"></a>&#147;The change will remove Member States&#146; vetoes in respect of criminal law and policing and legal migration. This means that it will be possible for the UK, in some cases, to be bound by a measure in the area of criminal law or policing against its will, although the likelihood of this happening will be greatly reduced by the existence of a general right not to opt in for the UK&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80512-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="08051310000005"></a>I will return to that point in a minute. In respect of the power of the ECJ, the report continues:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a><a name="08051310000103"></a>&#147;For the first time, Member States will be able to be taken to the Court for failure to implement properly EU legislation in the area of criminal law and policing&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051310000094"></a>In other words, even if this Parliament were to vote for a measure that reflected the will of the people of this country, this Government could be taken to court in Europe for not implementing a different measure that had been voted in by QMV in Europe. That is what we are considering.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="08051310000006"></a>I am sure that the Government will say, &#147;That is all very well, but we negotiated opt-ins&#148;. There are two  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_900"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column 900</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>problems with the opt-in, which my noble friend on the Front Bench has mentioned. The first is the matter of existing measures which we have already agreed under the previous arrangements where we will not have the choice of retaining the status quo. We will have either to agree to those measures being brought in to the new area, where the Court of Justice and QMV applies, or to opt out of those measures and bear whatever costs are imposed. Again, the report makes it clear that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051310000106"></a>&#147;the Treaty does not leave open the option of retaining the <I>status quo</I> in respect of Title VI measures after the transitional period. At the end of the period at the latest, the UK must either accept the Commission&#146;s enforcement powers and the ECJ&#146;s jurisdiction in respect of such measures or exercise its block opt-out, again accepting that if it chooses to opt back in to any particular existing measure, the Commission&#146;s enforcement powers and the ECJ&#146;s jurisdiction will apply&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80512-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="08051310000007"></a>There is a whole set of measures where we would be forced either to comply or to opt out and bear the cost. There would be many other areas where, at first blush&#151;the Government are trying to be friendly and co-operate within Europe&#151;we will agree to areas that are then amended. The problem is that once we have agreed to an area, any amendment that follows will be by QMV and will bring us under the jurisdiction of the ECJ. Again, I quote from the report:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a><a name="08051310000104"></a>&#147;The suggestion that the UK, having opted in to a proposal, could argue that its opt-in did not extend to fundamental amendments to the proposal during negotiations raises an interesting legal question. But the question is unlikely to arise ... In some areas of criminal law and policing, a dramatic change during negotiations may permit the UK to use the emergency brake to halt a measure&#146;s progress. In other cases, the UK may end up bound by a measure with which it does not fully agree; this is the nature of QMV&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051310000095"></a>We are entering territory where a fundamental shift is happening in the criminal justice and legal system, which is moving from an area that is under national control of a national parliament and national Government, elected by the citizens of the country, to a territory where it can be imposed on us by qualified majority voting or parliamentary decisions in Europe, even where this nation has a different view. We should not do so without having that fully explained to the people of this country.</p>

<p><a name="st_254"></a>
<a name="08051310000008"></a><a name="80512-0016.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80512-0016.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08051310000117"></a>Lord Goodhart:</b> We are looking at new provisions in the Lisbon treaty that will augment co-operation in civil and criminal proceedings. I recognise that the changes made in this area by the Lisbon treaty are very important and are among the most important of all the changes made by the treaty. It has to be recognised at the same time that the United Kingdom and Ireland are affected by those changes far less than other member states, because we are not bound by future changes unless we choose to opt in, and that is a very important provision indeed.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="08051310000009"></a>There is much to gain from co-operation in both civil and criminal matters. For example, the recognition of foreign judgments in both civil and criminal cases is important to prevent unreasonable delays. If judgment in one country needs to be enforced in another, non-recognition in the latter of that judgment basically means that the whole issue has to be retried, which creates injustice and unnecessary expense. We need further EU legislation on a number of issues. I will  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_901"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column 901</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>give one or two examples from my experience as a member of Sub-Committee E of the EU Committee.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="08051310000010"></a>We need an agreement in civil cases for a common small claims procedure without the EU so that, for example, a tourist from the United Kingdom who has booked and paid for hotel accommodation in Spain can sue the hotel for failure to honour that obligation. It is more or less impossible for that to happen now, because the costs and difficulties would far exceed the amount of money that could be recovered. We need a simple process that is the same across the EU, which minimises the language difficulties and enables someone to recover damages suffered under a small claim at minimum cost and expense.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="08051310000011"></a>Another problem, which I have very much seen in action during my time as a trustee of Fair Trials International, is the absence of proper legal assistance and interpretation in criminal trials in many countries. All countries in the EU already have an obligation under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights to provide legal assistance where the defendant cannot afford it, and to provide interpretation. However, this is simply not observed in many countries. Fair Trials International had great difficulty when people from this country were arrested and tried in Greece for plane spotting. That had a happy ending, largely because of the intervention of FTI. However, it showed the legal defects very clearly.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="08051310000012"></a>The EU has been considering introducing laws on small claims, and on support in criminal trials, but there has been no agreement. I believe that the United Kingdom would support warmly both of these, but no agreement is likely to be reached under the Third-Pillar procedure, which needs unanimity. Some smaller countries in the EU are not willing to join up. Any agreement on the recognition of judgements would need safeguards against judgments obtained by fraud or corruption. However, limitations on recognition should be confined to those matters that are necessary to avoid injustice.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="08051310000013"></a>We also need, among other things, an agreement about the proper forum for trials, to prevent conflict and abuse. Another method of co-operation that would be helpful, particularly over smaller claims, would be to limit the need for witnesses to travel to countries where trials are being held, by allowing them to give evidence by video link. In the past, this has been difficult to achieve, because it was expensive. However, IT developments in recent years are making it much more viable and it is now likely that if this was proposed by the EU, we would get qualified majority support for the video links&#151;but, again, we would be unlikely to get unanimity.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="08051310000014"></a>The problem for the United Kingdom and Ireland is that whereas we have a common law system, most other EU countries have a code-based system. However, we are protected&#151;and this is perhaps the main justification for our protection&#151;by our right not to be bound by new legislation unless we have opted in. However, we should not assume, without looking at it on a case by case basis, that our procedure is always better and must always be defended.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para27"></a>

<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_902"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column 902</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>countries, is very important when countries face cross-border and organised crime and terrorism. It should not be excluded by minor technical differences in procedure. We have agreements on procedure that have been obtained under the Third Pillar&#151;for example, the European arrest warrant. However, the framework agreement for the EAW may need amendment in the future. Under the Third Pillar, amendments would also need unanimity. This would likely lead to existing agreements becoming out of date, and either ineffective or too restrictive.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="08051310000016"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, recognises that we have the right not to opt in. However, why should we insist, as he suggested, that new EU legislation, which will often be something that we ourselves welcome, can be blocked by the objection of, let us say, Slovakia? One small member state of the EU will be able to block what everybody else wants.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="08051310000017"></a>We also need to look at Amendment No. 58, which aims to prevent Eurojust from carrying out criminal investigations. Investigation by Eurojust may well be useful in cases where internal investigation into misuse of EU money would not be pursued with enthusiasm in a particular member state. That is unlikely to be a problem in the United Kingdom, where we can be confident that this problem does not arise; but it arises in some other countries. It may well be, therefore, that the intervention of Eurojust would mean a greater likelihood that fraud against the EU&#151;which we are all deeply concerned about&#151;would, perhaps for the first time, be brought under control.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="08051310000018"></a>There is also the question of Amendment No. 59, on the European Public Prosecutor&#146;s Office. I am somewhat sceptical about that. It is doubtful that it is desirable to set up an entirely new system of prosecutions for fraud against the EU that would operate independently of national courts. But under the Lisbon treaty the introduction of the Public Prosecutor&#146;s Office requires unanimity. It is unlikely to get that from the United Kingdom. That would of course leave the possibility of nine or more states setting up arrangements for the operation of the Public Prosecutor&#146;s Office under enhanced co-operation. I see no reason why we would wish to prevent that happening. While it may be unlikely to succeed, it could do so, and if it were to be successful that would justify a wider use of the EPPO.</p>

<a name="80512-0016.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="08051310000019"></a>Police co-operation is extremely important for dealing with cross-border crimes. Incompatible systems for collection and storage of data make work for police much harder. We should not start with the assumption that other countries want to force on us measures that we would not want to have. If that turns out to be the case, we can always fall out on not opting in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="08051310000021"></a>I do not think that any of these amendments is necessary. All of them are likely to make the possibility of achieving effective legal action against misbehaviour in European countries harder to achieve.</p>

Given that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has grouped together two groups of amendments, I shall try to do what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, did and deal with these issues one by one and, perhaps, address the concerns that noble Lords have raised. I recognise the importance of the moves that have been made in the areas of justice and home affairs. I declare my interest in that I was a Minister who sat on the Justice and Home Affairs Council for just under three years and I have some experience of the opting-in process that noble Lords have referred to.</p>

<a name="80512-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="08051310000025"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, took us on a journey through Maastricht to Amsterdam on the way that justice and home affairs have evolved. Indeed, one can look back to the beginnings in the 1970s of the Trevi group and see the moves within Europe to recognise the importance of co-operation in matters of justice and home affairs to achieve common ends&#151;particularly on issues such as serious and organised crime. Those moves tried to make sure, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, that in areas of civil justice, where people live, work, study, travel, buy or sell across the European Union, they have the benefit of knowing that they can rely on the EU to work together to resolve any problems that may arise.</p>

<p><a name="08051310000096"></a>Put simply, if you are a tourist who buys something in a shop in any part of the European Union and it is faulty or breaks, you know you can be recompensed. Equally, it makes it easier to have debts repaid to you because of transactions that you have undertaken. These are issues that I worked on personally across the European Union in my time as a Justice Minister and I know the importance of the potential benefit to UK citizens. It is in that context that I want to talk about these matters.</p>

<a name="80512-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="08051310000026"></a>I think it is important when we look at the area of justice and home affairs, particularly in terms of judicial co-operation, that we look at what is within Article 81 of the consolidated treaties. When I was a Justice Minister I spent a huge amount of time on Article 65, trying to make sure that we considered it in the context of cross-border implications. I was very pleased to see that the treaty helpfully makes clear that measures in that field must be based on the principle of mutual recognition. From a UK perspective, that is an improvement on what went before. It is very important to me that we are recognising each other&#146;s legal systems and not seeking any form of harmonisation. That is an important principle that is much clearer within this treaty than what went before.</p>

It has appeared in every treaty from Amsterdam onwards but, under the Lisbon treaty, national parliaments have the right to veto its use.</p>

<a name="80512-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="08051310000028"></a>Going back to the amendments that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, who is not in his place, was concerned about and that my noble friend Lord Bach discussed on recognising the importance of the role of and strengthening the control of national parliaments, here we have an example. I am not sure whether the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, spoke to Amendment No. 55. No? I will not deal with it because I thought he was going to. I will leave it for another time.</p>

<a name="80512-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="08051310000029"></a>I will speak to Amendment No. 56, which is next on my list and deals with Article 82 in the consolidated version of the treaty on the function of the European Union. It talks about judicial co-operation in criminal matters, which is currently under Article 31 of the treaty of the European Union. Again, I think that that is an improvement on the existing treaties in a number of respects, which was implicitly acknowledged in the report of the Select Committee. It said that Article 31 was of &#147;uncertain and controversial width&#148; and replaced it with an exhaustive list of areas of criminal procedure where the adoption of minimum rules could be proposed. It concluded that what it described as that &#147;clarification and definition&#148; was,</p>
<ul><a name="08051310000107"></a>&#147;unlikely to involve any significant expansion of jurisdiction&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80512-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="08051310000030"></a>The new provision expressly limits activity in this area to,</p>
<ul><a name="08051310000108"></a>&#147;the extent necessary to facilitate mutual recognition&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051310000097"></a>and to police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters,</p>
<ul><a name="08051310000109"></a>&#147;having a cross-border dimension&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051310000098"></a>Again, these are important areas of clarification. It also explicitly requires that rules created under this provision should take into account the differences between the legal traditions and systems of the member states. All these requirements are welcome and I would have thought that the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, might welcome them as well because of the importance of mutual recognition of traditions and legal systems of individual member states.</p>

That means that we choose whether we participate in them. We cannot be obliged to participate in such measures where we deem that they are not in our interests. Of course, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, made clear, there will be many occasions when it is in our interests to co-operate with our European Union partners. Criminals and organised gangs do not respect borders, and therefore we need to work with our partners in pursuing cross-border prosecutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="08051310000033"></a>Amendment No. 57 relates to the inclusion of &#147;organised crime&#148; in the list of crimes where the EU, by qualified majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament, can establish minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions. As I indicated, Article 31 of the current treaty provides for the adoption of measures establishing minimum rules. On that basis, the JHA Council has already agreed a framework decision which requires member states to have in their domestic laws offences and penalties relating to participation in a criminal organisation. That decision is wholly consistent with the Criminal Law Act 1977, which is the relevant UK legislation on conspiracy and defines &#147;organised crime&#148;. The framework decision provides for member states to opt either for offences of participating in a criminal organisation or for offences founded on national conspiracy laws. Therefore, we are able to support the framework decision on the basis of the laws that we already have in place. It is an important element in ensuring that there are no safe havens for criminals across the European Union. Through collaboration and through the lists that we have put forward, which the committee say are a step towards an exhaustive list, the minimum and possibly the maximum rules are set out. Criminals will therefore know what will happen to them in any state in the European Union, rather than being able to evade justice. That is particularly important in the area of terrorism.</p>

Most people would accept that we should respect the judicial systems of other countries. We have the arrest warrant. Do we really need to go so far as minimum sentences for these offences? Is she suggesting that countries within the European Union have penalties that are so lax that we need to alter them at a supranational level?</p>

I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, will accept that a number of states in the European Union did not have an offence of terrorism. Although I struggle to remember the exact number, certainly many did not. It was important in the light of what happened, not only in London but, before that, in Madrid and further afield, to decide that member states needed to make sure that they had that offence covered properly. That was one example, but there are others.</p>

<a name="80512-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="08051310000038"></a>When I talk about mutual recognition, when working within the European Union I am looking to make sure that there is recognition of the system operating within a member state&#151;particularly as we are a common law country, while many countries with whom we are working are not&#151;so that we do not get a different legal system imported instead. Looking at cross-border questions, then, one is looking for mutual recognition linked to a system by which one can ensure that jurisdictions operate across the two.</p>

<a name="80512-0017.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="08051310000039"></a>I shall give an example. The idea of the small claims procedure was that it operated in each member state and that procedure could be used across borders. Yet that did not affect the functioning of the individual member state; rather, the system was built on recognising that systems might be different but the outcome should be that a claim could be made to get money back that was owed across the border. That is what mutual recognition is about.</p>

<a name="80512-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="08051310000040"></a>In the context of the lists that were described in the procedure, safe havens may not be a phrase liked by the noble Lord, but is precisely to ensure that in areas where we understand what we mean by criminality&#151;for example, in terrorism&#151;that there is absolute clarity on what will happen within each member state, and that we work together both to bring criminals to justice and to ensure that that justice matches across member states. I do not believe that is contradictory to making sure that individual judicial systems work effectively, not least because of what I have said about mutual recognition. However, it is important to ensure&#151;and we had this example&#151;that if something as grave as terrorism is not recognised within member states then it should be, as part of the great co-operation that should exist between member states in the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="08051310000042"></a>Why is it necessary to have EU legislation, with things introduced by qualified majority voting and a codecision of the European Parliament, as opposed to states agreeing that they want to co-operate on these sensible areas? Those matters do not start and end at the European Union borders. We have to co-operate with the United States and with other countries; why do we need to move away from the intergovernmental process in this fundamental area?</p>

Secondly, there is always a danger&#151;and, if my memory serves me well, my right honourable friend Jack Straw mentioned this in discussion with the European Union Committee&#151;of the lowest common denominator applying.</p>

<a name="80512-0017.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="08051310000044"></a>I can think of circumstances on the Justice and Home Affairs Council, where I sat, where one looked for ways through particular questions but, because of one or two member states having particular issues&#151;which I am not saying were unimportant or irrelevant, but they could none the less have been surmounted&#151;we spent a huge amount of time trying to do that. We did not, in the end, necessarily solve the problems as effectively as we might have.</p>

<a name="80512-0017.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="08051310000045"></a>For example, we have been looking at the recognition of people who have had driving bans. That took place many years ago but it has still not yet come into force. One question, then, in looking within an amending treaty on how to make a union of 27 member states work most effectively is whether there are better ways to do that. Now, from a UK perspective, we have clearly been sure to build into our position that we will not come into a measure on justice and home affairs unless we believe it is in our national interest. Many times, it will be; on occasion, it will not. I did not opt in to every measure. It is important that we retain that power, because we need to ensure that our national interest is always covered, but that is within the context that one&#146;s ambition is that where measures are advanced, they are for the mutual benefit of all member states, so we would want to participate as fully as possible.</p>

Reverting to my question, given that we have the European arrest warrant, which provides for near automaticity of extradition from country A to country B, and given that the European arrest warrant has abolished the requirement that an offence for which a person is being extradited had to be&#151;at least in British law, it used to have to be&#151;an offence in this country, and you can be extradited for an offence that is only an offence in the country to which you are being extradited, why do we need this precise harmonisation of the definition of criminal offences?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="08051310000049"></a>The noble Lord is right to say that the European arrest warrant is a useful and helpful tool&#151;it has certainly been extraordinarily helpful to the UK&#151;but I do not believe that that is the only solution. As crimes become more international in their nature and as serious and organised crime operates across borders&#151;for example, people trafficking and drug trafficking can occur throughout the European Union, and serious crimes can operate in more than one nation state&#151;having a commonality of the minimum tariff, and so on, can be a huge benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="08051310000050"></a>The advantage of the Lisbon treaty in that is that it puts that list forward more clearly.

<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="08051310000059"></a>Amendment No. 58 is about the role of Eurojust and its ability to initiate criminal investigations. As noble Lords said&#151;and I think the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, referred to this&#151;the Lisbon treaty creates a new legal base for Eurojust, building on that which is already in Article 31. It provides an extension of the mandate by envisaging that it could be provided with the power to initiate criminal investigations where at the moment it can only request such action from a member state. Paragraph 2 is clear&#151;and this is important for our discussions&#151;that such formal acts of judicial procedure shall none the less be carried out only by competent national officials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="08051310000060"></a>Although the legal base for Eurojust provides for the possibility for extending the remit, it is clear that the UK could not be bound by such a proposal unless we specifically opted in. It would require a new legislative proposal and our extended opt-in would apply to this provision as to the rest of the chapter. So we would have the right to choose whether we participated in any measures to amend or replace the Eurojust council decision and would do so only if it was in our national interests. I should make it clear, in the spirit of being extremely positive about what works well in Europe, that working with Eurojust has been beneficial to the UK. Since 2002, it has given considerable assistance to the UK and has been central to combating drug and human trafficking, serious fraud, money-laundering and child pornography in Europe.

Article 86 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union includes provisions for the creation of a public prosecutor who would investigate, prosecute and bring to judgment the perpetrators of and accomplices in offences against the financial interests of the Union. We have a double lock on any move to create a public prosecutor. In lock 1, the opt-in applies and we choose whether to participate. As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, it is very unlikely that we would wish to opt into a proposal to create a public prosecutor. In lock 2, unanimity is retained for any decision to establish such a prosecutor and for any decision to extend the prosecutor&#146;s powers. In the unlikely event that we opted into a proposal to establish one, we would have a veto over any decision to extend those powers. In no circumstances can we be obliged to participate in the creation of such a public prosecutor but, as noble Lords have said, if nine of the member states wish to proceed under enhanced co-operation, they are free to do so. That does not affect the UK unless we decide to participate.</p>

The new article sets out the legal base for police co-operation measures. Such measures, as the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, are subject to QMV and codecision. This includes the provision for the collection, storage, analysis and exchange of relevant information. We believe that the exchange of information throughout the European Union is vital; it enables us to work together to tackle common threats such as terrorism and organised crime so that we can pursue and prosecute criminals more effectively. This co-operation has given us access to crucial data-sharing arrangements, such as introducing a mechanism that allows the police to access fingerprints, DNA and vehicle registration information held by other member states. Noble Lords will probably be aware that there was a pilot project with the German police, who accessed data from Austrian police and are now investigating new leads

Noble Lords will know only too well of the potential, and indeed the reality, of the work that Europol has done to break up violent and armed gangs of eastern European robbers who had already committed more than 20 attacks in the UK, to break up child pornography networks and to support the Midlands police force in breaking up a people-trafficking ring that involved Chinese and Iraqi people. Europol is very important. Perhaps its most important investigation involved the Cambridgeshire letter bomber. It gave direct support to the Cambridgeshire police, which led to the apprehension of an individual who was convicted of sending explosive devices through the post. When he was arrested, he was found to be in possession of a number of explosive devices that were ready to be posted. There are direct benefits to the UK in collaborating with Europol.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="08051310000065"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said a little about Amendment No. 94. We will come to this amendment much later on, so I do not want to go into too much detail, although I will say that it is about &#147;financial penalty&#148;. The UK cannot be fined for deciding that it does not wish to opt in or opt out of something. We will discuss that in greater detail. When we come to look at the provision, it will be important to see that this is not about a financial penalty, but about a recognition that, if as a consequence of the UK&#146;s action it becomes inoperable, then it is only reasonable that it may be required to contribute financially to make sure that the consequences of that inoperability are dealt with. I have dealt with that as much as I can. I shall write to the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, on xenophobia, rather than go back into that right now. I hope the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_391"></a><a name="08051310000067"></a>The objects that the noble Baroness has said that those changes are intended to achieve can be equally well achieved by a combination of the arrest warrant and intergovernmental co-operation. I have heard

Indeed, in many respects, informal co-operation between member states in tackling so many of the problems mentioned tonight is probably just as effective as any formal agreement between member states. One should recognise that, just as constitutional conventions in this country play such a crucial part in the successful way we operate governmental affairs, so, equally, conventions between member states can have the same effect internationally.</p>

<a name="80512-0018.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="08051310000068"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, admitted that these changes were important but, rightly, went on to say that the United Kingdom need not be affected by them because it has the opt-out provision. There are, as I tried to indicate in my opening remarks, frailties in the opt-out provisions. However, generally speaking, I accept what he said; but that is not the point of our amendments. They were about what those measures are doing to the European Union itself. In our submission, these measures are changing the character of the European Union in a way that will prove extremely undesirable.</p>

<a name="80512-0018.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_393"></a><a name="08051310000069"></a>It is often said that the threat we are faced with is that the European Union will become some form of executive Government. Some describe it as a state. Originally, under the treaty of Rome, that conclusion would have been difficult to draw from the initial measures. One could say, perhaps, that the Community was federal in that it had a court that could override the decisions of national courts; but one could not say that it had a Government in the sense that national states have.</p>

<a name="80512-0018.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="08051310000070"></a>However, these measures are an undesirable step towards executive centralisation that will prove extremely damaging to the European Union. They will not only affect, adversely, the attitude of citizens to it, but will also undermine all those good things that it has done. I will give you an example. One of the most ingenuous instruments the Community has developed over the years is the directive. It has been fundamental to the success of establishing a single market&#151;its ingenuity lying in the fact that all the implementation is within the power and the legal systems of the member states.</p>

<a name="80512-0018.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="08051310000071"></a>For example, as I indicated in my opening remarks, under Article 83.2 the Union will take on the power with respect to any harmonisation measures to introduce its own criminal law system and to implement it from the centre. This is the destruction of the concept of the directive. It will make member states, in future, extremely reluctant to enter into fresh areas of harmonisation knowing that the directive will be undermined by the Union&#146;s ability to impose rules from the centre. These measures will have a damaging effect on the European Union that goes far wider than what they say in themselves.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000010"></a>I begin with Government Amendments Nos. 105 and 114, which have been agreed with our colleagues in the Welsh Assembly Government. Amendment No. 105 is an amendment to Clause 65, which requires the commission and the Welsh Ministers to co-operate with one another in order to carry out their respective functions efficiently and effectively. Effective cooperation may require information-sharing; one example might be where a patient receiving treatment under the Mental Health Act moves across the border from England to Wales. Under the responsibilities of the commission and the Welsh Ministers to appoint second opinion appointed doctors, one may need to alert the other to an existing certificate provided by such a doctor authorising a patient&#146;s treatment. Amendment No.105 therefore enables this exchange of information.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000011"></a>Section 143 of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 allows the Welsh Ministers to use information gathered in connection with the exercise of a particular function for the purposes of the exercise of other functions. For example, information obtained by Welsh Ministers in assessing a registered care home might also be used by them in considering the appropriateness of a local authority&#146;s actions in determining whether people should be placed in that care home.</p>

<p><a name="0805125000012"></a>Amendment No. 114 is designed to expand the list of specific functions exercised by the Welsh Ministers to which this power to use information will apply to cover new functions they are being given. These include the functions the Mental Health Act Commission currently have in Wales, which are being transferred to the Welsh Ministers, and the functions that are to be given to the Welsh Ministers under the

I beg to move.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0805125000071"></a> Clause 25, page 13, line 27, leave out subsection (4)</p>
</ul>
<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000016"></a>The noble Earl said: Clause 25(4) contains what appears to be a surprising provision. Where a provider complies with a warning notice, the regulator cannot use this as a ground for cancellation, suspension of registration, the imposition of a new condition or the variation or removal of any condition of registration. Why does the Minister believe that in certain circumstances that would not prejudice effective enforcement action? Let us suppose that a provider is served with a warning notice for failing to comply with a particular requirement and then rectifies the failure within a specified time period. In that event, the relevant failure could not be used as part of any grounds for a subsequent cancellation or suspension of registration. Those providers who do just enough to comply with warning notices will be in a stronger position to avoid regulatory action than those who are not served with such notices. That surely cannot be fair.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000017"></a>It could mean&#151;as happened, for example, in the notorious Longcare case&#151;that relevant information is available but is not made known to the regulator. The issue at stake is the provider&#146;s suitability to remain registered, but it is not difficult to imagine circumstances where it would be difficult or impossible for the regulator to obtain a full picture on which to base that assessment. It would amount to a breach of the Soham principle, which is to build up a picture of someone&#146;s previous conduct and attitude in relation to vulnerable individuals.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000018"></a>By the opposite token, if the rules of evidence are constrained in this way, it may act as a spur to the regulator to take more serious enforcement action against a provider without first issuing a warning notice. One could imagine cases where such action was disproportionate. I should be grateful if the Minister explained the thinking behind this part of the clause. I beg to move.</p>

Warning notices under Clause 25 will be an important new sanction which might be appropriate for first-time or minor breaches of regulatory requirements. The issuing of a notice should encourage a provider to change their behaviour to comply with requirements. In the expectation that they will do so, Clause 25 allows warning notices to specify a period in which to correct an issue. The commission will need to specify precisely the failure which concerns it, and which must be rectified within the timescale. If the problem has not been resolved after the period has expired, the commission will be  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC209"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column GC209</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>able to take stronger action if necessary. Allowing for this period will not, however, tie the hands of the commission. Subsection (4) does not prevent the commission taking further, stronger, repeat enforcement action, even within that specified period, if the situation deteriorates, or if the commission has a concern about a separate, more serious issue that arises and was not addressed in the warning notice. For instance, the commission may give an NHS trust or care home a warning notice in relation to poor infection control. If the situation deteriorates, or there is evidence of an additional breach, the commission would take further and immediate action.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000020"></a>Allowing service providers wherever possible the opportunity to address failings while they are still relatively minor seems to be an important part of encouraging improvement, as long as people who are using the services are protected from harm. The Bill allows the commission the freedom to respond appropriately to breaches of requirements of the registration system. As we will discuss over the next couple of groups of amendments, we have deliberately given the commission a more flexible range of enforcement powers than currently exist under the Care Standards Act 2000. This is in response to feedback, particularly from CSCI, and would enable much more effective regulation. The commission will be free to determine which powers are appropriate in a particular situation. The Bill also allows for sanctions to be imposed urgently if necessary. I hope that that addresses the issue raised by the noble Earl and that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="0805125000027"></a>The noble Baroness said: The clause refers to the urgent procedure involved when an application has to be made to a Justice of the Peace to cancel a registration. It requires the justice to take into account the extent to which the commission has paid regard to the duties set out in Section 2(3)(c) and (d) of the Mental Health Act 1983, which refer to the commission&#146;s activities being proportionate to the risks and the need to safeguard and promote the rights and welfare of children and vulnerable adults.</p>

<p><a name="0805125000028"></a>In effect, we are seeking to ensure that the JP is reminded that the decision is proportionate to the risks involved; that it is the last resort; and that it is essential to close the nursing or residential home, ward, clinic or hospital without further investigation.

<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000029"></a>I do not doubt that this measure is necessary. I know that CSCI has used it only nine times in the past year and, knowing the integrity of that organisation, I have no doubt that it was used appropriately. However, this vast new regulator, the Care Quality Commission, will have to have a depth of administration; we know that large organisations are much more difficult to manage and we do not know what level or quality of person will be involved in making these decisions.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000030"></a>For 12 years I was a JP and I remember being called in on a Saturday morning or late in the evening to sit alone and make immediate decisions on some very difficult cases. I was reliant on the information given to me by the police or other authority. The cases were presented as having no alternative. Later, reflecting on a case, I used to wonder whether other possible avenues had been explored. I would have welcomed a prompt to consider the wider issues or, in our context, for the clerk to remind me that I should be sure that a decision was proportionate and that action had been taken to accommodate the other residents or patients.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000031"></a>When I chaired the Brighton health authority we had a case of legionnaires&#146; disease in a ward which was part of a 20-storey block. It was a vast building with numerous wards and theatres, and an accident and emergency department. The chief executive telephoned me and suggested that we evacuate the 20 storeys as they shared the same air-conditioning system. I counselled that we should not panic and resisted the closure. Fortunately, it was contained within a single ward. This amendment is designed to resist the temptation to panic and to give a prompt to a JP sitting alone to ensure that a decision to deregister takes into account all the implications of an immediate closure.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000032"></a>I was delighted to learn that, when the shadow chairman of the CQC was questioned before the Health Select Committee last week on the closure of hospitals or hospital wards, she said that she could envisage situations where licences could be suspended or withdrawn as a very last resort. She said that it was important to remain proportionate, not to regulate blind, and to consider the consequences of such an action. She noted that she currently regulated Sellafield; closing it down might not be the best regulatory approach, but there were firm sanctions that could be taken against management to improve performance. I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, will take a personal interest in making the decision to go to court for an immediate closure. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000034"></a>In deciding to apply for urgent cancellation, Clause 2 already makes it explicit that the commission will have had to balance the risks to service users of cancellation&#151;closing a care home, say&#151;with the risks of allowing that service to continue. It will also need to provide appropriate evidence to the court for a decision to be made. Justices of the peace should make an order only on the basis of the evidence in front of them and on their judgement that the evidence indicates a serious risk to the life, health or welfare. They should not be forced to consider other matters at that stage. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will agree to withdraw this amendment.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000041"></a>The noble Earl said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 61, 62, 109A and 109B. In doing so I bring us to an issue of some importance which the proceedings in another place dealt with only in a rather fleeting and cursory way, and that is the issue of penalties. We see in Clauses 29 and 30 provision made for penalties: first, when a registered service provider or manager fails to abide by a condition of registration; and secondly, where a registered service provider or manager carries on a regulated activity despite the fact that a registration has been cancelled or suspended. In each case the penalty on conviction for an offence is a maximum of &#163;50,000.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000042"></a>I have quite a problem with this, which the Minister may not necessarily recognise. There are cases where a fine, sometimes even quite a hefty one, is an appropriate penalty for someone running, say, a care home and who in some way or other has severely compromised the welfare of the residents. But if we imagine the case of an NHS trust, let us say a hospital, which is seriously falling short on hygiene standards, and that as a direct result patients have been harmed or have even died, I question whether it is appropriate to treat that matter as something to be dealt with only in a magistrates&#146; court. The range of culpability that these offences might cover is quite considerable, of course, but at the worst extreme we  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC212"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column GC212</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>could be talking about very serious negligence on the part of a hospital manager or a care home owner. In my view, the options open to the authorities in a serious case of this sort should include not just a fine, but also a prison sentence, in which case, depending on the circumstances, it could be thought appropriate for the Crown Court to deal with the case.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000043"></a>There is another aspect to this. It is manifestly pointless to fine an acute trust a sum of money for having committed an offence because, as a public body, the fine inevitably will be paid out of public funds. The sum will either be insignificant in the context of the budget, or it will be substantial. But I find it quite difficult to see whose interests will be served by a transfer of money from one public body to another, the net effect of which would be to disadvantage patients. I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s view. Does she agree that in some cases a fine may not be a sufficient or appropriate sanction, and that is what is needed is a rather wider menu of options?</p>

<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000044"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 109A and 109B, which I tabled in response to comments made by noble friend Lord Goodlad arising out of the scrutiny of the Bill conducted by the Lords Select Committee on the Constitution. The point can be dealt with quite quickly, but it is very important. The committee questioned whether it was appropriate for the Bill to contain stand-alone civil sanctions as alternatives to criminal prosecution. It did so bearing in mind the general framework for such powers set out in Part 3 of the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Bill. That Bill contains provisions which are intended to act as safeguards on the use of civil sanctions by regulatory bodies, and the Government themselves brought forward amendments to limit the powers of regulators in a way that in the eyes of the Constitution Committee strikes a fair balance between effective sanctions and due process.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000045"></a>It would have been quite possible for the CQC and Welsh Ministers to be designated regulators&#151;that is the term&#151;as defined in the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Bill, but the Government have not chosen to take that route. As it is, the powers in Clauses 82 and 83 do not contain the kinds of safeguards against misuse or error that might be thought desirable. In its letter to the Minister, my noble friend&#146;s committee said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0805125000075"></a>&#147;There is no requirement for any &#145;notice of intent&#146; before a penalty notice is issued. There is no provision for written representations and objections to the regulator in relation to the proposed imposition of the fixed monetary penalty. There appears to be no express right of appeal against the imposition of a fixed penalty&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000046"></a>In his reply to my noble friend, the Minister explained that the Government have quite consciously created a bespoke scheme for the CQC, which is materially different from the provisions in the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Bill. In particular, he made clear something that I had not previously realised&#151;that the penalty notices under Clauses 82 and 83 are completely unenforceable. The penalty notice procedure depends on the offender consenting voluntarily to pay the penalty. That is apparently why there are none of the safeguards listed in the letter of my noble friend Lord Goodlad.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC213"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column GC213</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000047"></a>I find the concept of an unenforceable penalty regime quite extraordinary. Can the Minister give an example of any similar scheme established in primary legislation? The whole idea seems decidedly quaint, like something that Sergeant Wilson from &#147;Dad's Army&#148; might say to a miscreant member of the Home Guard&#151;&#147;I say; I'm afraid you&#146;ve been very bad. Here is a penalty notice. Would you mind awfully if I asked you to pay it some time at your convenience? There is no hurry at all. Thank you very much&#148;.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000048"></a>That idea is very odd. Whereas my noble friend Lord Goodlad believed that the penalty regime appeared to be overly draconian, it turns out that the regime has far fewer teeth than it needs if it is to be at all credible. I should be grateful if the Minister would enlighten us further about why the Government have taken what seems to be a highly novel approach to this aspect of the CQC's enforcement framework. I beg to move.</p>

Clause 30 puzzles me. The registered person or registered manager is liable to a conviction and fine up to &#163;50,000, rather than the organisation, such as an NHS trust. However, a fine of &#163;50,000 for an organisation with a turnover of &#163;400 million would be nonsense. Can the Minister clarify the practicalities? Who in an NHS trust provider would be liable to receive the penalty?</p>

<p><a name="0805125000050"></a><a name="80512-gc0001.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80512-gc0001.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="0805125000088"></a>Lord Campbell-Savours:</b> Like the noble Earl, Lord Howe, I cannot see the logic behind the proposition, but I want to turn to another aspect&#151;the question of care homes. Clause 30 refers to persons, managers and a &#163;50,000 fine. I know that I missed part of a Sitting the other day, and this may have been dealt with then, but what is the process? If a warning is given, but does not have any effect, urgent action is taken. Does the care home close? Does it stop trading? Does someone else move in? Who pays the fine? In the event that the fine is paid, is not the maximum a rather small amount when fees are generally around &#163;1,000 a week? One week&#146;s take in a home with a reasonable number of beds would cover the fine. It seems that people could prolong this process.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000051"></a>Perhaps I am missing something in the Bill, but one would think that there would be a way of directly intervening to ensure that there could be no harm; the conditions and the problems are dealt with; the management is changed; and, most importantly, that the people living there are not disrupted, which has to be a major consideration. The &#163;50,000 fine seems out of proportion to the problem being dealt with.</p>

<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC214"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column GC214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>robust, appropriate and timely action, and use a range of sanctions to protect patients and people using care services. The commission therefore will have a flexible range of enforcement powers and will be able to use its judgment to decide which approach would be most effective in which circumstances. I shall expand on that, which I hope will answer some of the questions raised during this discussion.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80512-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="80512-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000053"></a>This range is in response to the feedback, particularly from CSCI, in devising a more flexible range of powers than exist in the Care Standards Act 2000. Initially, the Care Quality Commission might decide that it is necessary to increase only the frequency of monitoring and inspection visits, but it can escalate to statutory warning notices, penalty notices, cautions, conditions on registration, prosecution through to suspension or even cancellation of registration.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000054"></a>The enforcement powers are an important part of the new commission&#146;s armoury. Providers operating outside the remit of their registration could pose a serious risk to patients and service users. For example, a care home&#146;s registration might be subject to a condition not to provide services to people with learning disabilities because it does not have appropriately trained staff in place. Failure to comply with such a condition would clearly be serious. It is therefore entirely appropriate that the penalty on conviction for each such offence can be a fine of up to &#163;50,000. The range is up to &#163;50,000 and multiple offences can attract multiple fines, which I hope answers one of the questions raised by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000055"></a>If the Care Quality Commission concludes that a fine is not the most effective way of addressing a problem, it will use its other powers&#151;for example, suspending or cancelling registration. That fine is addressed to the corporate organisation; that is, the business, the trust or whichever part of the care and health services being addressed by that issue. On the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, I should say that we do not believe that increasing the upper limit to &#163;250,000 is necessary because of the option to have multiples of &#163;50,000, should that prove to be necessary.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000056"></a>Although the fines should be significant enough to be taken seriously by the provider, the level of fines is not intended to be set at such a high level as to damage the local care economy or have a negative impact on patients or service users. But fines should have an additional deterrent effect, partly because of the stigma attached. On whether this is taking money away from front-line services, where fines and penalties are incurred by NHS trusts, we are looking for a practical administrative way to return the money to local commissioners to be reinvested for the improvement of services, so that local populations do not lose out through incompetence.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000057"></a>I now focus on Amendments Nos. 60 to 62, which would allow for imprisonment on summary conviction. In line with Ministry of Justice guidance, sentences of imprisonment have been reserved for the most serious of offences: the offence of not having registration.  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC215"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column GC215</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>That is, first, because the commission will not be able to use any of its other powers in these cases and, secondly, because operating without registration potentially puts patients and service users at great risk. This offence is therefore triable either in a Crown Court or a magistrates&#146; court and is punishable by an unlimited fine and/or a custodial sentence. Where a provider is registered, the commission will have the full range of enforcement powers at its disposal, and in those cases it would not seem appropriate to make failure to comply with conditions an imprisonable offence. Therefore, we do not think that these amendments are necessary.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000058"></a>The three existing commissions, which the Care Quality Commission will replace, were outside the scope of the Macrory report&#151;the report that proposed the regulatory powers in the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Bill, recently debated in your Lordships&#146; House, and which form the basis of Amendments Nos. 109A and 109B. That said, the Care Quality Commission&#146;s power to issue penalty notices is consistent with the six Macrory principles as applicable to health and social care. Penalty notices are intended to assist in changing the behaviour of the offender, to act as a punishment, and to attach public stigma to non-compliance with regulatory requirements, as well as acting as a deterrent to future non-compliance.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000059"></a>In both the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Bill and the Health and Social Care Bill, the penalty is intended to be an alternative to prosecution. However, fixed monetary penalties in the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Bill are enforceable by the regulator and, therefore, subject to a notice of intent, written representations and a full appeal structure.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000060"></a>By contrast, penalty notices under Clauses 82 and 83 of the Health and Social Care Bill require the offender to consent to pay the penalty, with the threat of something worse. The penalty notice procedure offers the recipient an opportunity to discharge liability for the offence. If they do not, the commission would, of course, be free to use any of its other enforcement powers against that person, as it considered appropriate, instead. We therefore do not believe that a provider will turn down the option of a penalty notice lightly. This Bill does not make provision for a notice of intent, written representations or a right of appeal in respect of penalty notices because it does not need to. Clauses 82 and 83 are deliberately constructed in that way, which we believe provides for an efficient and effective sanction which meets the specific needs of the sectors that are to be regulated, avoiding the potential for delay and legal expense associated with the prosecution of offences or indeed any other sanction that requires full appeal rights.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0805125000061"></a>In answer to my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours, Clause 84 sets out that the commission will issue guidance on how it will exercise its function in relation to cancellation, suspension notices and penalty notices. Before my noble friend arrived, we had had a discussion about the balancing of risks that that would involve and how those decisions could not be taken lightly.</p>

If there are two systems, and the first system related to healthcare and the recycling of funds, what other kind of organisations would recycle the money? How would it be recycled, and under what code of practice would that happen? If there is not a similar provider in that given area, would the money go to another provider? Having worked in this area, I know that it is crucial that the rules on penalties are clear, straightforward and simple. The difficulties encountered in the past by CSCI in deciding, with providers, whether there would be a fine or closure, lead me to hope that it will be clarified rather than left as it is. Despite my views on this, it would also be useful if all the providers had very similar regulations, bearing in mind that we are supposed to be aiming for greater conformity between the two.</p>

My noble friend referred to multiple penalties; if the manager of a care home took an action which came under the heading of &#147;subject to penalty&#148; against a particular resident, I presume that that would incur one penalty. If the manager took similar action against another resident, would that be treated separately? Is that what my noble friend means by &#147;multiple&#148;? If, say, half a dozen residents were affected, would that mean a fine of half a dozen times &#163;50,000, which is a potential penalty of &#163;300,000?</p>

The penalty scheme is a coherent scheme that will be applied across the board; it is not a dual scheme. As we read the various clauses, it is clear that it applies all the way through. On how fines are recycled, the only assurance I can give at the moment relates to those that involve public funding. We are still looking at how the others might be recycled or what could happen to them. I cannot give a specific answer at this point, but no doubt we will return to this issue.</p>

<p><a name="0805125000067"></a>While I cannot comment on any specific instance&#151;indeed, it would be wrong of me to do so at this point&#151;if a provider offends in many different ways, a fine can be imposed relating to each of the different instances. However, I am not going to state specifically what those ways might be, although it could be a fine

I noted with interest the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, about a dual system, but I think the Minister said that it is not a dual system. Does that mean that if a small residential home comprising around eight beds and a large hospital both have a situation where a health-acquired infection such as MRSA is present, it is a question of degree? The fine imposed on the small residential home may well force it to go bust, whereas the state-funded hospital is likely to continue to function. Further, if the hospital is fined, we understand that the money is given to the commissioners who then return it to the hospital so that it can improve its services. Presumably that would not happen with the residential home because it is a private organisation.</p>

Obviously, the impact of the sanction would, as I have already mentioned, have to be taken into consideration. To be completely clear to my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours, if there are six breaches, six fines can be applied.</p>

I congratulate her on selling a difficult issue. It is difficult to have a system of fines that applies to St Thomas&#146;s Hospital as well as a tiny place. As the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said, flexibility is fine, but these things only work if there is clarity and transparency. They will have to be a little bit more definite if they are going to work.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0805129000003"></a>However, I want the Minister to respond to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, about who will be fined. In Clause 30, the fine relates to managers. The Minister said that the fine would be levied on the corporate entity. She will understand from some of my amendments down the track that this is a particular issue of mine. For the sake of our understanding, could she deal with that point again? What she said appears to be at odds with what is in Clause 30, which is an important point, partly because, in the NHS, it is not always possible to tell who the manager of the service is.</p>

Something goes seriously wrong in an NHS hospital. The hospital is fined: it does not matter what the sum is. The money goes into one pocket and it is given back to the hospital to do something with. Where does the fine go, and what on earth is the point of fining the taxpayer? I always find that slightly dotty because it just goes round the system. It is not a real fine and the only people who suffer are the public.</p>

I see nods around the Committee, because noble Lords seem to understand my point; that is, that the aim of the fine is not to make the patients suffer but to encourage the hospital&#151;or whichever part of the health service is being dealt with&#151;to improve and for the commissioners to look at the best way to reinvest in services in that area.

<a name="80512-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0805129000018"></a>The Minister made some helpful comments on the amendments. She said that she was not drawn towards the option of a prison sentence as an alternative to a fine, and I think that she said that the Government did not consider this option appropriate or necessary. I am not sure that I heard a logical, underpinning argument for that point of view, except that, in the eyes of the Government, a failure on the part of a provider to be registered in the first place is a more heinous offence, where a prison sentence could be appropriate.

<p><a name="0805129000019"></a>On Amendments Nos. 109A and 109B, it is simply wrong to set up a system of unenforceable penalties. Of course, the unspoken&#151;or perhaps even explicit&#151;threat is that if you do not pay up, you will be taken to court. However, you will not be taken to court for failure to pay the penalty, but for breaching the regulations governing registration. One must ask how ethical or proper it is for the threat of a more severe penalty to be used as a lever to force someone to comply with a less severe penalty. If the less severe penalty is regarded as the appropriate sanction for the offence in question, then that framework of penalties should stand or fall on its own terms. That surely means having a set of safeguards of the kind outlined

We would expect the commission to continue the good work of the Healthcare Commission and CSCI, and make as much information available as possible through its website.

This amendment arises from concerns expressed by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, on which we both sit. It refers to the person who is not satisfied with how a complaint has been handled by the service provider. The amendment is clear, probably because it has been drafted by us rather than by draftsmen who make certain that no one can understand it without assistance, about four QCs and 300 guineas an hour.</p>

Similarly, the Bill maintains the distinction between private- and public-funded service users for the purposes of complaint. This is a distinction which Age Concern calls on the Government to end. It supports the amendments proposed during the Bill&#146;s passage through the House of Commons, which provides for the establishment of an independent complaints body operating alongside the CQC.</p>

This amendment is an attempt to do something about that. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, and several Members of the Committee have expressed sympathy with this proposal, but that the Government feel that it is not necessary. I am not convinced.

They are frightened of complaining. If they do complain, they fear that there may be a vindictive rebound against them.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0805129000044"></a>In order to inspect the true quality of a service, how it handles its complaints can be extremely telling. Complaints that go through NHS trusts are, by and large, pretty well handled, but they are better handled in some trusts than in others. In the trusts where they are better handled, one also has the sense that the whole attitude is more patient-focused. The big principle behind this amendment is in terms of collecting important data on how patients or clients who feel that they have not been handled properly are able to express their voice.</p>

<p><a name="08051219000001"></a><a name="80512-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80512-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08051219000037"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> I think we all agree that it is vital that complaints are dealt with effectively. Having listened carefully today and at Second Reading, I think that most noble Lords have also agreed that complaints are best dealt with and resolved locally, where there is familiarity with the issues and organisations involved.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051219000002"></a>The current second stage of the NHS complaints process, with external consideration by the Healthcare Commission, has lengthened the overall process for handling complaints. The Healthcare Commission&#146;s series of reports, entitled <I>Spotlight on Complaints</I>, demonstrates that having an independent body with powers to review complaints can also discourage some organisations from doing a thorough job and resolving them at a local level. So several factors need to be taken into consideration. Neither the Healthcare Commission nor CSCI supports the idea of the Care Quality Commission having a role in dealing with individual complaints, and neither does the Health Service Ombudsman, who is gearing up to be the second stage complaints receiver. We therefore want to put the emphasis on ensuring that in the first instance all providers operate good complaints handling procedures, which encourage effective local resolution and enable providers to use information from complaints to improve service delivery, as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, said.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051219000003"></a>As part of contract monitoring, PCT and local authority commissioners should also monitor how well the providers from which they commission services respond to complaints and take appropriate action when the response falls below an acceptable standard. This information on complaints-handling can therefore be used to inform subsequent commissioning decisions. As I have said before, we believe that the best way in which the Care Quality Commission can support these aims is through the registration requirements, subject to the feedback from the ongoing consultation. I wondered how long it would take me to refer to the consultation document. The paragraph about responding to people&#146;s comments and complaints specifies that there should be clear, simple arrangements for handling complaints and dealing with them.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051219000004"></a>The Care Quality Commission will thus have a very important role in assessing how well providers are handling complaints. It will be able to use a variety of methods for checking whether providers are complying with requirements. It may use case tracking, as CSCI does, to see whether the service that an individual receives, or the way a complaint is handled, meets the individual needs of the people receiving care. There will of course be an independent view through the ombudsman&#151;</p>

<a name="80512-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051219000007"></a>The goal should be to improve local arrangements for dealing with complaints, which should mean that there will be no need for independent consideration between the local level and the ombudsman. The response to our recent consultation on complaints reform, <I>Making Experiences Count</I>, generally supported that approach. There is one specific exception: the Care Quality Commission will continue to have a specific function regarding complaints about the use of powers and duties under the Mental Health Act, as currently carried out by the MHAC.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051219000008"></a>The rationale for this specific provision is that patients subject to some form of compulsion may not have easy access to the usual means of making a complaint&#151;as in the NHS and social care complaints procedures. However, the MHAC&#146;s role here is less that of an appeals function and more about advising and helping patients to make complaints through the appropriate channels. We have every reason to think that that will continue to be the case when the Care Quality Commission takes over that specific role. We acknowledge that in social care there is a particular issue for people who arrange or purchase their own care independent of the local authority and that they do not have access to the statutory complaints procedure, with its independent resolution via the ombudsman if necessary. We are looking at the issue very seriously and I hope we will be able to make a substantive proposal in the very near future.</p>

There is a problem with where the complaints go in the private sector, because people cannot use the ombudsman. There is a problem with the Care Quality Commission taking on a function by which it receives complaints from the general public. That should not happen&#151;that is not what the body is there for. I am in a serious muddle as to how the Care Quality Commission, when it is formed, will link up with the complaints procedure in the health service, in local authority and private care homes, and in mental health services. The Committee probably deserves some sort of flow chart to show us exactly where a complaint goes when it starts with an individual patient or client. We need to

<p><a name="08051219000012"></a>The one thing that I do not think that she has addressed&#151;and I was extremely pleased to get support from the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay&#151;was the very serious problem of the elderly, who are in the evening of their lives and very vulnerable and may not even have relatives. We know the tragic stories of old people who are never visited, and so on, which is the result of keeping people alive longer. We know all the reasons&#151;but, consequently, they become more and more vulnerable and more and more frightened. They are frightened to complain. I do not think that the Minister addressed that point at all. I may be doing her an injustice but, again, I notice little nods around the Room. Will she please, before Report, really look at the point of the vulnerable old being terrified of having their tenancy terminated?</p>

The point that I was trying to make&#151;and I apologise if it was opaque&#151;was that the Care Quality Commission&#146;s job will be to set up the very best and most robust regulatory system to ensure that complaints are handled properly, including ensuring that those who are most vulnerable can have their voice heard. That is its job. We must therefore ensure that the regulatory framework that we agree further down the line does that.</p>

It is a question of power, and we must get this right. Apparently there is no clear  way for individuals&#151;and here I include individual members of staff who know that something is wrong&#151;to make a complaint without fear of their job or their situation being worsened. It is important that we send a clear message on this.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051219000016"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, and I have expressed our confusion because some of us understand that individuals cannot take their complaint directly either to the Care Quality Commission or the ombudsman. Who is going to take up such complaints? We need a clear explanation and guidance on exactly what will happen because this is a serious situation where people have almost total power over some of the most vulnerable in our society.</p>

This is one of the problems that arises out of trying to combine health services, social services and mental health services under a single huge commission. A lot of the thinking seems to have come from the health side; many of us are worried that social services will either be ignored or it will be assumed that the same procedures that operate when a patient makes a complaint about the health service can also apply to social services, but they cannot. This is a big problem for the new commission, which is why I say again that this reorganisation is being undertaken far too soon and is going far too far.</p>

She had always been used to giving herself her own medicines. She was a highly intelligent lady who was able to finish the <I>Times</I> crossword the day before she died, so there was no problem with her mental functions. However, the male charge nurse caring for my mother decided that she was an alcoholic because she liked a glass of sherry before lunch, a glass of wine with dinner and a glass of brandy before going to bed. He concluded that she was incapable of administering her own drugs. Her dignity was taken away from her when she was told that she was not capable of taking her own medicines, and she simply fell apart. She rang me in a panic, so I went over and reminded the young man of who paid his salary. He gave my mother&#146;s medicines back to her. However, my mother suffered at his hands every time he was on duty until she died, and indeed after she died because he insisted, although it was clear that she had died from natural causes, that there should be a post mortem in case she had taken an overdose.</p>

<p><a name="08051219000019"></a>When someone from our walk of life can suffer in such a way, let us consider the position of those who have no advocate, no one to stand up for them. They need an exceptionally strong support system. This is not like purchasing something in Currys and then going back to complain about it. This concerns physical comfort, well-being and peace of mind.</p>

Amendment No. 66A would make plain what happens when individuals who are providers of care go into individual voluntary arrangements with their creditors&#151;when they have serious financial difficulties that are one step short of bankruptcy. There is no requirement on the part of the administrator appointed under the IVA to notify the commission of his appointment. The amendment suggests that administrators of individual voluntary arrangements should be put on exactly the same basis as trustees in cases of bankruptcy.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051219000032"></a>Amendment No. 66B deals with the situation arising from the death of a registered provider under Clause 38. It is envisaged that the person or representatives of the person who has died may carry on a regulated activity, albeit for a short time, to safeguard the needs of users. If a registered person running a small care home dies, those looking after their affairs can carry on that business for a short period of time so that vulnerable users do not have to be moved. This is a small and limited measure and I do not imagine that it would apply in many cases, but it could happen. The amendments are in the best interests of users because people in care homes are vulnerable and being moved without notice is known to be harmful to them. I beg to move.</p>

It requires that, if a registered individual becomes bankrupt, the trustee of the bankruptcy must notify the commission of their appointment and may be required to appoint a registered manager to ensure that the regulated activity continues to be provided in line with the relevant requirements. Amendment No. 66A, as the noble Baroness outlined, proposes that similar provision is made in relation to the licensed insolvency practitioners who administer individual voluntary arrangements.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000002"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness that the commission would need to be notified that a registered individual might need to enter into an individual voluntary arrangement, as the health, safety and welfare of people receiving those services could be put at risk. However, I am not sure that Clause 37 is the best place to make provision for this. Individual voluntary arrangements are a means by which people who can no longer afford the repayments on a debt can arrange a refinancing package with their creditors. Such agreements can draw assets, such as the value of any share a person may have in a property or business. However, the supervisor does not take control of the individual&#146;s business, as would be the case were they to declare themselves bankrupt. They would simply be acting as an intermediary between the individual and their creditors.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000003"></a>In most of these cases, the individual would continue trading, so could remain registered, or could choose to cease trading and cancel their registration in the normal manner. Were their financial situation to worsen and they declared themselves bankrupt, the existing provision in Clause 37 would have effect. I do not therefore believe that an amendment to Clause 37 is necessary.

<a name="80512-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000004"></a>Clause 16 also allows for regulations to include requirements as to the financial position of a person registered as a service provider. These do not form part of the current consultation but will be covered by a consultation later this year. However, regulations currently in force under the Care Standards Act, on which the new ones will be based, cover matters such as financial viability and agreements with creditors. In particular, existing regulations include requirements for current bodies to be informed if a service provider is likely to become insolvent in the next six months. We envisage making similar provision under Clause 13. This addresses the intention behind Amendment No. 66A.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000005"></a>Amendment No. 66B would enable people appointed under Clause 37 to act as the registered service provider for a specified period. Clearly, as long as the business remains operational, it will be important that services are overseen by someone with the appropriate skills to ensure that safety and quality requirements are adhered to. Clause 37 already allows for the person who takes control of the business to be required to appoint a suitable manager to ensure that this happens. However, it would not be appropriate to expect someone who is stepping in to arrange the financial wind-down of the business to accept responsibility for the safety and quality of service it provides, even on a temporary basis. As I have already said, in the case of individual voluntary arrangements, the insolvency practitioner does not assume control of the business anyway. Nor would it be appropriate for the official receiver, as an officer of the court and a member of the Insolvency Service, who would be the trustee or liquidator of last resort in bankruptcy and court winding-up cases, to be asked to register.</p>

If a small service provider has to go into an individual voluntary arrangement, it is then in serious financial difficulties. I suspect that the Minister is as aware as I am of the very strong temptation for small businesses in that situation to attempt to try to trade their way out. A reason for proposing this amendment is that some people who buy this care will do so on their own behalf, so it is important that they are protected.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>

<p><a name="08051233000013"></a>Clause 38 [<I>Death of registered person</I>]:</p>

<p><a name="08051233000014"></a><a name="80512-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80512-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08051233000226"></a>Earl Howe</b> moved Amendment No. 67:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051233000193"></a> Clause 38, page 18, line 38, leave out from &#147;in&#148; to end of line 39 and insert &#147;a case where&#151;</p>
</ul>(i) a sole person has been registered under this Chapter as a service provider in respect of a regulated activity, and(ii) the person has died;&#148;
<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000015"></a>The noble Earl said: This is no more than a simple drafting matter. Clause 38(1)(a) says that regulations may,</p>
<ul><a name="08051233000212"></a>&#147;provide for the provisions of this Chapter to apply with prescribed modifications in cases where the only person registered under this Chapter as a service provider in respect of a regulated activity has died&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051233000182"></a>It is clear what is meant, but I wonder whether the syntax and sentence construction could not be made a little better. If we talk about a situation where the only person registered under this chapter as a service provider has died, it rather suggests that the provision might apply only where one person in the whole country was registered as a service provider and that person has died; but we do not mean that. In an effort to be helpful, I have proposed an alternative form of words, which I hope that the Minister will consider. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08051233000016"></a><a name="80512-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80512-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08051233000227"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> Clause 38 deals with what happens when somebody who is registered as a service provider dies. This mirrors a requirement that currently applies under Section 35 of the Care Standards Act 2000. In these situations, it will clearly be important that there is some continuous service provision and, equally, that services are overseen by somebody with the appropriate skills to ensure that safety and quality requirements are adhered to. This will be particularly important where the service provider is also managing the services.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000017"></a>The clause therefore allows for regulations to set out the procedure that will apply for notifying the commission of the death of a service provider. This would obviously be a sensitive time for those involved, and it will be important that the commission is notified within a reasonable timescale and that there is clarity about the procedure for doing so. I had some sympathy with the noble Earl when he read out that paragraph because, when I read it, I agreed. However, the lawyers tell that this must be so, and this is how it must be worded.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000018"></a>As for the current legislation, Clause 38(1)(a) makes it clear that regulations may provide suitable arrangements for those cases where there is only one person registered as a service provider in respect of a specific regulated activity and that person has died. Amendment No. 67 probes the wording and meaning of this provision. Drawing on the fact that under the Interpretation Act 1978 a &#147;person&#148; includes a body of persons corporate and unincorporated&#151;that is, companies and government departments&#151;the amendment seeks to clarify that this provision can, and should only, apply to natural people; in other words, &#147;a person&#148;.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000019"></a>I hope that I can reassure Members of the Committee that the meaning is already clear from the context, and that these provisions, as currently

I hope that Members of the Committee will therefore agree that we need not redraft these provisions and that the amendment can safely be withdrawn.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051233000194"></a> Clause 42, page 20, line 27, after second &#147;of&#148; insert &#147;health promotion and&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000033"></a>The noble Baroness said: I make no apology for returning to health promotion. I took care to read some of last week&#146;s debate on the Bill, particularly the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, in which she said that she always found health promotion rather boring. I beg to differ&#151;I do not find it boring in the least. In my early years as a general practitioner, I used to think that if you could make a patient happy, they were usually healthy or they thought that they were. It was an important thing to do. One of the reasons I went into politics was that I decided that patients were usually unhappy because of circumstances such as terrible housing, poor education or too many or too few children. They were not matters which concerned the health service.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000034"></a>The downside&#151;if I dare utter it in this Building&#151;of having a national health service free at the point of delivery is that a high proportion of patients somehow devolve their own healthcare to the National Health Service. That was certainly the case with an awful of patients whom I saw. Their healthcare was no longer any of their concern. What they did to their bodies, how they abused them or how they lived did not matter, because the health service would put it right. We have to recognise that some  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC231"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column GC231</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people do not give a fig, because they know, think or say, &#147;It&#146;s my right to have it put right if I abuse myself in this way&#148;.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000035"></a>Another factor that prevents good health promotion is confusion of messages. It is quite extraordinary how much the press and the media will grab any little thing. A medical researcher may come up with something in some obscure journal&#151;for example, if we all drink lots of red wine, we will all be extremely healthy, because that is what happens in France. That is a crude example, but there are numerous other such examples of silly, small research projects being publicised in this way. Having been a junior doctor, I know of people who are desperate to get into the press, to get their name in print and get a paper written. The newspapers will take it up and, as a consequence, the general public become incredibly confused.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000036"></a>I was a community services manager in Ealing a long time ago. One of my clinics was in Southall, an area with a large Asian community and, consequently, high levels of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. At one end of the clinic, dentists would tell mothers and children that they must end their meals with a nice, bland piece of cheese because the acid from fruit would rot the enamel of their teeth. At the other end of the clinic, the health visitors were waging a huge campaign to try to stop the population of Southall eating animal fats, cheese, ghee and so on because that was terribly bad for their health and would give them heart attacks.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000037"></a>I promise the Committee that that sort of thing goes on in one clinic. I suspect that it still goes on in some GP surgeries. Sadly, over the past 10 years, community services and community clinics have tended to disappear because the targets for the primary care trusts have been all about hospital care and GP care. That has shown some benefits because the promotion of those targets has seen, as the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, said last week, a reduction in deaths from heart disease; a reduction in deaths from many cancers; and much better investigation and treatment of many cancers. A lot of good work is going on because of those targets and because of the work being carried out in general practices and in hospitals.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000038"></a>The work that used to be done primarily by community workers, health visitors, district nurses and school nurses was crucial in young people's lives: they were told what they should be doing, what they should be eating, when they should start having sex and so on. Over recent years, services such as family planning and sexual health clinics have been reduced. We have not seen much movement in teenage pregnancy rates, but we have seen a rise in HIV rates, a rise in sexually transmitted diseases up and down the country and, of course, a rise in obesity because no one is receiving the sort of advice which health visitors and school nurses used to give routinely to mothers, babies and small children. Alcoholism is rampant. I do not know where one lays the blame for that, but I suspect that advertising and manufacturers&#146; profits have much to do with the rise in alcoholism.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000039"></a>There is a huge job to do and the need to promote a particular lifestyle may be different in each community. I know Southall well and I know that we had to work on particular problems there. That is why this should be done at PCT level. We feel that, in future, the Care Quality Commission should ensure that the primary care trusts do not neglect all those services for health promotion and health prevention which are so essential. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08051233000040"></a><a name="80512-gc0004.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80512-gc0004.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08051233000232"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> I completely agree with the noble Baroness, particularly on the need for clarity in health campaigns and what a huge job there is to do. In carrying out reviews of the provision of healthcare, by and on behalf of PCTs, the commission must consider PCTs&#146; health promotion activities. That chimes in exactly with what the noble Baroness was saying. For example, if a PCT is running public health campaigns on screening programmes, the commission should be able to assess how the PCT activity has contributed to it meeting that particular need in its local population.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000041"></a>That is why Clause 92 clarifies that the provision of healthcare includes the promotion and protection of public health and the provision of services connected with the provision of healthcare, except in relation to the commission&#146;s registration functions under Chapter 2. For the purposes of Clause 42, therefore, healthcare absolutely includes health promotion, and I hope this addresses the intention behind Amendment No. 74.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000042"></a>Amendments Nos. 99 and 100 seek to require the commission to keep the Secretary of State informed about the improvement of NHS care and adult social services as well as provision. Clause 49 is very broad. It is aimed at ensuring that the Care Quality Commission can provide any information and advice to the Secretary of State. It is vital that there are good lines of communication between the commission and the Secretary of State. The commission will build up knowledge and expertise while carrying out its functions which it may then draw on to provide advice to the Secretary of State. The clause will enable the commission to advise the Secretary of State on the improvement of statutory healthcare and adult social services. Such advice will be vital to the Secretary of State in developing the appropriate requirements to ensure that services are safe, of good quality and continue to improve.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000043"></a>As Clause 2 already requires the commission to perform its functions for the general purpose of encouraging improvement, it will need to advise the Secretary of State of relevant matters&#151;that is, the improvement of services&#151;to properly fulfil this role. I therefore believe that the Bill makes adequate provision to ensure that periodic reviews of PCTs and those acting on their behalf cover health promotion. Under Clause 49, the commission will be able to advise the Secretary of State about improvements as well as the provision of NHS care and adult social services. So I would ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000047"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 74A, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 75A and 75B. I wish to point out something that I have mentioned already on a couple of occasions. No material circulated for the recruitment of the chair of the Care Quality Commission made any mention of comprehensive area assessments, nor did they mention local government. A key driver for the commissioning and provision of social care&#151;although not for its assessment&#151;is the comprehensive area assessment for all English local authorities, which is audited by the Audit Commission. The comprehensive area assessment requires local authorities to state how they will address and improve the social and health outcomes of the population and to make an assessment of the prospects for improvement of health and social care. It monitors closely how well local organisations work together in order to achieve those outcomes.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000048"></a>The comprehensive area assessment is key to social care&#151;its planning, assessment and monitoring. Its absence from primary legislation, as with so much of this Bill, appears to be downgrading key parts of social care. Therefore, these three amendments seek to restore that emphasis in primary legislation by requiring local organisations to show how their work will contribute to the comprehensive area assessment. Much of the work that CSCI does is done in tandem with the Audit Commission. In social care those two bodies look at many of the things which affect people&#146;s lives. In a way, this is a redress of that.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000049"></a>The other matter which these amendments seek to probe is what exactly is intended by the word &#147;periodic&#148;. Comprehensive area assessments are annual; the word &#147;periodic&#148;, when last I looked in the dictionary, is ill defined. It does not state what the period is going to be. What are the periods to which &#147;periodic&#148; refers? I beg to move.</p>

As described by the noble Baroness, the CAA forms part of the new local government performance framework, set out in the Government&#146;s 2006 local government White Paper, <I>Strong and </I><I>P</I><I>rosperous </I><I>C</I><I>ommunities</I>.

She is correct to say that the work of the CAA is very important&#151;and in her comment on the fact that CSCI&#146;s work is already integrated into that, which gives us an indication of how that is likely to continue.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000051"></a>As my honourable friend the Minister clarified in another place when debating this Bill, where the indicators used in reviews under Clause 42 relate to local authorities working alone or in partnership with PCTs, other NHS bodies or other local service providers, they will form part of the single set of national indicators to be used in comprehensive area assessments. The commission will work closely with the Audit Commission to ensure that that happens. The national indicator set was announced in October as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review; the details of the indicators are being published by the Department for Communities and Local Government. There are 31 indicators covering health and well-being and adult social care which appear in the national indicator set and the NHS vital signs to support partnership working.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000052"></a>The Government have also commissioned the seven current inspectorates with a role in local authority assessment to work together to develop and test a methodology for carrying out CAAs, and they carried out a joint consultation on their proposals in November last year. This methodology has been trialled in four local areas in order to work through in more detail how the CAA will need to operate on the ground. The learning from this process will be reflected in a second joint consultation this summer, which will set out more detailed methodologies for the CAA, along with more structured piloting in a further 10 authorities. The first joint CAA judgments are then expected to be published by the relevant inspectorates, which will include the Care Quality Commission, in the autumn of 2009. This will be a transition year, with full implementation the following year.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000053"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will be reassured from this that arrangements are being taken forward to ensure the Care Quality Commission&#146;s assessments will be fully integrated into the CAA process and that she will therefore agree to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0004.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000054"></a>Under current legislation, the Healthcare Commission and Commission for Social Care Inspection are required to review NHS bodies and local authorities on an annual basis. We have altered this to allow more flexibility, precisely because we believe that the commission is best placed to decide on the frequency of periodic reviews and the periods they cover. Of course, the commission will also want to take into account the timing of comprehensive area assessments in making that decision.</p>

Anybody looking at Clause 42 sees a range of health providers in there and one mention of adult social services. The reason for tabling these amendments was, again, to try to rebalance the legislation towards social care. I am afraid that that must be done.

<p><a name="08051233000056"></a>I take the point about allowing a degree of flexibility, but were the CQC not to be involved on an annual basis with comprehensive area assessments then the resulting documents would be somewhat lacking.

<p><a name="08051233000059"></a>The noble Earl said: This is a probing amendment, prompted by genuine puzzlement. In Clause 42 we find the provisions which will enable the commission to conduct periodic reviews. Subsection (2) refers specifically to English NHS providers, for each of which the commission will have to review the healthcare provided, assess the provider's performance and publish a report. The question posed by this amendment is why this provision should not also encompass anyone who provides NHS care; in other words, any independent provider contracted to the NHS.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000060"></a>The Explanatory Notes make it quite clear that we are only talking about NHS bodies that provide services. That seems odd. Part of the point of the Bill is, at long last, to place the NHS and the independent sector onto an equal footing for regulatory purposes. We must look forward to Clause 45 to find anything relating to periodic reviews of non-NHS providers; but there we see that such reviews will rest entirely at the discretion of the Secretary of State. There is a regulation-making power in Clause 45 that would enable him to require the commission to review some or all registered service providers; some or all regulated activities; or particular aspects of a regulated activity.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000061"></a>I question why the review of non-NHS providers should be subject to approval in regulations, which may or may not be made, whereas the review of NHS bodies would be provided for in the Bill. We are not talking here about situations where an NHS trust subcontracts with an independent provider&#151;my understanding is that those situations would indeed be covered by Clause 42&#151;but where services are directly commissioned by a PCT or a GP from a private provider. What are the Government&#146;s intentions as regards enabling the CQC to review these services? How will the CQC be expected to configure itself and to plan ahead if there is uncertainty about what services it is going to monitor and regulate? As I have said, I am genuinely puzzled by what the Bill appears to propose here and I therefore beg to move.</p>

I feel uncomfortable when I read a split infinitive, and even more uncomfortable when someone says, &#147;This data is&#148;, not recognising that &#147;data&#148; is plural and that it should be, &#147;These data are&#148;.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000063"></a>I am uncomfortable, I have to say, with this ugly phrase, &#147;NHS provider&#148;, which might be construed as meaning that the provider is providing the National Health Service. I appreciate that it may be that in other parts of this and comparable legislation the term is used and has become hallowed by usage.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000064"></a>Having said that, I feel just a trifle uncomfortable with the amendment proposed by the noble Earl and the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, because to replace &#147;NHS provider&#148; with &#147;provider of NHS care&#148; suggests that all that the NHS provides is care. As we were reminded just a few moments ago by the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, the NHS is supposed to provide preventive medicine as well as care. I would feel more comfortable if the amendment suggested inserting &#147;provider of NHS care and services&#148;, which would clarify the matter much more satisfactorily.</p>

<p><a name="08051233000065"></a><a name="80512-gc0005.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80512-gc0005.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08051233000239"></a>The Countess of Mar:</b> I am horribly confused by this term. I understood for a long time that NHS provider meant someone from the independent sector providing services to the NHS. That term became common parlance during the time when the noble Earl&#146;s party was in government and I have used it frequently. I am all for plain English and would support it to the hilt, but we need a bit more clarification on what this phrase means.</p>

The noble Earl has given me the opportunity, yet again, to point out that the mixing of health and social care is unequally demonstrated in this chapter. The heading is, &#147;Quality of health and social care&#148;&#151;and the notes to the Bill talk about that; then we go into &#147;Health care standards&#148;. Nowhere do we have social care standards, which are mixed up with &#147;Reviews and investigations&#148;. The whole chapter is a mish-mash of bits and pieces put together, which simply makes me feel, again, that social care is being relegated to a secondary status within the whole of the Bill. That is what this chapter reflects, and the various other esoteric points about the linguistics are a reflection of that greater, more strategic position.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000070"></a>My understanding of Amendment No. 75 is that it is intended to widen the scope of periodic reviews to  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC237"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column GC237</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>independent sector providers of NHS care. I agree that, as the private sector is increasingly playing a role in helping to deliver effective public services, we must ensure they are subject to the same scrutiny and assessment, so that the public can determine whether they are getting value for money.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000071"></a>Under subsection (1) of Clause 42, the commission is already required to carry out reviews of the provision of healthcare by primary care trusts and by others under arrangements made by PCTs. This already means that the commission will review the provision of NHS care by independent providers as part of its review of how well PCTs are commissioning and providing services for their local populations. The same applies to local authority commissioning of adult social services under subsection (3).</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000072"></a>In addition, under Clause 45, there is provision to extend the periodic review functions through regulations. This would enable wider reviews of independent sector provision to be carried out and it is our intention to use this clause to continue the quality ratings system that CSCI has just introduced once the registration system is up and running in 2010.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000073"></a>The situation in the NHS is different. There is a large number of small, private sector NHS contracts and we do not think it would necessarily be appropriate that there should be reviews of every individual independent provider of NHS care which would be hugely resource-intensive. It is more appropriate for small contracts to be managed by PCTs with an oversight by the commission through reviews of the provision of healthcare by and on behalf of PCTs. If necessary, we can also use the powers in Clause 45 to require the commission to conduct additional reviews of certain providers or of particular types of care.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000074"></a>Therefore, I think that the Bill provides scope to meet the intention behind Amendment No. 75 and I ask the noble Earl to withdraw it.</p>

I am not at all sure what activities will be covered by which part of either of those clauses. I am sure that there is time enough for us to obtain greater clarity on this.

</ul>
<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000083"></a>The noble Baroness said: We do not like the way Clause 42 has been written, particularly subsections (4), (5), (6) and (8). The clause gives powers back to the Secretary of State which, to put it simply, we do not want him to have. The amendments would restore the position established by the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003. These subsections, being introduced in 2008, represent a diminution of the powers of CSCI and the Healthcare Commission. In particular, the Secretary of State is taking to himself powers which under existing legislation belong to the commissions. These changes will give further control to the Secretary of State, although I thought we were all for devolving power and decentralising these things. It does not look like it here.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000084"></a>The amendment to subsection (4) would reinstate the wording of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003, but uses the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="08051233000213"></a>&#147;by reference to such indicators&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051233000183"></a>rather than &#147;by reference to criteria&#148; as in the Act. It is a small but important change. The amendment would ensure that the Care Quality Commission devised the indicators of quality and the Secretary of State approved them. In other words, both functions would not be held by the Secretary of State.</p>
<h5><a name="08051233000220"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000085"></a>Although the Secretary of State can delegate this function to the commission under subsection (5), there would be no need to if he or she had confidence in the Care Quality Commission. As the Bill stands, it looks more like an arm&#146;s-length body obeying the Department of Health than an independent body advising and informing the Secretary of State objectively and authoritatively.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000086"></a>There are good reasons for the Care Quality Commission developing indicators of quality and its own methodology for assessing performance: it would reinforce the commission&#146;s independence from the Government; it would enable the public to have confidence in the credibility of the findings of the commission, which they would not have if it was under the diktat of the Secretary of State; the Secretary of State would not duplicate the expertise of the Care Quality Commission; and it would give credence to the Government&#146;s statements that they are transferring the powers of the existing commissions into the Care Quality Commission, which we thought was their intention.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000087"></a>Taken as a whole, the clause changes the nature of the accountabilities. It is clear that the Care Quality Commission will be accountable for delivering its functions through annual reviews and a five-yearly

The clause allows the Secretary of State to take on responsibility for those methodologies without having the responsibility of making it work. It would therefore undermine the credence of government statements that they would build on the experience and expertise of the existing commissions. We strongly feel that the Secretary of State has to trust the new Care Quality Commission to set the criteria. It is an independent body, and the general public would expect it to be so. I beg to move.</p>

All of them concern periodic reviews and inspections.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000089"></a>Reviews have been an important tool for both the Healthcare Commission and CSCI. They have proved to be an effective way of improving standards and quality of services. These two regulators, because of their different remits and markets in which they operate, have fashioned different ways of inspecting and reviewing. The Healthcare Commission has a lot of detailed information, gained through the different reporting mechanisms in the NHS, with which to monitor performance. It not only reviews and publishes but returns to ensure that its recommendations bear fruit. In the foreword to its report, <I>Learning from Investigations</I>, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh wrote:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051233000199"></a>&#147;I served as a member of the Healthcare Commission for the years covered by this report and know very well the benefit of the powers given to it by Parliament to carry out investigations on behalf of patients. Early interventions and the identification of root causes are the best way to ensure improvement. But the use of an independent and authoritative voice to highlight problems and suggest improvements also means that lessons are learned quickly and on a wide scale, whether they relate to the safety of maternity services, the support and care provided to people with learning disabilities or the management of infection in our hospitals&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000090"></a>Professor Keogh concludes his foreword by saying:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051233000200"></a>&#147;This report makes clear why it is in the interests of patients and the public to have a strong, independent, regulator&#151;one that is empowered to decide when investigation is needed, undertake its work in a robust and professional manner, and publish its findings and recommendations for improvement&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051233000184"></a>Sir Bruce is, of course, the medical director for the whole of the NHS. We could n have a more authoritative voice on the necessity for the regulator to be independent. The Government would do well to listen to their own doctor.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000091"></a>CSCI&#146;s approach is different from that of the Healthcare Commission, in that it has a paucity of detailed information because it is regulating a wholly different service which is largely privately provided. Its approach has been to theme its reviews. <I>Time to Care?</I> was the first ever comprehensive review of the state of domiciliary care services. It highlighted problems for those receiving care, delivered in just 15-minute slots. <I>A Fair Contract with Older People?</I> brought the nation&#146;s attention to the raw deal experienced by self-funders. <I>State of Social Care in England 2006-07</I>, published in January, highlighted the poor quality of life experienced by people excluded from services by the impact of rising eligibility thresholds set by councils. As a result, the

The review is due by September this year.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000092"></a>I am sure that this piece of work will be trusted, because it is being carried out unfettered and independent of the department. One of the core qualities to engender and maintain trust in an organisation is for that organisation to be open, transparent, and honest. The opposition to Part 1 of this Bill and the changes that it proposes is due to the fact that all three regulators have been so successful in engendering trust. Their hallmark has been integrity and honesty. They bring to the attention of the Government and the nation, through independent reviews and inspections, the shortcomings and the concerns in certain services or institutions. They are to be trusted. We want our regulator to keep a watchful eye and, without fear or favour, speak out when matters go awry. If it is known that the Secretary of State is meddling in these affairs, the CQC will simply be seen as a poodle of government; it will not be respected or believed.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000093"></a>Before a review is undertaken, the regulator must decide what indicators of quality will be used as the benchmark against which services are to be judged. That is only fair and proper for those being regulated. The indicators are entirely a matter for the regulators. They know the business; after all it is their business, and not the business of the Secretary of State, some erstwhile politician here today and gone tomorrow. I am not being disparaging, but it is a fact well recognised; there is nothing in the present legislation to state that quality indicators are the province of anybody other than the regulator.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000094"></a>I am surprised that, through this Bill, by changing what is in current legislation, the Secretary of State should want to interfere and fetter the freedom of the new CQC. Action on Elder Abuse only a day or two ago welcomed CSCI's introduction of quality ratings for care providers. Through this work we are made aware that around 70 per cent of all registered providers have achieved an excellent 3-star or a good 2-star rating. We should rejoice in that. Only 3 per cent of all 24,370 providers fall into the poor category. They clearly need attention. The rest, 24 per cent, are adequate, with the remainder being either new services that have not yet been given a rating, or services that are subject to enforcement action by CSCI.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000095"></a>Commenting on the new scheme, Gary FitzGerald, chief executive of Action on Elder Abuse said,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051233000201"></a>&#147;We very much welcome the introduction of Quality Ratings for Care Providers as a concrete example of empowering older people and their families when making difficult and life changing decisions about care&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051233000185"></a>He continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051233000202"></a>&#147;We commend CSCI for this initiative. We now expect local authorities to use Quality Ratings to inform their commissioning processes and drive out services that tolerate poor practice and abuse. We will certainly be questioning those local authorities who consistently commission services from poor providers of care. Older people who use and depend on these services deserve nothing less&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC241"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column GC241</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08051233000186"></a>So here is an organisation which is going to use CSCI's work to improve standards. It clearly trusts the independent information provided and is being helpful to the Government. We are surely all at one in wanting the highest standards and the greatest love, care, and attention when we and our friends and relations are at our most vulnerable.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000096"></a>However, we strongly disagree with the Government on the erosion of trust caused by the Secretary of State in devising the indicators&#151;Clause 42&#151;and, in Clause 43, approving the frequency and period to which reviews relate, preventing the commission revising reviews without the Secretary of State's permission and, worse, giving a power to the Secretary of State to modify reviews. That is meddling&#151;big time. Where is the independence when the Secretary of State modifies a review to suit his needs because the results are uncomfortable, or a general election or a by-election is on the horizon, or the Prime Minister is in personal difficulty? Why should we trust the new regulator if we know that the review has been modified to suit the Government's needs and that a spin has been placed on it?</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000097"></a>I hope that the Minister will recognise that Clause 42(4) and (8)(a), and Clause 43(1)(b), (3) and (4) do no favours for the Government and that she will agree to our amendments which are simple in the extreme. All that is needed is a little red marker pen to strike a few words out of the Bill, thus giving the CQC the credibility which it will need.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000098"></a>Amendment No. 103ZA is slightly different. In Clause 57 the regulations&#151;the Secretary of State, not the CQC&#151;may prescribe the frequency of inspections prior to registration, the manner in which they are to be carried out and the type of person who is authorised to conduct them. Again, this is serious interference and is not in current legislation. Why does the Secretary of State want to be involved in the detailed operation of the day-to-day running of the commission's business? I should have thought he already has enough to do. Is he really going to say who should be undertaking the inspection? Will he decide what professional qualifications are necessary? If so, there is a very real danger that the experts by experience, who are so valuable in the current CSCI system, would be ruled out of order. Earlier, we debated the vulnerability of elderly people in relation to the complaints procedure. It is often the experts by experience who can detect what is wrong and report it on behalf of the individual concerned. If the Government wish to stipulate by whom and how inspections prior to registration should be carried out, there is hardly any need for this Bill. It could be done through a contract with the Department of Health. However, I do not believe that is what the Government want. I believe they want a successful Care Quality Commission that is respected and trusted throughout the land.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000099"></a>On this clause, all the Government have to do is to amend subsection (1) to read, &#147;The Commission shall determine&#148;, rather than the present wording which is, &#147;Regulations may prescribe&#148;. I hope that the Minister agrees that is a splendid idea and that it fulfils the Government's desire for an independent regulator.</p>

<p><a name="08051233000100"></a><a name="80512-gc0005.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80512-gc0005.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08051233000249"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> I have listened carefully to the debate and I wish to reassure Members of the Committee by repeating that the Government are committed to the independence of the Care Quality Commission. As we have discussed throughout the drafting of the Bill, we have sought to strike the right balance between ensuring that the commission is able to act independently and provide independent challenge while being a key player in the wider health and social care systems. I fear that this is one of the areas where we may disagree about the balance.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000101"></a>The new commission will have a wider range of enforcement powers that it will be able to use to take independent enforcement action against registered providers when they do not meet the required levels of safety and quality. For the first time, these will also apply to NHS providers. This represents a significant increase in independence compared with the Healthcare Commission or CSCI. We have sought to explain that the work and independence of CSCI and the Healthcare Commission will be carried forward in how the commission will do its work, including, for example, the rating system as explained by the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000102"></a>In terms of the periodic reviews in Clause 42, we believe that it is important that the Secretary of State should retain a role in setting the indicators. This is to ensure that they are an accurate reflection of the outcomes the Government have committed to delivering in response to what patients, service users and the public have stated they want health and adult social care services to deliver.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80512-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000103"></a>We intend these indicators to be outcome-focused, covering the full range of health and adult social care services rooted in the department&#146;s strategic objectives. The focus on outcomes provides the flexibility for local organisations to make decisions on priorities for their local communities. For example, we have already discussed the new comprehensive area assessments and how essential it is that the commission&#146;s reviews feed into them. The power for the Secretary of State to set the indicators will help ensure that the reviews support assessments across health and well-being and adult social care, and contribute fully to comprehensive area assessments.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000104"></a>The new commission will, from the very beginning, be an integral partner in agreeing with the Secretary of State the right set of indicators to assess and evaluate both health and social care organisations in its reviews. The commission will be responsible for drawing up the methodology by which bodies will be assessed and evaluated, and will be able to advise the Secretary of State on what indicators would be appropriate. However, I have reflected on these amendments and confirm that it is our intention to delegate the function of setting the indicators of quality for English NHS providers to the commission from the outset, in recognition of its role in enforcing the registration requirements providers have to meet. In doing so, it will need to draw on the indicators used to assess commissioner performance so as to align with the outcomes that patients and the public expect.</p>

<p><a name="08051233000105"></a><a name="80512-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80512-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08051233000250"></a>Baroness Tonge:</b> Before the Minister continues, I want to raise two points. She said that the quality indicators would be for the English health service. What about social care? We always come back to this. Does she mean health and social care in England? That is my first question.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000106"></a>Secondly, we are again talking about indicators of quality. I ask Members of the Committee to look at Clause 42(4) and (5). Subsection (4) states,</p>
<ul><a name="08051233000214"></a>&#147;a body&#146;s performance is to be by reference to such indicators of quality as the Secretary of State may devise or approve&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051233000187"></a>That means that if we had a real dictator of a Secretary of State who thought that he knew the lot, he would devise and approve all the quality indicators, but if we had a really weak Secretary of State who was not terribly interested in this and was due to be moved to another position, under subsection (5) he could direct the commission to,</p>
<ul><a name="08051233000215"></a>&#147;devise indicators for the purposes of subsection (4) and submit them to the Secretary of State for approval&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051233000188"></a>This is a muddle and it is not clear how independent the Care Quality Commission is going to be in devising indicators of quality.</p>

<p><a name="08051233000107"></a><a name="80512-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80512-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08051233000251"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> We have already had several discussions about this. I realise that some Members of the Committee wish to strike out any role for the Secretary of State, and are therefore discussing the levels of involvement, influence and how this will work when the commission is established. The point is that, regardless of the character of the Secretary of State, the Government are committed to certain outcomes that we will need to ensure are integrated into the work of the new commission. We are seeking to find a way in this Bill to ensure that that in fact happens.</p>

<p><a name="08051233000108"></a><a name="80512-gc0006.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80512-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08051233000252"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> I am not opposed to subsection (5). We are saying that the Secretary of State may direct the commission to devise the indicators; that is fine. We do not like, as per our amendments,</p>
<ul><a name="08051233000216"></a>&#147;the Secretary of State may devise&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051233000189"></a>which we would delete. We do not want him to devise, but we are happy that he may request that the commission do so.</p>

<p><a name="08051233000109"></a><a name="80512-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80512-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08051233000253"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> I appreciate that that is the point we are discussing.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000110"></a>To repeat what I said about the indicators, it is our intention to delegate the function of setting the indicators of quality for English NHS providers to the commission from the outset. We are only delegating to the NHS because local authorities will use the CAA indicators to set their quality indicators. In doing so, we will need to draw on the indicators used to assess commissioner performance so as to align with the outcomes, as I have said. We are therefore unconvinced that Amendments Nos. 75C and 77A, proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, and Amendments Nos. 77 and 78, proposed by the noble Earl, are necessary.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC244"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column GC244</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000111"></a>I am sure that Members of the Committee would agree that it is important that the methods by which the commission will assess performance when carrying out a periodic review are transparent. For this reason, we have included a requirement for the commission to publish its methodologies and indicators used in periodic reviews. We are requiring the method statement and indicators devised by the commission to be approved by the Secretary of State, so that he can maintain oversight and ensure coherence. In particular, these provisions will help the Secretary of State to ensure that the methods proposed do not place an unreasonable burden on those being assessed. Amendments Nos. 77B and 77C are therefore unnecessary.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000112"></a>Similarly, I would like to explain the rationale behind the requirement for the Care Quality Commission to seek the Secretary of State&#146;s approval before publishing the frequency of periodic reviews and the period to which they will relate. This is separate from the issue of commencement of special reviews, which we will be coming to later. We agree that the ability for the commission to programme its reviews and studies independently is essential. Under current legislation, the Healthcare Commission and the Commission for Social Care Inspection are required to review NHS bodies and local authorities on an annual basis. We have altered this to allow more flexibility, as I have previously explained, precisely because we believe that the commission itself is best placed to decide on the frequency of periodic reviews. </p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000113"></a>However, there must be effective communication on this matter between the Secretary of State&#151;ultimately responsible for the performance management of the NHS&#151;and the commission. It will surely be beneficial to all concerned if the commission and the Secretary of State agree on the frequency of reviews. For this reason, rather than anticipating that the Secretary of State will interfere, we have included the requirement for approval from the Secretary of State, which Amendments Nos. 79, 80 and 81 seek to remove.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000114"></a>Indeed there needs to be a dialogue between the commission and the Secretary of State, and between the commission and other relevant people such as health and social care service providers and other regulatory authorities, on what activity is appropriate and what issues should be seen as priorities. Clause 77 should ensure that service providers are aware of the work programme that the commission will be undertaking. This requirement to consult will be particularly important because there has been some criticism about the burden that may be placed on providers, particularly the NHS, where studies or reviews require new information to be collected. We wish to ensure that the work of the commission does not impose an excessive burden on those being regulated, and therefore has a proper balance.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000115"></a>We have discussed these issues with both CSCI and the Healthcare Commission during the preparation of the Bill, and they agree that this is an appropriate arrangement. I therefore cannot agree to Amendment No. 107. Crucially, the Secretary of State is given no power to prevent the commission from undertaking the activity it decides is appropriate. The commission  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC245"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column GC245</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>may undertake any investigation, regardless of whether it is in the proposed programme, if it considers there to be a risk to the health, safety or welfare of persons receiving health or social care. I am unable to find where in the Bill there is a power for the Secretary of State to modify the CQC&#146;s reviews and reports, as referred to by the noble Baroness.</p>

<p><a name="08051233000116"></a><a name="80512-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80512-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08051233000254"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> Perhaps I could help the Minister on that or perhaps I have misread it. Clause 43(4) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051233000203"></a>&#147;The Commission must publish the document&#148;&#151;</p>

<ul><a name="08051233000217"></a>&#147;as approved or modified by the Secretary of State and as revised from time to time&#148;.</ul>

As I have already said, the commission may undertake any investigation, regardless of whether it is in the proposed programme. As well as carrying out reviews, the commission will inspect providers for compliance with the registration requirements. We recognise that in most instances, the commission will be best placed to decide how often it carries out inspections to assess compliance, who should carry them out and how they should be carried out. Different approaches to inspection may be required for different services or different issues.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000118"></a>However, as we stated in the delegated powers memorandum, we believe that it is appropriate to make provision for the Secretary of State to be able to prescribe how certain inspections are to be carried out in particular circumstances. This might be to ensure that the assessment of compliance is consistent with government policy and priorities. We envisage that in the majority of cases the commission and the Secretary of State will agree these matters jointly. The provisions debated here are intended to ensure transparency and coherence for service users, patients and the public, as well as providers, and to minimise the burden on providers. I agree wholeheartedly that to be effective, the new commission must be able to act independently.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000119"></a>Clause 43 refers to the frequency of reviews, not the reports themselves. I can see where the confusion has arisen and I shall seek to clarify that to make sure that we are correct and on the same page on that issue. Following my explanation of how the Bill has been drafted to set out the appropriate balance of independence, I hope that the noble Baroness feels able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I have no problem with the Secretary of State having some influence and involvement. Anyone who has worked in any authority knows that, ultimately, you have paymasters and you have to work with them, which works quite well.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000121"></a>I am concerned about the implication that, because the regulator may not be proportionate in its regulation&#151;which is what the reply suggested&#151;the

If anyone knows about the usages and the work of providers at the local level, it is the regulators through their regulatory inspections. I only hope that that was not implied in the noble Baroness&#146;s response.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000133"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 83, 87, 89 and 101A. Once more I shall try to convey to the Minister the scope of social care which this new body is going to have to regulate, not just in terms of the number of providers but in terms of the differences between client groups. I refer to the needs of people with learning disabilities, older people and those with mental health problems. This is an enormous, disparate and complex set of objectives to meet. If the legislation goes through, one regulator will have to suffice. In this set of amendments we seek to translate to the new body something which has worked effectively for CSCI, and that is the commissioning and production of special reviews.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000134"></a>CSCI plays a uniquely strategic role in social care. It is one of the few bodies that gets to draw comparisons between different providers working in different sectors. I am not sure whether it is possible to convey this to  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC247"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column GC247</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Lords, but my sense is that in the NHS, people have a clear understanding of what is going on with other providers of healthcare. That is not the case in social care. Some service providers are very small and have little connection even with other providers in their own locality. Indeed, I have yet to come across a PCT that can produce a totally comprehensive list of the social care provision in its own area, a list that takes into account all the small and voluntary providers operating in the area. What CSCI does in relation to regulated services has been uniquely important to the scope and depth of its reports. These amendments would require the new regulator to carry on with the function of commissioning and conducting special reviews.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000135"></a>Special reviews have become a method of addressing issues which, although serious, often go unnoticed. The noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, referred to a number of its reports, one of the most effective of which was published earlier this year. It demonstrated what people in social care felt was the case, but often could not prove: by and large, local authorities are commissioning care solely for people who are in acute need. Basically, they are not commissioning for those in any of the other four categories in their access to care services criteria. It was a tremendously important piece of work.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000136"></a>Through its special reviews, CSCI has not only set out the scope of what is going on, but has assisted in developing evidence-based social care, which is an extraordinarily difficult thing to do. It requires the establishment of data gathering over long periods, and CSCI has begun to do this work. Under the Bill, the commissioning and production of special reviews is to be reduced to a &#147;power&#148;: that is, it is something which the commission has the power to do but is not required to do. My amendments, particularly Amendment No. 101A, would change that power into a function. The noble Lord, Lord Darzi, and I had an interesting debate on the first day of our proceedings on the meaning of &#147;functions&#148; and &#147;objectives&#148;, but for the moment I accept that the Bill gives the Care Quality Commission functions as opposed to objectives. Given that, the amendment provides that the production of special reviews should be a function.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000137"></a>In addition, the amendments make it clear that whoever is calling the tune on deciding the quality measures for outcomes, the commission will be able to commission its own special reviews and will not be confined solely to matters deemed to be important by the Secretary of State. Moreover, under Amendment No. 83 it will have the resources to enable it to do that. Having commissioned those reviews, it will have the power to make recommendations to the Secretary of State. Whatever one&#146;s view of the preceding group of amendments, the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, was right to point out that what CSCI knows uniquely in relation to providers should enable it to make recommendations to the Secretary of State. I beg to move.</p>

The Government should have no difficulty at all in accepting it on two clear counts. One is that the world has changed significantly since the Bill was first published.

The commission&#146;s carrying out this function will be extremely helpful.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000141"></a>Secondly, when the commission was first proposed, it was said that this kind of work would not be done at the beginning because it would be settling down. We have now accepted that it will settle down rather faster than was originally thought. Let us hope that that is so and that the commission can get on with this work. I am more familiar with the Commission for Social Care Inspection than with the Healthcare Commission but they both hold extraordinarily valuable information across the health and care sectors and it would be a huge pity if they did not get on and use that. There is now experience about working together. They have produced their document about duplication which outlined the type of work that they were doing together and we all know of the various reports that have been produced jointly. As I said, I cannot see why the Government would have any problem at all in accepting this amendment.</p>

They seem eminently reasonable. What is at issue is the ability of the commission to carry out thematic reviews, particularly in the social care area. For the reasons outlined by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, about the sheer variety of social care establishments of one sort or another that there will be, the ability to focus on and highlight particular types of issue in this way, and produce recommendations, should be an essential part of the work of the new Care Quality Commission.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000143"></a>Given that part of what needs to be done is to give people confidence that this new body will look clearly at the social care as well as healthcare parts of its remit, conceding on this amendment would help give people confidence that social care will not be the poor relation in this new family.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000145"></a>Clause 44 allows for exactly that, and I agree that this is a crucial role for the new commission, hence the clarification in Clause 2(2)(b) that the commission&#146;s functions include its review and investigation functions under Chapter 3 of the Bill. I therefore believe that the provisions in the Bill as drafted already achieve the intention behind Amendment No. 82.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000146"></a>Clause 44 also does not limit what special reviews and inspections may relate to. It allows the commission to look at any aspect of NHS or adult social care provision. As such, I believe that reviews or investigations could encompass any of the types of issues that might arise from the commission&#146;s agreed objectives, as proposed by Amendment No. 87. Not only will the Care Quality Commission have the freedom to determine when and how to conduct reviews or investigations under this clause but also it will have greater powers than the Healthcare Commission currently has. The new commission will be able to act directly where a registered provider is not meeting the levels of safety and quality that users are entitled to expect. Where initial action appears to be having no effect, there will nearly always be room to escalate the matter and introduce stronger sanctions to suspend or cancel registration.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000147"></a>As discussed, the commission might act following an inspection of an individual provider, or on concerns that arise as a result of a wider periodic or special review. We would of course also expect NHS organisations to take account of broader issues arising from the commission&#146;s reviews and investigations. It should surely be for the NHS bodies to determine the most appropriate action to take, taking account of local needs and priorities. Primary care trusts, as commissioners of local services, and strategic health authorities as performance managers will hold the NHS to account for the quality of provision and whether it meets local needs.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000148"></a>Clause 49 already provides the necessary channel for the commission to escalate concerns, or make specific recommendations about the actions that it feels the Secretary of State should take to address those concerns. That could be particularly helpful where the commission has concerns across a health and/or adult social care economy, where the commission cannot already act itself. That is an issue that the Healthcare Commission, in particular, has raised. I realise, however, that Members of the Committee remain unconvinced that the wording of Clause 49 is explicit enough, and I am therefore happy to look again at how we can clarify that the commission is able to make recommendations to the Secretary of State on issues including&#151;</p>

It has been brought to my attention recently that &#163;14 million was allocated for contraceptive services to the primary care trusts. It was not ring-fenced. No targets were attached and it was used by some primary care trusts to make up their deficits, even though we know that contraceptive services are deteriorating and doctors

It is assumed that the GPs do this work, but most of them cannot train and they have not done any training for long-acting reversible contraceptives. Patients therefore no longer have the choice of contraceptive they used to. So it is terribly important that, when budgets are allocated for a specific use but not ring-fenced, the Care Quality Commission goes back and ensures that they have been used for that purpose. </p>

I was saying that we would agree to consider Amendment No. 89 and clarify how the commission is able to make recommendations.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000151"></a>I hope that I have been clear on the importance we attach to these reviews and investigations. Of course, the commission has a whole range of important functions apart from its review functions, not least establishing and operating the registration system. The commission will have to decide how best to allocate its resources appropriately in order to fulfil all its statutory obligations across health and social care.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000152"></a>I understand that Amendment No. 83 stems from a concern that the commission&#146;s operating budget may reduce its capacity to undertake this kind of work, particularly in relation to social care. However, the operating envelope that we have agreed for the commission in 2009-10 supports our commitment to rationalisation and reduction in unnecessary regulatory burdens across government. This is based on the findings of the Hampton review and the work of the Better Regulation Executive.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000153"></a>Both the Healthcare Commission and CSCI are operating within a similar budget in 2008-09 and have already achieved significant reductions in their running costs without sacrificing their programmes of reviews and studies. There is no reason why the Care Quality Commission&#146;s budget should restrict its ability to carry out this activity as well, for either health or social care.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051233000154"></a>Members of the Committee should note that, as a last resort, it would be possible under Schedule 1 for the Secretary of State to attach conditions to the funding he provides to the Care Quality Commission. However, fundamentally, it should be for the commission, as an independent body, to determine how it allocates the resources available to particular functions. I hope that these reassurances will be sufficient to allow Members of the Committee to withdraw their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="08051233000158"></a>Clause 50 enables the commission to undertake or promote studies carried out by other people, which are intended to result in recommendations for improving statutory health and adult social services. There will be occasions when the commission needs to take this broader view, and we agree that this is an important additional role for it. This is why we have included Clause 50, which allows the commission to take on this role. I reassure the Committee that carrying out studies will continue to be a function of the commission. Under Clause 2, it will be required to perform its functions for the general purposes of encouraging the efficient and effective use of resources. Studies that the commission carries out under Clause 50 will be one way in which it can achieve this. I hope that that address the intention behind Amendment No. 101A.</p>

<p><a name="08051236000002"></a>At times we appear to be inching towards agreement, but at other times we are as far apart as ever. In her response, the noble Baroness again talked about the fact that registration is a new process for the NHS and therefore a novel burden for the service, but it is not new for social care. One of the ways that social care has gone beyond that is in the form of regulation set out in these amendments. Given that, perhaps the noble Baroness will understand, even if she cannot agree, that we are concerned that social care should not be pulled backwards by the process envisaged for it.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000007"></a>The noble Baroness said: The issue addressed by this amendment is one that has seized the minds of people involved in social care more than many others. We have talked at length in considering the last two groups about the expertise which already exists in social care to conduct special reviews and the importance of them in influencing outcomes for those receiving services. This amendment seeks to ensure that the CQC is able to conduct special reviews from day one of its inception rather than having to wait for a period of one year, as provided in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>

However, given the substantial registration process that will need to be established within that year, we believe that there should be a transition period during which it does not conduct special reviews&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Health and Social Care Bill Committee, 17/1/08; col. 310.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051236000073"></a>In the world of social care, that comment has been greeted with a great deal of scepticism. That scepticism goes back to two reasons to which noble Lords have already referred at different points in our deliberations. I have said before that Ministers underestimate the scope and the pace of change going on in the commissioning and provision of social care services. Ministers have underestimated the cumulative effect of their own policies such as <I>Putting People First</I>, the introduction of individual budgets and so on. I also think that they underestimate how difficult will be the rolling out of individual budgets from the group which already has them&#151;those with learning disabilities who have a lot of support&#151;to other client groups. Given that, there is potential not just for very bad practice on an individual basis, but for patterns of bad practice to form in the coming two years. It is not right to leave individual recipients of care at some risk because the regulator is not up and fully functioning; nor is it right to leave providers for that same period. A credible reason for the one-year delay has not been given.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000009"></a>I refer to the points made to the Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Patel of Bradford. He was confident that he would carry forward his staff and their existing expertise into the new commission. If the Bill stays as it is, with a year-long bar on the performance of special reviews, the new commission is at risk of losing the expertise of staff transferred from CSCI. I beg to move.</p>

I simply add my firm support for everything which the noble Baroness has just said. It is not for the Secretary of State to fetter the operational freedom of the commission in relation to special reviews. If the commission decides to limit its work to certain areas during the first few months of its existence, that should surely be a matter for it. Once Ministers start saying that they will not allow the CQC its statutory functions in a manner that the chief executive believes to be necessary, we are into some very unwelcome political manipulation of a kind which Ministers have foresworn in our debates up to this point. I hope that the Minister will reassure us on this important point of principle.</p>

I hope that my understanding is true and that reporting will be a function, even during the early stages of the new commission&#146;s existence.

I have listened carefully to the views just expressed, particularly the wisdom of the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth.

The commission will be able to carry out reviews into publicly funded or commissioned services on both specific and more general issues.</p>

<p><a name="08051236000014"></a>In both your Lordships&#146; House, and in the other place, we have heard much debate on the commencement of these provisions. It had been our intention to delay the commencement of the power to carry out special reviews and investigations for a year, other than to investigate matters that could pose a risk to the health, safety or welfare of people receiving health or social care. This was so that the commission and NHS providers could fully focus on ensuring that the new registration system would be up and running from 2010. It was certainly not because there was any doubt about the value of the reports the existing commissions have produced. However, having reflected on the concerns raised by so many in your Lordships&#146; House and elsewhere, including from the current commissions, I am pleased to be able to confirm that this is no longer our intention. The commission will decide for itself what reviews are necessary from the outset, taking account of the resources available to it and the need to fulfil all its statutory functions.</p>

<p><a name="08051236000015"></a>As the Committee will appreciate, there is actually no need to amend the Bill to achieve this: we simply need to commence the clause on the date that the commission takes on its other functions.

<p><a name="08051236000026"></a>The reasoning behind determining in regulations whether the commission is required to publish a report of its review or to assess the performance and publish reports of its assessment is important. In some cases, it may be enough to simply make the report of the review available&#151;for instance, where we want the commission to review only the activity that an independent sector provider is carrying out for the NHS. In these cases, the level of provision may not warrant any kind of judgment on the overall level of quality as the results of the review will speak for themselves. However, in relation to social care, as I have already said, we intend to make regulations which will allow the continuation of CSCI&#146;s quality

<p><a name="08051236000033"></a>The noble Earl said: This amendment is very much in the same vein as Amendment No. 89, which the Minister kindly said that she would take away and consider. It has been prompted by puzzlement on my part as to why under Clauses 46 and 47 the commission is to be given powers in relation to failings by English local authorities and Welsh NHS bodies but is not being given similar powers in relation to failings in relation to English NHS bodies.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC256"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column GC256</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80512-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000034"></a>The key point here is that when the CQC has conducted a review or investigation of an NHS trust, it may have uncovered issues that need to be addressed not only by the trust but by the wider NHS community. In those circumstances, where patients are seriously at risk and there are lessons to be learnt of general applicability, the CQC should have the power to make appropriate recommendations to the Secretary of State. It may not be right in certain situations for the commission to suspend or cancel a provider&#146;s registration. That course of action could well be thought not only too draconian but also impractical.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000035"></a>If, for example, as at Northwick Park hospital, failings are uncovered in maternity services, the closure of the whole unit is simply not an option, bearing in mind the need for expectant mothers in the locality to have a hospital in which to give birth. On the other hand, there could well be a case for the commission to say, &#147;We have inspected the maternity unit at Northwick Park and uncovered significant failings. We believe that these have relevance for the local health economy and the wider NHS. Here are our recommendations for the Department of Health to promulgate as necessary&#148;. Under the Bill as drafted, it does not appear possible for the commission to do that&#151;it can only publish reports.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000036"></a>That is a significantly less far-reaching power  than the power currently given to the Healthcare Commission. For that reason alone, the power should be reinstated here. Again, however, it looks decidedly odd that the commission is to be able to do everything that I have described when it has investigated a Welsh NHS trust or an English local authority, but not when it has investigated an NHS trust in England. I hope that with that explanation, the Minister will consider the amendment in a positive light. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08051236000037"></a><a name="80512-gc0007.htm_spnew34"></a><b><a name="80512-gc0007.htm_spnew35"></a><a name="08051236000105"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> Amendment No. 92 seeks to give the commission the power to recommend that the Secretary of State takes special measures in relation to significant failings it identifies in an NHS body, which reflects existing provision in Section 53 of the 2003 Act. Indeed, we have had discussions in a similar vein on Amendments Nos. 40 and 89. I similarly hope that I can persuade the Committee that Amendment No. 92 is not necessary.</p>

<p><a name="08051236000038"></a>As I have explained, the commission will have significantly greater powers to intervene directly with NHS providers than is currently the case, because it will fall within the ambit of the registration regime. It will therefore be able to apply conditions to registration, issue warnings or penalty notices and, in serious cases, suspend or cancel registration. I have also set out that there is nothing preventing the commission, as part of its duty to keep the Secretary of State informed under Clause 49, from recommending that the Secretary of State takes particular measures if it feels that that is necessary. I therefore believe that the powers in the Bill closely match what is being proposed in this amendment. However, in line with our intentions to create a more intelligent regulatory environment, streamline the system for providers and ensure that issues are dealt

<a name="80512-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000039"></a>I have described the assurance framework we are putting in place for achieving world-class commissioning to ensure that PCTs are effective and well supported in this aspect of their work, and the emphasis that this puts on the role of the SHAs in strengthening performance management in the NHS. Where the commission takes action in relation to a breach of registration requirements, it is required under Clause 35 to notify the relevant PCT and SHA so that it can take action to prevent the issue escalating. As discussed, we would also expect it to take account of the results of periodic reviews if they give cause for concern. I believe that these strategies will help to ensure that services improve locally and will be much more effective than intervention from the centre.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000040"></a>I hope that that satisfactorily explains why we do not believe that the clause proposed by the noble Earl is necessary and that, therefore, he will withdraw his amendment.</p>

I hope that that will fulfil the same objectives as I have outlined. I shall study the Minister&#146;s reply and, for now, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

</ul>
<a name="80512-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000047"></a>The noble Baroness said: We return to concerns that have been expressed by the Mental Health Act Commission and I am joined in these amendments by the noble Lord, Lord Patel of Bradford, who is unable to be here. These exploratory amendments seek reassurance about how the CQC will discharge its special functions in relation to detained provisions. Amendments Nos. 94 and 96 would insert a requirement for visiting and interviewing patients in private, as required in Schedule 3, to be carried out sufficiently regularly to ensure that patients&#146; rights and welfare &#147;are safeguarded and promoted&#148;.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000048"></a>Amendment No. 97 imposes a requirement that those who do specific visiting in relation to the implementation of the Mental Health Act, and undertake a review of those powers in relation to  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC258"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column GC258</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>individuals, should have special training and expertise in doing so. I want to stress that particular point&#151;that the Mental Health Act Commission is, as noble Lords know from previous debates, very supportive of service users and carers for service users being involved in general visiting and inspecting of individuals&#146; welfare. However, when it comes to visiting in private, expertise is required. It is not always easy to recruit that expertise; when the Mental Health Act Commission was first established, it was actually quite difficult to persuade doctors and lawyers that they should be involved in this work. It was difficult to get the quality of person involved in this day-to-day commissioner type of work.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000049"></a>Amendment No. 95 introduces a new category of patients to those who must receive regular visits from the commission. These patients are detained under the Mental Capacity Act, so dear to the hearts of those who sat through the &#147;Bournewood Gap&#148; debates in the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 1994. This would give rights under the new commission to visit this group of patients. Infringements of the liberty of these patients under the current proposals for their detention mean that they must fall within the optional protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to which the Government have signed up. The 2006 protocol establishes the international inspection system for places of detention. The protocol&#146;s objective is to establish a system of regular visits undertaken by independent international and national bodies to places where people are deprived of their liberty. Article 1 describes the importance of preventive visiting. Those detained under the Mental Capacity Act who lose their liberty fall clearly within its remit.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000050"></a>It is not sufficient to leave vague in the schedules what degree of visiting is to be undertaken or what regularity must be achieved. This is frankly an area which light-touch regulation will do nothing to assist. It is possible to collect a mammoth amount of information and lots of data. We know well, for example, that self-reported standards reported to the Healthcare Commission about dignity and hospitals and so on are often fictitious and do not relate clearly to what is really happening on the ground. It is simply not possible to risk that with patients detained under the Mental Capacity Act or the Mental Health Act.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000051"></a>You need to have trained specialists and not to leave this to the whim of the future CQC. Whatever degree of importance they give this task at the beginning, we need it established in the Bill that mental health wards are not like other wards and that people in them are at greater risk. We know that these wards are often very tough, violent places, with excessive noise, fear and sexual abuse. Poor ventilation, cramped conditions and a dirty environment often add to the problems. A lot of the wards are run at 100 per cent occupancy&#151;the least risk, of course, being that someone will leave. I do not want to leave to chance the regularity and style of the visiting activity. We need to be clear about how we discharge functions of protection under the Mental Capacity Act for new Bournewood patients. I beg to move.</p>

I would like to pick her up on a couple of points in order to support her argument. Not everyone who finds themselves in the Bournewood gap would call themselves a patient, nor would they be recognised as a patient. For those who did not sit all through the Mental Capacity Act&#151;one of the best pieces of legislation to go through this House in recent years&#151;I will say that people who are detained under Bournewood are in residential care homes; they are not all in mental health wards. That is my point and that is why I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, is absolutely right to ask for more explicit statements and more clarity in the Bill. If we do not have that, we shall be guilty of overlooking people who find themselves in social care at the expense of others&#151;in this case not acute care, but mental health care. I believe it is worth making that point.</p>

<p><a name="08051236000053"></a><a name="80512-gc0008.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80512-gc0008.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08051236000109"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> Amendments Nos. 94 to 97 relate to the visits that the Care Quality Commission and Welsh Ministers will be required to carry out for the purpose of monitoring the application of the Mental Health Act in England and Wales respectively. There is no doubt about the importance that we attach to these aspects of the commission&#146;s work. On numerous occasions in previous debates I have stressed how important it is that the commission has the skills and expertise required to carry out the functions that it will inherit from the MHAC, including appropriate visiting arrangements. At Second Reading in another place, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health also paid tribute to the emphasis that the MHAC places on its visiting programme, and signalled his expectation that the new commission will continue with that approach.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000054"></a>At Second Reading, my noble friend Lord Darzi, the Minister for health, stressed how important it is that the commission has the skills and expertise to carry this out. That proportionate regulation does not mean adopting a tick-box mentality; it means assessing the risks of individual providers and the services they provide and prioritising inspection activities accordingly.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000055"></a>Both the commission and the Welsh Ministers will be obliged to conduct these visits. Both will also be required to demonstrate how they have fulfilled those obligations in their annual reports. In addition, Clause 2 requires the commission to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the rights and welfare of vulnerable adults when carrying out its functions, which would include its investigative and visiting functions under the Mental Health Act. So I believe that the Bill provides the safeguard intended by Amendments Nos. 94 and 96.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000056"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 95, which would extend the monitoring remit of the commission and Welsh Ministers under the Mental Health Act to apply to the deprivation of liberty safeguards under the Mental Capacity Act 2005. The Mental Capacity Act 2005 provides a statutory framework for acting and making decisions on behalf of individuals who  


<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC260"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column GC260</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Government recently amended the Act, through the Mental Health Act 2007, to make it lawful to deprive such an individual of their liberty in a care home or hospital, if it is in their best interests. The Act also provides detailed safeguards to ensure that such a deprivation of liberty is independently authorised. We propose to make regulations in due course to give the Care Quality Commission the responsibility to monitor the operation of these safeguards in England.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000057"></a>In Wales, I understand the intention is that the monitoring of the deprivation of liberty safeguards in hospitals is to be undertaken by the Healthcare Inspectorate Wales, the body that will also monitor Mental Health Act functions. For care homes and local authorities, monitoring of the safeguards will be undertaken in Wales by the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000058"></a>Amendment No. 97 focuses on the visits which are fundamental for the monitoring of the application of both the Mental Health Act 1983 and the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Given the commission&#146;s duty to have regard to the need to safeguard the rights of children and vulnerable adults, I agree it will be very important that the training provided to those carrying out the visits ensures that they have a good understanding of civil, legal and human rights. It will ultimately be the duty of the new commission, as it is for the current commissions, to determine what skills and experience are required by its staff to fulfil its obligations, as it will for the Welsh Ministers. However, to ensure that the transition is as smooth as possible and that no expertise is lost, we are in the process of developing a human resources strategy for the new commission. A similar approach is being adopted in Wales.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000059"></a>It is clear that the commission will also need to consider its functions in the context of the Human Rights Act, including its responsibilities as a public authority under that Act. Welsh Ministers, too, will have to act in accordance with the conventions enshrined in the Human Rights Act by virtue of the Government of Wales Act 2006.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000060"></a>It is clear from the MHAC&#146;s success in incorporating a human rights framework into its work that no additional statutory responsibility is necessary to accomplish this. The Joint Committee on Human Rights said that the Healthcare Commission and CSCI could learn from this work&#151;I agree with that. I would expect the new commission to learn from and continue this approach.</p>

<a name="80512-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051236000061"></a>I hope that I have been able to demonstrate that the commission will have due regard to these functions. While understanding the noble Lords&#146; concerns, I believe that we must trust the ability of the commission as an independent organisation to fulfil its statutory obligations properly. I therefore ask noble Lords to withdraw these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="0805124000010"></a><a name="80512-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80512-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="0805124000075"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Parmjit Dhanda) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0805124000011"></a>I am pleased to announce that I am today laying before Parliament and publishing the Government&#146;s one-year-on response to the all-party inquiry into anti-Semitism.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0805124000012"></a>Just over a year ago, Government responded to the all-party parliamentary inquiry into anti-Semitism report and undertook to report back to Parliament on progress in implementing its recommendations.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0805124000013"></a>We believe that the best way to tackle anti-Semitism is through effective implementation of strong legislation against racial and religious discrimination and racially and religiously motivated crime. This must be underpinned by policies and strategies to increase racial equality and build community cohesion, particularly through education.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="0805124000014"></a>We have made significant progress against the 35 recommendations made by the all-party parliamentary inquiry&#146;s constructive and comprehensive report. We have ensured that by April 2009 all police forces will collect data on all hate crime, including anti-Semitism; agreed that schools and authorities can use their devolved capital funding for investment in security at schools where this is a priority; committed to funding research on the impact of anti-Semitic discourse; and launched the Race for Justice Declaration, a cross-government strategy that aims to combat all forms of hate crime.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="0805124000015"></a>Despite this progress, there is no room for complacency and we will continue to take practical, effective action to stamp out anti-Semitism whenever and wherever it occurs. We are committed to increasing the number of hate crimes brought to prosecution, tackling anti-Semitism on university campuses and challenging hate crime and extremism on the internet. We have agreed to continue our support of the cross-departmental and Jewish stakeholder working group and will report back to Parliament on further progress in 2010.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0805124000018"></a>A new call-out order has been made under Section 56 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 to enable members of the reserve forces to continue to be called out into permanent service and deployed to Cyprus as part of the UK&#146;s contribution to the United Nations Forces in Cyprus (UNFICYP). Currently some 35 reservists are deployed as part of 7 Transport Regiment RLC, which will be followed with a deployment of over 250 reservists in October. The call-out order has effect until 30 April 2009.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="0805124000019"></a><a name="80512-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><b><a name="80512-wms0001.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="0805124000077"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office &amp; Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Lord Jones of Birmingham):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade Policy (Gareth Thomas) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="0805124000020"></a>Following my Written Statement on Farepak of  10 December, I would like to report to the House that the investigation into Farepak and other companies in the European Home Retail group has been completed.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="0805124000021"></a><I>The investigation</I></p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="0805124000022"></a>The investigation has taken longer than expected to complete because it involved collecting and often reconstructing the financial and other records of a group of companies, including Farepak, which had ceased to trade and were in administration. The report is over 700 pages long and could lead to court proceedings, so taking short cuts in the investigation was not an option.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="0805124000023"></a>Legal advice is being obtained on the report to decide what further action is merited. This is a process that must be carried out confidentially to avoid prejudicing any action that may result and to protect the reputations and interests of those whose conduct is being scrutinised but in respect of whom no decisions have yet been made. As I said in my earlier Statement, if proceedings are taken against any party involved, this will become public knowledge if or when the case reaches open court. We will do everything in our power to process this quickly.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="0805124000024"></a>The report cannot, in any case be published because there is no provision for reports carried out under the Companies Act such as these (under Section 447) to be published. In fact, unauthorised disclosure is a criminal offence.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="0805124000025"></a>The Government have great sympathy with those people who have lost money that they saved as a result of the collapse of Farepak. We are doing all we can to prevent other families from suffering similar problems in the future. BERR has worked with the remaining hamper companies to put in place effective protection for customers&#146; prepayments. The Government have given the OFT funding for a new awareness campaign so that consumers are better aware of their options for Christmas savings. My department is now considering the report, alongside other advice received, to assess whether further action, including possible new regulation, is necessary in the light of the action that has been taken by the surviving Christmas savings schemes.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="0805124000027"></a><a name="80512-wms0001.htm_spmin6"></a><b><a name="80512-wms0001.htm_spmin7"></a><a name="0805124000078"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Darzi of Denham):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Alan Johnson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="0805124000028"></a>In October 2007, the Comprehensive Spending Review contained a commitment that the Government would undertake work to look at reform options for the care and support system and consult on a way forward. It also stated that the Government would set out a process involving extensive public engagement, ultimately leading to a Green Paper identifying key issues and options for reform.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="0805124000029"></a>Today we are launching a six-month engagement process with the public and all those involved in care and support for adults to set out clearly the case for reform and to consult on a number of questions. This is set out in the document <I>The </I><I>C</I><I>ase for </I><I>C</I><I>hange&#151;Why England </I><I>Needs</I><I> a</I><I> New Care </I><I>and </I><I>Support System</I>, which is being published today to mark the beginning of this engagement process. The responses to these questions will inform the development of a number of reform options, to be set out in the Green Paper.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="0805124000030"></a>This process, although led by the Department of Health, involves work across a number of other government departments, reflecting the fact that care and support encompass many different types of services and assistance. Ensuring effective and sustainable care and support in a society where people are living longer is one of the major public policy challenges of our time. This engagement process is an opportunity for the public to help to shape a response to this challenge.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="0805124000032"></a><a name="80512-wms0001.htm_spmin8"></a><b><a name="80512-wms0001.htm_spmin9"></a><a name="0805124000079"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Darzi of Denham):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Alan Johnson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="0805124000033"></a>In my oral Statement of 10 October 2007 (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col. 297), I notified the House that my noble friend Lord Darzi had published an interim report as part of the NHS next-stage review. I am writing to update the House on the progress of the review as Lord Darzi has today published <I>Leading Local Change</I>.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="0805124000034"></a>The Prime Minister and I asked Lord Darzi to lead the review in July 2007. His interim report in October set out a vision for a world-class NHS that is fair, personal, effective and safe.</p>




<notus-date day="12" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS42"></a><b>12 May 2008 : Column WS42</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="0805124000035"></a>The review has been led locally by clinicians in each NHS region. Seventy-four local clinical working groups, made up of some 2,000 clinicians, have been looking at the clinical evidence and engaging with their local communities. They have developed improved models of care for their regions to ensure that the NHS is up to date with the latest clinical developments and is able to meet changing needs  and expectations.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="0805124000036"></a>Lord Darzi is today publishing <I>Leading Local Change</I> to set the context for these local visions and the principles that will guide their implementation. We are also publishing new operational guidance, as promised in October&#146;s interim report, to help to ensure that any changes are based on clinical evidence and are in the best interest of patients. As part of this, we are making five pledges on change in the NHS, which primary care trusts will have a duty to have regard to:</p>
change will always be to the benefit of patients. This means that change will improve the quality of care that patients receive, whether in terms of clinical outcomes, experiences, or safety;change will be clinically driven. We will ensure that change is to the benefit of patients by making sure that it is always led by clinicians and based on the best available clinical evidence;all change will be locally led. Meeting the challenge of being a universal service means that the NHS must meet the different needs of everyone. Universal is not the same as uniform. Different places have different and changing needs, and local needs are best met by local solutions;local communities will be involved. The local NHS will involve patients, carers, the public and other key partners. Those affected by proposed changes will have the chance to have their say and offer their contribution. NHS organisations will work openly and collaboratively; andlocal communities will see the difference first. Existing services will not be withdrawn until new and better services are available to patients so that they can see the difference.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="0805124000057"></a>Lord Darzi will publish his final report in June. It will be designed to enable and support the improvements that have been determined locally in the SHA strategic visions.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="0805124000060"></a>Over the course of 2008, the Government are reintroducing procedures to count foreign nationals in and out of the UK. We are introducing ID cards for foreign nationals, on a compulsory basis, to guard against fraudulent access to jobs and benefits. As part of our cross-governmental enforcement strategy, the DWP will further tighten the criteria for national insurance number (NINO) allocation to ensure that, where the partner of a legitimate benefit claimant has no right to be in the UK, DWP will no longer issue the partner with a NINO. This follows the successful introduction of right-to-work interviews for those applying for national insurance numbers in 2006.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="0805124000064"></a>The east of England plan is crucial to putting in place the Government&#146;s sustainable growth strategy within the east of England. It builds on the foundations of the draft east of England plan, which was prepared by the East of England Regional Assembly, and the findings of the independent panel that conducted an examination in public.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="0805124000065"></a>The east of England plan replaces the regional planning guidance for East Anglia and relevant parts of the regional planning guidance for the south-east within the regional spatial strategy for the east of England. Its main purpose is to provide a framework for local planning authorities to prepare their development plan documents, which must be in general conformity with it.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="0805124000066"></a>The strategy aims to guide development in the east of England to 2021 and to set in place a direction of travel for the longer term. It requires the provision of 508,000 dwellings within the region between 2001  and 2021.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="0805124000067"></a>The plan adopts the independent panel&#146;s conclusion that a case for higher growth was made but that it must and can be reconciled with sustainability and environmental constraints. The plan supports a spatial strategy with development focused on the main urban areas, such as Cambridge, Peterborough and Stevenage, including the growth points at Norwich, Colchester, Ipswich and Thetford. It identifies Hemel Hempstead, Welwyn/Hatfield and Chelmsford as additional growth locations close to London.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="0805124000068"></a>Other aspects of the plan include the regional transport strategy, the waste strategy, policies for achieving efficiency savings in water and energy consumption and policies for improving water resource and waste water infrastructure. The plan reflects the increased urgency to reduce carbon emissions, requiring local authorities to promote renewable and low-carbon energy development and the regional assembly to develop regional targets for the carbon performance of new development.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="0805124000069"></a>In regard to the green belt, the plan provides that the review at Harlow extend to the north of the town and the review at Welwyn/Hatfield may extend into St Albans. It adds additional guidance on the basis for assessing the area to be released and requires compensatory green-belt extensions to the north of Harlow and west of Stevenage, which will increase the extent of green belt in the region. In regard to transport, the plan identifies priority areas where further measures are needed to tackle congestion and to support growth.</p>

<a name="80512-wms0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="0805124000070"></a>The plan was subject to assessment under the habitats regulations. The sustainability statement concludes that the plan is in accordance with the principles of sustainable development and that the additional growth and changes to distribution do not give rise to adverse environmental impacts.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="0805124000071"></a>Reflecting the levels of development confirmed through the plan, we are today confirming that five districts are to be included in the growth areas with growth area funding confirmed.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="0805124000072"></a>The plan represents a step change in addressing housing needs but falls short of what will be required based on likely growth in households. The regional assembly is about to commence a further review of the RSS covering the period to 2031 for completion by 2011, which will be informed by government guidance on the range of housing provision required.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="0805124000073"></a>The RSS review is a key milestone in putting in place sustainable higher growth and setting the strategic planning context for decision-makers in the east of England. The crucial task now is to ensure that it is implemented quickly and effectively. We look forward to working with the local authorities, local delivery vehicles and other key partners on its delivery.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="0805124000074"></a>Copies of the east of England plan, together with the sustainability report, are available in the Libraries of both Houses and have been provided for all the region&#146;s MPs, MEPs and local authorities.</p>

To support the delivery of the strategy a delivery plan is being produced by the Forestry Commission and Natural England. Under Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, local planning authorities may enter into agreements with developers to secure contributions towards the provision of open space in accordance with policies in their local development documents. The Secretary of State's policy on the use of Section 106 is set out in Circular 5/2005 <I>Planning Obligations</I>. In addition, the <I>Code for Sustainable Homes </I>contains an ecology component which encourages developers to both protect, and enhance, the ecology of the site.

Changes in liver enzymes have also been reported. Patients who survive a severe acute poisoning crisis sometimes develop muscle weakness beginning one to four days later and this has occasionally resulted in fatal respiratory failure.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_65"></a><a name="08051210000155"></a>Fines, such as those levied by the OFT, are paid into the Consolidated Fund and are then allocated according to government spending priorities as part of the spending review process. The fines are therefore spent on providing services to the public. The Treasury's Comprehensive Spending Review and Pre-Budget Report (published in October 2007), available in the Library of the House and at <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pbr">www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pbr</a> _csr/pbr_csr07_index.cfm, provides details of how departments' budgets have been set for the next three years. The fines levied by the OFT are intended to be a punitive measure to deter anti-competitive behaviour and are not designed as a means of compensation. However, in general where consumers or businesses have suffered as a result of anti-competitive behaviour, they can seek redress for their losses through private action. The Government recognise that, in some instances, there may be barriers to redress and will be consulting shortly on measures to address this.</p>
