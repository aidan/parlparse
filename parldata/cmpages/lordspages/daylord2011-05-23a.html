During the Olympic Games our ambition is that all spectators should travel to London venues by public transport, cycling or on foot. These and other measures will help minimise air quality risks in London during the Games.</p>

Will he say who is responsible for keeping the air at the right quality? Is it TfL, the GLA or the Government? Secondly, if there is very little wind during the Olympic Games and PM10 values exceed the limit, is he aware that the Government could be fined £180 million by the International Olympic Committee? That is what will happen if the pollution is as bad as it was in Beijing. Does he have a contingency plan?</p>

Everyone is responsible: the Government, the mayor, TfL, LOCOG, the ODA and, most importantly, individuals who make their own transport decisions. As regards the noble Lord's second question, the host city contract states that the International Olympic Committee can withhold payment from LOCOG if an event in the Olympic and Paralympic Games cannot take place for any reason or if there is

The Minister will be aware that London has already violated its entire annual allowance for PM10s for 2011 and we are in only the fifth month of the year. Will he give us some assurance that London will at least look at putting in place a temporary clean air zone around central London and the Olympic venues during the Olympics? If it does not, does he agree that we will end up doing what Beijing did, which was to resort to an almost impossible alternation between allowing in cars with odd-numbered plates one day and even-numbered plates the next in order to manage air quality problems?</p>

I am sure that this report will be helpful to Ministers, and indeed to everyone who wants to see a stable housing market, not boom and bust. Does the Minister agree that the level of mortgage repossessions, which are now running at 100 a day, might get a lot worse if interest rates and unemployment rise? If so, does she agree that the proposals in this new report for a mortgage protection payment insurance scheme to provide a safety net for homebuyers would be good not only in preventing their homelessness but in stabilising the housing market at a difficult time?</p>

We currently welcome private insurance solutions and recognise that there are enormous challenges for first-time buyers. We are already running the mortgage rescue scheme, as I am sure the noble Lord knows. Some £200 million has been put into that scheme already, and we have already helped 38,000 households with that money as well as with advice and support. So it is not as though the Government are not doing anything-we are making substantial efforts-and if the economy were to stabilise and settle down, much of this problem would go away.</p>

The economy, which is the first priority of this Government, needs to be effectively stabilised. After that, we hope that the banks will feel able to bring themselves more into the market to help particularly first-time buyers with mortgages. However, the first line of defence will have to be making sure that the economy is right.</p>

Under the Localism Bill, of course, we are preparing for neighbourhood plans, which will identify land that is available, and we will also look to the community right to challenge to identify and challenge land that is available for development.

It is a sad fact that there are many empty properties which can or should be brought back into use. We have already allocated money to this and within the new homes money we will identify such empty properties. For that, £100 million is already available. It is not occurring just in the north but across the country. We are anxious too to make sure that homes are brought up a decent standard. In areas-particularly in the north, I guess-where traditionally a lot of houses have been left empty, it is perfectly right that those are brought back into use rather than just demolished or left.</p>

We should remind ourselves that a total of 23 million people hold ISA accounts, and of those 15.5 million hold cash ISAs, so this very important part of the savings market is held by some 40 per cent of households. My noble friend's Question prompted me to speak to the British Bankers' Association today and I can confirm that the association is working on its own recommendations following on from those made last year by the Office of Fair Trading after it had looked at this area. For example, from early 2012, additional information about the interest rates being offered will be shown on all statements. Further, in line with the

But the structure of interest rates being offered, which is increasingly transparent on the websites that are now available, is a matter of commercial competition. I would recommend all savers to take advantage of the tools that are out there in order to shop around.</p>

Treating customers fairly in the broadest sense is a critical part of what the FSA has been working on over the past few years. As we look at the remit, particularly for the new Prudential Regulation Authority within the regulatory structure, it is important to make sure that a proper focus is placed on that strand of work going forward.

It is not the job of any one person or organisation. Strong and effective multi-agency working across local authority and health partners is essential. No Health without Mental Health provides a co-ordinated, cross-government focus to improving mental health outcomes for people of all ages, including those in vulnerable groups such as children in the care of local authorities.</p>

Will he urgently consider working with local authorities to ensure that, in the early assessment of children when they are taken into care, a clinical psychologist with appropriate training or a child psychiatrist is involved so that mental health needs are recognised and can be acted on? Furthermore, will he say what the state of specialist looked-after children's mental health services is?

It is up to local authorities to decide the level at which staff should be appropriately deployed. Targeted CAMHS for looked-after children should work closely alongside the child's social worker, carers and other professionals such as nurses and paediatricians. It is reassuring that data collected over past years for the CAMHS mapping survey by Durham University show an increase from 2003 to 2009 in the number of social services teams and teams with a focus on looked-after children, although those data carry a slight health warning in that participation in the survey, I understand, was voluntary.</p>

In doing so, they considered evidence including research reviews, a practice survey, a consultation with young people who have been in care, field work with practitioners and the testimony of expert witnesses. The evidence demonstrated that the health and well-being of looked-after children and young people are affected by nearly all aspects of their lives and care. The noble Baroness may like to know that a detailed list of that evidence is contained in appendix C to the guidance.</p>

But local authorities generally should be in no doubt that they have legal obligations in this area that they cannot obviate. The Department for Education has produced revised regulations and statutory guidance on care planning for looked-after children and care leavers, which came into force on 1 April. I have already mentioned the NICE and Social Care Institute for Excellence guidance, which should be followed alongside those regulations.</p>

Around 3 per cent of the child population of Great Britain is from black, black British or mixed groups, but 8 per cent of looked-after children are black and 7 per cent are from mixed groups. She is right that there is a problem. She is also right that early intervention is key. There is a strong emphasis on public mental health in the mental health strategy. The good foundations are down to early intervention, as I mentioned, and we are clear that this is a priority for the Government.</p>

<a name="1105236000067"></a><b><a name="110523-0001.htm_spnew61"></a><a name="1105236000366"></a>Lord Kerr of Kinlochard:</b> My Lords, I rise to speak to the question of whether Clause 7 should stand part principally to draw attention to a common feature of this clause and succeeding clauses, which was also a feature of Clauses 2 and 3 and to which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, has drawn attention on a number of occasions. The question concerns the acceptability of the language in Clause 7(3):</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="1105236000234"></a>"A Minister of the Crown may not vote in favour of or otherwise support a decision to which this subsection applies".</p>

<p><a name="1105236000068"></a>This is the chicken-and-egg problem, as explained by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay. It would be normal before a decision is reached in Brussels that there should be preliminary discussion, the preparation of a text and textual negotiation, and that various rounds should be gone through before there is a decision. I am in no way disagreeing with what Clause 7(3) says about the Minister being banned from voting in favour of the decision. My worry-like the worry of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, about previous clauses-is simply about the language "or otherwise support".</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="1105236000069"></a>One can envisage a situation in which the United Kingdom representative might be keen to say, "My Government would live with this", or "My Government would like this", but it must be understood that under UK law, under this Bill, it would require an Act of Parliament and a referendum-or, in this case, will require an Act of Parliament. That could be construed as supporting the measure, though explaining that there were steps that had to be gone through before the UK could vote for it. I am nervous about our being unable to say anything in respect of decisions that we favour. That seems to me the effect of this

The risk is that the negotiator would be accused of having broken the law by supporting the idea or a particular form of the draft decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="1105236000070"></a>Before we come back to this issue on Report, I hope that the Government will think seriously about the point that the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, has made more than once, and which has yet to receive an adequate answer from the government Front Bench. We were assured at one stage that it would be thought about; I hope that it really will. One can envisage various forms of language-for example, Clause 7 is full of the word "permit". It occurs all over Clause 7(4). I wonder whether it would be a disaster to the Government, while it would certainly solve my problem, if Clause 7(3) said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="1105236000235"></a>"A Minister of the Crown may not vote in favour",</p>

<p><a name="1105236000208"></a>or permit a decision. That would prevent his taking part or allowing the final decision; it would not prevent his taking part in the negotiation of the terms of that decision, or a prior discussion of principle about the possible decision.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="1105236000071"></a>I put this forward as a minor technical amendment which I think the Government should think very seriously about. There are a number of other ways of taking the trick, but the argument presented by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, deserves a proper response.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="1105236000072"></a>I have two points that I wish to record as suggestions appertaining to Clause 7. The first is about decisions under Article 333(1). I am talking about Clause 7(4)(e), and I am also going to talk about Clause 7(4)(f) and Article 333(2). These are about qualified majority voting and, in particular, enhanced co-operation activities in which the UK is taking part. We are not allowed, other than if there has been a specific Act of Parliament, to agree that for a particular enhanced co-operation or deployment of election monitors qualified majority decisions can be taken on the detail of the deployment.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="1105236000073"></a>Here I take my text from what was said in earlier days of this Committee about flexibility. I do not think that it is wise to tie the Government's hands. These provisions are about specific deployments. It is perhaps an unlikely situation that someone who is in disagreement with the majority would agree that decisions should be taken by a qualified majority, but it has happened quite regularly in the European Union's history. It has been a standard feature of German policy that rather than take on the Bundesrat on a particular issue they prefer to be voted down by a qualified majority. They do not want to stop something happening, but nor do they want to vote in favour of it, so they are happy under qualified majority to vote against and be voted down. I think that I raised this point last Monday in relation to a previous clause. The Government need to think about it.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="1105236000074"></a>This is not about changing the normal rules for deciding issues that arise in relation to enhanced co-operation activity. This is about specific enhanced co-operations in which, as Clause 7(4)(e) and (f) say, the UK could be taking part. The decision on whether to adopt the qualified majority rules for implementing it would be taken by unanimity, so the Government could prevent a decision to move to qualified majority  


<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1596"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1596</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>if they did not want it. My point is about whether the Government have to stop the show and say, "No, there can't be qualified majority until we have an Act of Parliament". In relation to particular enhanced co-operation deployments and activities, that could be very constraining and undesirable for the UK's interest. I ask the Government please to reflect a little further on that.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="1105236000075"></a>I draw the Government's attention to Clause 7(3)(c) regarding a paradoxical provision in the treaty that I personally find hard to understand. I am criticising not the Bill but the treaty. This bit of our Bill says that we would need an Act of Parliament before there was,</p>
<ul><a name="1105236000253"></a>"a decision under the provision of Article 64(3) ... that permits the adoption of measures which constitute a step backwards in European Union law as regards the liberalisation of the movement of capital to or from third countries".</ul>
<p><a name="1105236000209"></a>I find it hard to tell what that is about. The language of Article 64(3) is not very revealing. I had hoped to be able to attack the Government on using such loose language as,</p>
<ul><a name="1105236000254"></a>"which constitute a step backwards",</ul>
<p><a name="1105236000210"></a>but unfortunately I find that they are quoting precisely from the treaty. Article 64(2) says that for capital movement-that is,</p>
<ul><a name="1105236000255"></a>"the movement of capital to or from third countries involving direct investment ... establishment, the provision of financial services or the admission of securities to capital markets"-</ul>
<p><a name="1105236000211"></a>there shall be qualified majority. That is not the bit of the article that we are talking about at Clause 7(3)(c) of the Bill. The clause talks about Section 3 of the article, which says that notwithstanding the bit that lays down that there shall be qualified majority,</p>
<ul><a name="1105236000256"></a>"the Council, acting in accordance with a special legislative procedure, may unanimously, and after consulting the European Parliament, adopt measures which constitute a step backwards in Union law as regards the liberalisation of the movement of capital to or from third countries".</ul>
<p><a name="1105236000212"></a>So we have some sort of emergency measure that enables them, if they are unanimous, acting only in consultation with the European Parliament rather than by the slower procedure laid down in the previous paragraph, to take a decision-perhaps sanctions, perhaps when there is some systemic threat to the system, some sort of crisis in the markets-rather than with the European Parliament being co-equal and qualified majority by the standard procedure.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="1105236000076"></a>If I am right-I may have misunderstood the article; I find it hard to understand-it is a bit odd that this Parliament should be imposing a requirement for a very heavy procedure, an Act of Parliament, for going back to unanimity. In a crisis where everyone agrees that something ought to be done and you have to move fast, you can only consult the Parliament; you do not have time for a full dress Session with the Parliament.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="1105236000077"></a>My question to the Government is: are they quite sure that Clause 7(4)(c) should find a place in the Bill? Again, I admit that I may not fully have understood its import but it seems paradoxical. The Minister has spoken to us at length about transfer of powers. I understand his reluctance to see moves to qualified majority voting. However, we are talking here about a move to unanimity by exception-clearly in an emergency. The Government should reflect on that and whether

That said, having registered these three points, I do not intend at the moment to oppose Clause 7 standing part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="1105236000078"></a><b><a name="110523-0001.htm_spnew62"></a><a name="1105236000367"></a>Baroness Williams of Crosby:</b> My Lords, I follow the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, by asking similar questions. The phrase "or otherwise support" appears in clause after clause of this section of the Bill. If my fellow Members of this Committee look at Clauses 7, 8, 9 and 10, they will see that the phrase "or otherwise support" appears again and again. It is important that we are all completely clear about what it means. The noble Lord, Lord Kerr, is a distinguished civil servant. He has raised some of the issues that flow from this in the case of negotiation in Brussels, at the Council or in another European Union institution. I speak as a former Minister of the Crown. I, too, have concerns that deserve a little consideration by the Committee and my noble friends who will respond to this debate. I will be brief.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="1105236000079"></a>In Clause 7(3) we have the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="1105236000257"></a>"or otherwise support ... unless the draft decision is approved by Act of Parliament".</ul>
<p><a name="1105236000213"></a>That is to say, before a draft decision is approved by Act of Parliament, the Minister of the Crown is not free to vote in favour-that is absolutely fair and perfectly clear-or otherwise to support it. That really puzzles me. He or she is unable to support in discussions in the Council a view that may be in the interests of this country, and that he or she genuinely believes to be in the interests of this country, because he or she is expressing that support before a draft decision has been approved by Parliament. A Minister of the Crown-this is even odder-is unable to express support in the whole run-up to that draft decision being taken. It is not even clear whether he or she can speak in Parliament's discussions on the draft decision. Certainly, the wording does not suggest that. You could have the very odd situation of a Minister whose Government think that what he is trying to do is right, and who himself believes that what he is trying to do is in the national interest, not being able to speak out and say so.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="1105236000080"></a>I ask noble Lords to consider for a moment or two what will be the effect of 24/7 press and media coverage. Heaven knows, we in this House have heard enough about it in the past few days. The Minister of the Crown cannot express to the media support for what will now be put to Parliament in a draft decision on behalf of his own Government. The media will undoubtedly line up to ask him where he stands, where he is going and what grounds he has for supporting the decision. He can, I presume, say only, "I am not free to say anything". That is in some ways a ludicrous position. Surely, at the very least we should remove the words "or otherwise support" and let the whole case rest on voting in favour, where the position is clear, strong and constitutional.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="1105236000081"></a>My second point about the role of the media is that the very draft decision that Parliament is being asked to make-the decision of approval-will turn to a great extent on how the issue is discussed in advance of Parliament making that decision. However, under  


<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1598"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1598</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the wording here, unless I misunderstand it, the person who knows most about it-the Minister of the Crown-simply could not take part in that argument. I ask Ministers either to explain why the wording does not mean what it appears to mean, or to explain how they will bar a Minister of the Crown from speaking about an issue that could be of considerable national importance. Incidentally, this is not an issue of being for or against the EU, as such; it is about what we say to Ministers who are negotiating on our behalf in Brussels. I strongly suggest that the wording as it stands is not clear. It is profoundly ambiguous and could be rather absurd and very hampering if there is an attempt to interpret "or otherwise support" as broadly as it is left open by the wording of the Bill.</p>

I wish to give an instance of where a problem may arise. The Council in Brussels may be discussing a measure which requires unanimity-our agreement-in terms of some outcomes that would be unacceptable to us, and others that would be acceptable to us once Parliament had endorsed them. How is the Minister to express that preference? There is a real risk that "or otherwise support" could be interpreted in a way which prevents the Minister expressing that preference. That, surely, would be completely counterproductive because in such circumstances we want to be able to say-do we not?-that one or more courses of action would be unacceptable to us and we would not agree to them there and then, but that another course of action could be acceptable to us once we had the authority of Parliament to make a legal decision possible. Taking all these points together, I hope that the Ministers will break their duck and agree to a change. After all, we have been sitting here for I do not know how many hours and so far they have not managed it. I would like to encourage them to try a little harder.</p>

He mentioned the coalition agreement. I think that on day five in Committee we discussed the coalition agreement and what it said about passerelles. Does he agree that the coalition agreement is clear on this particular use of passerelles, as it says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="1105236000236"></a>"We will amend the 1972 European Communities Act so that ... the use of any passerelle would require primary legislation"?</p>

I do not believe that the noble Lords on the Cross Benches, or I, are for one moment arguing that there should not be an Act of Parliament. The issue is about the run-up to the draft decision that Parliament will make, and whether that run-up should include a proper debate involving Ministers of the Crown.</p>

<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="1105236000086"></a><b><a name="110523-0001.htm_spnew66"></a><a name="1105236000371"></a>Baroness Falkner of Margravine:</b> I was getting to that. Whoever said that EU legislation was dull and boring should see the enthusiasm of Members of this House to make sure that we examine every sentence. I was going to refer to the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, on "or otherwise support", and I shall do so now. Clause 7(3) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="1105236000238"></a>"A Minister of the Crown may not vote in favour of or otherwise support".</p>

<p><a name="1105236000216"></a>However, that has to be read in the context of the following words:</p>
<ul><a name="1105236000258"></a>"a decision to which this subsection applies unless the draft decision is approved by Act of Parliament".</ul>
<p><a name="1105236000217"></a>My interpretation of the words,</p>
<ul><a name="1105236000259"></a>"or otherwise support a decision",</ul>
<p><a name="1105236000218"></a>is a slightly more legalistic one. Will the Minister clarify that point? I see "or otherwise support" as meaning to give assent to "a decision"-meaning a law. In other words, that is a decision as seen in the category of regulations, directives and decisions-in this case, a decision taking immediate effect. That is why supporting -in other words, giving assent to-the making of a law would not be possible, but the Minister would have to come back with a draft decision, and subsequently go back and support it. This might be a rather legalistic view of the issue, but I should be grateful if the Minister can confirm whether that is right. If it is, the words are entirely sensible.</p>

If I may say so, we are making rather heavy weather of the phrase "or otherwise support". There is only one issue that the House ought to consider-is the legislation clear as presently drafted? If it is, then of course a lot of this argument is negated. If it is not clear as drafted, someone-almost certainly the Government-ought to put it right. I am doing my best with this phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="1105236000260"></a>"or otherwise support a decision",</ul>
<p><a name="1105236000219"></a>but I am finding it difficult to understand what it means. I do not know what "otherwise support" means. Does "otherwise" refer back to the original approval, or to something less than the approval that you are minded to support? This is an extremely difficult concept to grasp. In short, is it clear? The answer to that is no. Should it be amended? The answer to that is yes. Who should do the amending? It should, on the whole, be the parliamentary draftsman. If ever there was a case in which the Government should say, "Right; we agree there is something here that we can look at again", this is one.</p>

It would increase the amount of parliamentary work on European legislation and would inevitably increase the amount of scrutiny we placed on such legislation. That is bound to be a good thing. In our submission, it is also bound to reflect well on Parliament and its responsibility to do the job adequately, without turning to a multiple requirement for referenda.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="1105236000089"></a>This clause, at least in some of its wording, is not just a lock but a double lock. There are two kinds of locks in it. The first is that, apart from the matters covered in the clause, there will be a referendum lock, and there is a double lock on the political process in which a Minister might take any reasonable part in any reasonable discussion of any reasonable proposition in order to make sure that their parliamentary colleagues-let alone the public-know what the issues are and how they stand on them.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para17"></a>

<ul><a name="1105236000261"></a>"may not vote in favour".</ul>
<p><a name="1105236000220"></a>That is the point on which, I suspect, there is a great deal of agreement around the House. However, I do not think that the use of "or otherwise support" is a simply a drafting or technical matter. I rely in part on the fact that those words appear in many clauses. This is not the only example. Clause after clause imposes the requirement. In general, when we have talked about these kinds of clause, the government Front Bench has indicated that in some sense-not in any sense that Ministers have described to us, and certainly not in any detail-it will be all right on the night and that it will not somehow have got in the way of anyone engaging in serious political work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="1105236000091"></a>We first moved an amendment to delete that wording some time ago; I continue to believe that it is unhelpful and inappropriate. I put to the Government the following thought, which flows from ministerial experience-a good many Members of this House have real ministerial experience in this and other foreign affairs issues. Ministerial experience tells me that it is wholly impractical to try to do the political job without being able to speak on any matter of substance while you are doing it. Your processes of thought-the decisions to which you may come not instantly but as a result of discussion-must remain wholly obscure. Can you even say that you wish to deploy the knowledge you have of the issue? Can you say that you think that it is in the national interest that the issue is thought about and resolved? Can you find words in the process in which you are engaged-some of us have been engaged in these processes in much detail over the years-that are so neutral that nobody could misunderstand any word or syllable that you said as being other than completely neutral and not demonstrating any inference of support? Can you realistically anticipate that everyone will agree that what is said is so neutral that they will not claim that it is a breach of the law when they do not agree with you or the outcome? We have heard noble Lords saying in terms that they are in fundamental

I do not mean noble Lords on the government Benches-they are just happily confused-but noble Lords in UKIP, for example, have found it almost inconceivable that anything that could be said would not represent some slippage into a greater presence of Europe in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="1105236000092"></a>I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, that it is not a matter of how she reads Clause 7(3). Of course it is all about decisions. Draft decisions are bound to give rise to the expression of a view, or nobody would have drafted them. That is precisely why you would draft a decision. I cannot believe that we do not agree on that basic proposition.</p>

The moment that anybody drafts anything, it will be seen or thought to be a clear indication of support by the very nature of going through the process of drafting it and putting it into the public domain.

Is it not ironic that the then Conservative Government in the mid-1980s were mad keen on the passerelles to help the Single European Act-that was when the system first started? Subsequently, there were very few, but in the Lisbon treaty, all the member states regarded them as indispensable to allow the Union to move forward on matters which had already been decided in substance-that is Clause 7 in essence-and therefore did not require an intergovernmental conference or a unanimous decision. Why is there so much agony for the government draftsman about this unnecessary clause?</p>

It appears to me that, in choosing this drafting in the Bill, the Government have once again ignored a fundamental principle of political process. Any of us, whether we are in this House or have been involved in other organisations where some politics, with a big P or a small p, are going on among those who are taking part will recognise the circumstances perfectly well. I have found, as I suspect many noble Lords have done, that people occasionally welcome the chance to speak out and say that they do not like something. They like to be given the visible opportunity to fight their corner and, in the end, they find it far easier and a much more comfortable position to be seen to have been defeated in whatever it was they were arguing and to live with the result than to appear to have supported the issue in the first place. That, I think, is a commonplace in political life. I do not deny for a moment that I have enjoyed the fact that I have been able to present an argument and have lost it and that something else potentially more rational than anything I suggested has then happened. That occurs in the normal course of political life.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="1105236000099"></a>Unanimity, which could allow a slightly different process to occur in relation to enhanced co-operation, gives room for real politics in really difficult circumstances. Therefore, I say to the government Benches that, when they reply and explain to the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, what Clause 7(4)(c) means-I, too, am quite keen to know what it means-perhaps they will tell us how they expect real politics to work. I refer not just to how they have locked out the possibility of it working but how they expect it to work and how they expect to give Ministers who are in senior, responsible and authoritative positions the ability to do the job that I think the people of the country expect of them individually and of Parliament.</p>

In theory, that sounds perfectly reasonable. However, is that precisely because Ministers' rhetoric and Governments' rhetoric in the past has never quite matched the decisions that have emerged?</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="1105236000101"></a>It is commonplace in politics for someone to put forward an argument, and the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, quoted the German case. To avoid a certain procedure within the German constitution, people would say, "A nod and a wink. I'll do a bit of talking here. I'll put up a good fight but at the end of the day I know perfectly well that I'm going to get beaten and therefore everything will be all right on the night". In some senses, that can be seen as normal but others may see it as chicanery. People might see that as undermining the process in Brussels but some, and I am one of them, may argue that there was a prolonged period in history when cases were put in exactly that way with exactly that outcome, which led the people drafting this legislation to take measures-they may not be the most elegant but perhaps the Minister can confirm that they exist-to protect against that precise situation. Let us face it: if  


<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1603"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1603</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a parliamentary decision has to be taken on a particular proposal, a political argument develops in the media to try to influence it, and a Minister sitting at the table can play a major part in creating and framing the debate when it goes into the media and try to build support for it. There is nothing wrong with that. The idea that people are going there secretly with one particular agenda but in fact pretending to have another is precisely why the European Union is in so much trouble with the population of this country. I hope that the Minister can indicate whether that is part of the rationale behind this or whether our fears are unsupported.</p>

It reflects the general view that we have heard in the debate so far that primary legislation is the right instrument in a number of fields, which we have discussed at considerable length.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="1105236000103"></a>This clause also brings the UK more into line with the commendable practice of a number of other partners, in particular, Germany, of ensuring that national parliaments have a greater say in the developments of the European Union. It is also consistent with the principles of Laaken, to which I have referred frequently at this Dispatch Box in the past, and it is consistent with the trend in the Lisbon treaty to give more control to national parliaments across Europe.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="1105236000104"></a>I want to come to the specific issues that have been raised with considerable knowledge and expertise and try to offer what I hope will be a constructive response. First, I refer to the theme on which a good deal has been made in the debate on the words, "or otherwise support", raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, my noble friend Lady Williams, the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and others. The noble Lord, Lord Davies of Stamford, would immediately call me to order if I were to say that this is inherited phraseology. When I sat where the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, now sits, through the long nights that we were dealing with the Bill on the Lisbon treaty, I am trying to remember whether we had amendments on these words. I cannot remember and do not have the electronic memory to retrieve it, but the words were in the Bill which became an Act and which was drawn up by the previous Government, ratifying the then Lisbon treaty. Those with long memories will remember that people like me were not terribly enthusiastic about the treaty or how it should be treated.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="1105236000105"></a>However, that is the past and out of the past has come this phrase, "or otherwise support", which also raises some difficult questions, to which the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, rightly referred. Of course, we want to see in this Parliament a pattern of legislation in this enormously complex area of EU measures which minimises the obscurity and maximises the clarity. I should like to take away the points that have been put very clearly and reflect on the noble Lord's arguments. I do not know whether that constitutes, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, "breaking ducks", merely passing balls gently to the boundary, or whatever, but the matter clearly needs some reflection because  


<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1604"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1604</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>there is clearly obscurity. I suspect that that has been pointed out again and again in debates on European legislation in the past few years; it is nothing new but it does not mean to say that we cannot get it better now, so I will reflect on the points that have been made.</p>

Here we are discussing only one of them. I am sure that his intention is to look at all of them: if he will confirm that, I will happily agree that he has scored a boundary.</p>

I will put it like that: that is what I am saying that I will seek to do.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="1105236000108"></a>I turn now to Article 333(1) of the TFEU, on enhanced co-operation. The pat answer that the Bill gives if you stare it in the face is that if a sensitive veto listed in Schedule 1 is removed, there will be primary legislation for the removal of other vetoes. That is something that the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, questioned. He cited the German example to which the noble Lord, Lord Empey, also referred. That is stretching it a bit. I cannot see that the pattern in Germany-for which there may well be good reasons, such as anxiety not to offend the Länder-arises here. I trust that it does not sound too austere to say that it would not be our way to go through that kind of action in the hope that people would understand that we really wanted to do the reverse. Nevertheless, it is a complex point and I have more to say about it.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="1105236000109"></a>This is to do with whether we maintain or surrender a veto in these areas. We are not talking about action in those areas: I am sure that that is perfectly obvious to noble Lords. Enhanced co-operation decisions will not be agreed overnight: they will be agreed as a matter of last resort in areas of sensitivity for some member states. A move to set up enhanced co-operation has happened only once, and is being proposed now in the context of the European patent.</p>

Does it not say in Clause 7(4)(e) and (f) that we are talking about a particular enhanced co-operation? We are not talking about the general rules for enhanced co-operation. I accept the first point that the Minister made about precedent. It seems to me-and, I think, to him-to be an insufficient answer, but it was a sort of answer. The point that he is making now surely does not apply, because paragraphs (e) and (f) state that the decision will relate to a specific reinforced co-operation in which we will be a participant.</p>

I simply do not accept that the provision would hold up the taking of a specific decision. I am afraid that my mind may not be meeting that of the noble Lord, Lord Kerr. I cannot see what his concern is. This is to do with removing the veto, not taking that decision. That is the best explanation that I can give: I think that it meets his concern, which he put forward in a very valuable and experienced way.</p>

A particular kind of external activity is taking place and we do not know what it is. Those who are taking part in it have to make rapid decisions. They have to decide what we do tomorrow about situation x. The treaty says that if they unanimously so decide, they may take implementing decisions by qualified majority in relation to that specific deployment, or whatever it is. They are not changing the treaty or the general rules but are dealing with the problem that has arisen now. I do not understand the different scenario that is being presented when the Minister says that this will be prepared over time and that there will be a lot of consideration. This is about implementation. It is about people in the field. That is why I think it is rather inappropriate. Is the Minister quite sure that it is appropriate to make this a matter on which the UK would need to pass primary legislation?</p>

This is a very complex matter, and I have sought to try to explain as best I can how we see it working but, of course, I will write to the noble Lord in more detail about his precise concerns. I am not sure that he has really satisfied me about the cutting edge of his amendment, and I have clearly not satisfied him. We will just go on boxing and coxing while other noble Lords have to listened, so I think it is better if I write to him and try to clarify the Government's understanding of the reasoning and the reason why primary legislation would be justified against his clearly very strongly held view that it would not be justified and might hold things up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="1105236000116"></a>I want now to turn to the next point that the noble Lord raised, which is to do with Article 64(3) of the TFEU on the reverse of liberalisation of capital movements to or from third countries. The noble Lord, Lord Kerr, indicated he did not fully understand  


<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1606"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1606</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what the Bill means. He interpreted it as allowing a move back from QMV to unanimity. Article 64(3) allows for unanimity for the adoption of,</p>
<ul><a name="1105236000262"></a>"measures which constitute a step backwards in Union law as regards the liberalisation of the movement of capital to or from third countries".</ul>
<p><a name="1105236000221"></a>I do not know where this phrase "step back" originally emerged from. I do not know whether it was way back in the original draft of the European constitution. It may have been. It is used to do that which we believe should be subject to an Act of Parliament. Once again, I will obviously look at it very closely, but that is why we believe it is in the Bill in the form that it is and why we think an Act of Parliament is the right way forward.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="1105236000117"></a>Those are the detailed points that were raised. As I said about the phraseology that comes down to us from legislation under a previous Government, there is matter for further reflection. I fully accept that just because it was there before does not automatically mean that it is the right way forward now, although the previous Government undoubtedly thought that there were good reasons for it, otherwise they would not have put it there.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="1105236000118"></a>Clause 7 covers four categories of passerelles-I do not want to detain the Committee by listing them all now-that cover a wide range of different passerelle devices with which we are concerned. I like to think that Clause 7 represents a clear step, which in principle although maybe not in detail has the support of noble Lords generally, towards enhancing parliamentary control over the Government's participation in a range of important passerelle decisions at EU level. The result ought to be-indeed, the coalition Government believe it will be-an increase in Parliament's, and ultimately the British public's, sense of ownership of and engagement with the future direction of the EU.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="1105236000119"></a>Of course, in the highly sensitive areas listed in Schedule 1, as we know and have debated endlessly in Committee, the referendum lock would apply on top of parliamentary approval. However, an Act of Parliament is required in the other areas listed in the clause, which surely can only be a bonus for the public trust and accountability that we are all working towards in this legislation and in our work on the European Union generally.</p>

This sub-committee has just had before it a proposal for a Council regulation under Article 352, the subject of this clause. It is about a matter as mundane as the publication of the <I>Official Journal</I>, which noble Lords will know is the source of the authentic versions of EU legislation and other documents. At the moment, Article 297 provides that the authentic version is the published and printed version.

But if it were used, both in the German Bundestag and the British Parliament, there would have to be parliamentary approval. As noble Lords will know, when the clause says an Act of Parliament, it may be a clause within another Act of Parliament but it would have to be subject to parliamentary approval. This is a hard, technical case and I suspect that when it comes to it, other means will be found of approving this measure than Article 352.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="1105236000130"></a>Article 352 will now be used a great deal less often than its predecessors, again because the Lisbon treaty provides in so much more detail for so many other competences which the EU now has. Although during the period 2004-09, the predecessors to Article 352 were used a good many times, most of the purposes for which it was used during that period would now be covered by specific articles in the treaty. I hope that I have satisfied noble Lords with that.</p>

I wonder whether, in the spirit of co-operation and willingness to consider things in a flexible way, the Government might take away and consider-for all of these later clauses that require an Act of Parliament rather than a referendum-some flexibility that would allow a significance test to be applied by a Minister. That would require a lower level of parliamentary approval in cases where we are dealing with technicalities rather than important issues of policy.</p>

Perhaps I may remind the Government of their great leader's statement made in late 2009:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="1105236000239"></a>"We will want to prevent EU judges gaining steadily greater control over our criminal justice system by negotiating an arrangement which would protect it. That will mean limiting the European Court of Justice's jurisdiction over criminal law".</p>

<p><a name="1105236000222"></a>That is from the Prime Minister before he became so. The other quote I give the Government in probing this matter is from Mr David Lidington, made on 20 January this year:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="1105236000240"></a>"The UK has until 31 May 2014 to choose whether to accept the application of the Commission's infringement powers and jurisdiction of the ECJ over this body of instruments or to opt out of them entirely, in which case they will cease to apply to the UK on 1 December 2014".</p>

<p><a name="1105236000223"></a>More importantly-this is what I want to check up on-Mr Lidington went on to say that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="1105236000241"></a>"Parliament should have the right to give its view on a decision of such importance. The Government therefore commit to a vote in both Houses of Parliament before they make a formal decision on whether they wish to opt-out".</p>

<p><a name="1105236000224"></a>As I understand it, the provision in Protocol 21 allows the Government to opt out entirely from the whole justice and home affairs proceedings in Lisbon. It is true that if they accept an amendment to any of those provisions in the mean time, that provision then stands. Further, if in the mean time they opt in to anything, the 2014 deadline might not apply. I hope that your Lordships will feel it is helpful if the Government bring us up to date on how their decision is moving on opting out of the whole of the JHA provision. The last time I raised the matter was in Oral Questions, when I was told from the Front Bench by the noble

I am conscious that the national interest in terms of co-operation in matters of civil and criminal law is a complex area given that there are now nearly 2 million British citizens living in other states of the European Union-in Spain, France, Portugal, Cyprus and elsewhere. I have to say in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, that we have not yet come to the point where we must take a final decision on opt-in and opt-out. I have say to the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, that Her Majesty's Government have opted in to the majority of measures which have come up since the last election, but perhaps I may quote holy writ, otherwise known as the coalition agreement, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="1105236000242"></a>"We will approach forthcoming legislation in the area of criminal justice on a case-by-case basis, with a view to maximising our country's security, protecting Britain's civil liberties and preserving the integrity of our criminal justice system".</p>

<p><a name="1105236000225"></a>That is what we are doing.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="1105236000141"></a>Clause 9 deals in particular with the use of three passerelles specific to the area of justice and home affairs. These are in addition to the Government's recent commitments to enhance current parliamentary scrutiny arrangements on the use of JHA Title V opt-in and Schengen opt-out decisions following the Written Ministerial Statement of my noble friend Lord Howell and that of the Minister for Europe on 20 January this year. As your Lordships' House will be aware, the details are subject to continuing discussions between Parliament and the Government, which is part of our commitment to enhancing parliamentary control over three key EU decisions.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="1105236000142"></a>I remind your Lordships that the passerelles are: Article 81(3) of the TFEU, which permits measures concerning family law with cross-border implications to be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure and therefore qualified majority voting; Article 82(2)(d) of the TFEU, which enables the Council to add to the list of criminal law procedures that can be subject to subsequent EU legislation under the ordinary legislative procedure; and Article 83(1) of the TFEU, which allows for additions to the list of criminal offences and sanctions in the areas of serious cross-border crime on which the EU can set minimum standards. These are considered to be sufficiently serious and significant moves for this clause to stand part.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="1105236000143"></a>The parliamentary approval process for the three passerelles comprises two stages rather than one. This reflects the operation of our opt-in protocol on the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the treaties and, more specifically, the arrangements governing our opt-in. It requires two decisions to be taken: first, the initial opt-in to negotiations and, secondly, the adoption of the final negotiated measure. Clause 9 affords Parliament control over both these decisions by requiring a positive vote in both Houses to approve the Government's proposal to opt in to the negotiation, and then parliamentary approval through primary legislation once the UK has opted into the negotiation and that negotiation is complete.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="1105236000144"></a>Having said that, the clause helps to fulfil pledges made in the <I>The Coalition: Our </I><I>Programme for Government</I><I>,</I> in that the use of any passerelle clause will be subject to approval through an Act of Parliament and represents an enhanced level of control afforded to Parliament. Having reassured the Committee on that, I hope that it will accept that this clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

Therefore, my concerns are much reduced compared with my concerns about the appropriateness of the heavy provisions in some of the previous clauses. Indeed, my concerns about Clause 7 and the scope of Clause 7(4) would be more than met if the Government would consider moving some of the less significant items in Clause 7 to the procedures that we are now looking at in Clause 10.

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="1105236000148"></a>The point of substance that I want to raise comes under Clause 10(1)(c), where a procedure is laid down for the approval of decisions under Article 252 of the TFEU permitting an increase in the number of Advocates- General. There are eight Advocates-General assisting 27 Justices of the European Court of Justice. Ten years ago there were eight assisting 15, so clearly the ratio has worsened and should be corrected. The Advocates-General provide a useful element assisting the Court of Justice.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="1105236000149"></a>I was a member of the sub-committee of the splendid European Union Committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Roper. The sub-committee was chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bowness. A month ago, we recommended that an increase in the number of Advocates-General should be made as soon as possible, because that comparatively straightforward reform would assist the Court in increasing the speed with which cases could be dealt with while improving the quality of decision-making. We pointed out that there was provision in the treaty for an increase in the number of Advocates-General serving the Court and we recommended that the Court of Justice submit a request for an increase to the Council. I do not pretend that it is a very big deal that there would have to be a Motion in both Houses before we could agree. I take this opportunity to say that I hope the Government will agree and will be ready when the right moment comes to see the increase in the number of Advocates-General, which the Court clearly needs and which the UK legal profession believes it needs and is asking for.</p>

I deny absolutely the title "learned": I do not think that even calls for our Standing Orders, but I thank him. Nevertheless, given the state of the Court of Justice and the need for speedy resolution of disputes in it-as indeed in any court-it is extremely important, as I said, that we should not make the procedures so cumbersome that delay follows. If your Lordships look at this list, you will see, among other things, amendments to the statutes. Many people think it not unreasonable for the rules of procedure, at least those of the courts, to be determined by the courts themselves. They should not be a matter for the Council of Ministers, still less a matter for debate in both Houses of this Parliament. Again, I appeal to my noble friends on the Front Bench to face the prospect of some flexibility in matters relating to justice and co-operation in judicial and police matters. As I said on Second Reading, we do not know where many of these things are going and, in many instances, we need to make decisions quickly rather than later.</p>

In other words, it has the construction of a Motion to be passed rather than anything stronger in respect of matters where the Government might, later on, quite understandably regret the tangle into which they have got as a result of decisions whose details would look quite routine.

The Government could regret that later on because it would create quite an onerous obligation for them to go back into full procedure in Parliament-although in general terms we are all in favour of that intrinsically-on matters which really should be dealt with quite easily and expeditiously. In the new spirit of co-operation which has been breaking out in this, the seventh allotted day of our Committee of the whole House, where the Government are now listening-the whole House is grateful for that-I hope that before we terminate the Committee's proceedings, today or later this week, there will be some promise to reconsider this vital area as well.</p>

In 2001, Ireland voted against the Nice treaty; similarly, there were more concessions and another referendum. In May 2005, France voted by a large majority against the constitutional treaty, followed three days later by an equally emphatic rejection by the Dutch electorate of that constitutional treaty.

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="1105236000160"></a>Next in the ring is Monsieur Giscard d'Estaing, the ex-President of France, one of the hapless fathers of the constitutional treaty, who said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="1105236000246"></a>"It is not France that has said no. It is 55 per cent of the French people".</p>

People like Laurent Fabius made it part of their campaign that, "It's not that we're against Europe, it's that this isn't for a sufficiently social Europe". In that sense, the argument was right; this was a vote not against Europe but against a particular view of Europe.</p>

So whatever the noble Lord on the Front Bench may say, there was a rejection by the French people by a 55 per cent majority of the constitutional treaty.

<p><a name="1105236000229"></a>The reason, he admitted, was above all to avoid having referendums.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="1105236000168"></a>Yet again, that ungrateful bunch the Irish threw a shillelagh in the works by voting against the Lisbon treaty. What an unnecessary obstacle these referendums are to the furtherance of the great project. For their pains, the Irish were roundly vilified. A leading German politician said that a no vote was real cheek, while a British Labour MP said that the Irish had voted no because they had become entirely too arrogant. True to form, Ireland was shamelessly vilified by the Eurocracy and told to hold another referendum, which duly gave the so-called "right answer". Not that this has done the Irish any good, of course; their reward has been to be sacrificed on the altar of the solidarity of the euro, to be loaded with debt that they will probably never be able to pay back and to be told by the French that they must raise their corporation tax. So much for EU solidarity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="1105236000169"></a>Noble Lords can see that the European elite have form when it comes to reversing the results of referendums that do not suit them. The amendment will reassure the people of this country at least that when they vote no in a referendum on any of the items in Section 6 against a transfer of further powers to the EU, their vote will not be nullified by an immediate demand for another referendum and to think again.

He may recall that in 1975 there was a referendum in this country, which was carried by a substantial majority, on whether we should stay in the European Economic Community, as it then was.

Behaviour of that sort is a denial of the right to say, "Change cannot take place unless we all agree and, as we don't all agree, you and I must put up with the status quo". That is what signing a treaty is all about. I submit that what happened over Denmark in the early 1990s, after the Danish people voted no to Maastricht in June 1992, was an abuse of power. It was also a terrible lost opportunity, which was responsible for much of the trouble and strife that hit the Major Government.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="1105236000173"></a>My noble friend Lord Spicer wrote a very perceptive article on this in <I>Total Politics</I> in March of this year. I hope Governments have learnt from what then happened. The Conservative Government were not happy about many aspects of Maastricht, particularly the removal from sovereign states of the power to manage their own economies. While we had opted out of the euro, there was a nagging fear that the European Court might even find that our opt-out was illegal.</p>

All I am telling noble Lords now is what the history of the matter is. The history that I have related so far is entirely correct. The Conservative Government were obviously not happy about many aspects of Maastricht, which was precisely why they, with considerable perspicacity, negotiated the opt-out. However, having opted out, there were still great dangers ahead. Therefore, when the Danes rejected Maastricht there was an opportunity to block the treaty and work for a fresh start in which energies would be concentrated not on trying to manage the economies of the member states, but on extending the borders of the EEC and creating a fully competitive common market within those borders. But that opportunity was all thrown away. If it had not been and there had been a fresh start, the EU would not be in the mess it is in today, bailing out countries which are "broke" as a result of having been put in the straitjacket of the euro.</p>

<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="1105236000179"></a><b><a name="110523-0001.htm_spnew115"></a><a name="1105236000421"></a>Lord Stoddart of Swindon:</b> My Lords, I am a signatory to this amendment and, of course, support it. The noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, has provided a good deal of the history of referendums in other countries. The most recent case of a further referendum was in the Irish Republic, where the first referendum was held on 12 June 2008. During that referendum, Mr Barroso intervened to warn that, if the Irish rejected the Lisbon treaty, there was no plan B under any circumstances, and that there would be dire consequences not only for Ireland but for the whole of the European Union. Nevertheless, the Irish voted no on a 53 per cent turnout, with 53.4 per cent voting no and 46.6 per cent voting yes. There was pandemonium all over the place, especially in the European Union. Many people thought that the Irish had spoken and that that should be the end of the matter, especially as Mr Barroso had denied that there was a plan B, but obviously there was a plan B-another referendum. That took place on 2 October 2009. As noble Lords will know, the result was reversed after a bitter campaign, during which the European Commission and the Irish Government weighed in with taxpayers' money-probably illegally, incidentally. According to Mr Jens-Peter Bonde, who at that time was a senior MEP, the Commission and the Irish Government between them spent millions of euros supporting the yes campaign. As if this huge support was not enough, large amounts were also contributed by vested interests, including €250,000 by Ryanair. In fact, 10 times as much was spent on the yes campaign as on the no campaign-little wonder, then, that the Irish people reversed their first vote by a 2:1 majority.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="1105236000180"></a>However, that was not the first time that the Irish people had been made to vote again. When they had the temerity to vote no to the Nice treaty, they had to vote again to provide the only answer that was acceptable to the European Union and the Irish Government-in other words, if people do not provide the right answer first time round, they will be made to vote again until they do. That is the impression that is given, and that is why in many respects the European Union and some of the nation states are held in contempt by their peoples.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="1105236000181"></a>However, as we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, the Irish people were not the only ones who were made to vote again. When the Danish people voted no to the Maastricht treaty in 1992, they were forced to vote again a year later in 1993. Again, the no campaign was out-financed and clobbered by their own Government and others with vested interests in obtaining a yes vote-and this was duly achieved. However, as noble Lords may remember, when the result was declared the Danish people were so annoyed that they actually rioted in Copenhagen, the police fired 113 shots into the crowd when it was trapped, and 11 people were treated for gunshot wounds. When people feel cheated about their decisions, in some cases and under some circumstances, they are prepared to cause mayhem and riot.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="1105236000182"></a>Therefore, for these and other reasons, I support the amendment and hope that the Government will accept it. Before I sit down, I ask for an assurance from the Government that in any referendum under the Bill they will not use taxpayers' money to support one side of the argument, and that they will prevent the use of taxpayers' money by any institution of the European Union to support one side of the argument. That should include the European Parliament, which has just voted for a change in funding rules that will allow cross-national EU political groups of MEPs to take part in referendum campaigns in member states. It would be quite outrageous if MEPs from any part of the EU, with taxpayers' money through their expenses, were able to indulge themselves in a specifically British referendum. Unless the Government can assure us that they will block such activities, I support the amendment.</p>

The forced holding of second referenda has been shameful and has involved quite improper practices. However, I should like to make two points on why the amendment may not be appropriate for this country. The first is that any second referendum would require the approval of both Houses of Parliament. I trust that this House, unless it is dangerously interfered with, would act properly in that situation. Secondly, in the event of a referendum on "in or out" in which people voted to stay in but certain developments in Europe within the five-year period made the situation dramatically different, it would be unwise to be limited by a five-year rule that the UK could not reconsider the issue again in the light of future developments. Many Members of this House are sympathetic to the amendment on the improper use of forced second referenda, but such a measure would not be appropriate in this country.</p>

There was, however, a difference between the two referenda in Ireland, and the difference was that the Irish Government believe that they negotiated a stronger deal. They were going to lose their Commissioner and various other things, so they negotiated hard and obtained changes.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="1105236000185"></a>The way in which Brussels went about things in the Republic was brutal. People felt intimidated and threatened, and their financial security was threatened. Of course we can see why that happened and the genuine concern. Public opinion in the Republic since the imposition of what the public regard as penal conditions surrounding the bailout is shifting against the European Union. I have no doubt that, as the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said, there was intimidation. It was not a pretty picture. However, one thing that would worry me about the amendment is that if a proposition were before our Government and Parliament that contained certain conditions that we objected to and those conditions were subsequently, because of the referendum, negotiated out, where would we be if we found that we had what we had asked for? We would not be able to do anything about it for five years. That is my only concern. I do not dispute the  


<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1620"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1620</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sentiment or what actually happened, because I saw it from next door, and it was brutal. However, the Irish Government negotiated a better deal. That is my only reservation about the amendment. If we found that we were able to negotiate, we would be hamstrung.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="1105236000186"></a>The other lesson is that having a referendum behind you as a requirement has proved to be a strong negotiating tool. The Irish are a classic example. Because of their fundamental financial weakness, they were not able to press it home, but they got improvements. In our circumstances, what would we do if we were able to negotiate what we wanted and achieved our objectives?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="1105236000190"></a>However, it is true that the Conservatives forced through the Maastricht treaty, so presumably they were quite pleased with it. Some of us resisted it in this House. In his defence, one has to say that Mr Major had discovered the error of his ways by 12 November 1996, when he wrote a letter to M Jacques Santer, who was then, whatever it was called at the time, the boss of the European Commission. The letter shows how Mr Major, and possibly the Conservative Administration at the time, realised how they had been deceived by the cunning and duplicitous octopus in Brussels. His letter is very brief, and I have read it to your Lordships before-in 1998, I think, so it bears repetition now. It reads:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="1105236000248"></a>"Dear Jacques,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="1105236000249"></a>My intention in agreeing to the Protocol on Social Policy at Maastricht was to ensure that social legislation which placed unnecessary burdens on businesses and damaged competitiveness could not be imposed on the United Kingdom. The other Heads of State and Government also agreed that arrangement, without which there would have been no agreement at all at Maastricht.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="1105236000250"></a>However, in its judgement today, the European Court of Justice has ruled that the scope of Article 118a"-</p>

<ul><a name="1105236000265"></a>"is much broader than the United Kingdom envisaged when the article was originally agreed, as part of the Single European Act. This appears to mean that legislation which the United Kingdom had expected would be dealt with under the Protocol can in fact be adopted under Article 118a".</ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="1105236000251"></a>"This is contrary to the clear and express wishes of the United Kingdom Government, and goes directly counter to the spirit of what we agreed at Maastricht. It is unacceptable and must be remedied".</p>

<p><a name="1105236000232"></a>He then says that he will table amendments and so on to it. His penultimate paragraph says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="1105236000252"></a>"I attach the utmost importance to these amendments and I shall insist that they form part of the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference.

<p><a name="1105236000233"></a>That was in the run-up to the Amsterdam treaty. The Conservatives then lost the election and the new Labour Government signed up to the Social Chapter anyway, so we have the working week and so on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="1105236000192"></a>Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, said that the reason the French voted against the Giscard constitution was that they wanted a more social Europe. My simple question to him is: why did the Dutch then vote in exactly the same way two days later? I support the amendment.</p>

Having listened to what has been said in this debate, I have to say that some of the accounts of the facts do very scant justice either to what took place or, indeed, to some other countries. To be told that people were made to vote again and that the referenda were enforced appears to give very little credit whatever to the determination of the peoples of Denmark, Ireland, France or Holland, and I do not see why we should spend our time here insulting them. They were perfectly capable of settling the first propositions put in front of them and they were perfectly capable of assessing the changes. If it is said that, for example, consent was finally achieved in Ireland because of the financial problems that the country was facing-bailed out, it was said, by the straitjacket of the euro-I find that an astonishing bit of history. The banking and liquidity collapse of the country appears to have had no role; the sub-prime derivatives in which the banks of that country were so heavily involved that it had to set up a "bad bank" to deal with the mass of debt that had been accumulated appears to have had no role; and the massive speculative forces in property, finally producing a major financial threat which arose from those kinds of difficulties, also apparently had no role.</p>

In the same sense, I hope that we would have sufficient sovereign pride to conclude such an issue ourselves, although I think it highly improbable. Perhaps I may add that the circumstances in which people might be asked to vote a third, fourth or subsequent time seem not at all likely.</p>

That resulted in people borrowing as much as they could and putting the money into assets such as property. That produced the property bubble, and the bursting of the property bubble was the main cause of the banking system's problems.</p>

It was a wave of mad speculation-it can only be described as madness, because it was possible to do it under the interest-rate conditions that obtained generally around the world. They are not so varied between countries in either hemisphere.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="1105236000198"></a>Of course it is true that in the referenda conducted in the countries that we are discussing, they concluded, as they were perfectly entitled to do, that what was being put in front of them was not good enough. We know, however, in part from the noble Lord, Lord Empey, in terms of the role of the commissioner in Ireland, and the issues that came up in Denmark on whether the people would be compelled into defence propositions that they did not like; or whether people in Ireland would be compelled to change the abortion law, or consider NATO membership, that all of those things produced circumstances in which there was a no vote. Those Governments negotiated again and got those terms changed. Protocols were introduced in almost every incidence to get those terms changed. They then went back and asked the people of their countries whether the changes in terms were sufficient to merit a change in the view that they had taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="1105236000199"></a>That seems to me to be completely legitimate. I cannot for the life of me understand why someone would say that it is a legitimate outcome if you vote no by, say, 52.5 per cent-that is plainly a no vote; I understand that completely-but when it is put again it is completely illegitimate if something like 65 per cent of the people in that vote say yes. What is the point of a sovereign decision by people when they are asked to take a vote if you do not accept the outcome in either direction-like it or dislike it; it is irrelevant? It is their decision and they have taken it. The idea that any country, least of all this one, should feel that it is bound to be strong-armed into taking a different decision if the first decision does not accord with perhaps the general sentiment in Europe is completely

We have had accusations of the European elite forcing the holding of second referendums. I wondered whether we were going to be told by the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, that the European gendarmerie would be used to force second referendums. I recall him previously raising the question of what the European gendarmerie was for. We talked about EU bullying as if somehow Brussels is different and imposes itself on national governments. I simply remind noble Lords that the European Union is an association of states and that Brussels operates on behalf of those member states. It is the member states which agree on proposals of the sort likely to be put to referendums.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="1105236000201"></a>On Ireland, I would simply say that the situation may or may not have been to some extent associated with Irish membership of the euro. The situation in Iceland was an even greater financial bubble and can in no sense be blamed on Iceland's membership of the euro since Iceland is neither a member of the euro nor of the European Union. We need to get away from that. On the question of financing the Irish referendums, I am not aware of how the second referendum was financed beyond the fact that I have three very good friends in Dublin who took out substantial loans on their houses to guarantee the basic funding for a second referendum. When my wife and I had dinner with them some months after the referendum, they were still very heavily in debt. That suggests to me that there were no sugar daddies, let alone external forces, providing funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="1105236000202"></a>Clearly the amendment has been tabled with memories in mind of the Danish and Irish experiences. Noble Lords have been reminded that in both cases there were renegotiations, and that the packages that were put back to the electorate represented concessions and opt-outs offered by other member Governments to those Governments who returned to ask their electorates to accept a modified package.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="1105236000203"></a>It is not appropriate to accept this requirement in statute for two broad reasons. Should the British electorate vote no in a referendum, the Government clearly will have to reflect on what action to take. If they were to decide to hold a referendum on the same issue-I am sure that there would be arguments over whether it was the same, a similar or a modified issue-they would first have to secure Parliament's agreement to the new piece of primary legislation required to establish and hold the referendum. That would allow ample opportunity for debate on whether the principle and the timing were right to hold a further referendum on the same subject. I remind noble Lords that Governments will not call referendums in Britain unless they wish to argue that it is in Britain's national interest to accept the case that they are making.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="1105236000204"></a>If the Government were defeated in a referendum, it would be tantamount to a defeat of the Government: they would have been defeated on their view of the British national interest. Therefore, the Government

It would be unusual for the Government then to consider asking the public the same question in short order, having failed to convince them of the benefits of the treaty change the first time round.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="1105236000205"></a>However, there is another point. Given our lack of perfect foresight of future circumstances, there might be a situation where the Government and Parliament might judge that a treaty change previously rejected by the British people was even more necessary and desirable, perhaps because of intervening external or internal events. Flexibility is something that many noble Lords have argued for in Committee: we cannot entirely foretell the future. If both Government and Parliament were then to decide that circumstances had changed enough to warrant asking the people again, Parliament should be able to do this without having to wait for the end of the five-year moratorium. I am happy to repeat that this Government would think it highly unusual and politically costly to suggest rerunning a referendum on the same subject without very good reason. However, for the reasons that I have given, I am not convinced that a fixed-term cooling-off period is the answer. Having people judge such a move at the ballot box surely would be a more effective deterrent. Therefore, I urge noble Lords to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act makes it entirely clear that there are tight controls on the funding of referendums by political parties and other actors, including those outside the European Union. My understanding of the clause is that the European Commission would not be allowed to spend more than £10,000 in the course of a referendum. I hope that that provides the answer that the noble Lord needs. If any further details are required, I will of course write to him.

The underlying purpose of the amendment is to lay a duty on Ministers to put the case for the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union, not just during a referendum but in general and at all times. It has been said that the coalition agreement on Europe tries to reconcile two conflicting ideas; indeed, I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, who said that. The amendment is very much in line with that part of the coalition agreement which says,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="11052325000129"></a>"Britain should play a leading role in an enlarged European Union",</p>

<p><a name="11052325000122"></a>and that the aim of the Government is to,</p>
<ul><a name="11052325000130"></a>"strike the right balance between constructive engagement with the EU ... and protecting our national sovereignty".</ul>
<a name="110523-0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="11052325000007"></a>Why should a duty be placed on Ministers to argue the case for Europe? Surely they can be relied on to make that case without a legal obligation being placed on them. I can see some merit in that argument, but the fact is that, in the years since the 1975 referendum and with honourable exceptions, British Ministers of different parties have been very hesitant about speaking up for United Kingdom membership. I am sad to say that that also includes Ministers from my own party while in government. Certainly the last two Prime Ministers, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, made the occasional fine speech about the benefits of membership. Tony Blair was particularly eloquent when speaking on the continent-for example in his Warsaw speech and in his June 2005 address to the European Parliament. However, inside the UK, his pro-membership speeches were less frequent and, I thought, less impressive.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="11052325000008"></a>Of course, both men were so reluctant to speak up mainly because they were extremely worried by and concerned about the possible reaction of the Eurosceptic media, especially the Murdoch press, which spent a lot of time taking Ministers apart, particularly the Prime Minister if they thought he was going too far on the European Union issue. In view of the track record, I believe Ministers need the support of Parliament to bolster them and to give them strength in the face of a hostile media.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="11052325000009"></a>There is a further consideration. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, has frequently drawn attention during our debates to the "disconnect"-I think that that is his word-between the British public and their political leaders over the European issue. Indeed, that is his main justification for the Bill and for the plethora of referenda that could flow from it. Certainly, according to public opinion polls, the British remain reluctant Europeans and fairly ill informed about the EU. Given the hostility of the press and the reticence of Ministers, it is hardly surprising that the British should feel that they do not have enough information about what goes on.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="11052325000010"></a>There are some exceptions to the ministerial silence, and I am glad that I can mention one Minister in this House. I have already praised the Europe Minister, David Lidington, a Member of Parliament in the other place, for setting out in a Commons Written Answer why he believes that United Kingdom membership is in the national interest. The reasons he gave included:  


<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1627"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1627</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>giving British business access to the world's most important trading zone-that of 500 million consumers -without the barriers of customs or tariffs; the 3.5 million UK jobs that are reliant on exports to EU member states; the beneficial impact of EU trade, amounting to between £1,100 and £3,300 a year for each UK household; and being able to influence developments in the EU and giving the UK greater leverage and negotiating power on the global stage. I thought that that was a pretty good summing up of the case for British membership in a short Parliamentary Answer.</p>

<a name="110523-0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="11052325000011"></a>More recently, the Commercial Secretary to the Treasury, the noble Lord, Lord Sassoon, stressed to this House-I think in answer to a question from the noble Lord behind me-that the United Kingdom gets much more out of the EU than it puts in. It is right that Ministers should say that, because sometimes if you listen to the remarks of some noble Lords in this House-members of UKIP-and indeed read the remarks in a number of newspapers, you would think the opposite. The noble Lord, Lord Sassoon, mentioned the access to EU markets, cheaper prices and greater choice on our high streets, more foreign investment and a stronger voice in the world for the UK. I think that it would be very good if we heard the same from the two Ministers representing the Foreign Office here. I have said already to them that I should like to see them make more speeches about the case for British membership. It would be good if the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and the Foreign Secretary also could add their voices to explain not only the economic benefits of membership but also the strategic advantages that the UK derives from working so closely with our nearest neighbours. As we have discovered in this country time and again in our history, what happens on the continent has a major impact on us. So-called splendid isolation, as advocated by noble Lords behind me, is simply not an option in the modern world, if it ever was so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="11052325000012"></a>I make no apologies for moving my amendment in the way that I have. As I have been arguing, I believe that to counteract the sustained hostility of the press, Ministers need the support of parliamentary statute to help them to put the case for our membership of the European Union, of which we have been a member for nearly 40 years-although one might not think so when listening to some noble Lords. Above all, we need a less negative attitude towards the EU. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, who is in the Chamber, said at Second Reading, the key idea of this Bill is to place an unprecedented system of referendum locks on the statute book. That could, as he warned us, act as a long-term break on UK participation in the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="11052325000013"></a>As many noble Lords have said, this EU Bill is based on the wrong premise about our membership.

My view is that if there has been a bias in the past, it has been for Ministers, in their desire to get the agreement of the House and the country to treaty changes, to downplay some of the consequences of those treaty changes that they did not wish the country to realise until it was too late. That has been part of the reason for the successive loss of trust in the Government and the European Union-the balanced arguments have not been put forward.</p>

Britain has been a member of NATO for a very long time. It is an organisation which also has its faults. I have never seen a British Minister make a speech about NATO which did not support it. Why can they not do it about the European Union too?</p>

It is up to Ministers to take their view and to make those views known. That is all I am saying about the European Union; namely, that it is up to Ministers to take a view and make that view known but that they should be allowed and, indeed, have an obligation on them, to state both sides of the case and make sure that they are not putting a too Panglossian view of the European Union in the way that this amendment would suggest.</p>

Many years ago, I shared the view of many members of the Labour Party when I expressed the opinion that our membership of the EU was wrong. My noble friend Lord Radice took a different view. He was right and I was wrong. Having been a commissioner of the EU for some time, and having been in charge of transport, the environment and the nuclear industry, I formed the view that on all those issues, the voice of Europe should be positive and heard. I never came to the conclusion that we should somehow shilly-shally on those issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="11052325000026"></a>My noble friend Lord Liddle was in Europe as well. I think that he would share my view that it is imperative that members of the Commission should be heard. At the moment, their views are drowned out by people who take a contrary view, such as the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, who is a great friend of mine despite our differences of opinion on this issue. When the then President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, spoke to the TUC in Bournemouth, it was a remarkable event. I wish that more members of the Labour Party and of this House had been present. It was remarkable because many people in the TUC did not share that view. But he was rather positive about the virtues of the European Union and he convinced most of those present that that was right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="11052325000027"></a>Unfortunately, in recent times Ministers from both parties have been less than forthcoming with their views on the European Union. I wish that that was not the case. Therefore I support the views expressed by my noble friend Lord Radice on this point. It is incumbent on members of this Administration to speak out about the virtues of the European Union. It is quite impossible for us to withdraw from the EU or play a lesser part in it, although some people here would like us to do so. It is absolutely vital that the case for the European Union should be advanced by Ministers at all times, and that is singularly lacking at the present moment.</p>

The idea that Government Ministers should be under a legal requirement to propagandise for the European Union really is too odd for words. It is absurd. On the one hand we have the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, saying rather sadly that no one speaks up for the EU so nobody knows how wonderful it is, while only a few moments earlier the noble Lord, Lord Radice, observed how often the noble Lord, Lord Sassoon, has said how wonderful our membership is. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, has frequently reminded us of the manifold benefits of paying £15 billion a year for the EU and running a £20 billion trade deficit. He is quite right to do so.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="11052325000031"></a>To make Ministers legally responsible for what is frankly propaganda is absurd. Surely the arguments have been made. People have now grown up and there are all sorts of means of communication. We have the internet, the hated Murdoch press which, of course, is balanced by the BBC and other spokesmen for the EU. I do not see how the Government have any role to play in this whatever. I hope that the Committee rejects the amendment without further debate.</p>

The BBC is not the other side of Murdoch. If you look at your BlackBerry each morning, you can see that what the papers and all the BBC programmes do is report what the <I>Daily Mail</I> says, followed by what the <I>Daily Express</I> says, followed by what the <I>Times</I> says and followed by what the <I>Sun</I> says; and so it goes on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="11052325000033"></a>My noble friend Lord Radice is absolutely right to say that in the populist environment of the red tops, along with a lot of money from the foreign exchange markets and people with a particular interest in the City of London, it is difficult to see how a referendum could be conducted on a level playing field unless we do something. I am reminded of what the then Labour Government did in about 1967, which by common consent was quite useful. We had a counterinflation campaign. There was indeed government information, which could be called propaganda, which explained the economic necessity for doing what the country needed through social partners-a term much derided by people who did not know trading from an elephant. We were able to win the support of the majority of the people of Burton-on-Trent precisely because factual information was put forward.</p>

I will not repeat those arguments now, but any student of these matters can look up the case against the single market and why his famous 3 million jobs are not worth much against the 4.5 million jobs which they have through making things and exporting them to clients in this country. I also discussed why we can trade with a market of 350 million people through free trade in the same way as 63 other countries around the world do at the moment, now moving towards 75 countries. There is really no advantage to our membership of the European Union which we could not enjoy through free trade and friendly collaboration. I will not go down that obvious and inviting route.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="11052325000036"></a>What I will do is produce some statistics and facts to show that the wicked Murdochite and Desmondite et cetera press is more than balanced by the BBC in this country. It is not as the noble Lord, Lord Lea, suggests. In 2005, thanks to continuous monitoring by the organisation Mediawatch-UK, the BBC was forced to hold its first ever independent inquiry into some of its political coverage, in this case its coverage of the European Union and our relationship with it. The whole of that story can be found on the Global Britain website. That independent inquiry, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Wilson of Dinton, found unequivocally that the BBC's coverage of our relationship with the European Union was inadequate and biased. The BBC responded in November 2005 and made one clear promise: to explain to the British people how the institutions of the European Union work, how they interact, and their effect on our British way of life.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="11052325000037"></a>I trust that the noble Lord, Lord Radice, agrees with me that it is a great pity that the BBC has never fulfilled that promise. It would be helpful to the debate between us, because obviously we are never going to agree, if the BBC did conduct such an unbiased debate and at least told the British people what they are voting for when they vote for the European Parliament. They do not have a clue what the European Parliament is, or where it fits into the European law-making process, that of laws being proposed in secret by the unelected Commission, negotiated in secret in COREPER and passed in secret in the Council. The people do not know that. I think that if the BBC were to explain all that, Euroscepticism in this country would rise. The noble Lord, Lord Radice, and other noble and Europhile Lords presumably think that public opinion would swing in favour of the European Union.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="11052325000038"></a>I have one devastating statistic from the BBC's coverage. Over the past six years, the "Today" programme has devoted only 0.004 per cent of its coverage to any discussion about withdrawal from the European Union. That figure, which has not been bettered anywhere else in the BBC, has to be set against that of the roughly 25 per cent of the British people who voted for a withdrawalist perspective in the last European elections, and roughly 5 per cent at the last general election. We have a British public who are massively more interested and massively more Eurosceptical than the BBC gives them space for.</p>

I cannot understand why the Government go on refusing to do that. I hope that we can agree, and I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Radice, will accept that the answer to his amendment is not that it should be seen through, but that there should at least be a genuine economic cost-benefit analysis of our EU membership. We can leave aside the constitutional disaster of EU membership; let us just look at the money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="11052325000041"></a>Of course there are many things wrong with the European Union, as there are with the United Nations, with our special relationship with United States and with many other aspects of international institutions, one recently mentioned being NATO.

Neither your Lordships nor I have got time to go back at great length, but such an attitude dates from our refusal to have any part in the Coal and Steel Community of 1951, our refusal to take part in the 1957 treaty of Rome, with our dismissal of the enterprise as being unlikely to succeed, our failure to recognise the astonishing achievement in bringing Spain, Portugal and Greece, all of them dictatorships, into a framework of democracy which has been sustained, undoubtedly with some difficulty, right up to the present time-which is an amazing achievement-and our total lack of interest or great concern with the European Union's extension eastwards into central Europe, the Baltic states and elsewhere, countries for which the European Union, alongside their membership of NATO, were the guarantees of their future democracy and stability.

At the most parochial level, when we look at the cleanness of our beaches and at the fact that the Thames river now has salmon all way up to the Pool of London, we see that that is due directly to European Union directives, though nobody is ever

I could go on-I shall not-but what I find so sad is that we in this country have failed to give a constructive lead to the European Union and spend almost all our time carping about it. We are right to criticise it-yes-but to carp, to sour and to change and distort the facts in the way that happens in the British press is astonishing and not copied in France, Germany, Spain or most other major countries of the European Union. It is a unique aspect of a certain kind of British moaning about the great opportunities that it has decided not to follow up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="11052325000044"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Radice, spoke about the Murdoch press and Associated Newspapers. Those newspapers do not simply produce balanced and constructive criticism of the European Union; they continually emit a series of distorted statements, falsified facts and false scandals which rarely come home. One should compare them with the one newspaper that I think everybody in this House would recognise does not grind very strong party axes and attempts seriously to devote itself to society and the public good, in providing the nearest thing to truth that can be provided-I refer, to your Lordships' surprise perhaps, to the <I>Financial Times.</I> The indications, the outlines, the descriptions and the analysis in the <I>Financial Times</I> of what is actually going on in Europe are unique in being genuinely international, genuinely global and genuinely objective in a way that most newspapers do not pretend or even try to be. One reads in that newspaper lots of criticisms and worries about the eurozone and so on, but it provides a picture of what is happening that is far better balanced than that which one gets from most of the other major tabloids or even for that matter, sadly, some of the major broadsheets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="11052325000045"></a>Our future as a country lies in working closely with the European Union. It is not just me who says that; it is people such as President Obama and the leaders of China. Our major neighbour nations recognise that the UK's future as a serious player on the world stage is very closely linked to the extent to which we can co-operate with our neighbours in Europe. That is very strongly the view of the United States; it has been over several presidencies-I do not doubt that we shall hear anything very different when the present President of the United States comes here on Wednesday. Should we not at least give a moment's pause for some of our closest friends and best allies when they say to the United Kingdom, "Please, think constructively about what you can contribute to the future, and think about how the Commonwealth and Europe together could create a world of greater peace and greater balance"? Just for once, let us move away from the negative position that we in this country so often take and look at the prospects for our children and grandchildren. Let us notice that they inevitably require us to work, not uncritically, but thoughtfully and constructively, with our European neighbours to make the world a somewhat better place.</p>

However, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Radice, that he is wrong in his view that Ministers of all Governments have not promoted the European Union or the European ideal. In fact, we have progressed-if that is the right word-from what was supposed to be a common market to what is now, almost, a new country called Europe. We need to understand that all the way along, ratchet by ratchet, treaty by treaty, Governments have promoted our memberships, first, of the Common Market and now the European Union. They have done so in the belief that things should be done better by a group rather than by individual nations. That is not what the British people think; they believe that Britain should remain a self-governing nation.</p>

There is virtually no policy area where the European Union is not now involved. It is even involved in taxation and the control of our financial institutions. It takes the lead in foreign affairs and virtually all issues of British policy now have, in part or as a whole, a European Union basis. That is all I want to say for the moment, but I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Radice, will withdraw his amendment, which is ill conceived.</p>

The Government believe that freedom of speech is a cornerstone of our democracy, and that it is of the greatest importance that people should be able to discuss and debate issues as freely and openly as possible. This includes those occasions when freedom of speech is exercised provocatively, as it is supposed to be in a free country. Plainly, however, there are also occasions when an individual is entitled to have their privacy protected. There is a balance to be struck and this is reflected in our existing legal framework. The Government recognise the importance of finding the correct balance between individual rights to privacy on the one hand and rights to freedom of expression and transparency of official information on the other. We also recognise that there are widely differing views on what that balance should be. It is in no one's interest to rush to judgment on this.</p>

While such decisions will necessarily be made in each particular case dependent on the facts of that case, it does offer a likelihood of some greater clarity.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="11052325000052"></a>The report indicates that when some degree of secrecy is necessary, the facts of the case and the reason for secrecy should be explained, as far as possible, in an openly available judgment. It also emphasises that super-injunctions-where the fact that there is an injunction has to be kept secret as well as the substantive issues-are now being granted for only very short periods where secrecy is necessary to ensure that the whole point of the order is not destroyed. We hope that its analysis and recommendations should help to allay concerns that super-injunctions were being granted far too readily and about their potential open-endedness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="11052325000053"></a>Of course, a range of wider issues has been raised by the events of the past few months and especially the past weekend. We take seriously the need to ensure that we have the correct balance between privacy and freedom of expression. Today the Prime Minister is writing to the chair of both the Liaison and Justice Committees and my right honourable friend the chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee recommending that a Joint Committee be established to consider how current arrangements can be improved. Such a committee will be able to use representation of both Houses and the considerable expertise that Select Committees have to examine whether the current arrangements are working and to consider whether we might make any changes that would make things work better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="11052325000054"></a>In the mean time, it is right to emphasise that just as any change to the law is for Parliament, the interpretation of the law is a responsibility placed on the judiciary. Legal mechanisms exist to review individual decisions that may be mistaken. If we believe in the rule of law, it is our duty as parliamentarians to uphold these principles".</p>

I agree with a great deal of it. As far as this side is concerned, we agree that there should be a privacy law. Of course, the privacy law has to respect free speech. It involves striking a balance between an individual's right to privacy and the need for free expression.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="11052325000057"></a>That, basically, is the law currently. It requires an independent, neutral figure to strike the balance between freedom of speech and an individual's right to privacy. Nobody else can do that apart from the judges, and the judges who have been doing that have been doing it in accordance with the law, not through some invented new law that they are creating.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="11052325000058"></a>I completely understand and respect that individual Members of Parliament are entitled to wreck privacy injunctions because they think that they know better, but our system has worked well over the years, with Parliament dealing with laws and the judges dealing with individual cases. I have no idea of the detailed balance involved in relation to the Fred Goodwin case or the case that has been brought to public attention today. I do know that I know a lot less than the judges involved and that they were applying the law. I have no idea, for example, of the extent to which the families of the plaintiffs in those cases were thought to be affected by the terms of the injunction.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="11052325000059"></a>I welcome the creation of the Joint Committee. The matter should be looked at. We are getting close to a Rubicon in relation to this. The law is as it is. It is unlikely to be changed substantially because of the European Convention on Human Rights. There should not be this excited state about injunctions that have been granted. Instead, people, including parliamentarians, should comply with their spirit. There is something quite ugly about unpopular people being named in Parliament despite the fact that a judge has thought that they are entitled to privacy.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="11052325000060"></a>I have a few questions for the Advocate-General. First, do the Government agree that there needs to be a law on privacy? Secondly, do they agree that such a law must comply with the European Convention on Human Rights? Thirdly, does the Advocate-General agree that the judges are currently simply applying the law as determined by Parliament through the Human Rights Act 1998? Fourthly, what advice does the Advocate-General give to Members of Parliament-Peers or MPs-in relation to wrecking injunctions that have been made by the judges? Would his advice be the same as mine that perhaps it would be better to leave the courts to decide those issues rather than deciding for oneself whether a person should be entitled to what is currently his or her legal right?</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="11052325000062"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport indicated last week that a privacy law would not be ruled out. However, having set up a Joint Committee, that is very much the sort of issue that we would expect it to consider. The noble and learned Lord is right to say that the European Convention on Human Rights will influence and be material to the shaping of any future law should there be such a change. It is important to recognise that that was not overlooked when the 1998 Act was going through Parliament. As he will remember, having been a law officer at the time, there was quite a focus on the interplay between Articles 8 and 10. Indeed, Section 12 of the Human Rights Act was introduced to encourage and enjoin the judiciary, when considering such matters, to have proper regard to the importance of freedom of expression. Each set of circumstances and each case  


<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1637"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1637</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will be different, but clearly one can only expect and believe that the judges have been carrying out their duties in accordance with their judicial oath. As I indicated in the final paragraph of the Statement, the interpretation of the law is a responsibility placed on the judiciary and we would expect parliamentarians to uphold these principles.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="11052325000063"></a>Sub judice conventions exist in both Houses of Parliament and I am sure that anyone who seeks to raise such issues will take care in doing so. Perhaps it would be best to refer to the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which the Master of the Rolls also quotes in his report. This Joint Committee, reporting in 1999, said that the sub judice rules were needed,</p>
<ul><a name="11052325000131"></a>"to strike a balance between two sets of principles. On the one hand, the rights of parties in legal proceedings should not be prejudiced by discussion of their case in Parliament, and Parliament should not prevent the courts from exercising their functions. On the other hand, Parliament has a constitutional right to discuss any matter it pleases".</ul>
<p><a name="11052325000123"></a>In his press conference last Friday, the Lord Chief Justice indicated that he entirely agreed with that, and I do as well. We would perhaps all do well to reflect on those words from a previous Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege.</p>

I also welcome what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, said in response. However, is it clear whether the Joint Committee will have a remit to examine the practice of Parliament in relation to these matters? Parliament has long had a sub judice rule as a way of protecting the work which Parliament has assigned to the courts from undue interference by Parliament itself in exercising its undoubted right to discuss anything. It is extremely important that that aspect of parliamentary practice should be examined in the light of the present situation. As the quotation from the report of the Master of the Rolls shows, the sub judice rule was very much in the forefront.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="11052325000065"></a>This matter goes somewhat beyond the sub judice rule in this sense. The sub judice rule was put in place to protect the decisions which the judges had to make from prior discussion in Parliament, which might prejudice or pre-empt that decision, whereas the feature that we are dealing with at the moment seems to be an attempt to negate the effect of a judgment by using parliamentary privilege for that purpose. The situation is that a judge has decided that the person in question has a legal right to privacy on the matter. The question is whether it is appropriate for parliamentary privilege to be used to damage the effectiveness of that right and, if so, under what conditions, and subject to what rules. This matter requires quite detailed consideration. I do not believe for a minute that the judges were seeking to gag Parliament in any sense. They were seeking to ensure that their position in relation to Parliament was understood.</p>

As for the terms of reference of the Joint Committee which is to be established, it has been indicated that the Justice Secretary and the Culture Secretary are to liaise with the chairs of the two committees in the other place. Obviously they will bear in mind the importance of this issue in Parliament, but it is also important to point out that the Government are already committed to bringing forward a draft Bill on parliamentary privilege. Given that, as I think my noble and learned friend indicated, there are issues that go much wider than these particular cases, this may well provide an opportunity for those important issues to be gone into in much greater detail-indeed, in the detail which they undoubtedly deserve.</p>

In recent years, one problem has been that a belief has got about that judges have a wide discretion on whether to grant a super-injunction. The report makes it absolutely clear, in paragraph 1.33, as recent cases had already made it clear, that there is no such discretion. The principle of open justice prevails unless it is absolutely and strictly necessary to depart from that principle in order to do justice in a particular case. That has long been the position and it is very good that it should have been reasserted in this Statement and report. They are obliged to act in accordance with the law as stated; they have no discretion.</p>

It is important, as the report indicates, that openness is a cornerstone of our democracy and with our judicial proceedings and system. If that is departed from, it can be only in the most exceptional circumstances. The report by the Master of the Rolls and his committee also raises some issues of how that commitment to openness might well be enhanced. Clearly, these matters will, in part, form the discussion of the Joint Committee that is to be set up.</p>

I think that the Minister will remember the debate. At this stage, I strongly support the Joint Committee but it is a mistake to think that the privacy issue is about just these sexual cases that come up. An awful lot of cases referred then, and do now, to ordinary folk who get caught up in tragic incidents in their lives. Often, it is a death in the family or things of that nature. That is one factor that privacy needs to address. It is not about just the big sexual cases that the press like to report for money; they also arise in those personal life tragedies. I am in favour of the courts deciding the balance between Articles 8 and 10 of the convention, but we will have to look at this in the wider context not just of sexual issues but of the invasion of privacy of people who have suffered tragedies.</p>

As I said earlier to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, these issues and the tensions between Articles 8 and 10 were considered at considerable length during the passage of the Human Rights Bill and express provision was made in Section 12 of that Act to give further guidance to the judiciary to establish that balance.</p>

Notwithstanding that, there are clearly some important principles enshrined in them. Indeed, on numerous occasions, even in recent times, we in this House have sought to emphasise their importance and how much we cherish them. In terms of the Joint Committee and in the opportunity to look much more broadly at parliamentary privilege, that will be an opportunity to consider in detail some of these issues. The Master of the Rolls' report published last week has a chapter devoted to parliamentary privilege and identifies some of the tensions that are there. All of those elected to the other House and Members of this House take parliamentary privilege very seriously, and if we wish to say anything on matters that are sub judice it should be done only with the greatest of forethought.</p>

Although our courts seek to influence courts in California to have disclosure of names by twitter, the culture in the United States is very different and it is very unlikely that there will be disclosure by courts there. In my experience, even getting them to disclose matters relating to national security issues is difficult enough. The American courts are very protective of freedom of the press.

It would be an issue that the Joint Committee would want to look at, because it is very pertinent to the kind of issues that we are talking about.

Surely if the Government propose to bring forward a Bill on parliamentary privilege, it is particularly important that this Joint Committee, which is examining such a closely related matter, should have an opportunity to consider that as well, and the Government should have an opportunity to hear the conclusions of that committee before it frames its proposed legislation.</p>

The terms of reference of the Joint Committee are not yet established, and it would be wrong of me to pre-empt that, but I will certainly draw to the attention of my right honourable friends the comments made in the Chamber today on the importance of parliamentary privilege as it pertains to this particular issue, and it may well be that in these circumstances the committee may want to reflect on that and have its own input into any future draft Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="11052325000090"></a>I echo the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, about the relevance of what is going on on the internet. Cyberspace, which is outside the jurisdiction, is very close to the jurisdiction and no citizens can gain access to it. It has a huge bearing on the law, bearing in mind that this has arisen in the past 20 or so years.</p>

That issue will have to be considered. Regarding the establishment of the committee, the indication was that the Justice Secretary and the Culture Secretary would be liaising with the chairs of the Liaison Committee and the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. As Minister of State at the Ministry of Justice, my noble friend Lord McNally, is present, and I am sure that that will ensure that the views of the terms of reference reflected in our exchanges here will be fed into that. I think that it was clear that the committee is intended to use the representation of both Houses and the expertise that exists in both Houses.</p>

That was partly because of my anxiety to be brief in this important debate. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Radice, on proposing this new clause in his amendment. It is very important. I detect already that it has gone down well in the new atmosphere of the House. Even if the Government persist with the Bill in most of its configuration, there is a spirit and desire also to promote our membership of the European Union. I hope so, anyway.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="11052325000097"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Radice, has a distinguished and noble Italian ancestry. As a keen linguist myself, I am prepared to forgive him; he told me once that he did not speak Italian. However, he is an internationalist in every other sense. I had the pleasure of preceding the noble Lord, Lord Radice-I hope he had pleasure in succeeding me-as chairman of the European Movement. I was chair in the first half of the 1990s; it was the noble Lord, Lord Radice, afterwards. Even then when we spoke about these matters we often lamented the extent to which Governments of all colours-the two main parties, anyway-did not defend and promote our membership of the European Community enough. We saw that only in the days of the Edward Heath Government. To her credit, it was also partly true in the period of the Thatcher Government, particularly with the creation of the single market, but by and large it was not.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="11052325000098"></a>I compared this to the previous Spanish general election-there is the possibility that another will come along soon. The two great parties in that country fought a tenacious and bitter political battle on all  


<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1644"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1644</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>aspects of Spanish domestic and internal policies, but not once did anybody invoke Europe as an anti-cause to win domestic votes. It is a pity that our internal politics has been bedevilled by that phenomenon, as well as by Governments not explaining a mechanism and structure that is in many ways more complicated than just a defence alliance such as NATO, although that is complicated enough. Not enough has been given over the years to doing that. We need to do that even more now because of the way in which various press organs in this country have denigrated Europe excessively.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="11052325000099"></a>Therefore, the words of the noble Lord, Lord Radice, should be heeded by the Government to promote a campaign. Indeed, they ought to promote a campaign to defend and explain Europe properly in the objective and neutral sense of the word. It can be done, even when there are referenda to be fought in the future. I hope there will be no referenda, but it is in those terms that one asks the Government to respond positively to this important amendment tonight.</p>

<p><a name="st_196"></a>
<a name="11052325000100"></a><b><a name="110523-0002.htm_spnew38"></a><a name="11052325000205"></a>Lord Triesman:</b> My Lords, I welcome this amendment from my noble friend Lord Radice, whose expertise on Europe is well known in the House. Several of the speeches that have been made by Members of the Committee have reflected their own extensive knowledge of Europe and their understandable disappointment that we have been so churlish in the way that we have talked about Europe and the European project over the years. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, I take the point that there are things to criticise. However, that is scarcely a reason for the trajectory on which we have embarked.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="11052325000101"></a>In addressing the amendment specifically, it is clear from the beginning of Clause 2 that a referendum would be launched following matters being laid before Parliament and fully debated, a decision being taken by Parliament and a treaty approved by an Act of Parliament. Clause 3 gives essentially the same sequence: Parliament takes a fundamental view, looks at it and decides that a referendum should be held because of the conditions to hold one as set out in the Act. Under Clause 6, a Minister of the Crown must start with a draft decision approved by an Act of Parliament. The referendum condition is then triggered. In all the circumstances under which a referendum condition is triggered-were one ever to be triggered-the reality is that Parliament will have reached a conclusion. Obviously, it will not have done so in secret. It will be a decision that is well known to the public as a whole. Parliament will have decided that the point at which a referendum is required has been reached.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="11052325000102"></a>In those circumstances it would be inconceivable that no argument would be advanced to the people who were going to vote in the referendum to account for the decisions that Parliament had taken. It would be an extraordinary set of circumstances in which that decision did not have the visible consent of the Government. If the Government had put a proposition of that kind to Parliament and it had been defeated, it would be a significant blow to any Government. It must be the case that the arguments that had been held in that forum-or forums, taking this House into account as well-would have come to a positive outcome.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="11052325000103"></a>I turn to Clause 13. The Electoral Commission.</p>
<ul><a name="11052325000135"></a>"must take whatever steps they think appropriate to promote public awareness of the referendum and how to vote in it".</ul>
<p><a name="11052325000104"></a>In other words, it must make sure that people know the referendum is taking place and what they need to do to take part in it. Curiously, under paragraph (b), the Electoral Commission,</p>
<ul><a name="11052325000136"></a>"may take whatever steps they think appropriate to promote public awareness of the subject-matter of the referendum".</ul>
<p><a name="11052325000105"></a>In short, it must make sure that everybody knows about the referendum but it may take steps to make sure that people know what the referendum is about. I make this point because if, in those circumstances, the Government or a Minister did not take steps to deal with the policy issues under discussion, it would be the most curious discussion that there had ever been before a referendum, especially if the Electoral Commission itself did not get into the theatre of argument about the subject matter. It seems to me that it is less likely to do that than the politicians who are involved in it.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="11052325000106"></a>There is, therefore, a huge amount of good common sense in the amendment of my noble friend Lord Radice. If you look at the specific text of the amendment, Ministers of the Crown are asked to,</p>
<ul><a name="11052325000137"></a>"have regard to the desirability".</ul>
<p><a name="11052325000107"></a>This is not a monumental hurdle to have to cross. Ministers are expected to put the argument in a way that at least conveys why Parliament has taken the decisions that it has taken, and to do so in a way that is positive. Does that disbar anybody from saying, "There are issues here. We can see the following negatives"? No, of course it does not. I have no doubt that in any referendum debate people will say what they think the downside of the argument is. However, the amendment would ensure that the upside of the argument is also presented, even in a climate where a large part of the media of this country may not be sympathetic. That is probably the only route to achieving any balance in the discussion that will take place in advance of a referendum. Therefore, I welcome this amendment. One can look back and see how it links with the other clauses, and particularly how it deals with the rather conditional "may take" provision in Clause 13. In my view it would ensure that the argument was well made.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="11052325000108"></a>Having made that rather narrow point about the purpose of this amendment and how it would operate against the background of a parliamentary decision, I assert that in a generally extremely sceptical climate it can do no harm whatever to argue the case for the benefits of the European Union in a positive way. No doubt some Members of your Lordships' House do not believe that there are any positive benefits, or that they are so marginal that they should not be referred to because it is a waste of breath. However, a good many more of us believe that there is a very good and strong case to be made in favour of the European Union, and that it is sensible that it is made, as this amendment would ensure.</p>

However, as the debate has gone on, I have begun to share the sentiment expressed by my noble friend Lady Williams that the situation is sad in a sense, although I suspect that I disagree somewhat with my noble friend on how the EU should develop in the 21st century and be made fit for purpose, where the great trends should go and how this country should reinforce them. Nevertheless, I agree with her that all the old polarities of debate have prevailed for far too long. Over the past decade or so, one has needed to see emerge a new and much more positive British presentation and role than we have seen. That is a matter of regret.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="11052325000110"></a>The Government have no difficulty in supporting the main sentiment behind this amendment. We are members of the European Union. If we are members of organisations such as the massive and amazing European Union, it would be absurd to do anything short of making the very creative best we could of that. Therefore, the noble Lord, Lord Radice, makes an important point about the need for the Government to be a more vocal and effective advocate of the European Union of which we are members, given the way that the world is shaping. This applies also to other great bodies in the world of which we are members. I am sure he will join me in saying that we need to do better than the efforts of previous Administrations in our approach to this vital task. Indeed, the noble Lord said as much. We should do so by explaining more clearly how good and positive EU membership is part of our overall adjustment to a totally changed world landscape in which major markets are growing up outside Europe and in which Europe and the European Union, including this nation, are going to have to compete with increasing vigour. We need to ensure that the European Union is understood to be, and is seen as, a force for good. We want people to understand that the European Union, and our membership of it, has been, and can be, a force for good. We need to improve the effectiveness-this is slightly off the brief-of the EU's own voice. Many of us feel that sometimes in recent years that voice has not been quite so effective and focused as it should have been. We seek to present positively to the British people the benefits of these activities and our membership of the Union. The coalition is doing that. Indeed, all Governments should do so as a matter of course into the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="11052325000111"></a>I argue that the spirit of reconnection behind this Bill-this is widening the debate somewhat-is part of the whole programme of bringing back the cause of the European Union to some degree of consensual popularity. The more we deny the dramatic fall-off in support for the European Union as a popular cause that is going on not only here but throughout Europe, the more difficulty we will have in reviving and promoting the right kind of Europe in the future. This Government's approach will carry more weight with the British people if it is not just Government but Parliament making the case. If this case is made because of our convictions rather than having to do so because legislation

Therefore, I agree with the sentiment that has been expressed and the impulse behind the amendment but I do not see that it would add anything specific to the clearly identified need for us to speak out for the European Union. Not just the coalition Government but all parties and all those who speak for the United Kingdom, and seek to protect our interests and promote our contribution to global stability and security, need to speak out very vigorously for the great organisations to which we belong and of which we are close members, and which successive Prime Ministers have said that we should be at the heart of-namely, the European Union, which is our region, where we reside. In particular, the Government need to demonstrate our commitment to the UK's continued membership and, of course, to the reform, evolution and development of the European Union itself to meet the great new challenges that lie ahead, many of which are completely new and to which none of us yet has neat and clear answers as to how we should adjust our dispositions, power, influence and policies.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="11052325000112"></a>Therefore, my short answer to the noble Lord's well intentioned endeavour to raise this issue is that I understand the sentiments behind the amendment but we do not need a statutory requirement in a Bill to make the point he is trying to make. For those reasons, I ask him, in, I hope, a good spirit, not to press the amendment.</p>

That is quite the wrong spirit in which to negotiate with friends and partners to defend the national interest and to achieve successful outcomes from difficult and complex negotiations. What do the Government propose to do to try to persuade our European partners that, despite the evidence of this Bill, the British Government are positively committed to making a great success of our membership of the EU, and to continuing to build up and strengthen the institutions of the Union?</p>

He has certainly made a very lively contribution to previous debates and we missed him earlier this evening. However, his premise is wrong. We have clear indications that there are no difficulties. Jean-Claude Piris, the former head of the Council's legal service in Brussels, has commented that he sees no difficulties with Clause 18, and that he also has no difficulties with the thrust of the Bill. We have checked with people around the European Union and we are not getting the picture that the noble Lord talks about. Of course, it depends who you talk to. If you find people who support your views, that will reinforce your argument as you can then say, "These people support my views". However, I assure the noble Lord that throughout Europe there is a real desire on the part of different countries, with their different models and different ways, to seek to enhance the transparency, accountability and public support for the European Union, and to do it in ways not

It does not need to draw new powers from the nation states through treaty changes, competence transfers or power transfers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="11052325000115"></a>All around Europe there is a strong sentiment in that direction. It is a pro-European sentiment and I do not think that it does at all what the noble Lord says. On the contrary, this spirit shows that we are trying to make the architecture-I hope an enduring architecture; and we will debate that later-for a more democratically based Europe that is soundly build on a popular consensus, instead of one that is regarded with hostility and suspicion.</p>

We have heard a lot of views, some of which have been predictable, and others that have perhaps been less so. I should like to take up two or three points before I conclude.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="11052325000117"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, said that he hoped that I was not arguing for propaganda. Of course I am not. I am arguing for the facts, and that requires a balance. Of course there is a cost in our membership but, as the Commercial Secretary to the Treasury said, the cost is considerably outweighed by the benefits. I should like that to be argued out, and to that extent I support the case for costs and benefits to be set out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="11052325000118"></a>At the moment, the debate is unbalanced because there is no strong pro-European voice, and we need to restore that balance because it is not being heard. That is why, when moving the amendment, I put the accent on the positive. We were told by members of UKIP that the Government have no place in this argument. Of course the Government have a place in the argument. They are our Government. We are members of the European Union and we have been members for nearly 40 years. As the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said, it is up to members of the Government to put the case-and it is entirely right that they should do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="11052325000119"></a>I thank my noble friend Lord Triesman for making an even better case for my amendment than the case I made. He made a subtle and excellent case. I accept that this may be an obligation that should not be in statute but, frankly, I would not have put my case in the way that I did if I had not felt that we in this country faced a serious problem, whereby we are a member of a great Union that neither we nor our Government argue for.

He gave by far the best description of what Governments should be doing to advocate our membership of the European Union. I was grateful for that. I am afraid that he slightly spoilt the record by selectively reading from the opinion of Monsieur Jean-Claude Piris, the former legal adviser to the Council, who stated, in that wonderfully oblique way that fine legal minds have when expressing themselves, that if the British Government consistently blocked decisions that required unanimity simply because they were trying to avoid a referendum at home, they could well find themselves both marginalised and accused of bad faith, because they have ratified those provisions in the treaty of Lisbon. However, that is a small point to make in comparison with my welcome for what the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said in his reply to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Radice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="11052333000002"></a>Clause 18 is important. We have left our rather odd scenes from earlier in the day when we discussed the issues raised by the noble Lords, Lord Willoughby de Broke and Lord Pearson of Rannoch, which made me think that I had walked into a meeting of the Flat Earth Society on the day it was told that it had been discovered that the earth was round. The problem with Clause 18 is that it is, first, purely declaratory. It apparently has no legislative purpose, which is considered  


<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1650"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1650</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to be not a good way to legislate. Secondly, the clause is a bit obscure, and that is highly undesirable. Thirdly, because it is obscure, it contains certain risks whereby it may be misrepresented, become the object of judicial review, or risk other issues of that kind. To my mind, and for those who have put their names to the amendment, that is an unsatisfactory basis for legislation.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="11052333000003"></a>I should say straightaway that I would strongly support those who may wish to oppose the Question that Clause 18 stand part. It is a completely unnecessary part of the legislation. It does not have much to do with what the rest of the Bill is saying. I should also say that if I had to make a personal choice among the amendments that have been tabled on this clause, I would unhesitatingly choose the admirable amendment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, and my noble friend Lord Kerr. I shall certainly support it at every stage of the Bill.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="11052333000004"></a>However, my amendment is designed to make the best of a bad job. If the Government are absolutely insistent on the text they have tabled, it is necessary to make the Bill at least a bit less obscure and open to challenge, distortion or misrepresentation-and my amendment attempts to do that. I claim no pride of ownership for it, because every word was drafted by my former colleagues in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Why do I say that? It is because the amendment is drawn explicitly and precisely from the Explanatory Notes that were circulated by the FCO when the Bill was first published many months ago. There is no innovation in it. Not a word is removed from the Government's text. There are merely two statements about the primacy of European law clarifying the situation, which, I suggest, ought to be in the Bill if the Government were to insist on their text-which I hope that they will not, in the face of the amendment moved by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, and those who are opposed to the clause standing part. I hope that they will agree that the clause would be greatly improved by adding the Explanatory Notes provided by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which are extremely limpid and clear, to the Bill. On that basis, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="11052333000006"></a>We have had an excellent introduction to the amendment from the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, and I am very grateful to him for that. My view is that Clause 18 is unnecessarily vague when it talks about "an Act of Parliament". It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="11052333000119"></a>"It is only by virtue of an Act of Parliament that"-</p>

<p><a name="11052333000098"></a>and so on. The Act of Parliament that does that is the European Communities Act 1972 and its amendments, all properly described in a Bill of this kind as the European Communities Act 1972. Our amendment substitutes that absolutely clear and positive statement for the rather vague statement in the Bill. I cannot understand the advantage of vagueness in this context, when precision is possible without any difficulty.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1651"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1651</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110523-0002.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="11052333000007"></a>Secondly, I do not regard this as of no value. There is a view in some quarters that when you join the European Union treaty, the legal order of the Union has the effect of making directly effective Union laws in all member states. We in this country have taken the view that it is the Act of Parliament, not the European Union order itself, that gives the Union legislators, particularly in relation to directly effective law, authority in our country. Parliament gave that authority and, as long as Parliament continues to give that authority, that is the basis on which the law is applicable in our country. There is no threat in this to the sovereignty of Parliament, as is sometimes suggested. Parliament, the sovereign Parliament, introduced that Act, and the sovereign Parliament is keeping the Act in position. That is a perfect authority for the legislation from Europe to be given its effect according to European law in this country.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="11052333000008"></a>The alternative view that the Union by itself has a legal order which effectively reaches down into the legal systems of member states without further legislation in the member states is, possibly, not all that different in effect from our view, except that I think that theoretically we have the right position here, and I would like to adhere to that.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="11052333000009"></a>The difference, although it is a rather narrow one, can have an effect, particularly in relation to the clauses which are called passerelle causes in the Lisbon treaty, where some extension of a European treaty is brought into being by the operation of those provisions. There was a debate in this House some time ago about those in relation to the ratification of the Lisbon treaty. My personal view is that in that situation, the ultimate decision would rest with the courts of this country on whether a particular treaty was binding here. The other point of view would say that the ultimate decision rests with the European Court of Justice. Therefore, Clause 18, stating our position as the basis of the constitutional arrangements for European legislation to be effective here, has importance. I would certainly not like to see it dropped, as long as it is clarified in the way that our amendment suggests.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="11052333000010"></a>My noble friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill, who is unable to be here tonight because of a long-standing appointment to which he was committed, was kind enough to say, having heard in advance what I was going to say, that he agreed with it. He also wanted to make the point that there was some discussion on the original Explanatory Notes about the basis on which parliamentary sovereignty has been established in this country. He wanted to say as an addition, slightly aside from the substance of the matter, but still with reference to the Explanatory Notes, that the authority for the sovereignty of Parliament in our country is the decisions of the courts, who recognise that authority. There is no possible question about that. I do not see how Parliament itself can establish its own supremacy without it being recognised by the courts of law. That is where the doctrine came from. That is the additional point that my noble friend Lord Lester would have made if he were here, and I am trying to make it for him.</p>

That approach has been confirmed in at least two judgments in the courts, as well as in our general practice and how we describe the question of the status of EU law. Why is it here? I understand that clearly. There has been considerable discussion about parliamentary sovereignty, so I understand why the Government have proposed this. Discussion in the House of Commons confirmed that concerns over those issues and whether that should be covered in statute remain. The Government have put it into statute. That does not change the substance, but it must change something, because it is here for the first time in statute; whereas before it was the practice of the courts based on the European Communities Act 1972. That is how it worked. I fully understand all that.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="11052333000012"></a>Here we have two amendments. One would leave the text exactly as it is but add something which comes from the Explanatory Note. That point could be looked at carefully, but it does not change Clause 18 as presented by the Government. It is not being changed; something is being added to it. The other amendment, in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, changes to a modest degree the text which has been put on the table. It changes it by making explicit that it is by virtue of the European Communities Act 1972 that we have recognition of availability in law of EU legislation. It is explicit on that point. It avoids the initial phrase in the Bill, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="11052333000120"></a>"It is only by virtue of an Act of Parliament".</p>

<p><a name="11052333000099"></a>It is a clarification of that point. However, it does not change the basic structure of the way in which we deal with Community legislation. We deal with it by the authority of an Act of Parliament. That is how we operate and it is absolutely imperative to stick to that. It is how we have operated ever since we have been in the European Community-or, now, the European Union-and recognition of that in statute is perfectly reasonable. There are two amendments but, in particular, we have to decide whether the wording of Amendment 59, which makes the situation explicit with the words:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="11052333000121"></a>"By virtue of the European Communities Act",</p>

<p><a name="11052333000100"></a>and does not include the specific phrase:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="11052333000122"></a>"It is only by virtue of an Act of Parliament",</p>

<p><a name="11052333000101"></a>is clearer and more likely to avoid misinterpretation. I tend to favour Amendment 59 for that reason.</p>

Quite recently I received in an e-mail, in the magic way that one does, a photograph of our eldest daughter holding in her arms her grandchild. That means that the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, and I have simultaneously become great-grandparents, and it is with that sort of sense that I now look back on this section of the European Communities Act 1972.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="11052333000014"></a>The remarkable thing is that from the outset it was understood that joining the European Community, as it then was, involved the arrival of a situation in which Community law was to be directly applied in this country. My noble friend Lord Howell knows that as clearly as I do because, as I have said before, we published a magnificent article written by Dennis  


<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1653"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1653</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Thompson entitled <I>The Rome Treaty and the Law</I> long before we were in a position to introduce legislation. The striking thing about that article was the same striking thing that we are discussing now-namely, the direct application in this country of existing law and law yet to be made in the European Community. For a more respectable origin than that, I go back to the White Paper produced by the Wilson Government in 1967 before we succeeded in getting membership of the Community. The White Paper says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="11052333000123"></a>"'If this country became a member of the European Communities it would be accepting Community law. By 'Community law' is meant the whole body of legal rights and obligations deriving from the Treaties or their instruments'".</p>

<p><a name="11052333000102"></a>I am quoting from <I>Hansard</I> of 1972. I interposed, "So far, so good", and then continued,</p>
<ul><a name="11052333000133"></a>"it would be necessary to pass legislation giving the force of law to those provisions of the Treaties and Community instruments which are intended to take direct internal effect within the Member States".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/2/72; cols. 650-51.]</ul>
<p><a name="11052333000103"></a>That was foreshadowed in 1967.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="11052333000015"></a>Perhaps the most striking phrase in Section 2(1) of the 1972 Act is "without further enactment". Therefore, the legislation that we were passing meant that laws made within the Community structure took direct application here as a result. There was, admittedly, some variation in that because that is how regulations took effect, whereas directives needed to be converted into English law, as they did not have direct application.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="11052333000016"></a>Therefore, there is no surprise about this provision. The only surprise that I have had has been the emergence of Clause 2 of the Bill. Speculation was rife throughout the country when we were preparing the Bill that became the European Communities Act about whether it was going to be a one-clause Bill, a 10-clause Bill, a 100-clause Bill or a 1,000-clause Bill. There was tremendous speculation along all those lines. In fact, this central provision was absolutely fundamental. It has been fundamental from the outset and has been part of our membership of the European Community. It is not a burden upon us; it is beneficial to us but within the framework of the European Union. To take the most obvious example, how would we have been able to ensure that the French withdrew their ban on BSE-tainted beef? The legislation that we were entitled to invoke to make that happen was legislation of this kind, particularly in France. It has always been fundamental and I really cannot see how one can question its importance and value. The question is how it is best expressed now in the light of the Bill before us.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="11052333000017"></a>On the whole, I support the proposal made by my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay because it recites the foundation and makes it clear that we are merely endorsing for the sake of the future that which we can rehearse from the past. I do not think that there is much more to say than that. The important illustration is the way in which it comes into our jurisdiction in certain cases. I may have recited this before but it shows the effect. In the Spanish shipping case, when we were challenged in the European Court of Justice for having legislation that infringed Community law, the court gave judgments to that effect. We therefore  


<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1654"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1654</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>had to change our primary legislation-indeed, we had to repeal clauses of it-and we did so by invoking the next clause of the 1972 Act. A statutory instrument was affirmed by both Houses of Parliament and was then presented to Her Majesty to be given final legitimacy and to have the effect that it had. As it happened, that was the first instrument that I had to present to Her Majesty at my first attendance as Lord President of the Council. It was rather striking to read out the title of a statutory instrument, passed by Parliament in order to carry into law in this country the decision of the European Court of Justice. That happened because, when I read out the instrument, Her Majesty said, "Approved". That was a remarkable legislative sequence. It provoked me to give a lecture to the London School of Economics analysing its impact. Who was exercising whose sovereignty? The sovereign was exercising the last step in carrying into effect Section 2 of the 1972 Act. That is the best way of maintaining what is necessary for the effective operation of our membership of the European Union, as it now is.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="11052333000018"></a>I could not quite work out, any more than anyone else could, the purpose of Clause 18, as it contains certain ambiguities, whereas the provision that I now support-namely, the one proposed by my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay-makes the position absolutely clear. It merely reaffirms that my great-grandchild is still alive, covering a rather larger section of Europe, and it is very important for us to recognise that.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="11052333000019"></a>I add one thought on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Radice. It is important to understand why we subject ourselves to legislation of this kind. It is part of the entire coherence of the European Union within which we can best exploit Britain's national interests in the world. Britain alone has very little influence and, as we shrink our defence forces because we cannot afford them and as we question our ability to sustain the generosity of our present overseas development assistance, it is all the more important for us to be able to spread our influence and achieve our objectives in partnership with our European partners.</p>

<p><a name="11052333000104"></a>For Britain today, the place whereon we cannot stand is on our own. I know that my noble friend Lord Howell would never forgive me if I did not mention the Commonwealth as well. In a different way, it is an extremely important framework within which we can extend and assert our influence. It gives us communication to a tremendous range of countries around the world, but the European Union is the one which is closest to us in a large range of interests.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="11052333000021"></a>I find myself saying with recurrent regret what a tragedy it was that the European Union did not reach a concerted view on the wisdom and sense of the war in Iraq. Unfortunately, our own Prime Minister had acquired an obsession in that direction. I think that he got carried away by the excitement of receiving standing ovations in the United States Congress. That was one of the causes of the tragedy. If only the European Union had been able to unite with a concerted view, we could have saved ourselves that mistaken war.

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="11052333000025"></a>My preference is for there to be no Clause 18. However, I strongly agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, that the vagueness of the version of Clause 18 which is in the Bill is undesirable and, I would say, dangerous. I argued on Second Reading that it was potentially sinister. I hope that I was wrong about that but I have not yet heard an answer to it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="11052333000026"></a>The Explanatory Notes are not much help. They attracted the particular ire of Jean-Claude Piris, the then head of the Council Legal Service, in the memorandum from which the Minister made a perhaps selective quotation from. Piris said that the intention behind paragraph 104 of our Explanatory Notes "is not crystal clear", which is a very elegant way of putting it. The Explanatory Notes say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="11052333000124"></a>"The words 'by virtue of an Act of Parliament'"-</p>

<p><a name="11052333000107"></a>not the 1972 Act-</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="11052333000027"></a>I do not understand that. That all derives from the 1972 Act, which is all you need to cite. Because of the 1972 Act directly applicable law applies in this country. It applies even in areas where the authority has been devolved. The 1972 Act is still the fundamental basis  


<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1656"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1656</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for all this. If we have to have a Clause 18, it should refer clearly and precisely to the 1972 Act. I thought it potentially sinister because the loose phrase "an Act" could be construed as referring to future as well as past Acts. The reference to the 1972 Act is only implicit and not explicit as the clause stands.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="11052333000028"></a>On Second Reading I wondered whether it was some kind of a dog-whistle or signal to those who would like us to be able pick and choose, to apply or disapply particular pieces of EU law depending on whether we like them. Of course, the Government know that that is not possible. Their notes say that nothing affects the primacy of EU law. The addition to the text suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, would say that explicitly in the Act. Why go for such vague wording? Why have something that is open to the interpretation that it might cover future Acts? I withdraw the word "sinister" as that goes too far, but I will settle for the words of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay-"unnecessarily vague", and add unnecessary. I believe that Clause 18 is unnecessary and unnecessarily and dangerously vague.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="11052333000030"></a>I draw the Minister's attention to what that report says in paragraph 76, as it might help him. The committee states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="11052333000125"></a>"We think it right that, should an Act of Parliament instruct the courts to disapply an aspect of European Union law, the courts should do so: this is not only consistent with the case law of the courts, but also with the doctrine of the legislative supremacy of Parliament; and also with the rule of law.</p>

<p><a name="11052333000108"></a>As I said on Second Reading:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="11052333000126"></a>"Encouragingly, the committee goes on to conclude that it is entirely within bounds for Parliament to ask judges to disapply any aspect of European Union law if that is the will of a democratically elected Parliament, even if-this is important-that were to lead to infringement proceedings in the EU Court of Justice".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/3/11; Col. 699.]</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="11052333000031"></a>There seems to be a divergence of opinion. Who is right-those who say EU law is supreme and should be within the Bill as the amendments suggest; or is the Commons European Union Scrutiny Committee right? It presumably has had legal advisers to instruct them as well. I suppose that we ought to take account of the fact that the French Government threw out the Romany Gypsies, which must have been contrary to EU law. However, as far as I know, no infringement proceedings were taken. Even now, the French and Danes are ignoring the provisions of the Schengen agreement, which they signed, and are putting in place border posts. As is well known, the French stopped a train from Italy that contained Tunisian emigrants who were given some sort of EU passe-partout and were supposed to be allowed into France. The French police stopped the train and would not let them in. Denmark has reinstated full border controls to stop immigration. Therefore, the argument about the complete supremacy of EU law does not any longer hold. I will be interested to hear what the noble Lord or his advisers say about this in response to the amendments.</p>

I shall take the matter away and look at what they said, because it seems to me-as it seemed when I tabled the amendment-that the clause is, as has been said, not just unnecessarily vague but unnecessary. As has also been said, it is declaratory in effect. However, the legal position is perfectly clear from Section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972. Like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, I remember vividly the discussions that led up to that section. It has been buttressed by opinions in the Court of Appeal, if not in the Supreme Court-or House of Lords as it was-and I have not been convinced that we need Clause 18 in the Bill. I share the views of the noble Lord, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, about the undesirability of declaratory provisions that do not change anything. Therefore, I have not yet been convinced that the law is uncertain or not absolutely clear already in this matter and needs to be reinforced or redeclared by the clause.</p>

I ought to have been more courteous in my portrayal of our partnership in a form that he would prefer to support. The reason that I was impelled in the Scottish direction was in order to underline the importance of the 1972 Act. The noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, is right to argue that we do not need the clause. However, it can do no harm to have the overriding importance of the 1972 Act being manifest, and to remove the ambiguity of the original Clause 18 and move beyond the removal of the offending clause to underline the proposition and lay it further beyond doubt. That is why I am inclined to prefer to move in that direction. However, I do so with apologies to my erstwhile partner.</p>

I completely agree with the noble Lords, Lord Armstrong and Lord Kerr, and with my noble and learned friend Lord Howe that the clause is probably redundant, not only because it is declaratory but because it does do what it sets out to do. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, that if one reads carefully the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee report, one

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="11052333000127"></a>"Clause 18 does not address the competing primacies of EU and national law ... evidence suggests that clause 18 is not needed ... if the legislative supremacy of Parliament is under threat, it is from judicial opinions in other areas of law ... Clause 18 is not a sovereignty clause in the manner claimed by the Government, and the whole premise on which it is included in the Bill is, in our view, exaggerated".</p>

<p><a name="11052333000109"></a>That is the view of the European Scrutiny Committee.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="11052333000037"></a>In case the Minister convinces the House that the clause has merits that are not instantly evident to most of us, I will say a word or two about Amendment 59. We have spent hours and days in Committee trying to gain clarity where there was ambiguity in the Bill, and a level of certainty where there was obfuscation. Therefore, it is odd to see that Clause 18 is as ambiguous as it is. I have a great deal of sympathy with my noble and learned friend, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, and my noble friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill, whose amendment seeks to replace an Act of Parliament with the European Communities Act 1972. This would be a welcome move.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="11052333000038"></a>As regards Amendment 57, I suggest that the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, looks at paragraph 61 of the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee's report, in which Professor Tomkins says that it does not deal with the primacy issue, but only with the source issue, which is not really a question of sovereignty. On careful reading, the report leaves one almost as confused as when one started, because it seems to say everything to everybody, and seems to want to placate several constituencies in one go. It is also clear when one reads the evidence in the Notes that different legal experts offered different ideological interpretations of the Bill. Therefore, I would not die in the last ditch to defend the report. However, it is interesting that it is fairly clear that the sovereignty issue is not addressed by the Bill.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="11052333000039"></a>In conclusion, I find it rather peculiar that paragraph 115 of the Explanatory Notes states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="11052333000128"></a>"This clause has been included in the Bill to address concerns that the doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty may in the future be eroded by decisions of the courts".</p>

<p><a name="11052333000110"></a>This is slightly curious. Perhaps the Minister will give us clarification.</p>

It is not in this group, but it is very much part of the balancing act with Clause 18. My purpose in tabling Amendment 58 is to persuade the Government that it would be helpful to have a clause to balance Clause 18. Both the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, and I would be happier if Clause 18 was not there, so that there would be no need for what one might call a balancing affirmation. However, I suspect that if we wind up with Clause 18, the majority of the House would be happy to have it along with a balancing affirmation. I am not going back into the theology of declaratory clauses, although in different ways, I half infer from a range of speeches, including, to some extent, that of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, that declaratory clauses are not without value if there is a balance.</p>

<p><a name="11052333000111"></a>I hope the Government will not look askance at the idea that I am trying to do them a favour. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, is an honourable man, and I hope I am, and I think this would be helpful. It would avoid the impression that this Bill is simply about giving credence to the idea that everything that comes from Brussels is horrible and that we have to watch like a hawk and have referendums in various places. This is the tone of the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, made an excellent statement-I am reflecting what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, and others-but it is hardly the picture that is coming across of the role of the European Union in this Bill.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="11052333000041"></a>I have taken the liberty of writing out the major pieces of legislation that constitute the framework of where we are in Europe. It is quite significant. I have not even put in all the jargon of the acronyms-TEU and so on. We have the European Communities Act 1972, the amending treaties and the Single European Act 1987. We all remember that these were not little jigsaw pieces. We have the Maastricht treaty of 1992, the Amsterdam treaty of 1997, the Nice treaty of 2001 and the treaty of Lisbon of 2007, which were concluded in the context of the European Union having a dynamic of development with new EU competences side by side with the successive enlargements of the European Union and new competences in fields agreed to be necessary for Europeans to act together. If we are in the business of declaratory clauses, I think that would be a good one and might reflect the views of the majority of the Committee if Clause 18 remains in the Bill. It needs balance.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="11052333000042"></a>The only other point I shall make is that we have here an affirmation of what the Government claim to be their position. The Minister says that this is the Government's position and that far from trying to introduce an opt-out from Lisbon via the back door of referendums and so on, they accept responsibilities from the framework of all the signatory nations in implementing this framework and that they will look pragmatically at any new proposals under these treaties in the usual way through the Council, the Parliament and the Commission.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="11052333000043"></a>I am leaning over backwards. I hope it is not a posture that looks too ridiculous, but if you are going to have Clause 18, a balancing affirmation like this would be very desirable.</p>

The speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Howell, at the end of the previous group emphasised the same point, so to that extent one is very grateful indeed. Coming back to the previous discussion on Amendments 57 and 59, like the noble Lord, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, I was not quite sure whether the description should veer between vague and unnecessary or go back to sinister. If we listen to the words of the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, one might say that it should go back to being sinister, but I am glad to suggest to the Committee-I hope I am not being discourteous-that that is still a minority view of the worth of this country's membership of the European Union. I always listen with great respect to the things that he espouses when he makes his arguments, even if I do not agree. At the moment, we are still with vague and unnecessary, and that is the crux of the problem. I express enormous appreciation for the very wise words of my noble and learned friends Lord Howe and Lord Mackay of Clashfern.</p>

As Solicitor-General, he had the opportunity to re-educate Harold Wilson about the realities of the 1972 Act in general and, specifically, about Section 2, which he did with great skill, I believe. It came back to the reality, as George Brown reminded us continually before and after these events, that he could never quite persuade Harold Wilson to be a really genuinely deep, good European, as he was. It was the best they could do in the circumstances, and the rest of it flowed from that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="11052333000049"></a>The report by the Constitution Committee of the House of Lords, which was published in March, has been much quoted in these debates. It referred to these matters, as my noble friend Lady Falkner said today. The scrutiny committee's report and this report are very relevant in this context. The very specific amendment tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, would remove the original text of Clause 18 and insert a new clause that would reassure us and dispel the doubts that might arise, such as the one to which paragraph 59 on page 16 of the Lords Constitution Committee report refers when it talks about this particular dilemma:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="11052333000129"></a>"An argument raised in evidence to the European Scrutiny Committee is that, by seeking to shield the principle of parliamentary sovereignty only in the context of EU law, clause 18 may inadvertently invite questions in the courts about why Parliament did not take the opportunity to seek to reinforce its sovereignty more generally".</p>

<p><a name="11052333000112"></a>Paragraph 60 of that report concludes in dark print:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="11052333000130"></a>"We are confident that if parliamentary sovereignty were to be questioned in any other context, the existence of clause 18 would not prevent the courts from upholding the well understood and orthodox position".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="11052333000050"></a>One may relate that directly to paragraph 118 on page 27 of the Explanatory Memorandum and the Government's absolute reiteration of the fundamental principle in that lengthy text on Clause 18, which, they say,</p>
<ul><a name="11052333000138"></a>"does not alter the existing relationship between EU law and UK domestic law; in particular, the principle of the primacy of EU

The principle of the primacy of EU law was established in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice before the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities".</ul>
<p><a name="11052333000113"></a>They then mention the cases that were referred to the ECJ that bore that out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="11052333000051"></a>Amendment 57 is in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and in the names of two other noble Lords, one of whom is unwell tonight and cannot be present-the noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, who has given his apologies, I believe. The great beauty of Amendment 57 is that it relates back very neatly to the very text of paragraph 118, which I have just quoted, and to the actual words of the insertion suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, on page 12, line 9, at the end of Clause 18, for which we thank him. The Government's magisterial decision will therefore surely be to accept the amendment in the name of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, with its much more precise and unshakeable reference to the 1972 Act and his inserted words that underline the fact that EU law has primacy and that would therefore dispel the doubts and restore the Government's authority on European Union matters.</p>

Like the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, I cannot claim to have any legal background in these matters. I do know, however, that during the whole of my political life, which has been a very long one, I and everyone else understands that the British constitution is based on the proposition, and indeed the law, that one Parliament cannot bind its successor. That you must hold to. It is indivisible, and once you start qualifying it you undermine the whole concept. That is why I oppose all the amendments and Clause 18, because they all seek to qualify that absolute part of our constitution.</p>

It is absolutely true that things can be sorted out by repealing the 1972 Act. The only problem so often is that people go on to say that that is inconceivable, but it is not. There are circumstances in which this country may wish, and indeed may have the duty, to withdraw from the Community. I know that that sounds as though it is out in the clouds. Nevertheless, there are circumstances in which it would be desirable, and perhaps essential, not to be bound by the European Communities Act, and it can be repealed. That is the essence that we have to stick to: the fact that that Act is simply an Act of Parliament that can be repealed by any Parliament in the future or in the present.

<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1662"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1662</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>having heard the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, who clearly believes that what would be declared would not be right. Therefore, declaring it is not merely otiose. In the present world, it is occasionally valuable to make a statement which may for some be a statement of the obvious but clearly for some it is not. Therefore, I am happy for there to be a declaration.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="11052333000055"></a>My problem is not about the need for a declaration but in the wording of Clause 18. That problem arises from two directions. First, I do not believe that it is safe to have anything which is in the slightest bit ambiguous. That is not because I have the same suspicion that the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, has of the Government's intentions. I have been reassured on that by my noble friend the Minister. It is simply because there are people in this country who will do anything possible to try to drive in wedges where there is really no hole to drive them. Therefore, one should just make sure that one does not provide a means for their so driving. Let us be careful about ambiguity.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="11052333000056"></a>Secondly, I wish that we would talk about these things while remembering the other countries in the European Union. There is a tendency to feel that somehow it would be perfectly all right for Britain to decide that it liked "this" Act but not "that" one. But the moment that the French, the Spanish, the Portuguese or the Slovenians do that, we get on our high horse immediately. That interesting daily newspaper, the <I>Daily Mail</I>, spends most of its time doing precisely that and saying that someone is being absolutely unacceptable because they are not agreeing, supporting or doing what they should under the European Union. But the moment it is convenient to complain about Britain, somehow Britain is in a different category. I do not think it harms us to be reminded of the enormous value that we have in the fact that all members of the European Union are bound by the European treaties.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="11052333000057"></a>Earlier, a noble Lord mentioned BSE. I do not think that anyone has had more experience of BSE than me or that anyone has been more photographed as regards BSE. I say to your Lordships' House that the ability to insist that countries could not use excuses for restraining trade was a crucial part of this country's defence against what turned out to be a situation which could have damaged us in an unfair and unreasonable way. That is only one example but there are dozens. Anyone with any ministerial experience knows that, within the context of the European Union, issues are pressed one way or another: Denmark may make a statement about something and the French may be difficult about something else. We are very difficult about a lot of things, which is part of the give and take of a community in which we are all members and partners. It is the same give and take that you have in any Cabinet. Sometimes there is more take than give, which has been our experience of Britain's attitude to the European Union in my view. We have often failed to give enough and, therefore, we have found ourselves looking as though we are more concerned with the take.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="11052333000058"></a>I have a considerable desire to remind the House of the advantages of this clause, as amended by the amendment of my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay, and supported by my noble and learned  


<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1663"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1663</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>friend Lord Howe of Aberavon. Clarity is a valuable addition to what is not an unnecessary clause but something which would be well worth having.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="11052333000059"></a>I end by making one comment which should be mentioned in this debate. One of the problems with our system-I support the system enormously-is that we produce legislation in our Houses of Parliament to carry into law the decisions that are made by us all around the table in the European Union. I make that point because it is not Brussels which makes those decisions. We make them with others in Brussels of our own volition. Then we carry it into law. The real concern is that, unlike many other European countries, we have a wonderful opportunity to make the whole thing more complicated. We can add this and that. "Better not leave that out", and, "Have they thought about this possibility?", says the civil servant. When you look to see where the gold-plating comes from, you can see that it comes from our system. I am in favour of us doing this, but I would not like to have spoken to this amendment without reminding the Committee that every time we do it, we ought to be careful. Perhaps we would do better to keep to the simplicity of much of European law rather than elaborate it for the benefit of the curious mind of the bureaucracy of Britain.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="11052333000060"></a>I hope that the Government will find it possible to accept the amendment. It cannot mean anything different from what they intend to mean in their Clause 18. However, if Clause 18 does mean something different, the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, is right to be suspicious. If it means the same, surely it would be better to take the wise advice of noble Lords who are learned in the law and accept that the formulation put forward by my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay, my noble friend Lord Lester and the noble Lords, Lord Kerr and Lord Dubs, is a better way of achieving something that I believe is worthwhile.</p>

The only point on which I do not quite agree with the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, is that I think that Clause 18 as it stands is better than nothing, and no doubt especially once the Minister has explained it in a few minutes' time.

Will he confirm that if Parliament-your Lordships' House and the House of Commons-repeals the original 1972 Act, particularly Section 2 with which I include all the amendments that have been added, those arising from the Single European Act 1986, Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice and so on, are we then in effect out of the European Union? Will we no longer be subject to the diktats of Brussels and the jurisdiction of the Luxembourg court? Of course I understand that a lot of British law did come from Brussels and is sewn into our own law. I

However, I would be grateful if the Minister would confirm that Clause 18 means that it is only if we repeal the 1972 Act that European law would no longer take precedence over the law of this country, and that that can be reversed by repealing the Act?</p>

It is not the best drafted clause I have ever read in legislation, and I understand why-or at least I think I understand why, which I will come to in a moment. But it is also true to say that the Explanatory Notes to the Bill do the clause no favours. They do not set out why it is compelling or why any of us who think that it is obscurely drafted should feel that we can put our hand on our heart and say that we know exactly why it is written as it is. I certainly do not feel that way. I am not a lawyer. I am not learned in the law, which is the expression that has gone around the Chamber. I am a humble mathematician and I am trying hard to understand the considerable obscurities of law when compared with mathematics.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="11052333000064"></a>It is important to ask, as did the noble Lord, Lord Deben, only a short while ago, what the clause as it is written is for-I shall come on to the alternatives in a moment. Everybody agrees that it is declaratory in its reference to the 1972 Act. It looks as though it is attempting to balance a number of arguments which plainly have gone on in the background between those who are uncomfortable with the idea that Europe has any bearing on the way we conduct our legal lives, and may continue to do so, and those who recognise that that is a fixed reality because of the processes that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, described in a very helpful speech. It is hard to understand the necessity of Clause 18 and it is reasonable to say that, as drafted, it is open to very wide interpretation. As a couple of noble Lords have said, that would probably make it open to judicial review.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="11052333000065"></a>I find myself in strong agreement-I hope that it will do her no harm-with the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, who said that the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee's report gave not the most glowing reference which anybody has written to a piece of legislation. The report is written with the niceness that parliamentarians occasionally reserve for a description of something they think is very poor, but, none the less, it says, in terms pretty much, that it is very poor. The Government in their response almost give up the ghost after a very short period of trying to defend it, because there is no certainty, I think, even on their part, that this was the right way to do it.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="11052333000066"></a>I cannot see the point of the clause or that it is at all helpful. I have real sympathy with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, that parliaments cannot bind their successors. That view at least, about the character of parliamentary Government, must be common ground among us. In those circumstances, it must be common ground that Parliament is supreme, and it must be common ground that, should Parliament wish to stand down the 1972 Act, it would be within its competence to do so. It is extremely unlikely that it would, but that is neither here nor there in the terms in which the noble Lord put that proposition to the  


<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1665"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1665</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Committee. The supremacy argument is very powerful. One of the reasons that I have great difficulty with much of this legislation is that it seems to reduce the role of Parliament and the supremacy that it should enjoy. The points that have been made ad nauseam in your Lordships' House about multiple referenda do nothing for the objective of propping up the supremacy of Parliament, but the general proposition made by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, must be right.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="11052333000067"></a>If the Government feel that it is essential to have in place a clause that is declaratory, it might as well have the following characteristics. First, it should be so clear that even those of us who are not learned in the law understand it. Secondly, it should be sufficiently clear that it does not give rise to frequent legal challenge. Thirdly, it should make reference to-if I may put it this way-the core code that is involved in European legislation and not gloss over that. For those reasons, Amendment 57 offers greater clarification. It may well have been written with people who are used to dealing with sovereignty issues somewhere in the background, but it is none the less a straightforward clarification. Beyond that, Amendment 59 does that by a very direct reference to what I described as the core code-to the central proposition about why the status of our relationship to Europe is as it is.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="11052333000068"></a>If we did not have this clause at all, which would be my preference, much of what I said in the past few moments would not be particularly relevant. But if there is to be a declaratory cause it should at least have the characteristics that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, introduced in his speech this evening. It is impossible to misinterpret or misunderstand it. That has great merit and I hope that he will not mind my saying so from the opposition Benches. It does not alter my view that, as the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, said, the clause is not really necessary, but Amendment 59 has a convincing pedigree and that is what recommends it to me.</p>

I will seek to explain why the words are in the Bill. Whether the explanation is acceptable to the Committee is another matter at the moment. I will explain that the words that are in the Bill work the other way: they add to the precision of the legislation rather than to the vagueness of it. I will come to that in a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="11052333000070"></a>As noble Lords have recognised, Amendment 57 would include on the face of the Bill that Clause 18 does not alter the rights and obligations that the UK signed up to on becoming a member state of the European Union. It also seeks to legislate explicitly that Clause 18 does not alter the primacy of EU law. I am grateful to your Lordships for drawing attention to these two important principles: that the EU law has primacy and that the UK must honour its obligations as an EU member state. I assure the Committee and particularly the noble Lord, Lord Lea, with his Amendment 58, that the Bill supports both those principles. Indeed, the Bill has to support them. It is not a question of choice. The Bill has to support those principles because to do otherwise would put us in breach of our obligations as EU members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="11052333000071"></a>I have serious concerns about Amendment 57. It does not reflect accurately the legal position regarding the UK's membership of the European Union. I say that because the UK follows the dualist constitutional model. Giving treaties effect in the UK is always a two-stage process. That did not seem to feature in the debate that we just had. The first stage-the signing of the treaty during which the UK may take on rights and obligations-is governed by public international law. The rights and obligations assumed by the UK on becoming an EU member state are governed by public, international law rather than domestic law. Those rights and obligations are binding on the United Kingdom under international law irrespective of the existence of the European Communities Act or any other Act of Parliament and will continue to be so as long as the UK continues to be a member state of the European Union. It follows that the EU Bill does not and cannot change the rights and obligations assumed by the United Kingdom on becoming a member of the European Union. It would be misleading to suggest in this or in any Bill that any Act of Parliament could do this. Such a change could only be done by the UK renegotiating the terms of its membership of the European Union.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="11052333000072"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, that Governments can of course seek to bind future Governments. Most Governments whom I know, and whom many of your Lordships know, have sought to bring in great legislation. Let us take, for instance, some of the privatisation provisions under the earlier Thatcher Government. Our hope was that those would endure. We hoped that a future Government would feel bound by privatisation visions, not renationalise the whole of the then privatised sector-indeed, our hopes were in fact borne out. However, a Parliament cannot bind a future Parliament; that is a completely different proposition. It is of course possible that a future Parliament could repeal the 1972 Act although, interestingly, that would not remove the United Kingdom from the European Union. It could only be done by negotiation through Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union but those things are possible. Parliament can do anything and is supreme.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="11052333000073"></a>Noble Lords have asked what the point of Clause 18 is and why it is in the Bill. It confirms that the second stage of the dualist system, whereby the rights and obligations taken on by the UK are given effect in UK law and can therefore be enforced through the UK courts, must always be done by an Act of Parliament. Any suggestion that EU law constitutes a new, higher autonomous legal order and has or can develop into part of the UK's legal system independent of statute are thereby refuted. That is very important indeed. Noble Lords may say: "So what? That is what the courts have always upheld". However, as the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, acutely observed, it has been challenged. I think that the prosecution in the metric martyrs case tried to float the idea in the counter case that EU law had some autonomous existence independent of our own statute law. It has been raised and to say that it is not in question is simply factually wrong when people have questioned it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="11052333000074"></a>It is therefore the view of the coalition that it is right and valuable that this declaratory clause should be in the Bill. Even if it can be said that the courts have

They are, from time to time, challenged by learned legal minds and there is dispute about them. Far from this clause being unnecessary, as the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, ventured to argue with great clarity, I maintain that on the basis of our own experience-what we hear, read and see in the public debate-it is necessary that it should be in place. That is my view on Clause 57 but I will obviously think hard about the views that were put forward by extremely acute and expert minds on this matter. However, I said that I would set out how the Government see the matter and that is how we see it.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="11052333000075"></a>Amendment 59 was a very important part of the argument put forward by a number of noble Lords, including my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern. Let me explain why we have in there "an Act of Parliament" rather than "by virtue of the European Communities Act 1972". I reassure my noble and learned friend that we have thought about this very carefully because it is a complex balance of issues and we wanted very much to get it right.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="11052333000076"></a>The Government accept that Section 2(1) of the European Communities Act is commonly identified as the primary way in which EU law takes effect in the UK, but unfortunately that is not quite right. There are other Acts which can be interpreted as giving effect to EU law within the UK; for example, there are some provisions of the Scotland Act 1998, the Government of Wales Act 2006, the Northern Ireland Act 1998-and I believe there were other earlier Northern Ireland Acts as well, as I remember taking part in some myself. Then there are the Enterprise Act 2002 and the Equality Act 2006. They all put Ministers under an obligation to act in accordance with EU law without reference to the European Communities Act-and there may be other such Acts in future. Who knows? We have to prepare for these things. It was to address this concern and those facts that Clause 18 was deliberately drafted to refer to Acts in the plural, or an Act of Parliament, rather than solely referring to Section 2(1) of the European Communities Act 1972.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="11052333000077"></a>I reassure my noble friends that having carefully thought about it and come down on that side of the argument, which we believe to be the comprehensive and effective one, there was no sinister purpose. It was simply a design to ensure that all the means by which directly effective or applicable EU law could be given an effect in the UK legal order are addressed. That is the raison d'etre and the underlying argument why the clause is there, why it is necessary and why it is so worded.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="11052333000078"></a>I would like to say a final word, or semi-final word-or penultimate word-about the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, at Second Reading, which he touched on again today. He queried what on earth paragraph 113 was doing in the Explanatory Notes, which refers to the,</p>
<ul><a name="11052333000139"></a>"UK subordinate legislation ... and ... Acts and Measures of the devolved legislatures".</ul>



<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1668"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1668</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="11052333000114"></a>The answer is that EU law can be given effect in the UK legal order, not only directly through primary legislation but through means of delegated legislation adopted under primary legislation. The obvious example of this is the secondary legislation giving effect to EU measures adopted under Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act, and the reference in Clause 18 to,</p>
<ul><a name="11052333000140"></a>"by virtue of an Act of Parliament",</ul>
<p><a name="11052333000115"></a>covers that aspect.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="11052333000079"></a>I said that was my penultimate comment. My noble and extremely learned friend Lord Howe did that dangerous thing of mentioning the Commonwealth, which has not really come into this Bill at all. I cannot resist making the point that if we are to promote the interests of this nation as a positive member of the European Union, and to do so fit in to this extraordinary new world in which all the wealth and accumulated savings and first the economic and now the political power have shifted to a degree away from the Atlantic nations and the west to the new emerging worlds of Asia, Africa and Latin America, these are the new networks in which we must also involve ourselves. We must work to ensure that our European membership enables us to take our full part in these things to reinforce each other.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="11052333000080"></a>I had to get that in, only because my noble and learned friend tempted me. It has very little to do with the amendment, but I think that I have explained why the two points raised by noble Lords with great learning and authority fit in to the fact that the clause is necessary; it may be declaratory but it does a job, and that is why it is there, and it is drafted as an Act of Parliament rather than the European Communities Act 1972 but deliberately and carefully.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="11052333000081"></a>I think I said a word about the amendment intended to help proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Lea. I assure him that there is no way in which Clause 18 alters the commitment or position of the primacy of European Union law, which in turn rests as it always must on the will and Act of Parliament supported by the courts. That is why I would ask noble Lords and the noble and learned Lords to consider what they have put forward and withdraw the amendment.</p>

He said that if this Parliament repealed the 1972 Act and the relevant parts of the other Acts that he mentioned, we would still be bound by Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty. Article 50 is of course the laborious and expensive process that Lisbon allows for a member state to leave the European Union over a period of some two years. Why is that so? Surely if we have repealed the 1972 Act, have we not repealed everything that flows from it, including Article 50. Could we not then get out much quicker and rather more cheaply?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="11052333000085"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, produced a lot of totally irrelevant analogies with the action taken by the French last year on the Roma, with the Danes and so on. They were all taken by executive action, not by legislation. He was proposing that Parliament should actually disallow a ruling by the European Court. If we did that, it would not be infraction proceedings that we would be getting; we would be on to the road out, which is exactly what he would like to achieve.</p>

I was simply quoting directly what the European Scrutiny Committee in the Commons stated at paragraph 76. If the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, would care to read that paragraph, he would be better informed.</p>

The noble Lord will understand that if he quotes in an approving manner from a report from another place, it is assumed that he shares that view. I am merely pointing out that the parallels that he made with the Danes and the French are very inexact and that the sort of action proposed in the quotation he gave would in fact lead to us leaving the EU, which is a perfectly possible eventuality, one that I know he and his colleague in UKIP strongly desire. I am merely suggesting that that is not the desire of the government Front Bench-they have made that clear-and that, apart from those two interventions, the Government's draft of Clause 18 has had no support at all.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="11052333000088"></a>What remains is a rich banquet of alternatives to which I hope the Government will give serious consideration between now and Report and will choose the one most likely to gain a majority in this House and in another place. As far as the first is concerned, that looks unlikely to be the one that is on the table in the name of the Government at the moment. Since the noble Lord has clarified the Government's intentions very helpfully, the Government could easily accept any of the following three options: losing Clause 18; accepting the clause that has been drafted by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern; or making the addition that I have proposed but which leaves their own draft intact. I hope that the Government will give serious consideration to this.</p>

If this Parliament legislates every time a prosecuting attorney makes a bosh like that and it is dismissed by the judge, we would be here every day of the year for about 20 years. Surely it is not a basis for legislation. It is simply unnecessary. However, I am perfectly prepared and very happy to give the Government the period between now and Report to consider carefully the options that have been put on the table, all of which are consistent with their own views. On Report we will return to this matter, as I am sure we must. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Will the noble Lord, Lord Howell, include in his consideration that there is a demand for a rewrite of Clause 18? The noble Lord has said that the Government respect all of the seven statutes that we are committed to implementing in the United Kingdom. To use the vernacular, you could have fooled me. In the tone of the Bill there is very little that acknowledges the weight of this great structure that has been prepared as a framework. That is the ghost at the feast at the moment. No other country in the EU is raising the bar as high as we are with all these referendum arrangements. It would be very valuable, to say the least, if something more positive could be incorporated into this declaratory clause.</p>

We have had an excellent discussion-civilised, expert, well argued and showing the real quality of the House of Lords. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, at the end did his best to explain why the Government think that the inclusion of this clause is necessary. I am no lawyer-one comes to these matters as a bird of little brain-but we will have to give what he said in his speech a lot of thought over the Recess. I am glad that we have the Recess to think about it.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="11052333000092"></a>The fundamental question at the back of my mind on this clause-and at the back of the minds of many Members who have moved amendments to it-which the Government have failed to answer, is: why is this clause required now? We have been members of the European Union satisfactorily for nearly 40 years. Why do we need to introduce this clause at this stage? How will it improve our relationship with the EU? I have not come across a good, objective answer to that question. I am sorry to lower the tone and talk about crude politics but I think the reason why this clause is included is because it is intended to satisfy and appease some of the worst elements-from our point of view-of feeling about Europe in this country.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="11052333000093"></a>I have always believed in something that I call the Dora Gaitskell principle of politics. This is based on the story that when Hugh Gaitskell made his great "thousand years of British history" speech at the Labour conference in 1962, and it was a tremendous success and the hall rose-the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, was probably there-Dora turned to Hugh and said, "But Hugh, all the wrong people are cheering". I wonder who is cheering this sovereignty clause. Why are the Government doing this? The whole idea of introducing some sort of sovereignty clause goes back a long way. I was not at the Labour conference in 1962 but I had to listen to the comments of the Common Market Safeguards Campaign and the Labour Common Market Safeguards Committee in the 1970s. I remember Peter Shore, for whom I had the greatest respect as an individual, strongly putting forward the argument that we should renege on Clause 2 of the European Communities Act. For the past 20 years we have had the redoubtable and indefatigable William Cash making these kind of arguments in the other place.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="11052333000094"></a>The Government have to explain to us why, after 40 years of membership, we need this clause now. My fear is that anything we do in this area will be misinterpreted and will be an invitation to the courts to change what has been a relatively clear position up to now. That is why we must come back to this issue with all seriousness on Report. With that, I withdraw my opposition at this stage to Clause 18 standing part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_229"></a>
<a name="11052333000095"></a><b><a name="110523-0002.htm_spnew70"></a><a name="11052333000175"></a>Lord Howell of Guildford:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord has touched on a number of the issues that we have already covered. He asks yet again why the clause  


<notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2011" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1672"></a><b>23 May 2011 : Column 1672</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is there. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, slightly mocks the coalition, and mocks me, by suggesting that this all turns on the prosecution's line in a particular case. It does not, of course; it turns on a very wide number of views. I do not know whether he has studied all the academic views submitted to the scrutiny committee in the other place, but they were substantial. They reflect a substantial body of thought which asserts that EU law is autonomous and independent. This measure is in line with the practice of other member states. Germany's Federal Constitutional Court, the Bundesverfassungsgericht, ruled in 1993 in the case of Brunner v the European Union Treaty-this was in the <I>Common Market Law Reports 57</I>-that Community law applies in Germany only because laws passed by the German Parliament say that it does. Therefore, although the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, put it extremely kindly when he said that we are raising the bar above others, I am not sure that that is so. In some cases, we are actually catching up with others. We are simply moving to a position of declaring that the will of Parliament is supreme in all our laws in this kingdom, but that Parliament has willed that EU law should have supremacy. That is and has been the position since we passed the 1972 Act all those long nights and years ago, as my noble and learned friend Lord Howe reminded us.</p>

<a name="110523-0002.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="11052333000096"></a>There it is. I have clearly listened carefully to this excellent and learned debate. I owed it to the House and to your Lordships to explain why the coalition reached the view that a clause of this kind, after careful consideration, should be worded in this way. That is particularly important because I hope that the clause now carries a little more support from my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, and others. I tried to explain the position as clearly as possible. We have a good and valuable case that reinforces our stance vis-à-vis Europe, which is, as I said, positive and constructive in the dangerous and fluid world where new and positive thoughts are urgently required.</p>

<a name="1105233000007"></a><b><a name="110523-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="1105233000052"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Henley):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State has today made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="1105233000008"></a>I am today laying before Parliament a first National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England and Statutory Guidance on Co-operation and Requesting Information in Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management. Both documents are being presented in accordance with Section 7 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 and stem from Sir Michael Pitt's review of the widespread flooding in 2007, and will be issued on 18 July unless either House resolves that they should not be issued.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="1105233000009"></a>The national strategy will provide a legally-binding framework in setting out how communities, the public sector and other organisations will work together to manage flood and coastal erosion risk. The national strategy describes:</p>
the Environment Agency's strategic overview role for all sources of flood risk, and coastal erosion, and the approach they will take to managing the risk of flooding from main rivers and the sea;the framework within which lead local flood authorities can work with other risk management authorities to manage local flood risk in their areas;the work by coastal erosion risk management authorities to manage our changing coastlines, and;how national funding and resources will be targeted towards flood and coastal erosion risk management activity in the coming years.

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="1105233000010"></a>Copies of the national strategy and guidance on co-operation and requesting information are available to Members of the House from the official documents website and the Vote Office.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="1105233000011"></a>This Government are committed to making sure that as many communities as possible have the opportunity of benefiting from flood and coastal defences. I am therefore pleased to inform the House that following full public consultation earlier this year, my department is today setting out a new partnership approach to funding flood and coastal resilience. The new approach aims to be both fairer and more transparent than the system it replaces, and offers the potential for much more to be achieved.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="1105233000012"></a>Instead of meeting the full costs of just a limited number of projects, the new approach could make government money available towards any worthwhile scheme. Funding levels for each scheme will relate directly to the number of households protected, the value of damages being prevented, plus the other benefits a scheme would deliver. For the first time, grants for surface water management and property-level protection will be available alongside funding for other risks and approaches. The reforms will not affect the amount of money that Government themselves will invest in the coming years.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="1105233000013"></a>The new approach encourages better value for taxpayers' money and greater local and private contributions to come forward, in recognition of the benefits being delivered. Choices can be taken locally on whether, and how, contributions might be found. All funds invested in this way will supplement national budgets and mean more communities can be protected. By encouraging greater local choice, and more local investment, we will ensure that local ambitions for protection are not dictated by what Government alone can afford. The new approach reflects suggestions made by Sir Michael Pitt, who recommended Government introduce a scheme that allows and encourages greater local investment.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="1105233000014"></a>I have today written to the chair of the Environment Agency to ask this approach be adopted for all future funding approvals. The coming months will be treated as a transitional period allowing lessons to be learned and the approach to be refined before final arrangements are confirmed in time to apply from April 2013.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="1105233000015"></a>Finally, I would like to inform the House that summaries of responses to the following consultations and other supporting documents are also being published today:</p>
Consultation on a National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England;Consultation on Statutory Guidance on Co-operation and Requesting Information in Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management;Future Funding for Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management: Consultation on the Future Capital Grant-in-Aid Allocation Process in England; and Consultation on Guidance to Lead Local Flood Authorities on their Contribution to Sustainable Development.

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="1105233000017"></a><b><a name="110523-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="1105233000053"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My right honourable friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office (Francis Maude) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="1105233000018"></a>Today I have laid before Parliament the <I>Giving</I> White Paper (Cm 8084). This follows from the <I>Giving</I> Green Paper which was published on 29 December 2010 and the consultation which this launched.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="1105233000019"></a>We believe that everyone can make a difference. So we want to empower and encourage more people to get involved; support each other and create the change they want to see.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="1105233000020"></a>In the <I>Giving</I> Green Paper we set out our ambition to work with partners to inspire a step change in giving-both of time and money. We believe that giving is good. It offers benefits for everyone-those giving as well as those receiving. It does not matter how you give, or what you give, mutual support is at the core of a happy, healthy society.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="1105233000021"></a>We understand that stimulating social action is not easy or straightforward. Governments have tried in the past but have not succeeded in generating significant increases in giving. We are also conscious that the economic difficulties of the past few years mean we must tread carefully. Many people may be unable or unwilling to give more of their time or money if they feel stretched financially or have little time to spare.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="1105233000022"></a>Stimulating giving is a long-term project and we want to take a new approach that uses lessons from previous attempts. In part this is about acknowledging the limits of government-recognising that social action is not something people can or should be compelled to do. Instead it has to be built from the bottom up through grass-roots organisations and with opportunities to give that appeal to people's motivations and interests. As we heard repeatedly in responses to our consultation, the autonomy of charities and community groups, and the voluntary nature of giving are vitally important and we are determined not just to respect but encourage this independence.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="1105233000023"></a>We believe that there are a range of ways government can help to make giving easier and more compelling without interfering or getting in the way. We want to use a mix of approaches to achieve this: from more traditional policy levers such as tax incentives, funding, policy programmes and removing regulatory barriers; to softer approaches, such as setting a good example and bringing people and organisations together to share ideas and celebrate success.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="1105233000024"></a>In the White Paper we set out three core strands of activity where we want to work with partners to:</p>
make giving as easy as possible;make giving as compelling as possible; andgive better support to those that provide and manage opportunities to give-be they charities, community groups or others.

I can confirm that will remain the position and will provide 50 FTE posts at Newport to deal with the 47,000 customers from South Wales and the South-West who make use of the Newport office.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="1105233000028"></a>The consultation period was extended by two months at the request of key stakeholders. We have taken that opportunity to listen and to evaluate the responses received from staff, trade unions, Members of this House and the Wales Select Committee, Members of the National Assembly for Wales and local leaders in Newport.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="1105233000029"></a>We have also taken into account other organisational changes impacting on IPS, particularly the effect of voluntary exit schemes. Some 170 operational staff have left IPS since autumn 2010 on a voluntary basis. That has provided IPS with the opportunity to consolidate some of its operational functions throughout their regional network.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="1105233000030"></a>We are maintaining our intention to cease the processing of postal and online applications at Newport. This remains the most effective approach to achieve the necessary reductions in excess staffing levels and capacity in the application processing network.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="1105233000031"></a>However, as a result of the consolidation work undertaken by IPS, a further 100 FTE posts will be located in Newport. The Newport office will maintain the IPS central customer complaints and correspondence function and share telephone customer enquiry handling with the Durham office. The handling of lost and stolen passports will be located at Durham and Peterborough and a specialist counter-fraud team will be based at Newport. The processing of overseas passport applications will be carried out in Liverpool, Durham and Belfast after repatriation in 2013.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="1105233000032"></a>The current premises in Newport will be retained until the lease break in 2013. After that date, the size of the premises used for Newport will be reduced by 50 per cent. IPS will give up excess space at their offices in Glasgow and Durham by the end of the current financial year. The Durham estate will be reduced further by March 2014 to achieve an overall reduction of one-third of current capacity. A strategic review of the North-West estate will be carried out and the options for Peterborough estate assessed after the main lease break in July 2013.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="1105233000033"></a>The programme of work combined with the voluntary exit schemes will reduce capacity by 300 posts. The proposed consolidation of specialist work across the regional offices will lead to a surplus of around 120 FTE posts in Newport compared to the original proposal to make 300 posts surplus. IPS will continue to work with those staff, with trade unions and others to find suitable alternative employment within IPS and elsewhere.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="1105233000034"></a>IPS commenced the consultation with the aim of a reduction in estate of around 19 per cent and delivering savings of approximately £24 million over the Comprehensive Spending Review period. The planned programme of work will deliver anticipated savings of £22.6 million over the CSR period, subject to carrying out a further voluntary exit scheme later this year and rationalisation of the estate will reduce the overall IPS estate capacity by 15 per cent.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="1105233000035"></a><b><a name="110523-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="1105233000055"></a>The Minister of State, Home Office (Baroness Browning):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Policing and Criminal Justice (Nick Herbert) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="1105233000036"></a>My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is today presenting to Parliament a statutory <I>Code of Practice on the Management of Police Pursuits</I>. Copies of the code will be available from the Vote Office.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="1105233000037"></a>The code is being laid under the provisions of Sections 39 and 39A of the Police Act 1996. Section 39 permits the Secretary of State to issue codes of practice relating to the discharge by police authorities of any of their functions; Section 39A permits her to issue codes of practice relating to the discharge of functions by chief officers where that is necessary for the purpose of promoting the efficiency and effectiveness of police forces in England and Wales. Under Section 39A(7) of the Act, chief officers have a duty to have regard to a code of practice when discharging a function to which the code relates. The code must be followed unless there are good reasons not to do so, in which case the decision not to follow the code should be recorded in writing.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="1105233000038"></a>Over the past six years there have been on average 22 deaths a year arising immediately or subsequently from police pursuits. Following a recommendation from the Independent Police Complaints Commission, the Association of Chief Police Officers revised its existing operational guidance on the management of pursuits and asked for this to be issued as a statutory code under the Police Act. It indicated that it was its clear professional judgment that a code would ensure appropriate chief officer attention to this issue and make a significant difference on the ground, with a reduced risk of deaths and serious injuries. I agree with its advice.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="1105233000039"></a>The Government are committed to the operational independence of the police and will respect their professional judgement. The code I am now presenting is therefore a high-level strategic document, setting national standards and requiring chief officers to have regard to the guidance prepared by the police themselves.

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="1105233000040"></a><b><a name="110523-wms0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="1105233000056"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="1105233000041"></a>I am today publishing our response to the comments received in the consultation on proposals to amend the criteria defining strategic national corridors (SNCs) and confirming the action we will take.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="1105233000042"></a>The strategic national corridors were established in 2009 to define the network over which the largest proportion of strategic traffic-that is traffic travelling between the 10 largest urban areas, 10 busiest ports and seven busiest airports in England-moves around the country. The original definition also provided for connectivity between the four nations of the United Kingdom, but there was no specific provision for connecting capital cities.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="1105233000043"></a>We concluded that the routes linking Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast to the nearest urban strategic destination should be recognised for the strategic connectivity that they provide, and consulted accordingly. After taking account of the consultation responses I can now confirm that we are going ahead with this change.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="1105233000044"></a>Specifically, we identified two routes as having national significance: namely the A1 between its junction with the A19 north of Newcastle and the Scottish Border, providing a defined link to Edinburgh; and a route between Bootle and the Twelve Quays Ferry Terminal in Birkenhead, providing connectivity with Belfast. Again, after taking account of the consultation responses, I can confirm that these routes will henceforth become roads of national significance.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="1105233000045"></a>A number of other suggestions were made for changes to the SNCs, including specific proposals for increases in coverage. My department will reconsider the scope and role of the SNCs once the LEPs are well established and their role in transport decision-making is clear.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="1105233000046"></a>The consultation documents, including the consultation response, can be found on my department's website. An electronic copy has been lodged with the House Library.</p>

<a name="110523-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="1105233000048"></a>The committee has been asked to produce an advisory report, taking account of the UK Government's view that changes should not involve a net increase in public expenditure and the benefit system should be as simple as possible.

As previously advised, the Government hold information about export licences issued, refused or revoked and information about what these licences cover, including a summary of the items, overall value and type (eg military, other), are published in the annual and quarterly reports on strategic export controls. As an export licence is required to export arms and other military equipment from the United Kingdom, details about what items were licensed for export to Indonesia will be contained within these reports. However, the fact that a licence has been issued does not mean that an export has necessarily taken place.</p>

<a name="110523w0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_39"></a><a name="11052312000046"></a>All export licence applications are rigorously assessed on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria taking account of all prevailing circumstances at the time of application. A licence will not be issued where to do so would be inconsistent with the criteria or other relevant announced commitments. In particular, criterion 2 concerns the "respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country of final destination", and states that the Government will not issue an export licence if there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression. If the situation in the country changes or new information comes to light that causes us to have concerns, we can and do revoke export licences where we consider that the proposed export would, in light of the changing situation, contravene the criteria.</p>

However, tensions began to heighten from 2009 as the Burmese authorities sought to subsume armed groups into a national border guard force as part of their pre-election preparations. Major armed groups resisted the border guard force proposal in order to protect their local autonomy. The Government have received reports that the Burmese military subsequently responded by closing all communication channels to the armed groups and claiming that the ceasefire agreements no longer existed. Tensions in these areas have recently escalated leading to renewed conflict. We have also heard reports of increased military movements against the Wa and Mon-two of the largest groups.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11052312000191"></a>"The York review identified 88 studies (mainly cross-sectional) investigating dental fluorosis, from 30 countries, which suggested a prevalence (all levels of severity) of 48 per cent in fluoridated areas and 15 per cent in non-fluoridated areas. Limiting consideration to aesthetically important levels of severity, the York review reported the prevalence of fluorosis to be 12.5 per cent in fluoridated areas and 6.3 per cent in non-fluoridated areas. For any given fluoride concentration in water the prevalence of aesthetically important dental fluorosis was higher in naturally fluoridated areas than in artificially fluoridated areas. A sensitivity analysis excluding data points above 1.5ppm fluoride found prevalences for all levels of severity of 46 per cent. and 18 per cent".</p>
