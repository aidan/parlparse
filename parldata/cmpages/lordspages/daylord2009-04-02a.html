We know that the number of people developing diabetes continues to increase and that is why we are working with the NHS to help prevent people from developing the condition. Initiatives such as Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives and the vascular checks programme will be key to achieving this.</p>

In the light of these research findings, is she aware that the number of new cases of type 2 diabetes, which, as she said, is strongly linked to obesity, rose by 69 per cent in the six years between 1997 and 2003? It is vital that diabetes is identified early to prevent the onset of complications such as blindness and amputation. Does she agree that a wide range of measures needs to be taken to tackle this threatening time bomb? There are worrying reports that the diabetic specialist services are being cut back. What steps are the Government taking to ensure that these vital services are available to all people with diabetes in order to prevent the appalling complications that can ensue?</p>

Consequently this has led, for example, to increased spending on the drugs being prescribed. We are not aware that there has been any reduction in expenditure or workforce at local level. We are investing heavily in prevention, particularly in the programmes I have already mentioned&#151;Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives and the vascular checks programme&#151;in self-medication and in self-management, and we are encouraging comprehensive services for diabetes at local level. Indeed, the NICE guidelines issued in 2008 recommended a comprehensive programme for people with type 2 diabetes, encouraging life style changes, healthy eating and increased physical activity.</p>

We estimate that there are 20,000 children with type 1 diabetes in England and there may be up to 1,000 children with type 2 diabetes. The close link between diabetes and obesity means that it is vital that we reduce the number of children becoming overweight and obese and we are focusing on that. We recognise that there are particular issues about helping children and young people both to have access to the best quality care and to provide them and their families with the support and training to enable them, over a period of time, to become competent at managing their condition.</p>

As she said, there is a positive correlation between the increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes on the one hand and the development of obesity on the other. What advice are the Government giving to the public at large about the risks of overeating?</p>

He is, of course, quite correct in his diagnosis. In January 2008 we launched a &#163;372 million cross-government strategy, Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives, which set out our ambition to enable people to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. We launched Change4Life, a national movement that brings together community groups, health professionals, teachers, government departments, supermarkets and the media to help people make positive changes to their diet, levels of activity and lifestyle, leading to better health. Indeed, yesterday the vascular checks programme kicked in as we announced our programme of vascular checks for everyone in England aged between 40 and 74. This has real potential to prevent many cases of diabetes and identify thousands more cases earlier.</p>

What plans do the Government have to address this problem? In particular, could not this House set an example, perhaps by jogging on the spot during debates or having a morning exercise session after Prayers and before business starts?</p>

It is, indeed, due to lifestyle; not only eating, but exercise. It is also

Because diabetes is a progressive condition, as you grow older, your risk of diabetes increases, particularly if you are not taking care of yourself and not taking exercise. If people have better access to support and can identify what they need to do to manage their condition and health day to day, we will prevent diabetes and help to keep it under control.</p>

In 2007, the Government extended the scope of FSA regulation to cover home reversion plans, which are the other main type of equity release product, to help to ensure a level regulatory playing field for the equity release market. Equity release is a complex financial product. Consumers considering equity release should seek independent financial advice.</p>

Does he agree that well regulated equity release can help to fund the adaptions and social care that will give an older person the choice of staying in their own home, rather than going into residential care?

Equity release is a very small part of the housing finance market&#151;less than 0.25 per cent of mortgage loans relate to it&#151;but for those who perhaps find themselves in a position where they have high assets but low income, it can be a valuable and important part of their financial strategy.

The trade association representing those active in this area has developed a highly commendable code of practice.</p>

It is clear that the FSA&#146;s role in prudential supervision has come under challenge and the FSA acknowledges that it needs to do more to improve its standards. Today&#146;s G20 meeting will probably set a framework within which some of that work will be taken forward. I am not aware that the FSA&#146;s deficiencies in consumer protection are as grave as the noble Baroness&#146;s question might suggest. As far as the credibility of those active in the market is concerned, it is clear that some quite major lenders do not want to be involved in this product because they see it as too fraught with hazard. However, the risk lies ultimately with the individual, which is why good regulation and transparency about risks and consequences are critical to the development of this interesting product area.</p>

The reason for asking this Question is the age-related nature of the problem. The great bulk of our power stations are more than 40 years old now and will fail over the next few years due to age. Would the Minister agree that it seems inevitable that for the next 10 years or so we will build nothing but gas-fired power stations so increasing our reliance on imported gas, from sometimes dubious sources?</p>

The noble Lord is absolutely right to point out the challenge to ensure that there is adequate replacement. Gas capacity, at 7 gigawatts, forms the majority of what is under construction. With the EDF takeover of British Energy, there are now strong proposals for new nuclear to be built, not just from EDF; other companies, too, are showing considerable interest. We also have the challenging drive for renewables, so we expect to see much more renewable energy being put in place over the next few years as well.</p>

Our decision to support the whole concept of smart meters in this country shows that we see considerable potential in energy efficiency. The more that customers know, the more likely they are to understand the need for energy efficiency, and we have a number of consultations at the moment to encourage it. The noble Lord raises an extremely important point.</p>

We do not want these power stations in remote locations, where that heat will be wasted. The French get this right; the Swedes do not.</p>

The noble Lord will know that the process of looking at potential sites is going on, but he will also understand that at many of the current sites that will shortly embark on decommissioning, or those that are currently doing so, there is great anxiety among the workforce that new nuclear should be developed on those sites. There are many factors to be taken into account.</p>

We fully understand that many power stations are due for either closure or decommissioning over the next 10 to 15 years, but I have indicated that there is a considerable programme of investment in stations that are now under construction and those that have received consent, and we expect further investment decisions to be made. This is a critically important matter. We carefully monitor the whole situation to ensure that we will not have an energy gap.

While there is no question of changing the constitutional role of the monarch or the Church of England as the established church, both my right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellor have said that we have to deal with issues of discrimination here. The laws concerning marriage to Catholics and the primacy of male members of the Royal Family should change, but that can happen only with the agreement of all the Commonwealth countries of which Her Majesty the Queen is the Head of State. Given the need for consensus across all the Queen&#146;s realms, this cannot happen overnight.</p>

On her first point about whether we might remedy one of these issues and not the other, the problem is that the same difficulties apply when amending the law on succession to effect equal rights for females in the line of succession as to removing anti-Catholic provisions in the Act of Settlement. The Statute of Westminster 1931 requires the assent of the Parliaments of all those countries of which Her Majesty the Queen is Head of State.</p>

<a name="90402-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="09040250000062"></a>With that out of the way, and now that the general hubbub has abated somewhat, I begin, as I did last week, by declaring my various interests in this field: as an unpaid adviser to the Enterprise Privacy Group, Privacy International and 80/20 Thinking. I should perhaps also say that I have no wish to be unduly partisan in introducing the debate. This is far too important an issue for any of us to use it as an opportunity to indulge in party political grandstanding.</p>

<a name="90402-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09040250000063"></a>Against that background, I say again that I am fully cognisant of the potential utility of data and information across the whole panoply of public policy. I agree with the statement made by the Minister last week that,</p>
<ul><a name="09040250000422"></a>&#147;Information is fundamental to the delivery of modern public services and public protection because it helps citizens to receive the services to which they are entitled, front-line staff to have the information that they need to do their jobs effectively and public services to be accurate and efficient&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 25/3/09; col. 658.]</ul>
<p><a name="09040250000366"></a>I also accept that the imperatives driving policy in this field are, in the main, well-intentioned and worth while. Moreover, I acknowledge that where to strike the balance between data privacy and the legitimate right of the state to manage and process those data for the public good is an especially vexed issue.</p>

<a name="90402-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09040250000064"></a>Why, therefore, have I, and an ever increasing phalanx of like-minded citizens, been so persistent in expressing our concerns and anxieties about how our established right to privacy, via article 8 of the ECHR, is under such insidious attack? At an aggregated level, the answer is pretty straightforward. The stark reality is that, over the past 10 years or so, the UK has earned an unenviable reputation for being a world leader in how to impose a whole raft of surveillance technologies upon its citizenry: the DNA database, CCTV cameras, the National Identity Register, the NHS National Plan for IT, and so on.</p>

<a name="90402-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09040250000065"></a>The Government may seek to pray in aid both the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act as the means whereby they have guaranteed that those technologies are subject to appropriate and adequate safeguards. However, as the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust report, <I>Database State</I>, observes, the Data Protection Act is a &#147;defective implementation&#148; of the EU data protection directive in a number of respects. For example, how can an individual mitigate the harmful consequences of illegal data processing when he has no way of knowing that it has taken place? Quite apart from this, and because data protection and data security are two sides of the same coin, its manifest flaws have been brought into very much sharper focus in recent times after the HMRC data scandal and the relentless flood of breaches and losses both within government and the commercial sector that followed that debacle. In effect, the legitimate and reasonable expectation that the Data Protection Act, buttressed by the Human Rights Act, would embed and entrench the primacy of  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1182"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1182</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the data interest of the citizen, as codified by the data protection principles, has been just so much wishful thinking.</p>

<a name="90402-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09040250000066"></a>What has happened instead is that policy avenues have been pursued, particularly in the context of the public services reform and security agendas, which actively and explicitly seek to subordinate the citizen&#146;s data interest to that of the state. This gives traction to a fundamental change of the relationship between the state and citizen whereby, as the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust report maintains:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="09040250000396"></a>&#147;Increasingly users who should feel like a citizen or customer&#151;responsible and in control&#151;feel instead like a suspect or recidivist&#148;.</p>

<a name="90402-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09040250000067"></a>Nowhere is this process more apparent than in the strategy document, <I>Transformational Government</I>, published by the Cabinet Office in November 2005. On the face of it, its core presumption, that,</p>
<ul><a name="09040250000423"></a>&#147;Government must move to a shared services culture&#151;in the front office, in the back office, in information and infrastructure, and thereby release efficiencies through standardisation, simplification and sharing&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09040250000367"></a>gives the impression of being eminently sensible and well intentioned, perhaps even innocuous. That may explain why it has received scant scrutiny by Parliament so far. However, its ongoing rollout appears to be aimed at a structural and cultural entrenchment across the whole of Government of the supremacy of the state&#146;s data interest by means of reliance on a network of interconnected databases seeded with ever more information about us. Albeit that the Secretary of State for Justice has recently withdrawn them, the data-sharing proposals on the face of the Coroners and Justice Bill were just the latest manifestation of this trend. Moreover, there is a palpable sense in which this agenda is being almost exclusively driven by administrative convenience and political expediency rather than any innate respect for or understanding of the privacy rights of the individual citizen.</p>

<a name="90402-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09040250000068"></a>Here, I represent the words that I quoted earlier from the Minister in a rather more succinct way. Information and data, in their myriad forms, are the lifeblood of the exercise of power. Thus, in the context of developing policy, state control of statistics runs the risk of being, in the words of Sir Michael Scholar, &#147;corrosive of public trust&#148;. He adds that,</p>
<ul><a name="09040250000424"></a>&#147;having good statistics is like having clean water and clean air. It&#146;s the fundamental material that we depend on for an honest political debate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09040250000368"></a>Therefore, it is to the Government&#146;s credit that they have legislated for the independence of statistics. Nevertheless, in much the same way that political control of statistical data can grant the holder control over the policy agenda, so control of an individual&#146;s personal and sensitive information can grant dominance over the individual himself. It is precisely this that, in the information age, makes identity theft such a harrowing crime: the dual sensations of violation and helplessness arising from a realisation that one is no longer in control of one&#146;s own life. The fact of the matter is that our personal and sensitive data are the core statistics of our own unique lives and, by extension, the wholesale collection, retention and sharing of our data by government is equivalent to a state-sponsored and thereby legitimised form of identity theft.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09040250000069"></a>In this context, David Goodhart, the founder and editor of <I>Prospect</I> magazine, has recently suggested that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="09040250000397"></a>&#147;It might be useful if we started to see our data as similar to tax, something we willingly surrender to the authorities in return for various benefits&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09040250000369"></a>There is some credibility to this view. Personal data are imbued with considerable commercial and political value, the relinquishing of which can generate benefits and advantages for the ways in which we live our lives. To that extent and when aggregated, they can be perceived as part of the nation's stock of social capital. But, in much the same way that we would not tolerate a tax system that stripped us of all our earnings, so we should resist systems that increasingly look as if they are being designed to impoverish every one of us in data terms.</p>

<a name="90402-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09040250000070"></a>Implicit in David Goodhart's approach is a presumption that the anxieties that I have expressed are no more than a storm in a teacup; that the state has a legitimate right, if not responsibility, to deploy technological advancement to the benefit of the greater good. Indeed, it may very well be that, as a result of such influences as the internet itself and celebrity culture, society does not value the &#147;complex bundle of issues&#148; that constitute privacy as highly as perhaps it once did. Be that as it may and at risk of repeating myself, privacy is an established right, articulated in the ECHR. With that in mind, its protection should not, as it were, be reduced to the lowest common denominator. More importantly, as the Willcock v Muckle case in 1951 demonstrates, once sacrificed it is hugely difficult, if not impossible, to recover it.</p>

<a name="90402-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09040250000071"></a>Your Lordships will be well aware that the <I>Database </I><I>State</I><I></I>report made a number of recommendations to address some of these problems. I am supportive of these although I fear that the Minister, on behalf of the Government, will approach them with too much of a closed mind. That said, a more fundamental issue is at work here. Because of the apparently irreconcilable conflict of interest between the data interests of the state and those of the citizen and because of an intrinsic and ingrained inability of government to guarantee adequate security of data, the appropriateness and legitimacy of the state as being the default administrator/processor/manager of our data is called into question. Quite apart from this, it has been the case for some time now that the imperatives that drive government policy in this field, essentially to use data management processes to improve public services and to enhance the fight against terrorism and serious crime, are deliverable in a much less invasive&#151;and, it has to be said, less costly&#151;way than the route chosen by the current Administration. As it happens, only last week I attended a seminar with Microsoft where the technological advances in this field, based on a citizen-centric data sharing platform with no diminution of the state's legitimate rights of access, were outlined.</p>

<a name="90402-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09040250000072"></a>To repeat, I am unconvinced that it is appropriate that the state should be both poacher and gamekeeper of our personal information. Rather, the tasks and functions of data management should be, at the very least, delegated to an authority that is wholly independent of government, perhaps even, if advances in technology permit, devolved to the level of the individual user, as

Dare I say it, adhering to the current myopic obsession with data-sharing across ever larger databases that record each and every moment of our lives runs the risk of creating systems that are so bloated, if not obese, that they grind to a halt and collapse under their own weight. To give your Lordships some feel for the simple arithmetic here, I refer to a number of Questions for Written Answer tabled by my honourable friend, Eleanor Laing, in another place. For example, these have revealed that the customer information system of the DWP, the database that it is intended will be the principal source of information for the National Identity Register,</p>
<ul><a name="09040250000425"></a>&#147;holds 92 million person related records and 9,800 data fields&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 26/3/09; col. 614W.]</ul>
<p><a name="09040250000370"></a>That is to say 960 billion separate fields of data. That is just one database.</p>

<a name="90402-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09040250000073"></a>Perhaps more tellingly Stephen Timms, on behalf of the Treasury, makes this observation:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09040250000398"></a>&#147;There are many data categories of different kinds within each of the identified systems. A count of them all could be produced only at disproportionate cost&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 25/3/09; col. 405W.]</p>

<p><a name="09040250000371"></a>As the Ideal Government blog puts it:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09040250000399"></a>&#147;It&#146;s official. HMRC now collects so much personal data that they can&#146;t afford or can&#146;t be bothered to provide Parliament with the number of fields of data they collect&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09040250000372"></a>In effect we may already be at the point whereby, far from generating a utilitarian information-rich data management system, the Government are already experiencing data overload.</p>

<a name="90402-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09040250000074"></a>In conclusion I cannot improve upon the assessment in the <I>Database State </I>report, which says that the situation in which we find ourselves is one where:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="09040250000400"></a>&#147;All aspects of our lives will be surrounded by masses of data collected without our consent, and shared well beyond the purposes for which they were originally collected. Citizens are starting to realise this, and are progressively losing trust in government&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09040250000373"></a>Bluntly, enough is enough. It remains only for me to say that I very much look forward to the contributions of other noble Lords in the debate and in due course the response of the Minister. I beg to move.</p>

It is not by any means the first time that these issues have been raised, and indeed the Constitution Committee of this House has produced a most worthwhile report. I have not yet seen the Government&#146;s response, but I do not doubt that the Minister will inform us about its detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09040250000076"></a>More importantly, perhaps, is that the Government are not, I believe, an inflexibility on this issue. I agree with the noble Lord who has spoken that it is not sensible to have a partisan approach to these issues. They are of such a scale that it is more effective if we are of one mind about what needs to be done rather than simply to poke holes in each others&#146; cases.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09040250000077"></a>I have to say that I was considerably impressed by the final report, produced last June by the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Gus O&#146;Donnell, <I>Data Handling Procedures in Government</I>. There seemed to be little wrong with  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1185"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what was proposed in those procedures. What we have yet to know, and it is the most important question, is how they will be implemented in practice.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09040250000078"></a>It was said at the time that the intention was to describe the implementation of the principles enunciated in that central report in an annual report by the Cabinet Office to Parliament. They included the use of encryption and penetration testing of systems, standardising and enhancing management of information risk, and identifying individuals in the departments and public agencies who would be personally responsible. They also promised quarterly risk assessments within the department, mandatory training for staff and, perhaps most importantly for this House and another place, privacy impact assessments when new policies or processes are being considered.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09040250000079"></a>It was also generally concluded that greater scrutiny and monitoring, including of information risk, were required in statements on internal control which would be made available to the National Audit Office and the Information Commissioner. Furthermore, it was recognised that there needs to be very great transparency about these matters in annual reports to Parliament. A number of other things have happened since then, including the recognition that the Information Commissioner should have the power to carry out spot checks on public departments and agencies, but alas not in line with the recommendation of the Constitution Committee. Such powers have not been considered yet for extension to the private sector. In the light of the evidence that has been accumulating of such things as blacklisting of workers who are held by employers to be unsuitable for employment and the trading in such information, there is good reason to believe that, notwithstanding the cost of these inspections, it would be appropriate to give consideration to extending the right of intervention beyond the public sector.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09040250000080"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, made plain, everyone who reflects on these matters is aware of the value of information in policy making. It is certainly right that we should not bring that to a halt, but it is also right in parallel to consider on every occasion the implications for privacy of the extension of these developments. Since the development of technological capability is proceeding at such a pace, we have a duty to consider processes that enable a very full understanding to be enjoyed by the decision-makers and proper accountability for the amplification of this process, particularly the process of sharing information for purposes that were not intended when it was collected and which are not strictly the reason for the data being stored. It is right to ask what the Government&#146;s thinking is about that cross-use of information and whether a system of opting in and opting out by the individuals affected might be both practical and desirable.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09040250000081"></a>I recently heard the Minister dismiss the Joseph Rowntree report in an answer. I do not want to exaggerate, but his response suggested that he doubted the methodology. That being so, we have to ask him how he proposes to view the findings of the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, because it was a powerful report. Its findings indicated that a very large number of the systems that are in place would not pass muster if they were tested against the Data Protection Act, never  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1186"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1186</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mind the Human Rights Act. The trust said that 11 of 46 database projects examined almost certainly breached human rights legislation and 29 systems were considered problematic, including having legal problems. I imagine that very few of us will have done any serious trawling over the precise examples that the trust gave. I have not done so myself. None the less, that is a significant charge by a body that consisted of significant specialists in the area with strong not merely academic but commercial backgrounds in the field. The individual challenges that have been made by the trust need to be examined and answered, because I know that it is not the Government&#146;s intention that their practices in this sphere should run counter to the legislation, which they themselves are responsible for enacting and, in some cases, modifying in the light of experience.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09040250000082"></a>Speaking of the legislation which the Government have enacted, I very much hope that the Minister will take the opportunity of this debate to explain what the Government regard as necessary and proportionate in evaluating the &#147;holding of data protection&#148;, those being the words from the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. Another point made by the Constitution Committee of this House was that the Government should give a clear definition. That is right because what is necessary and proportionate can vary very much from one department to another. It is quite clear that, in seeking to prevent crime, the Home Office will have a very different view of information from that of the Department for Work and Pensions. Consequently, we need clarity about the criteria being applied across the board if data is to be shared across the board.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09040250000083"></a>There are wider questions about whether data should be so shared. A number of bodies, including some in this House, have recommended that it is a mistake to seek to accumulate data right across government and to centralise it and that it is better for it to be held locally. Those arguments need to be addressed and consideration needs to be given to whether locally accumulated evidence cannot also be useful centrally, perhaps with some of the personal information extracted from it, so that the proper concerns of the public about invasion of privacy are addressed.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09040250000084"></a>I wish to put a number of other questions to the Minister in this relatively brief intervention, considering the scale of the subject. I wonder whether the Government can give any information about their intention to put communication data, concerning e-mails, telephone communication and the internet, on a large, centralised database. The general expectation about an anticipated Bill has given rise to considerable concern because it is widely recognised that those who access these things can scan people&#146;s life histories with very little advantage accruing to the individuals but much accruing to those who want to advertise.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09040250000085"></a>I would like to ask the Minister whether the Government will think again about the response made some time ago to the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and whether, when they propose to extend their data collection in a particular sphere, they should include that proposal in amendable primary legislation rather than in subordinate law. I have heard and read the arguments about the need for

The trouble with subordinate legislation is that you take it or you lose it and it is not really the best way of ventilating concerns on a complex issue of this kind. I know that things are moving rapidly, but that is part of the general public concern. There is a real need to reassure the public that these matters are taken seriously by all political parties and that we are anxious to build in procedures which enable us to anticipate the difficulties and the intrusions into privacy which may arise.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="09040250000402"></a>&#147;Every holiday, Channel hop or sailing weekend must be registered in advance ... The travel plans and personal details of every holidaymaker, business traveller and day-tripper who leaves Britain are to be tracked by the Government ... Anyone departing by land, sea or air will have the trip recorded and stored on a database for a decade. Those leaving from any international station, port or airport will have to supply detailed personal information as well as their travel plans. So-called &#145;booze cruisers&#146; who cross the Channel for a couple of hours to stock up on wine, beer and cigarettes will be included. Weekend sailors and sea fishermen will have to comply if they plan to travel to another country, or face possible criminal prosecution. The owners of light aircraft will also be brought under the system, known as e-borders, which will eventually track 250 million journeys annually. Even swimmers attempting to cross the Channel and their support teams will be subject to the rules. Travellers will have to supply information such as passport and credit card details, home and email addresses and exact itineraries&#148;.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09040250000087"></a>The Government propose that these rules might apply to the Crown dependencies, such as the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, as well as Northern Ireland, but after yesterday&#146;s defeat of the Government in this House, I do not know how that stands, and I doubt whether they do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09040250000088"></a>There are no prizes for guessing what all this is supposedly in aid of. It is for catching terrorists&#151;catching at the ports, or wherever, suspects whom the security services are supposed to be keeping an eye on, but have not kept a sharp enough eye on. Rather than focus on the people they need to catch, the Government propose a blanket screening of everyone. It is part of the e-borders programme. I can understand the usefulness of keeping tabs on people coming into this country, but to log every single inhabitant of Britain who goes on holiday seems to me to be a log too far. I, and I expect some of your Lordships, should like to know how much all this is going to cost.</p>

I am sure that your Lordships would be delighted for the Government to hold their credit card details, since their record of keeping personal data secure is nothing short of abysmal. As most people buy travel tickets with credit cards nowadays,

Details of baggage are also requested, including the number and description of pieces. I wonder what that means&#151;Vuitton or Marks &amp; Spencer?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09040250000090"></a>All this is in the Immigration and Police (Passenger, Crew and Service Information) Order 2008, which concerns information required about people coming into this country. Can the Minister kindly tell the House under what order these regulations are to apply to people leaving this country&#151;that is, emigrants? The order that I have just referred to concerns immigrants.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09040250000091"></a>Once upon a time, not so long ago, this was a wonderful country to live in. Our ancient freedoms, fought for for nearly 800 years, were the envy of the world. And what has happened to them? Habeas corpus, dating from 1215, has been severely curtailed. The presumption of innocence has been eroded. Freedom of speech and pen is only permissible as long as your views are politically correct. Our e-mails and the internet sites we visit on our computers are tracked by the security services. The police and certain petty officials may break into our houses. A lot of this appears to be cribbed from the German Reichstag Fire Decree of 1933. When thieves break into our homes, we are not allowed to hurt them, whatever they may do to us. We have to get permission to make comparatively minor alterations to our homes. Health and safety rules interfere with everything we do, even the temperature of our bathwater. I could go on.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09040250000092"></a>Much of that emanates from the boys in Brussels. Then very soon we are all to have identity cards and, while the information on them to start with will be fairly basic, the Government have not ruled out adding more personal details at a later date: see the answer of the noble Lord, Lord Brett, to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, last Thursday. The travel-based database, on top of all the rest, is too much. Britain is getting more and more like Soviet Russia before glasnost, and a totalitarian Government&#151;which no country is completely safe from&#151;will find everything already in place for total control. I think the terrorists have won.</p>

It is no good being luddite about modern communication systems. Government at all levels is not only bound to make full use of them but has a duty to do so because citizens have a right to the best possible service from public authorities. The benefits are multiple. Such systems help bodies such as the National Health Service to fulfil its primary purpose of care and are crucial to research in disease, the monitoring of public health and the protection of patients.</p>

However, we know that there are costs: the unnecessary gathering of personal information; overloaded and insecure systems; and data being inaccurate and out of date. There is also the persistent problem of security, as we have seen in recent times. That is why I believe that it would help

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09040250000095"></a>At the centre of this is a contract between the citizen and the public authorities. If I want the National Health Service to provide me with a service, I must accept that it will need information about me that helps it to provide what is needed. Matters concerning the life of each of us as individual citizens are of course the property and responsibility of the person concerned. We do not hand over those property rights to the state. The contract must be clear that the information held by the service will be used for the purposes for which it has been given and by persons with a direct interest in the service offered. If I am to have confidence in the service holding that information, I must be assured about its confidentiality and security. I have no difficulty in the information being widely used, provided that it stays within the broad framework of the service.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09040250000096"></a>Inevitably with modern systems there will be a lot of data held without direct consent. Much of this, as with the 2009 data retention regulations, is concerned with security and tackling crime. However, we need publicly known, understood and accepted regulation of such systems, which needs to protect the privacy of the individual and to reassure the public that no abuse of power is either intended or possible. For example, I will be interested to know from the Minister the Government&#146;s response to the July 2008 <I>Data Sharing Review</I><I> R</I><I>eport</I> from the Information Commissioner and Dr Mark Walport, which I think proposed that the commissioner should be given a statutory duty to produce a code of practice on data sharing and to issue context-specific guidance on its consistent application. That is the sort of field that we need to be in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09040250000097"></a>That leads me to talk about transparency and accountability. These two are inextricably linked. If the authorities are clear about who and what is involved, where information is held and what the values and rules are under which all this happens, then real public accountability is possible. I assume that the Information Commissioner has a key role and needs the powers necessary in assuring us of that accountability.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09040250000098"></a>My last point&#151;my contribution is at a more general level in this debate&#151;concerns what is manageable. The problem with modern communication systems is that we think that they will do it all for us, so increasingly vast sums of money are poured into them and there are growing levels of frustration as complex and massive systems do not work as well as had been hoped. We do not ask: what are the boundaries around what can be delivered through these systems? Therefore, not only must we be clear about the potential benefit that any new system will bring but we must also be clear that it can be managed and delivered and that it will be safe.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09040250000099"></a>As all of us know in the organisations of which we are a part, it is all too easy in complex modern democracies for powerful state bodies, for perfectly good reasons, to launch new systems, only for us all to

That is why I believe that we need to affirm the contractual nature of this issue: the need for clear and publicly stated values and principles, for openness and effective accountability, and for systems that we can both manage and have real confidence in. In that way, we can make full use of the benefits of contemporary communications and information systems, thereby strengthening the capacity of public services to deliver good services to the people and strengthen our common life in our society.</p>

I wish to say how much I agree with the powerful points that he made.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09040250000101"></a>As the contributions to the debate have already shown, all sides of your Lordships&#146; House are well versed in and understand the argument that the collection and retention of personal data are necessary for the efficient running of public services, and to aid our security services and the police in the fight against terrorism and serious organised crime. However, as has also been said, unchecked this justification is leading to an exponential increase in the amount of personal information that is collected, retained and accessed by all manner of different bodies. The Information Commissioner has said that personal information has become the &#147;lifeblood&#148; of government and business, and that is certainly the case, but it is also true that this can be tolerable only if the information is used properly and intelligently.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09040250000102"></a>My noble friend mentioned the report produced by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust called <I>Database State</I>. It assessed 46 of the UK&#146;s national databases and found that fewer than 15 per cent of them were effective, proportionate and necessary with a proper legal basis for any privacy intrusions. That in itself seems to be quite a statement of the rocky basis on which a lot of present practice now sits. Tellingly, it also found a quarter to be,</p>
<ul><a name="09040250000426"></a>&#147;almost certainly illegal under human rights or data protection law&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09040250000375"></a>because of problems with privacy and effectiveness. These included the National DNA Database and the national identity register. The report recommended that many centralised databases be scrapped or substantially redesigned&#151;again, another point about the basis on which we are operating being rocky.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09040250000103"></a>The Rowntree report is rightly critical of the centralisation of data in the UK. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s conclusions on the report. I agree that some data&#151;I stress &#147;some&#148;&#151;need to be retained and collected. As a shadow Security Minister, I could hardly think otherwise. However, the data have to be stored securely and&#151;the important point&#151;only accessed by legitimate persons for legitimate reasons, under suitable controls and safeguards.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09040250000104"></a>The process must be regulated by law on a detailed basis, not left to the exercise of executive discretion within the far-too-loose regulatory framework of RIPA. In establishing regimes for data collection and retention,  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1191"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1191</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Government have not given due regard to privacy or the need for public trust in three areas: the amount of data collected, how it is retained and how it is used. I fear that they are deservedly running into a high level of suspicion.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09040250000105"></a>I will look at one matter with which the House dealt recently and on which further things should be said. I refer to the potential legislation on communications data. Last week, your Lordships&#146; House considered a statutory instrument that extended the range of communications data that must be retained by service providers, to include details of our internet access, internet e-mails and internet telephony. The Minister&#151;the noble Lord, Lord West&#151;was unable to tell us the meaning of the broad terms that the statutory instrument uses, such as &#147;internet e-mail&#148; and &#147;communications data&#148;, and the extent to which they would cover third-party applications. This is a technical point, but it is important and it affects our freedoms. We need to know the answer to this question and I beg the Minister to address the question of third-party applications.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09040250000106"></a>It is also unclear whether it would be possible to distinguish between the content of a communication and the fact of its occurrence for internet protocols where these pieces of information are contained in the same data stream. This is a technical problem, because in practice, in this kind of data stream, the gap between the so-called envelope and the contents does not exist in the way that it does with other forms of telephony. There is a problem in distinguishing between these things, but it is a distinction on which the Government are relying for their reassurance that people&#146;s rights to privacy over content will not be infringed without a properly processed warrant. If you cannot distinguish between these two things, you cannot protect content and may therefore be invading privacy without a warrant.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09040250000107"></a>This means that we do not know how these regulations, which have now passed into law, will operate in practice. The Government have not been able to satisfy these Benches that last week&#146;s statutory instrument did not create a vehicle through which the interception modernisation programme could be carried into practice without further primary legislation. The draft Queen&#146;s Speech led us to believe that primary legislation would be forthcoming and that the powers contained in the SI would be transposed in a Bill of primary legislation. Instead, the SI has been transposed separately, and against the background of the Home Secretary having cast doubt in a recent speech on the need for primary legislation.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09040250000108"></a>Are we going to get any primary legislation? The Government would do well to come clean on their intentions, since failure to do so obliges one to examine the scenarios that could develop without primary legislation. It is not hard to imagine a scenario&#151;with or without primary legislation&#151;in which, because of the vast quantities of information collected, and an inability to separate communications data from content, it would be argued that access must now be made more efficient by having a centralised database that holds the data in a standardised format. So, without Parliament ever having given its agreement, the Government could then come to hold a vast database of communications. In case the House thinks that I  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1192"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1192</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>am engaging in a flight of fancy, can the Minister confirm the accuracy of reports that a prototype of a centralised database for communications data is under construction? It is vital that he answers this point in his response.</p>

<a name="90402-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09040250000109"></a>If such a central database were to come into existence, it could be interrogated using data-mining technologies, pattern recognition and deep packet inspection. I am aware of the arguments used in justification for this: for instance, that it would increase the chances of successful pre-emption of crime. That may be so, although we do not have proof of this thesis. However, it is clear that there is a counterpart downside: access so easy and so extensive would carry with it a loss of governance and system control. It could get us very near being treated as guilty unless and until proven innocent.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09040250000110"></a>It is not just that legislation in the field of surveillance and data processing does not contain sufficient detail and specificity to allow Parliament to scrutinise the proposed measures effectively. Other noble Lords have made the point that we have seen over the years a constant creeping of surveillance powers. Your Lordships&#146; House will be familiar with the examples of local councils snooping on ordinary people for things such as dog fouling and putting rubbish in the wrong bins. That is why I am very unhappy that during our consideration of the statutory instrument last week the noble Lord, Lord West, said that the other place was &#147;confused&#148; in its consideration of the instrument because it debated access to communications data and not only the retention of those data. Frankly, it is putting it rather kindly to say that he cautioned your Lordships&#146; House against making a similar mistake of confusing data retention and access. It is not your Lordships&#146; House that is confused&#151;you retain data so that you can have access to them. There is little useful distinction to be made between retention and access in practice&#151;the two go hand in hand. Does the noble Lord accept that you cannot separate those two issues so cleanly? You cannot look at one-half of the legislative framework in isolation from the other. If you do, you get exactly what we have seen over past years: a constant creeping of powers of surveillance and a concomitant decline in public trust as legislation is misused against ordinary people.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09040250000111"></a>This is a constant theme in this House. This House is not full of hysterics; it is full of sane, ordinary people of experience and it is concerned about the powers that are being used and developed by the state which can invade the privacy of ordinary individuals without good reason.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09040250000112"></a>As many noble Lords know, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 stands out as an example of these creeping powers. When the Act was passed, local authorities were not included in the list of public authorities that could access communications data. During the passage of the Bill, the then Home Secretary and Minister of State responded to concerns expressed that it would extend the power to a range of public sector bodies, including local authorities, by giving assurances that such powers would not be made available to them. But lo and behold, in 2003 two orders were passed that gave a number of additional public authorities,  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1193"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1193</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>including local authorities, access to communications data and the power to use directed surveillance and covert human intelligence sources.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09040250000113"></a>The then Minister of State said about the previous assurances that had been given:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="09040250000403"></a>&#147;Clearly, if an assurance has been given you like to try and ensure that that assurance is maintained, but ... sometimes there are things that happen two, three, four, five, six years later ... despite the assurance that was made there is a need to change&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09040250000376"></a>In its report, <I>Surveillance: Citizens and the State</I>, the Select Committee on the Constitution concluded,</p>
<ul><a name="09040250000427"></a>&#147;we are concerned lest this reversal set a precedent for future unforeseen policy changes in the field of surveillance&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09040250000377"></a>I have two comments. First, it is hard to see what has so changed in our national life that it is necessary and right to give all 474 local councils in England, every NHS trust and fire service, the Environment Agency, and even the Royal Mail and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society access to communications data or surveillance powers, or how that increases the security of the nation. Secondly, it would be a sad day when the House could no longer place reliance on assurances from Ministers.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09040250000114"></a>It is not surprising that the Rowntree report found that over two-thirds of the population no longer trust the Government with their personal data. How will the Government address this huge deficit in trust? The issue has been accurately described by my noble friend as the creeping subordination of the individual to the state.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09040250000115"></a>I suggest that we need five things. The first is an emphasis on having separate disaggregated databases rather than centralised databases. That is not to say that there should be no information-sharing between different systems and users but&#151;this is the second thing that is needed&#151;there certainly needs to be greater regulation and oversight of the transfer of data. Thirdly&#151;this is related&#151;I would like the role and office of the Information Commissioner greatly enhanced. I welcome the recommendations of the Select Committee on the Constitution that the Government should consult the commissioner at an early stage of policy and legislative development, that he should have a greater role in advising Parliament on surveillance and data issues and that he should help the Government undertake a review of the law governing citizens&#146; consent to the use of their personal data. I suggest that we need greater independence and much greater governance in this whole area.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09040250000116"></a>Fourthly, I would like to see legislation in this field contain sufficient detail to allow Parliament to scrutinise proposed measures effectively. Explanatory Memorandums in this sort of legislation are very important, and they need to be much more helpful to legislators when they are trying to understand and grapple with some of the difficult technical issues which, as I say, have great import for our civil liberties. Here, again, I look to the Minister to confirm whether a prototype of a centralised database for communications data is under consideration. That is the point I referred to earlier, and it is relevant to whether in practice we are going down the road of a centralised database in the area of communications, even if we are not authorised to explicitly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09040250000117"></a>Finally, we need a review of RIPA as soon as possible, and the powers it hands out need to be substantially curtailed. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

He highlighted the importance of the difficulties of data sharing, the need for good management of those data and the balance between data held and the rights and privacy of information for people.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09040250000119"></a>I shall speak mainly on the issue of data where it concerns our children and young people. The quantity of legislation concerning data collection, transfer and use is daunting. I shall start with SI 2006/2601, the Education (Information about Individual Pupils) (England) Regulations 2006. The instrument was made on 21 September 2006, was laid before Parliament on 3 October and came into force on 31 October. It laid a duty on school governing bodies to supply scheduled information within 14 days of a request from the local authority or the Secretary of State. The information for the local authority relates to each child in its schools and consists of their gender, date of birth, unique pupil number, surname, first name, ethnic group, date of admission to the school, first language, year group, usual mode of travel to school, address, details of special educational needs, whether in care, whether eligible for free school meals, education details, whether on the gifted and talented register and absence details. Details on pupils who have been excluded are also required. I wonder whether that is all really necessary.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09040250000120"></a>Within days of these data being transmitted to the local authority, they are forwarded electronically to the Department for Children, Schools and Families. The governing body of a secondary school in Warwickshire wrote to the department expressing its concern about the dangers of holding information about young people on a single database and seeking the reasons for doing so. The department responded with three pages of text, in the course of which there was the following statement:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="09040250000404"></a>&#147;Data is needed at the individual pupil level to ensure that funding is accurately allocated (for example, to ensure pupils are not double counted in instances where pupils are legitimately dually registered at two institutions; or where there are &#145;duplicate pupils&#146;, that is where a pupil has not deregistered from one school on moving to another)&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09040250000378"></a>The cost of compiling and holding records for 11 million youngsters is surely hundreds of times greater than the cost of any dual funding, even if it were not simpler to lay on the local authorities a duty to ensure that double counting did not happen within their jurisdiction.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09040250000121"></a>On 1 September 2007, access to the database was extended to further education institutions, primary care trusts, work-based learning providers, researchers into educational achievement, learning providers registered with the UK register and institutions in higher education. In 2008, the Statistics Board was given access to most of the information on the database, including all personal identification. Have there been any other statutory instruments or manoeuvres used to widen access even further? Do the Government plan to use these data for  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1195"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1195</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>any other purposes, such as allowing potential employers to access them, either to check on applicants or to hunt for possible future staff?</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09040250000122"></a>This database is not the only one that the Government have wasted our money on. A Written Answer in the other place on 22 April 2008, at col. 2028W of <I>Hansard</I>, showed that ContactPoint had so far cost &#163;103 million, with a further &#163;121 million to be spent by March 2010, at an annual running cost of &#163;41 million. ContactPoint has been the subject of much questioning, particularly from Members in another place. It will be able to access national data sources from within the DWP, the DCSF, the Department of Health and the Office for National Statistics and compare fragments of data that are duplicated therein.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09040250000123"></a>On 17 March 2008, the Member for Basingstoke pointed out, at col. 604 of <I>Hansard</I>, that nine other children&#146;s databases feed into ContactPoint, which is maintained by the DCSF in addition to the national children&#146;s database and the Connexions database, which supplies information about children&#146;s choices beyond school. I was concerned about this when we took the Children Bill through in 2004, and my noble friend Lord Northesk spoke at great length about it. At Second Reading, I raised the whole question of data and data processes, saying:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="09040250000405"></a>&#147;Indeed, it appears that we are not to have any influence over the four data processes: the creation, amendment, access and destruction of data held on children. Who will be responsible for setting up each of the databases and the rules governing their operation?&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09040250000379"></a>I asked whether that would be just one national database and, of course, we have found that it is not. I said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="09040250000406"></a>&#147;Who will be allowed to add, amend or delete information? Who will be able to access the information held on the databases and what rules will govern that access? Who will delete the completed records? What rules or anticipated rules will there be? Will they be mandatory or will exceptions be made? More importantly, will young people have access to their own information? What access will families have to the information held on the lists? Is it envisaged that each LEA will have a local data base containing information on each child at the authority&#146;s schools? Will the name of a child coming to the attention of one of the other authorities for a serious reason &#145;go forward&#146; to the national data base?&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09040250000124"></a>These questions have not been answered adequately. I went on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="09040250000407"></a>&#147;Finally, who will ultimately expunge the records, or will they carry on throughout a child&#146;s life into adulthood? These are questions which are certainly not tackled within the Bill. I am not the only one who is frightened that these personal records may be held by the state for time immemorial. This could have real repercussions on jobs, insurance and many other aspects of daily living&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 30/3/04; cols. 1299-1300.]</p>

<p><a name="09040250000125"></a>Will the Minister also tell us whether, following my comments on the Children Bill, any other statutory instruments have had the same effect? What is the Government&#146;s thinking on that?</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09040250000126"></a>Many of these children need help and I am not belittling the need to hold data on children, but surely it has got to the stage of perhaps being disproportionate. I am sure that I am not the only person to criticise the Government for their data collection mania. Deloitte carried out a review of the security of ContactPoint. The Government decided on 13 February 2008 to publish only the executive summary of the Deloitte   


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1196"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1196</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>report, as reported at col. 2635W of <I>Hansard</I> on 5 March 2008, and then decreed that the resultant risk assessment, to be completed by May 2008, would remain unpublished. Why? The Government exist for the defence of the realm. These records held centrally, when taken with the increasing statutory provision for interdepartmental data sharing, will mean that young people who will now be on the database will have every detail of their lives&#151;including place of employment from HMRC, sickness records from their PCT, marriage, car ownership, court appearances, parenting and housing&#151;recorded by the state. We have reached a frightening stage.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09040250000127"></a>I turn to a more recent letter, which the noble Lord sent on 31 March to the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, in response to the 27th report of the Select Committee on the Merits of Statutory Instruments from the 2006-07 Session. The report drew special attention to the draft Children Act 2004 Information Database (England) Regulations 2007. These are very important. Paragraph 8 of the report, which covers the 2006 regulations, says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="09040250000408"></a>&#147;We stressed the concern expressed by some commentators about whether a database covering all children in England was a justified and proportionate response to the need to improve communication among professionals in relation to the smaller (though significant) number of children in need of specialist help&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09040250000128"></a>In paragraph 11, the committee points out that the DCSF&#146;s summary states that there were 256 responses to the consultation, and explains that,</p>
<ul><a name="09040250000428"></a>&#147;approximately one-third of the formal responses came directly from young people and parents. The majority of responses from this group expressed their opposition to the establishment of ContactPoint&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09040250000129"></a>I wonder how much bearing that had on the outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09040250000130"></a>Finally, I turn to comments in paragraph 23, which deal with and are equally clear about the desirability of improving communication between professionals involved in the provision of services for children. The committee was not persuaded that the scheme provided by the regulations was an entirely appropriate approach to that objective. The report says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="09040250000409"></a>&#147;We do not consider that the Government have demonstrated conclusively that a universal database is a proportionate response to the problem being addressed, or that the additional benefits of a universal approach justify the additional costs and risks, as compared with a selective approach which would not include a child in the database unless or until the child&#146;s needs for specialist or targeted services became apparent&#148;.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09040250000131"></a>In the letter that the noble Lord sent to the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, he said that access is restricted to those,</p>
<ul><a name="09040250000429"></a>&#147;who need it as part of their work&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09040250000132"></a>I picked up on this sentence. I asked the Minister to clarify who would need it as part of their work. It seems to be a very open door. The second comment that I want to pick up on is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="09040250000410"></a>&#147;Mechanisms will be in place to prevent trawling&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09040250000133"></a>Perhaps the Minister could tell us more about that. I picked up on two more comments in his response. One was:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="09040250000411"></a>&#147;It is important and appropriate to cover every child in England because any child or young person could require the support of additional services at any time&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09040250000134"></a>I do not belittle that; I agree with it. The letter goes on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="09040250000412"></a>&#147;It is not possible to predict accurately in advance which children will have additional needs&#151; estimates show that 3-4 million children and young people will need additional targeted and specialist services at any one point in time&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09040250000135"></a>What about the others? Finally, I pick up on the comment at the end of the second page:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="09040250000413"></a>&#147;The Department for Children, Schools and Families has consistently made it clear that it will not extend ContactPoint beyond its current phase&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09040250000380"></a>perhaps the noble Lord will tell us what that current phase is&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09040250000414"></a>&#147;until the Department is satisfied that all issues identified in the early stages of implementation are addressed&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09040250000381"></a>I shall listen with interest to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

The point was made that the Government should deal with this assault on the individual by primary legislation. I do not need to say why. My next point is that the Minister has been asked highly important, relevant and critical questions which need an answer. He cannot answer all of them orally today, but they have to be answered. Will he undertake today to send all who speak in this debate a letter answering every single question? I refer not only to the questions of my noble friend but those from the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, and other noble Lords, particularly my noble friend Lady Neville-Jones. This is not a joke. I really mean what I am asking. We must have answers to those questions. We have to know where the Government stand on this. We have no idea at the moment, or, at least, I have no idea.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09040250000137"></a>I should have opened by saying that it is a great privilege to support my noble friend Lord Northesk. As one of the originators in understanding the data protection system, he has studied this matter for years and has always put his knowledge and expertise at the House&#146;s disposal. I am very grateful to him for having done so again today in opening this debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09040250000138"></a>This is not a prepared speech; I came to listen. I agree with every word that the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, said. We usually, but not always, agree. On this occasion, I compliment him on his speech. It was beautifully prepared; he asked some questions; and they have to be answered.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09040250000139"></a>I agree also with every word of the Church&#146;s appreciation of the legal aspect of this matter&#151;I shall come to another legal aspect in a moment which has not been quite touched on. The same goes for the contribution of my noble friend Lady Neville-Jones, who as a former security officer speaks with considerable authority on this matter, certainly as regards primary legislation. I want to say a word of appreciation also for what the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, said. She gave an example of hideous, ridiculous, unacceptable interference with humanity which went right beyond the realms of inconvenience. One owes her a word of gratitude for having brought it to our attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09040250000140"></a>I do not want to take much time. I turn to the legal aspect and the need for primary legislation. We have no domestic privacy law, nor have we ever had. Whether you are for it or against it is quite irrelevant; it is a matter of fact. We accepted into our law the European Convention on Human Rights. I shall not deal with article this and article that, and one thing and another&#151;this is not a legal speech. We accepted the principles of that convention, drafted largely by members of the English Bar, years ago, and they are now used as part of our privacy law.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09040250000141"></a>One has to accept that judges, on the facts and circumstances of each particular case, have to try to interpret those articles as they relate to a case. The judgment in the case of Max Mosley is related only to the facts and circumstances of that case; it is not of general application to all cases. You will find in the context of the problems arising from this question that the courts here will do their best to interpret the impact of the law on the case. Whether and how that will work is at this stage wholly unpredictable. Given that serious point, the Government must now really get down to the business of introducing their own legislation in conformity with the Human Rights Act.</p>

I am sure that the Minister will answer the questions as they have been raised or, even, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, mentioned, write to us if there are any for which there is not time for an immediate answer today.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09040250000143"></a>The crucial issue of freedom versus security has come up time and again. One extreme would be to tag us all so that exactly where we were and everything that we were doing could be known. I am told that mobile phones can nearly do that now: we can be located wherever we are. The other extreme, however, does not really exist, because we are all bound by law and to act within its framework. The problem always is where you draw the line between freedom and security. I shall raise just three concerns today.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09040250000144"></a>Any scheme which limits freedom must be as fair and near-foolproof as possible. Plato spoke of the philosopher kings. Although they might succeed, our society is one of human beings, who make mistakes. We have all, therefore, to take extra special care. When we legislate, especially, we have a tremendous responsibility, because what we do here affects every person within the kingdom.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09040250000145"></a>The Home Office needs to look closely at some of its recent projects, because they raise grave doubts as to its general approach. I have brought up in this House on a number of occasions the problem of the passport personal interview offices. The Home Office website says that 69 offices are up and running, so anybody going for a passport for the first time has now to have a personal interview. But it does not work like that, because there are supposed to be 22 remote-community personal video links, which I do not see as having been established. There are therefore some parts of the country, such as Anglesey and west Sutherland, which has a widely scattered population,  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1199"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1199</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that do not have that facility. The network is not complete. Is it fair for the system to be instated at all when it does not affect everybody in the same way? What are the Government doing to get the passport personal interview network really up and running so that 100 per cent of the people are dealt with in exactly the same way?</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09040250000146"></a>How realistic and effective is this project? I asked about three months ago how many applications there had been. If memory serves me right, about 246,000 personal passport interviews had taken place. That was good; they were going to sieve out those who were not worthy of a British passport. But not one applicant had been refused. I ask the Minister, very sincerely, how effectively the passport personal interview network is proceeding. First, I question whether the passport personal interview offices, as an example of what the Home Office is doing, are really effective. Secondly, any network of information needs to be secure. In March 2009, a memory stick containing information on hundreds of police investigations went missing in Edinburgh. It was not encrypted. In January 2009, a disk containing personal details about 2,000 staff of the British Council was lost. In December 2008, Leeds Council apologised for losing a memory stick containing unencrypted details of 5,000 nursery age children. In September 2008, Ministry of Defence computer files with records of thousands of serving and former RAF staff were stolen. And so it goes on: incidents in Surrey, Lancashire and Glasgow, all in the past six months. Altogether, in the 12 months ending in December 2008, 29 million personal records were lost. Surely the whole system is not fit for purpose.</p>

<a name="90402-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09040250000147"></a>Finally, I turn to the financial priorities. In a time of economic hardship, can we afford some of these new projects? The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, mentioned ID cards. In October 2006, the Home Office gave the cost of their introduction as &#163;5.4 billion, but by May 2008 it had increased by 37 per cent. The total cost now must be in the region of &#163;11 billion to &#163;12 billion. Is this good money given the current economic climate? On 24 March, just a week ago, the Home Secretary said in another place that it would cost &#163;40 million to scrap the scheme. Is &#163;40 million ever well spent? In Wales, we used to say&#151;I am sure that it is said everywhere&#151;that a stitch in time saves nine. To save in this way would be a help in the present economic climate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09040250000148"></a>There are many other grounds for following on the remarks of other noble Lords this afternoon, but on these grounds alone Her Majesty&#146;s Government should sit down and think again about their whole approach to these matters.</p>

It has generated a fascinating debate. Many people have got a lot off their chests and I hope that both Ministers have been listening carefully. In common with other speakers, my noble friend acknowledged that there was a difficult line to be found between the need of the state to protect its citizens and an overenthusiastic embracement of  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1200"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1200</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>technological developments to keep vast amounts of data on them. Each speaker has acknowledged that there is a role for some data collection but that it probably needs to be selective rather than generalised.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09040250000150"></a>It is becoming an increasingly perplexed issue, and one which exercises anyone who has any role to play in ensuring that the state&#146;s powers are not allowed, even with good intentions, to stray over the line of legitimate, but controlled, intervention in unbridled enthusiasm for keeping detailed information about all of us. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford and my noble friend Lady Neville-Jones both raised the question of the need for the public to have confidence in the requirements for the collection of any data. I think we would all agree with that. If the public do not have confidence then the Government have no control at all of what is happening and there is a complete disbelief in the need for what is being done. That is an important issue.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09040250000151"></a>We have had some startling examples recently about the use of information. I find it quite remarkable that the Government have so far been unable to give a solid reply to the European Court of Human Rights judgment that the retention of an innocent person&#146;s DNA or fingerprints is an infringement of their privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This has more than called into question the current situation where DNA and fingerprints taken from people during criminal investigations is then held in perpetuity on the DNA base irrespective of whether they were found to be a continuing part of police inquiries.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09040250000152"></a>The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights accords with the strictures of the Government&#146;s own DNA ethics committee, the Home Affairs Committee of the other place and the Economic Affairs Committee of this House. We have had debates on all those reports. It is quite remarkable to me that the Government so far have refused to budge. Although the noble Lord, Lord West, told the House very recently in responding to a question from me that consideration was being given to the matter, there is apparently no timescale. It is hard to know what is delaying the Home Office&#146;s response. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us where the Government stand on this issue and what they are going to do about implementing the recommendation of all these bodies. All the committees have said that DNA and fingerprint samples of people found to be guilty may be retained, but for a short period; the others should all be destroyed&#151;a short period, not a lifetime.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09040250000153"></a>Unfortunately, there are now far too many examples of the Government finding good reasons for legislating for, or refusing to temper, the increasing propensity for retaining or collecting of data and information on this country&#146;s citizens. We have had endless examples of those today. The shadow Minister for Security, my noble friend Lady Neville-Jones, repeated in her excellent speech her concerns about the latest EU directive, which this Government appear to have enthusiastically supported, that all e-mail and internet traffic should be kept indefinitely so such information can be interrogated at any time to check on the position and the activities of anyone suspected of crime or terrorism. She rightly  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1201"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>exposed the enormity of this proposal when the statutory instrument was introduced last week and she has done so cogently again today. She has also raised the extremely important question as to why this very radical measure has been left to a statutory instrument and has not apparently been brought to Parliament in primary legislation. That may not be correct and primary legislation is to follow, but there is yet no evidence of it. The Minister may be able to reassure us today that this matter is not going to be left just on the basis of a statutory instrument on the EU directive.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09040250000154"></a>We have also heard some discussion on the Government&#146;s intention to introduce identity cards. They have already done so for those obtaining visas to come to this country and have introduced a database on all children born in this country. My noble friend Lady Byford has given very strong reasons for concern about this. The children&#146;s database had its genesis in the report of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, on the tragic Victoria Climbi&#233; case. We understand the enormous concerns that there were about the lack of co-ordination and co-operation among the statutory agencies. Such concerns have, of course, raised their head again. There are, nevertheless, anxieties about the details of every child, whether vulnerable or not, being recorded in a way where state employees have access to them. My noble friend Lady Byford gave a far better exposition on that than I could.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09040250000155"></a>There is an ability within that legislation for some anonymisation of information to be permitted, but it is extremely limited, so that information is available to a great many people and organisations. We all have to question whether it is desirable or necessary that every child in this country should be known or have its name on a database which can be accessed by a lot of people, who may or may not have good intentions.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09040250000156"></a>We can also extend the question of information exchange to the Pr1/4m framework which allows law enforcement information to be shared between some EU member states without similar or proper data protection. This country is not a signatory to the treaty, but the exchange of information has now been extended by the EU to cover all its states. Again, there are probably very good reasons why some information, particularly in the judicial and criminal fields, should be exchangeable, but to have swathes of data on people who have no possible likelihood of being implicated being transferred to other countries and their agencies is very dubious.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09040250000157"></a>Other noble Lords have referred to the Joseph Rowntree report, which I hope all Home Office Ministers have read closely. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, and my noble friend Lady Neville-Jones also drew attention to it. It has been published recently and is another example of a respected organisation raising great anxieties about how data are collected, managed and held by government bodies. The Minister shakes his head in disbelief; I hope that he has read the report, because that is precisely what it does. It has put the known databases into a traffic light system. Red is for those which it believes are likely to be illegal under human rights or data protection law and should be scrapped; amber is for those which it believes may be   


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1202"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>completely unlawful; and there are very few green, which it believes may broadly be in line with the law. That is quite a devastating critique of the database situation.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09040250000158"></a>The report is refreshingly frank about the current situation, but one statement stood out. Recommendation 5 says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="09040250000415"></a>&#147;Citizens should have the right to access most public services anonymously&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09040250000382"></a>That is a maxim with which many of us would agree. I suggest, again, that the report is required reading for everyone in government who is dreaming or thinking of producing yet another database. Is it not a shocking state of affairs that so many authoritative voices should be raised in alarm at the current situation, and still we are left with the Government&#146;s main justification that every matter which has been raised is needed either in the name of security or in the rather amorphous interests of the people of this country?</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09040250000159"></a>It is not only the collection of data which is becoming increasingly offensive; it is also the increasing ability for organisations and IT systems to share that information across a wide front. Of course we are told that it is all sensitively held and subject to password access. However, no one has yet, I believe, done a systematic analysis of whether the holding of such comprehensive details is safe, which it clearly is not; whether it is secure, which it clearly is not; and whether it is justified, which it may not be, in terms of the amount of the useful effect it generates.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09040250000160"></a>The Minister responsible for security has said on many occasions in this House that the DNA database and now the garnering of millions of details of passenger information under the e-borders system can be justified on the grounds of security and criminal investigation alone. That contention is well and truly open to question, particularly where that information is held in perpetuity.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09040250000161"></a>The noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, spoke about the enormity of the requirements for anyone having to provide advance details of travel. The questions raised by the letter in the press were not totally addressed when I asked the Minister about what that information will be and why it will be needed. The question raised by the noble Lady about people providing information if they are going off for a booze cruise, for example, has not been laid to rest.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09040250000162"></a>The questions that need to be asked have largely been asked this afternoon. They relate to the balance of rights between the state and the individual, the length of time for which any data should be held, the proper justification for it being held, the impossibility of an individual being able to have any information about themselves taken off&#151;the expunging of the information about which my noble friends Lady Byford and Lord Campbell of Alloway asked&#151;and any idea whether that individual&#146;s knowledge of what is held on him is sufficient for him to decide to demand its removal. We recently discussed finding a way of getting information on your DNA off the DNA base. It is virtually impossible.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09040250000163"></a>We have learnt recently that immensely powerful cyber systems can be used to hack into any computer program, however well protected, and access any data   


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1203"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1203</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on it. As my noble friend Lord Northesk said, we all know that the Government have a dismal record on holding data securely. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, identified a considerable number of examples which have occurred in the very recent past. It is important that everything that is held is held securely, and that clearly is not being done.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09040250000164"></a>There is a balance to be struck between making sufficient use of the technology involved for good and legitimate purposes and the impact on the preservation of privacy. The evidence gathered so far, and the appalled reaction of those who have reported on this country&#146;s current position, should lead us to keep asking more and more questions about what is going on and to get sensible and responsive answers.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09040250000165"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford rightly asked for proper guidance for the use and sharing of data. While he was largely in favour of the collection of some data, he quite rightly stressed the need for transparency and manageability and a recognition of the need for confidence in the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09040250000167"></a>A great many serious questions have been asked today. My noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway has asked for written answers if the Minister is not able to answer the questions he raised today. I have some sympathy with the Minister if he cannot answer them now, but I hope that he will agree that some of them, at least, justify written responses and will see that that is done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09040250000168"></a>My noble friend Lord Campbell also drew attention to the fact that we have no privacy laws. Perhaps it is time we did to protect us from intrusive interference, however good the reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09040250000169"></a>We need a far more robust and honest debate between the Government and the citizens of this country about what is being done in their name. The subordination of the citizens of the state must not happen by default. Today&#146;s debate is a mini-start in that direction. I hope that it will and can be extended before any further &#147;good ideas&#148; are invented to protect us from harm.</p>

It has been clear, from the serious way in which the debate has been conducted, that this is a very important subject. One of the most important points that the noble Earl made was in not wanting the debate to become party-political grandstanding. By and large, noble Lords have achieved that end; toward the end of the debate, great efforts were made by those who are normally used to such grandstanding to resist the temptation. Those attempts were not always successful, but the conduct of this debate has, by and large, been a credit to the House and I pay credit to the noble Earl for his interest and expertise in the subject. I hope to be able to provide the House with some reassurances on the Government&#146;s position on, and action in, this area.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09040250000173"></a>The Government believe&#151;as does the House, from my general impression&#151;that the use of personal data is essential to delivering efficient and effective joined-up public services: first, to tackle crime; secondly, to protect the public, and, thirdly and importantly, to help people get access to the benefits to which they are entitled, to new opportunities in their lives, and to developments and support. We want to create services that improve people&#146;s lives and are simple and easy for them to use. Huge advances in technology make that more possible but, as the noble Baroness said when starting her speech, it is essential to balance the provision of better services with the proper respect for individual privacy in a free society. That balance is, we believe, maintained by a strong legislative framework that is already in place; namely, by the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09040250000174"></a>I shall set out the Government&#146;s view in this area. We all have an interest in data being held securely and properly used. The shared interest is in delivering the improved public services that we want and the public are right to expect. The secure, co-ordinated and responsible use of personal data brings real advantages for individuals, public services and the UK economy as well as in crime prevention. Every crime prevented adds to the freedom of those who are not offended against. People want and expect efficient and joined-up services from Government; in order to deliver them effectively and efficiently, it is essential to share information between different parts of Government and with private organisations.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09040250000175"></a>As my right honourable friend the Home Secretary commented in her recent speech on protecting rights and society:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="09040250000416"></a>&#147;Do we, today, live in what critics call a surveillance society? I don&#146;t believe so, not for one moment. But I welcome the debate ... We are&#151;all of us, as citizens, consumers, businesses and Government&#151;now presented with a host of new ways to capture, analyse and use data. And there are clear benefits&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09040250000383"></a>I offer a few examples of those benefits to the House. The NHS national programme of IT is delivering front-line systems and services&#151;to provide major benefits for patients, staff and NHS organisations&#151;and system reform. It is providing essential services to support patient care and the smooth running of the NHS, which could not now properly function without it. There are also services such as: the NHS care records   


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1205"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>service; a picture archiving and communications system, which makes X-ray accessible by computer; electronic transmission of prescriptions from GPs to pharmacies, and electronic booking of first outpatient appointments at the time of referral at GP surgeries, which incorporates patient choice.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09040250000176"></a>I noticed that those programmes have not been mentioned or attacked today, but one that has, which surprised me, is ContactPoint. That is of considerable importance and interest. I ask the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham: what is her party&#146;s real policy on it? The Department for Children, Schools and Families is rolling out ContactPoint, whose first phase of implementation to local authorities started on 26 January. It is one of those databases that the Rowntree trust report considered to be almost certainly illegal&#151;an astonishing judgment in a supposedly respectable academic report. I shall say more on Rowntree in a bit.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09040250000177"></a>The ContactPoint system helps to improve services to children with a strong emphasis on early intervention and prevention. Practitioners can spend days trying to find out who else is working with the same child, or unknowingly duplicating work that another service is already carrying out. There are 11 million children and young people in England; at any one time, around 30 per cent of children require specialist service of some sort while up to 50 per cent will have additional needs at some point during their childhood. We cannot predict which, or when. ContactPoint, which I do not know whether the party opposite supports, will enable the delivery of co-ordinated support for those children and young people. The schemes I have mentioned are delivering a service to the public.</p>

<a name="90402-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09040250000178"></a>On ContactPoint, there were many questions asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, including: who will use it? Its use will be restricted, and strictly limited to those who need it as part of their work. Authorised users will include those working in health, education, youth justice, social care and voluntary organisations, to help ensure more co-ordinated service provision for children and young people. It will not be used by a hugely wide section of the population, but by those who need it in order to help children. Another question posed was: what happens to a record when a young person turns 18? The system&#146;s supplier, known as Capgemini, has automated transfer of data beyond 18&#151;the age when it ends&#151;into the archive. We are told that is for six years, in line with the limitations act, and then destroyed. There is a facility for some young adults&#146; records to stay on ContactPoint until they are 25, but only for limited reasons and with explicit consent.</p>

I am going on to say&#151;because the noble Baroness asked a very good question&#151;what power the children themselves have in relation to seeing their records. They have the power to do that under the general power that there is for people to see how their records are accessed. So that is something that she need not worry about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09040250000181"></a>The criticism of ContactPoint, which will hold a very small amount of detail on individual children, is surprising. I can cite in aid of ContactPoint a whole number of organisations which this House respects hugely in the field of children, from Barnardo&#146;s to the NSPCC and other organisations&#151;including KIDS, which looks after disabled children particularly&#151;which think that this is an excellent database and that it will help. Most particularly, our colleague the noble Lord, Lord Laming, in his recent report, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="09040250000417"></a>&#147;There are definite advantages to electronic record keeping in place of the previous often inaccessible paper files. Technology offers the potential for professionals to share information more effectively, to make information more accessible, and to use systems to manage the workflow of children&#146;s services. The new ContactPoint system will have particular advantages in reducing the possibility of children for whom there are concerns going unnoticed&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09040250000384"></a>If the noble Lord, Lord Laming, is speaking so highly of it, perhaps this House should speak more highly of it.</p>

It is the universality that perhaps the Minister could address his remarks to, not the specific. That is where the whole of this debate seems to have gone&#151;on the balance between the universality and the specific.</p>

It is the universality of it that is its virtue here. If it is not to be universal, how is it to be limited and restricted? Maybe we will hear in due course what proposals the Official Opposition have in regard to ContactPoint. Listening carefully to the noble Baroness, I got the impression that they were opposed to it; if they are not, perhaps she will be good enough to say so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09040250000184"></a>Having mentioned ContactPoint, I move on to DNA, which again was the subject&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="09040250000418"></a>&#147;It should be noted that risk can only be managed, not eliminated, and therefore there will always be a risk of data security incidents occurring&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09040250000187"></a>DNA was also mentioned in the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham. I hope that the House would agree that the use of DNA in investigations is

No one disputes that taking and using DNA to detect crime and help bring offenders to justice must remain a key tool available to the police. It is crucial to public protection. The application of DNA profiling to crime detection has shown enormous results. Between May 2001 and December 2005 there were approximately 200,000 DNA profiles on the National DNA Database which would previously have had to be removed before legislation was passed in 2001 because the person was acquitted or charges dropped. Of these 200,000 profiles, approximately 8,500 profiles from some 6,290 individuals have been linked with crime-scene profiles, involving nearly 14,000 offences. These include 114 murders, 55 attempted murders, 116 rapes, 68 sexual offences, 119 aggravated burglaries and 127 of the supply of controlled drugs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09040250000188"></a>Is anyone seriously suggesting that that information and any resulting arrests that there may be are not of benefit to the public in this country? Research carried out in 2005 estimated that sampling persons who were arrested but not charged between April 2004 and December 2005 yielded a match with a crime scene in more than 3,000 offences, including 37 murders, 16 attempted murders and 90 rapes. These are serious crimes which have a major impact on victims and their families and friends and on local neighbourhoods and communities where the crimes occur. It impacts on the wider public confidence, too. It is the Government&#146;s job to do what we can to ensure that those criminals are brought to book.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09040250000194"></a>My argument is in favour of DNA. Now I have to face the fact that the current policy for retaining DNA of persons arrested but not convicted needs to be changed&#151;the noble Baroness is right that it does&#151;to comply with the European Court of Human Rights judgment. We have made it clear that we will implement the judgment of the court. The court found that our blanket policy of retaining the fingerprints and DNA of people who had been arrested and not convicted, but against whom no further action was   


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1208"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>taken, was in breach of Article 8. However, the court did indicate&#151;and it is important to point this out&#151;that it agrees with us that the retention of fingerprint and DNA data,</p>
<ul><a name="09040250000430"></a>&#147;pursues the legitimate purpose of the detection and therefore prevention of crime&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09040250000386"></a>That is a key point in the judgment and reflects the recognition by the court of the importance of DNA in fingerprints and in helping to detect offenders and bring them to justice. However, the judgment recognises that other jurisdictions do not apply a blanket destruction order to biometric data of those arrested and not convicted, and recognises the need for an approach which discriminates between different categories of offending and defined periods of storage. That is why my right honourable friend the Home Secretary on 16 December said that she would be examining ways in which the retention of samples and fingerprints will be considered, taking into account factors such as age, risk and the nature of the offences involved. Those will be set out in a forensics White Paper to be published this year.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09040250000195"></a>In the brief time I have left I shall deal first with Rowntree and then with some of noble Lords&#146; questions.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09040250000196"></a>As far as Rowntree is concerned, the Government believe that the Data Protection Act 1998 is an effective and proper implementation of the relevant directive. It does not seem as though Rowntree thought so. We take our obligations under the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act very seriously and we agree that collection, use and sharing of personal information must be lawful and proportionate, but we do not accept that the databases are illegal as the report suggests. With great respect to its authors, I must say that the report appears to confuse political and legal issues. Privacy is important, but there is also a public interest in maintaining databases. They ensure, as I said, better delivery of public services and can be vital in detecting and preventing crime. Interestingly enough, the DNA database is one of those that have a red traffic light against them in this report.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09040250000197"></a>I hope that I am not being unfair to its authors when I say that the report appears to be very much headline without any argument or analysis in each of the 46 cases that it looks at. It is not clear how the authors have made their assessments. How, for example, is the Office for National Statistics, which the noble Earl mentioned in his opening remarks, rated as amber? This is a non-ministerial department, not a database. The inclusion seems to be based on the fact that the ONS will run the forthcoming census in 2011. How are Directgov and the Government Gateway assessed as amber? The authors readily state that these are portals rather than databases and the report notes that they do not hold personal data. Local government&#146;s use of CCTV is rated as amber. Again, there is no database, but the amber light is based on the fact that CCTV is an overinvestment. I am not sure that that view will be held widely by the general public, who regard CCTV as a protection for them rather than, as the authors of this report seem to suggest, something against their interests.</p>

However, I ask noble Lords, if they have not already done so, to read the article by David Aaronovitch in the <I>Times</I> the day after the report came out. He made a very good point. He said that it was a pity that among the authors of the report there were no people who disagreed with the basic principle that databases were a bad thing. I have had my say on that now; I have been given the opportunity to do so twice. If the noble Baroness and others will pray this in aid every time we have a debate of this kind, I recommend that they consider whether it is really such a great work of academic brilliance that they can rely on its judgments in the arguments that they bring to the general public.</p>

I wrote to her after her helpful question when I was answering an Oral Question last week. I wrote to her as quickly as I possibly could, as I did to the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, who I see is in her place, on the matters that appeared in the <I>Telegraph</I> article to which she referred.

Since the pilot started, e-Borders has screened over 82 million passenger movements in and out of the UK against immigration, customs and police watch lists. That has led to over 3,000 arrests for crimes, including serious offences such as murder, rape and assault. It has led to significant counterterrorist interventions as well, which we obviously cannot hear more about, and has resulted in fraudulently used British passports being impounded and the confiscation of drugs and tobacco.

Is it seriously being suggested that, in the world in which we live, we should just forget all that and use the easy phrase &#147;surveillance state&#148;? I do not think so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09040250000206"></a>The right reverend Prelate made a point about affirming our commitment to the Data Protection Act. I do that happily today. It also shows itself in the Cabinet Office review and our response to the Walport/Thomas review. He also asked whether we would implement the recommendation of the <I>Data Sharing Review Report</I> for a code of practice on data sharing. Yes, I can tell him that it is set out in Clause 157 of the Coroners and Justice Bill, which the House will enjoy debating, starting with Second Reading on 27 April. I look forward to his support in those debates.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09040250000207"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, as always, put some interesting questions about primary legislation, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, who asked whether primary legislation should be used for data-sharing gateways in preference to secondary legislation. Already, a large number of data-sharing gateways are enacted in primary legislation. It is our policy that, for significant data-sharing powers, primary legislation remains appropriate. The noble Lord acknowledged that data-sharing powers cover a diverse spectrum. It is appropriate, provided that they are used properly, that a variety of legislative measures should be used to enact them. Not everything should be done by primary legislation.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09040250000208"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones. and the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, asked about government databases removing personal data from their archives when the information is not necessary any more. I have been advised that the third data protection principle of the Data Protection Act 1998 already provides that data can be legitimately processed only where they are not excessive. Thus, there is an existing obligation on all data controllers, including the Government, not to process information that is unnecessary.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09040250000209"></a>A number of noble Lords were interested in the important topic of why central databases are used instead of local ones. Neither the Data Protection Act nor the data protection directive before it explicitly makes any requirement in relation to local or central databases. The legislation requires that data processed must not be excessive. It is therefore the obligation on each data controller to consider what scale of data is necessary for the purposes of the database. National systems sometimes offer greater benefits in this age of greater mobility where citizens can access services across many boundaries and borders. Maybe there is not just one answer to that question.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09040250000210"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, was concerned that I answer in particular her question whether there is a prototype for the central database.  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1211"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1211</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>There has been, we believe, widespread misrepresentation of our plans for future communications data retention. We will set out the future plans in a consultation document to be published shortly. Since those plans have not been finalised, I cannot say that there will be a prototype, as plans will be confirmed only after the consultation. We have not commented on reports of a central database for communications data and, I repeat, our plans will be outlined shortly in the consultation.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09040250000211"></a>I have spoken for half an hour now, as noble Lords were generous in not speaking for the fully allotted time. I thank noble Lords very much for what they said in this important debate. It is important that we should exchange these ideas across the Floor of the House, even if sometimes in quite a robust way.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09040250000212"></a>The Government&#146;s ability to deliver and improve the public service changes that we want&#151;to fight crime and to protect citizens&#151;relies on strong public confidence in the ability of public and private organisations to handle personal information securely and effectively. That point has been made by Members from around the House and it is obviously true. We have implemented a range a different measures to improve trust in the arrangements to protect personal data. I hope that I have begun to show, if not completely to the satisfaction of all Members, that both in our legislation and in our reviews of working practices we are committed to a legal framework and culture that instil confidence in every citizen in the protection of their personal data, a confidence to which they are entitled. I am grateful to the noble Earl for introducing this debate.</p>

I genuinely enjoyed all the contributions, including that of the Minister, although I am perhaps a little disappointed that, in relation to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report, he may have resorted to shooting the messenger because of dissatisfaction with the message.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09040250000214"></a>As the debate has progressed, two specific themes seem to have emerged. First, the debate has articulated the deep anxiety and uncertainty that inform the perceptions of so many of your Lordships&#151;and of the wider public&#151;about the Government&#146;s data management agenda. Secondly, other than with the Minister, it appears to have engendered a broad consensus on the proposition that, in this field, less is more. As the right reverend Prelate observed, there are good reasons why the Government may be well advised to be a little less ambitious and a little less grandiose with this database agenda.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09040250000215"></a>For myself, I am none the wiser as to why the Government continue to favour the most invasive and expensive technological solutions when less invasive and less costly alternatives are readily available. I have no doubt that we will return to these matters in innumerable debates in the future and, no doubt to the Minister&#146;s disappointment, the JRF report and, I suspect, other like-minded texts will be prayed in aid in those debates. In the mean time I beg leave to withdraw the Motion.</p>

Areas of our cultural industries are under threat. It is imperative that we address these threats and bring all the creative industries&#146; future viability to the forefront of political debate.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09040250000217"></a>You may be wondering why I, someone who makes a living from live theatre, would initiate such a debate. While I am incredibly lucky that my life, my passion and my main source of income&#151;musical theatre&#151;is not affected by the problems afflicting other creative businesses, I see those problems damaging the cultural and economic fabric of the nation, and it worries me.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09040250000218"></a>I was further moved to initiate this debate after a conversation I had a few weeks ago with one of Britain&#146;s leading orchestral players. He was agonising about whether to deter one of his children from following in his footsteps. His reason was that the backbone of the livelihood of many professional instrumentalists is film score work. He could foresee a situation in a decade&#146;s time when there would be virtually no orchestral film work. Illegal downloading would so decimate the film industry that orchestral recording sessions would be a thing of the past. In this connection I was reminded that three of London&#146;s main orchestral recording studios have closed since 2000.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09040250000219"></a>I hope, therefore, that I am speaking here on behalf of my many colleagues whose livelihoods and their children&#146;s future livelihoods are being compromised by inaction. I do not come equipped with the answers; frankly, they are way beyond my world of musical theatre. My sole objective is to draw noble Lords&#146; attention to the cataclysmic consequences for all the creative industries if this area remains unregulated.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09040250000220"></a>The economic sustainability of Britain&#146;s creative industries is hugely important to this country, culturally and commercially. It is estimated that our creative industries&#151;film, music, literature, games, TV, software, books and printed media&#151;have an economic output of at least &#163;60 billion, equivalent to over 7 per cent of UK GDP.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09040250000221"></a>It is also important&#151;in terms of employment and the hope they give to aspiring, usually young, men and women&#151;that there are businesses in this country that can employ artists and invest in developing their talents.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09040250000222"></a>It is estimated that creative industries directly account for 1 million jobs, with a further 800,000 in related sectors. The interim <I>Digital Britain</I> report notes that,</p>
<ul><a name="09040250000431"></a>&#147;the digital economy underpins our whole economy and builds our national competitiveness&#148;.</ul>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09040250000223"></a>The question that occurs to me is whether, in 10 years&#146; time, Britain will be a place from which, say, the Beatles could have emerged. Will Britain be a fertile environment for all creative talent? Will Britain be a place where music, TV, film, games and publishing companies are sufficiently healthy to invest in British creative talent and take it to the rest of the world? No, not when there are no longer shops selling the physical products and when the internet has become a sort of Somalia of unregulated theft and piracy.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09040250000224"></a>This is as much a battle against mindsets as against anything else. There are many people who like taking things for free from the internet, even though it is not legal. The fact that something is easy, and many people do it, has confused commentators and politicians alike. Content on the internet is a problematic issue for regulators because the matters are technologically and legally extremely complex, and also, in a period running up to an election, politically problematic. But, as we have seen throughout history, and recently in the financial markets, there are dire consequences when people drift down the path of unregulated behaviour.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09040250000225"></a>With the exception of live entertainment, all our creative industries are suffering, but none more so than the music business. It is in the forefront of the battle and the first example of what can happen to an industry whose survival relies on the protection of its intellectual property rights.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09040250000226"></a>The UK recorded music business is a major contributor to Britain&#146;s creative economy. I would like to share with noble Lords some astonishing figures to illustrate this. In 2008 the UK recorded music market was valued at &#163;900 million in trade terms. The UK music business punches well above its weight globally. It is a major exporter&#151;four out of the top 10 global selling albums in 2008 were British. It is a major employer creating more than 100,000 jobs, but the market is being decimated by the impact of online copyright infringement. Recorded music revenue in the UK has fallen every year since 2003. In Europe as a whole the recorded music business is 60 per cent the size it was in 2001.</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09040250000227"></a>It is estimated that 7.3 million people in the United Kingdom&#151;28 per cent of the online population&#151;are now engaged in illegal peer-to-peer file-sharing, a figure which is projected to rise to 8.7 million by 2012 if action is not taken. This activity erodes the commercial value of the UK&#146;s world-renowned music sector. It is calculated that &#163;180 million of losses were directly attributable to online copyright infringement in 2008 alone. The losses for the six-year period from 2007 to 2012 are projected to exceed &#163;1.2 billion. As I am sure noble Lords will appreciate, such levels of loss are unsustainable. It is estimated that online film and music piracy could cost 30,000 UK jobs, and that does not take into account the performers and composers who will lose their livelihood and stop creating as a result. The biggest single cause of the music business&#146;s demise, and indeed that of all creative industries, is the carriage of file-sharing services by internet service providers.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1214"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90402-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09040250000228"></a>Globally only one in 20 tracks which are downloaded from the internet are paid for&#151;that is, a 95 per cent online piracy rate. Innovative business models, of which there are numerous examples which enable consumers to access legally any music they want, have to compete with the free providers, an unfair battle and an unwinnable one. The music business&#151;because of the universal popularity of music, its ease of access and its relatively low bandwidth requirements&#151;will be the first to fall, but other cultural industries will surely follow. Will it be film next?</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09040250000229"></a>No one questions that improving the capability and quality of the UK's digital networks is an essential task. The improvement of fixed, cable, mobile and broadcast transmission mechanisms is crucial if the provision of digital services is to keep pace with what users, be they individual consumers or businesses, expect and demand. Our broadband industry is hugely important to Britain and will be the backbone to society as well as to commerce, but what will it deliver?</p>

<a name="90402-0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09040250000230"></a>Given that consumer demand for faster digital networks is largely driven by demand for quality content, in particular creative content&#151;music, films, games, television, journalism, books&#151;I believe that it would be a serious mistake to invest billions of pounds in faster networks without ensuring that there is a sustainable commercial arrangement for those creative works on which these new networks depend. At the moment, no such sustainable commercial arrangements exist. As their businesses increasingly move to digital consumption, the ability of UK creative businesses to continue to invest billions of pounds every year in creating and marketing new high quality content is constantly being eroded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09040250000231"></a>The railway and roads opened up the first Industrial Revolution. Broadband and the internet are opening up the next one. Our internet service providers deliver excellent facilities that help so many people in so many ways. But we need to remember that one of the principal reasons for their popularity is that they search out information and creative content that people want. If internet service providers continually attract people to illegal sites, as they do now, and not to legitimate sources of content, then they are part of the problem, not part of the solution. These companies make billions in profits. In 2007, just one internet service provider made profits of &#163;5.78 billion. That compares with the recorded music business's turnover in the UK which, as I mentioned, was &#163;900 million. And yet these companies contribute nothing to the creative economies that they feed off and undermine. Forty per cent of their sales come from broadband and IT services, and P2P traffic is believed to account for an astonishing 60 per cent of all traffic on online networks.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09040250000232"></a>Internet service providers can help themselves: they are able to control bandwidth traffic when it suits them. They are not going to change without regulation, otherwise the good players could lose customers to the bad players; but I wonder how long this can be tolerated.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09040250000233"></a>People have got into the habit of talking glibly about &#147;content providers&#148; as if they are some sort of optional part of the process. The great wines of France are not content providers to the glass manufacturing

They are the experiences that bring consumers to the internet in the first place and they can only survive in a safe internet world. Lawlessness is not a model for any society and it cannot be a model for our digital future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09040250000234"></a>The cultural &#147;free lunch&#148; is not free because film, music, printed media and so on cannot be produced, marketed and distributed for nothing. Investment must be rewarded and performers, composers and authors must be paid. Otherwise how can they survive?</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09040250000235"></a>It is important to remember as well that pirates are bandwidth hogs who reduce the quality of service and raise costs to legal users. Illegal file-sharing spreads viruses and inappropriate, and unexpected, content for minors. There are even dire predictions that the internet will grind to a halt over the next few years. Dealing with piracy removes that threat.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09040250000236"></a>Through various reviews, notably the Gowers review in December 2006, <I>Creative Britain</I> in February 2008 and the July 2008 consultation on file-sharing, I have been very encouraged by the Government's stated determination to act. The interim <I>Digital Britain</I> report gives life to that commitment and to the prospect of legislative action. However, I wish to raise the question of whether we are giving this crucial issue enough prominence and whether we are creating an outcome that is in the interests of a section of the economy where Britain leads the world and has the precious chance to create new jobs and new world-beating content for the future.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09040250000237"></a>As I said, I do not have the answers. But I do have serious concerns as to whether the actions proposed to date will achieve the Government's aim, stated in July 2008, of reducing unlawful file-sharing by 70 to 80 per cent over two to three years. The Government would appear to be willing the ends but not the means. Proposing to legislate to require ISPs merely to write to infringers and leave rights-holders with the near impossible, deeply expensive and hugely unpopular task of suing those who persist is simply not going to produce the required deterrent effect. Internet service providers need to be made to do more to play their part in tackling infringement taking place on their networks.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09040250000238"></a>It should also concern government because fairly monetising the demand for creative works in digital form represents a key opportunity to generate revenue that can help to repay substantial investment in new digital infrastructure. If the regulatory response is right then massive value can be derived by internet service providers from legal services and there will be an incentive to invest. Notwithstanding government's repeated calls to industry to adopt new business models, government must accept that taking valuable content for free is not a business model. It creates no value. Only if illegal downloading is properly addressed can new business models have the room to breathe and succeed.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09040250000239"></a>As I said, I do not in any way oppose the laudable aim of improving networks. But next-generation networks need to be not just faster but smarter and safer, and they must work better as an ecosystem that allows

The music industry in particular has been profoundly affected. Music can be more easily recorded, distributed, discovered and consumed. As a result, more music is listened to than ever before, but less is paid for.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09040250000242"></a>We must be honest: the music industry has been slower than most to reinvent itself, both to take advantage of new opportunities for discovering talent and for better serving consumers and businesses, and to adjust and respond to unavoidable new realities. Piracy is certainly, therefore, not the only reason for the music industry's travails over the past decade, but it certainly does matter and it certainly should not be tolerated, for, quite simply, it is theft.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09040250000243"></a>Intellectual or creative products available digitally have to be invented, designed, conformed and invested in, just like physical products. Individuals and companies involved in making music are entitled to a fair return for their risk and for their labour. Stealing music in digital form is just as immoral as stealing a CD from Tesco. When high-speed broadband becomes the norm, as the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd-Webber, suggested, it will also be easier and easier to steal high-quality video and film, with potentially severe consequences for the film and television industries more widely.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09040250000244"></a>Crime of all kinds in the online world&#151;not just copyright theft&#151;is burgeoning. Child pornography is multiplying; phishing trickery is rife; sophisticated high-tech online fraud is growing; personal computers are infiltrated remotely to steal personal data; and mass attacks are organised on major online entities and governmental bodies. Governments need to bring order to this lawless environment rapidly if serious damage to society and to the economy is to be avoided and if a moral relativism is not to become entrenched.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09040250000245"></a>Internet service providers&#151;ISPs&#151;control access to the digital highway for content providers and for consumers alike. ISPs have the technical capability of blocking access to unlawful sites and of detecting illegal activity by consumers and by organised criminal networks. ISPs should be regulated and licensed. I can see why, at the moment, any individual ISP is not volunteering to police the internet. It would be costly, it would deter customers, and there would be few rewards for going first. However, if helping to counter

I accept that it would be disproportionate as well as expensive to criminalise all copyright theft by individuals, but we have introduced perfectly effective mechanisms for pursuing people who do not pay their TV licences or who park illegally. An internet regulator could enforce an appropriate regime for tackling online crime and place obligations on ISPs to assist it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09040250000246"></a>Those issues are global but the creative industries in the UK are not just a jewel in our cultural crown but, as the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd-Webber, suggested, a high-performing part of our economy, particularly in London and the south-east, where it is the second sector, after business services, and a vital part of our national wealth-creating capacity and of the tax base for the whole of the UK. It is now time for the Government to be bold and to offer full and proper protection for the music and other content-producing industries in the UK.</p>

As he has so clearly highlighted, Britain's creative industry contributes a remarkable amount to our culture and our economy. To sit back and do nothing while online piracy sucks the profitability out of such a productive sector at any time would clearly be irresponsible, even more so during the current disastrous economic situation. However, I am optimistic that there is an answer, and it lies in empowering the private sector to do what it does best, innovate.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09040250000248"></a>Recent months have seen a new provider burst on to the scene, offering a novel, perfectly legitimate way for people to listen to music that they do not want to buy. I am talking, of course, about Spotify, where in exchange for listening to the occasional advertisement interspersed through the playlist, users have access to an enormous library for free. As networks become faster and more reliable, as portable devices capable of maintaining a cheap and constant link to the internet become more common, services such as this can only become more popular.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09040250000249"></a>Those creating the music have also found ways to reduce their losses. In October 2007, Radiohead released the album &#147;In Rainbows&#148;<I></I>online, asking only for whatever those downloading it chose to pay. A third of those taking advantage of this offer paid nothing at all but, importantly, two-thirds paid and the average was about &#163;4, chosen, it appears, partly because that is what the public believe an artist generally receives from the sale of a CD through more traditional channels. It clearly is<I></I>possible to charge for music despite the availability of a free illegal version.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09040250000250"></a>So perhaps we are not looking at an outbreak of criminality among the online population; perhaps it is merely that the internet has given them the opportunity to move on from an out-of-date system, where large companies take the huge majority of the revenue leaving the creative talent with pennies. People who

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09040250000251"></a>Of course, Radiohead is an established band, with a brand and a fan base of sufficient size to dispense with the support of a record label which a marketing department can provide. But online-only production is not confined to the big names. There is a rash of small independent websites offering online-only music sales from little known bands. The internet represents an enormous opportunity for creative types who are unable to find a record label willing to give them a contract to reach out and find a market for themselves. It is not just music. There are websites available for people to invest in independent films. People can pay to receive blog updates, software improvements, games, anything that anyone with a creative bent is able to develop and put up on the internet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09040250000252"></a>The interim <I>Digital Britain</I> report correctly identified the danger that oppressive regulation could prevent the development of new business models. A dynamic investment climate must, of course, seek to protect the intellectual property of those who have spent their time and money on their creations but, above all, it must provide a clear base for the industry to innovate. The Government must take the greatest care that their concern for the lost revenue from illegal file-sharing does not cause them to suffocate the solution. The answer is surely not stringent penalties and regulation, as the public will always be one step ahead of those; it is allowing and supporting the development of a better alternative.</p>

This debate is much more about means than ends. In the context of online copyright piracy or infringement, I am sure that there is general agreement in the House today about our objectives.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09040250000254"></a>As the Gowers report, referred to by a number of noble Lords, which reported in 2006, and the interim <I>Digital Britain</I> report acknowledged, knowledge or creative capital in this country is increasingly important. The creative industries in the UK form a higher proportion of GDP than in the US, Canada, France or Australia. Of course, the creative industries have been growing significantly faster than other sectors in this country.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09040250000255"></a>One of the biggest threats to that growth and, indeed, further investment in creative industries is copyright infringement. All the evidence, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd-Webber, is that with higher speeds and greater penetration of broadband, piracy is growing. The loss to rights owners could represent at least half a billion pounds a year in royalties, if the Ipsos figures are correct&#151;they have been referred to in a number of subsequent reports&#151;and the loss is probably split at present between audio-visual and music rights holders. Many people say that that figure is an underestimate.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09040250000256"></a>The Gowers report made a number of recommendations. Even though the monsters of Napster, Grokster and Kazam may have been slain, Napster as  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1219"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1219</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>long ago as 2001, new threats constantly emerge. Just this week I was reading about the Scribd website, which allows copyright books to be downloaded. On these Benches, we are very strong defenders of intellectual property rights. We have strongly supported the proposition that good copyright protection is vital for the encouragement of creativity. My honourable friend Vince Cable promoted a Private Member&#146;s Bill in 2001, which became the Copyright, etc. and Trade Marks (Offences and Enforcement) Act 2002. It increased the maximum penalty for copyright theft to 10 years&#146; imprisonment.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09040250000257"></a>The Gowers report pointed out in 2006, however, that there can be a tension between the data protection obligations of the ISPs and the desirability of protecting the copyright of rights holders. The problem is whether or not we expect ISPs to be policemen. The Gowers report recognised the problem of piracy and suggested matching penalties for digital infringement to those for physical infringement, raising the maximum penalties and enabling fast-track litigation. None of those suggestions has yet been implemented. Subsequently there has been consultation by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform on tackling illicit file sharing and the recent government response to that consultation. The <I>Creative Britain</I> report was published in February last year. Last July, the memorandum of understanding between the major ISP and rights holders was designed to lead to agreed codes of practice in this area.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09040250000258"></a>More recently, the <I>Digital Britain</I> interim report and the consultation over proposals for a rights agency have seen the light of day. In all of this, although the Government have tried to steer an even course, there is no doubt that views have become very polarised, which makes going forward by consensus extremely difficult. ISPs believe that rights holders are asking them to be copyright policemen, a role which they do not want.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09040250000259"></a>One of the most crucial areas of contention is whether ISPs, once they have given notice to persistent infringers, should be obliged to throttle their broadband service or cut them off. This approach was originally suggested by the Government and is still favoured by President Sarkozy as part of his &#147;three strikes and you&#146;re out&#148; policy, involving setting up a new body in France called Hadopi, and by a number of UK rights holders. The French Government are pressing for amendments to the EU telecoms package as a result. I am as sympathetic as anyone to rights holders, but I do not believe that this is the right approach.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09040250000260"></a>I take some comfort from some very prescient words of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, in a speech some three years ago. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="09040250000419"></a>&#147;In fact some of the anti-piracy policies pursued by different sectoral interests can look remarkably like a continuation of war by other means&#151;hardly an effective strategy for winning the hearts and minds of consumers and citizens&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09040250000387"></a>We should be mindful of that. The BPI and others say that few people believe that the answer lies in suing individual consumers. I agree with that, but a court order should be required to terminate services when inevitably evidence will be somewhat contested in those circumstances.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1220"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1220</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90402-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09040250000261"></a>We broadly agree, therefore, with the Government&#146;s stated approach in the rights agency paper and the response to consultation that a voluntary approach through codes of practice would be preferable. In terms of the first compulsory step of notification by the ISP, all the evidence is that a significant number of infringers, some two-thirds, would change their behaviour once they had been written to by their ISP. As an alternative to penalising individuals and legal enforcement against non-persistent infringers, as Gowers and subsequent reports have said, it is clear that investment in education of the public is vital, together with creating alternative lawful distribution channels. The Culture Media and Sport Select Committee report in 2007 on the new media and the creative industries emphatically agreed with that proposition.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09040250000262"></a>At the weekend I saw a superb example at the Science Museum of what is possible. The Intellectual Property Office and Aardman Animations are collaborating on the mounting of an exhibition, A World of Cracking Ideas. This exhibition, to which I took my 11 year-old son, is inspiring, shows some of the great inventions of our time and stimulates children&#146;s enthusiasm for innovation and creativity; but it also gets the message across about the need to protect intellectual property. It was interesting to see how the exhibition explained the world of music copyright, including VPL, PPL, PRS, MCPS and so on; it was a noble attempt.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09040250000263"></a>We need to combat the idea that copyright infringement is socially acceptable. Having said that, and that I agree with the overall approach of the Government, we have considerable doubts on these Benches about the rights agency proposed in the recent paper. It proposed that the agency should be industry-run, not run by the Government, and that the basis for funding should be a levy on broadband ISPs and users. But the basis for the operation seems to be somewhat flawed. It will not have statutory powers, even if it is responsible for dispute resolution and developments of the codes of practice. It is meant to have a role in standardisation of practice, but again on a non-statutory basis. Bringing together rights holders and others clearly has a role, but why not simply call it a forum? The notion of a rights agency seems somewhat mistaken. The question is rightly raised in the consultation paper: how will a rights agency achieve sufficient authority? It will be with difficulty. The appeal procedures envisaged in the paper are intended to be non-binding, which again is a problem.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09040250000264"></a>There is also the question of how representative of all the different interests the agency would be. Rightly, consumer groups believe that they should be included; but so, too, should others such as visual artists who have important interests to represent and are often ignored in these debates. Is it not essential if the DRA is to be credible that it is properly representative? Ministers rather grandly claim in the proposals that the DRA will,</p>
<ul><a name="09040250000432"></a>&#147;facilitate a change of approach across the whole value chain&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09040250000388"></a>But the bottom line is whether it will reduce infringement and unlawful activity. The proposal is somewhat paradoxical, and I cannot see how the agency could operate without statutory powers.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09040250000265"></a>The educational role of the DRA is valuable, and I am sure that its representative nature will be useful, but at the end of the day, Ofcom will have and retain the power of regulation. A number of noble Lords mentioned the need for new models and innovative ways of exploiting copyright. I take on board the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd-Webber, in that context, but there need to be alternative distribution channels alongside better enforcement and education. We have heard a few examples. For instance, Nokia&#146;s &#147;Comes With Music&#148; service was launched in 2008, followed closely by Sony Ericsson&#146;s Play Now service and, as the noble Lord, Lord Luke, mentioned, Spotify, all of which are examples of how a new music service can happen when it is wholly legal and is provided in co-operation with the rights holders.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09040250000266"></a>The different perspectives on online copyright piracy are difficult to reconcile, but generally we believe that the Government are getting the balance right. It is internationally where we think that greater effort should be made. Many rights are infringed by dedicated sites that move into another jurisdiction when challenged, and there are a number of countries that are seen as safe havens for that kind of activity. Such co-operation is needed not just between ISPs, rights holders, consumers and others but between countries. There is little point in having very effective systems here and finding that rights can be infringed at will by downloading from foreign sites. The Government need to engage in international discussion, debate and co-operation on that subject. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09040250000268"></a>I am sure that the Minister will say how much he too is in agreement with my noble friend. After all, there has been a succession of government announcements over the past few years assuring us how seriously they take illegal file-sharing. Unfortunately, none of the announcements, reviews, consultations, issue papers or discussion papers appears as yet to have made a great deal difference, which is particularly why I sympathise so much with my noble friend.</p>

<a name="90402-0007.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09040250000269"></a>The statistic he gave us that over a quarter of online users illegally share files is startling and disturbing. That the number is growing shows clearly that the Government&#146;s approach is just not working, which is not hugely surprising, since the Government&#146;s approach has been, as my noble friend said, to avoid doing anything&#151;if one does not count the endless consultations, reviews and papers as activity. That the lack of punitive levels of civil damages means that there is no real deterrent to, for example, online piracy was raised in the Gowers review in November 2006. That was consulted on throughout 2007 and then it dropped into oblivion, never to be heard of again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09040250000270"></a>The Government&#146;s failure to act is worrying in itself but, even worse, their constant talk of soon-to-be-announced decisions on regulatory change and their endless consultations of new legislation have unsurprisingly meant a corresponding lack of movement from the industry, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Birt.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09040250000271"></a>My noble friend Lord Luke is quite right to look for the most innovative and effective business models in the private sector, a subject of which he showed extensive knowledge. In such a fast changing environment, everything, from users&#146; habits to technology and the source of desired content, changes at a bewildering speed. It is perhaps asking too much to expect the Government or the regulator to keep up, but the Government must not hold out the hope that a new round of EU legislation or a new initiative to re-train police officers will make a significant difference on the ground. They cannot&#151;and since 100 per cent enforcement would mean the criminalisation of nearly a quarter of our population, we should not pretend that that is what we are looking for.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09040250000272"></a>Instead, we must look to the industry to tempt users away from illegal options and to identify and shut down the worst abusers. Of course, none of that is new. Ministers have said much the same thing in various ministerial statements and press releases. But why is not happening?</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09040250000273"></a>According to the Government, there is already a groundbreaking memorandum of understanding between ISPs and rights holders to address the question of unlawful file-sharing. Despite that, the Government are consulting on setting up another quango, the rights agency, to which the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, referred, to see what else can be done.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09040250000274"></a>What will the rights agency do that Ofcom cannot already try? What new powers will it have to knock heads together within the industry and enforce any agreement that is made? Even worse, the Government are rumoured to be contemplating imposing a tax&#151;yet another tax&#151;on all internet users. What will the new money be spent on? What initiative is poised, ready to make all the difference, if only the funding can be found? The Government always seem to ask us to judge them by the amount of taxpayers&#146; money they have thrown at a perceived problem. The websites of the government bodies involved all have proud statements about the increased government funding that has been spent over the years on combating online piracy. Is it really a lack of funds that is the problem?</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09040250000275"></a>The current difficulties the industry appears to be having in enforcing the memorandum of understanding should not cause us to dismiss self-regulation out of hand as a viable approach. The internet has meant the sudden appearance of many similar and related concerns, all of which are as difficult to solve as each other. We had a debate in this House only a few weeks ago on the dangers facing children using social networking sites, which is another very significant problem and one to which the noble Lord, Lord Birt, referred today.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09040250000276"></a>The impossibility of regulating all content available to minors on sites such as YouTube is similar in many respects to that of identifying and removing all the illegal material available for download. In both situations, the criminals and the victims are frequently based in  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1223"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1223</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>different countries and under different legal regimes. There is a similarly large grey area where it is difficult to identify the targeted material and to separate legitimate and illegitimate behaviour. There is constant rapid change in both the technology used and the methods of using that technology.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09040250000277"></a>In the debate I have just referred to, attention was drawn to the recent establishment of an agreement between 17 social networking firms to improve voluntarily the protection of minors using their sites. It was made easier to report abuse, allowing legitimate users&#151;still the substantial majority of those online&#151;to help enforcement authorities find those who insist on transgressing. Can the Minister assure us that the tools that have been found effective against one crime are being carried over to others?</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09040250000278"></a>Of course, self-regulation can go only so far. Eventually, those seeking to protect their copyright need to rely on clear penalties enforced consistently. There are still many inconsistencies remaining among offences in this country. I know that the Minister is aware of them: there have been, after all, several reviews and consultations on them. Yet, in the past few years, when a criminal justice Bill has passed through this House in every Session, when there have been numerous serious regulatory developments in all sorts of sectors, we have seen nothing to address these inconsistencies.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09040250000279"></a>I urge the Government to concentrate their efforts where they can make a difference. The Government have a wealth of material to work from and must not dither any longer. There are clear and achievable recommendations in the Gowers review, and the later publications, that need to be put into effect.</p>

I think that the speeches have been of quality rather than quantity. There have been very informed contributions, and I mean that as a sincere compliment. The noble Lord, Lord Lloyd-Webber, spoke with great insight on the issues relating to digital piracy and its potential impact on creative talent in the UK. The House is very grateful to him for giving us the chance to talk about this important issue this afternoon.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09040250000281"></a>Let me begin by saying that we regard this as an important topic. It is important to me and it is an issue that David Lammy, as Minister for Intellectual Property and Higher Education, holds close to his heart, partly because it is part of his current ministerial brief, but also because he once worked as an intellectual property lawyer, so he brings some expertise to the matter.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09040250000282"></a>I fully share the noble Lord&#146;s appreciation of just how important it is to safeguard the creative industries&#146; contribution to this country&#146;s well-being. The creative sector accounts for 8.2 per cent of UK GDP. In London alone, one in five jobs is in the creative industries. It is important that we offer all the support that we can, given the thousands of jobs that the industry supports, especially in difficult times such as ours, as the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd-Webber, said.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1224"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1224</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90402-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09040250000283"></a>While figures suggest that sales of music and film are continuing to grow despite the current economic difficulties, we cannot be complacent about problems such as digital piracy. It is estimated that the total loss to the film industry in 2007 was in the region of &#163;486 million. The music industry estimates that its own lost sales were probably around the &#163;165 million mark, and that figure may well be conservative. That is why the problem of digital piracy should matter to all of us.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09040250000284"></a>Clearly, today&#146;s debate focuses on the impact of piracy on creative talent within the UK, but it would be remiss of me not to highlight that in some cases piracy is a crime that damages more than our economic or creative capabilities. My fellow Minister, David Lammy, told me how that was particularly brought home to him by a raid that he attended in north-west London in November. In that raid alone, 60,000 counterfeit DVDs were seized, among which were a significant number of obscene, pornographic titles that would not have been granted a certification in the UK in the first place.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09040250000285"></a>I was interested in the range of contributions made by noble Lords. There was recognition, above all, of the complexity of the issue with which we are dealing. That reinforces our approach: good law is good, but proportionate, enforced laws are better. Noble Lords explored the question of achieving both proportion and the ability to enforce legislation. I know that we are not introducing jail terms for online infringement, as some in the industry have called for. However, I think that the measures that we propose will offer an effective deterrent to fraud that stops short of putting even more pressure on already crowded prisons.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09040250000286"></a>Whether we are talking about new or existing law, effective enforcement is clearly the key. We need to be in a position where all government departments and key individuals within the police, trading standards and local authority structures tackle these issues together. That is why we have set up an interministerial group on enforcement, With ministerial and other colleagues, we need to look at how we can effectively raise public awareness and understanding of these issues and at how to remove some of the practical barriers to more effective on-the-ground enforcement.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09040250000287"></a>The best approach is to combine enforcement within the resources available with other types of measures that we have been talking about, as well as public education on the consequences of copyright crime. I was interested in the visit made by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, to the Science Museum, which is taking a very innovative approach to showing young people that this is not a crime that has no victims.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09040250000288"></a>We are currently exploring the options for establishing a rights agency. It is likely that part of its remit will be to focus on encouraging respect for the creative industries and increasing public awareness of the easiest ways to access legal content. I assure the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, that we have not made up our minds on this; we are still out to consultation. It is not that we are dithering. This debate has reflected that, first, there is a range of views on how to deal with the problem and, secondly, not only does a complexity  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1225"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1225</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>currently exist but it is an increasing complexity; it is not something that we can solve nationally. As the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, pointed out, there is a need for international action as well. I do not plead that as an excuse; I just make these points because I think that they are relevant to this debate.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09040250000289"></a>Therefore, the Government have been meeting the industry to discuss the most effective way in which to tackle internet piracy crime&#151;not just piracy but all forms of internet piracy crime. I know that partnership working between organisations such as the Federation Against Copyright Theft, the BPI and the IPO&#146;s enforcement unit has been invaluable, and I encourage all other industries to develop the levels of intelligence gathering that these bodies have.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09040250000290"></a>We are also doing our best to support our creative talent, as I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd-Webber, appreciates. The very nature of the creative arts means that they are dynamic and always changing, developing and innovating. As well as bringing challenges, the digital age has brought tremendous creative potential. I was fascinated by the up-to-date knowledge of the noble Lord, Lord Luke, who mentioned the various services being offered. He identified things such as Spotify and referred to other independents offering online-only music and film. He also gave the interesting and fascinating example of the Radiohead offering, which, in a way, seems to be counterintuitive. However, I think that he demonstrated that, when talking about supporting young people with talent, we have to look at how the things that they do creatively are offered online in a way that perhaps a few years ago we would never have imagined.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09040250000291"></a>We have already made progress. In <I>Creative Britain</I>, we set out a three-year strategy for the creative economy in the UK, backed up by more than &#163;70 million of government funding. We committed to establishing, by 2013, 5,000 creative apprenticeships annually and we funded 10 pilot programmes designed to provide greater access for young people to a range of cultural and creative opportunities through the flagship Find Your Talent programme. Again, we are trying to involve young people in these programmes and are making them aware of the importance of intellectual property rights and content.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09040250000292"></a>In 2008-09, the Technology Strategy Board ran a &#163;10 million R&amp;D programme for the creative industries, investing in more than 90 creative industry SMEs and major innovative collaborative R&amp;D projects. In all, almost 300 UK-based companies and academic institutions will have benefited from this investment. We are also developing a project with the Local Government Association to research and deliver a menu for local infrastructure.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09040250000293"></a>There was much reference in the debate to the memorandum of understanding and the question of how to tackle peer-to-peer file sharing. The Government have worked with both rights holders and ISPs to find an industry-led solution to the problem. We may not all agree on exactly how we should do it but I think that there is some consensus that that route probably gives us the best chance of success. A memorandum of   


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1226"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1226</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>understanding was signed by the six major ISPs and rights holders to get an industry-led solution. We remain committed to the principles set out in the MoU and are working hard to achieve, as agreed, a substantial reduction in illicit peer-to-peer file sharing. Recent legislative proposals on peer-to-peer file sharing will go a long way towards achieving that reduction, with some evidence suggesting that up to 70 per cent of infringing users will desist on receipt of a warning letter. We are looking into options such as the rights agency as one way of continuing the valuable work arising from the memorandum of understanding in a form suitable for today&#146;s environment.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09040250000294"></a>I believe that we have provided enough of an outline of how we are tackling digital piracy and other forms of internet piracy crime. Everything that I have covered so far offers better safeguards for nurturing our creative talent and for the profitability of our creative industries and those who work in it. However, the work that we are doing to improve internet piracy enforcement goes much wider than one industry or sector. Our key priorities here must remain to educate consumers on these issues and to work with government departments and front-line enforcement agencies to ensure that they understand how IP issues fit into the wider civil and criminal enforcement landscape.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09040250000295"></a>I have tried to cover most of the points raised. If I have missed any, we will write to noble Lords. Today there has rightly been a rehearsal of the issues surrounding internet service providers. It is a critical area. The debate has highlighted polarised opinion, which the consultation on peer-to-peer file sharing clearly demonstrated. I think that we all agree that there will be no easy answer to this problem. In a way, the noble Lord, Lord Luke, summed it up when he said that we have to be careful that we do not produce oppressive legislation that acts as the enemy of innovation. That would not serve any real purpose or benefit for the creative industry and we do not believe that it would serve the country. We have to proceed cautiously. The answer must surely be to find a course that works, is proportionate and involves rights holders and ISPs. As I have indicated, discussions are under way and experience shows us that joint agreement must be the way. ISPs and industry have a key role in finding a solution to this problem. I thank the noble Lord again for initiating the debate. This is probably the end of the beginning&#151;certainly it will run and run, as they say sometimes of West End shows.</p>

Years ago, it was the other way round. I was pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, reaffirming that the House supports intellectual copyright.

<a name="09040250000297"></a><b><a name="90402-0008.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="09040250000581"></a>The Lord Bishop of Chelmsford:</b> My Lords, the measure before you represents a very significant development in the life of the Church of England. It puts in place a legislative framework to enable the introduction of new terms and conditions of service for clergy and stipendiary lay ministers. Its object is to equip and support those who are called to the ministry, and the people whom they serve, by establishing fair and clearly stated terms of service that will deliver the security that is needed for the ministry to flourish, while also providing a proper measure of accountability.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09040250000298"></a>The measure has been six years in preparation. It was begun in response to the Government&#146;s consultation on the rights and employment status of atypical workers. The proposals have been through the synodical process and have been found expedient by the Ecclesiastical Committee.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09040250000299"></a>Why is this legislation needed? The church recognises that the evolution of patterns of ministry over many centuries has created the potential for inequitable differences of treatment. Clergy in the Church of England are officeholders, not employees. In the past, the great majority of clergy held freehold office as incumbents of a benefice that gave them tenure for life, ownership of the church building and parsonage house, and an income from tithes, glebe land and parish endowments. Although the freehold has been greatly modified over the years, those who hold it still enjoy very high security. However, times have changed. Clergy with a freehold are now in the minority. Other clergy, including many with full responsibility for parishes, are licensed to their offices by the bishop, and their security of tenure is very limited, since the bishop has the power to revoke their licences, either summarily or on reasonable notice.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09040250000300"></a>Extending the freehold tool, even if that were practical, is not the answer. The church needs common terms of service that will give clergy a fair measure of security while ensuring a proper balance of rights and responsibilities. This measure addresses the need for change by making provision for new conditions of service that will be known as &#147;common tenure&#148;. The  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1228"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1228</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>intention is that these conditions should apply eventually to clergy and stipendiary lay ministers across the board, from the Archbishop of Canterbury to the person just starting out in ministry.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09040250000301"></a>Common tenure seeks above all to promote justice and fairness. For the first time, it gives clergy the great majority of rights enjoyed by employees, including the right to a stipend and to annual leave. At the same time, it preserves and protects their status as officeholders, which reflects the way in which their ministry is best exercised. Clergy enjoy a large measure of autonomy in the way they work, which gives them the freedom to respond flexibly to the various demands of daily ministry. The church recognises that as a good thing, as do the clergy. When they were consulted, the great majority wished to retain their officeholder status rather than become employees.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09040250000302"></a>With a view to enhancing the security of clergy who do not enjoy the freehold, the measure removes the bishop&#146;s power to terminate a licence summarily, and closely defines the circumstances in which an office can be terminated. There is provision for limited-term appointments only in a few cases, such as training posts and appointments subject to sponsoring funding. Furthermore, the right to compensation where an office is abolished through pastoral reorganisation, which presently applies to certain freeholders, will be extended under common tenure to all officeholders.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09040250000303"></a>These changes are all directed at providing a proper and common level of security for the clergy. Provision is also made under the measure to ensure that clergy are properly accountable both to their congregations and to the wider church. To that end, it provides for regular development reviews and continuing education to ensure that clergy are effectively supported and equipped in their ministry. At the same time, accountability will be strengthened through the introduction of a capability procedure, which enables bishops to address, through a fair and transparent process, the problems that arise when clergy fail, for whatever reason, to perform their duties to an acceptable standard. This procedure is designed to be supportive, and to give clergy the time, training and resources that they need to improve. If in the last resort an officeholder is removed under this procedure, he or she will have the right to bring a claim of unfair dismissal to an employment tribunal.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09040250000304"></a>That is what the measure seeks to achieve, by laying down basic principles and providing for the making of regulations to set out the detail of common tenure. The regulations will make provisions for matters such as written particulars of office, and entitlement to stipend and leave, including time off for public duties and sickness. Draft regulations have already been considered by the General Synod and, should the measure find approval in this House, they will be further debated in the synod later this year. In their final form, they will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny as a statutory instrument.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09040250000305"></a>Before I close, I should mention briefly some things that the measure does not do. First, it is not intended to, and will not, undermine the historic independence of the clergy. That is why the church has not sought to make clergy employees. Secondly, the measure does  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1229"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1229</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not compel existing freeholders to change their conditions of service&#151;with the exception of the two archbishops, who have already agreed to transfer to common tenure. All other freeholders will be able to choose not to opt in to the new system until such time as they take up a new post.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09040250000306"></a>Thirdly, the measure does not materially affect the position of patrons, who retain all their current rights in the appointment process. Nor does it make any change to the ownership of property. The original proposals stipulated that parsonage houses should be transferred to diocesan parsonage boards, but the synod resisted that. The measure does strengthen the position of other clergy who are provided with housing, apart from those with the freehold, giving them for the first time both the right to a reasonable standard of accommodation and the right to object to any proposal that the house that they occupy should be sold.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09040250000307"></a>Finally, the measure will not impose an excessive financial burden on the church. Noble Lords will be glad to hear that the infrastructure for its implementation is already in place, and that most dioceses are already running ministerial development review schemes. Many have also appointed human resources advisers, and those that have not yet done so are co-operating to provide the most effective and efficient way of providing these services.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09040250000308"></a>This measure is vital to the future health of the church. It is an opportunity to make a new covenant between people and their clergy that is fit for the 21st century and enshrines essential principles of fairness, clarity and collaboration.</p>

<a name="90402-0008.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09040250000309"></a>I can be brief on the second measure because it is probably the shortest measure ever sent here by the General Synod. But it is important legislation even if it is extremely straightforward. Again, the measure has the overwhelming support of the church, and has been found expedient by the Ecclesiastical Committee and approved in the other place.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90402-0009.htm"/>


<a name="90402-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09040250000310"></a>The measure seeks the renewal for a further seven years of the Church Commissioners&#146; existing power to spend their capital for pension purposes. This power was conferred by Parliament on the Church Commissioners by the passing of the Church of England (Pensions) Measure in 1997. Parliament also supported the renewal of the power when it passed a similar measure in 2003. The existing power expires at the end of 2011 and the church seeks its further renewal until 2018.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09040250000311"></a>The church proposed in 2003 that future renewals of the power might be achieved under the negative resolution procedure for statutory instruments. The Ecclesiastical Committee was not convinced by that proposal and the church quickly withdrew from the territory. We welcome the fact that Parliament continues to take an interest in the safeguarding of the church&#146;s historic assets and it has not sought to widen the scope of this measure. So the measure before the House today seeks nothing more and nothing less than a straight seven-year renewal of an existing power.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09040250000312"></a>Perhaps I may now sketch in the background. In the mid-1990s, the church began to realise that the commissioners&#146; asset base could not sustain their   


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1230"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1230</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>expenditure commitments. In order to bridge the gap between income and expenditure, they could have cut their expenditure or they could have adopted a different investment strategy which focused on generating short-term income. Neither option was particularly attractive. There had already been deep cuts in their ministry support in the early 1990s and the church was reluctant to see any further cuts. Chasing short-term income, on the other hand, would have come at the expense of long-term returns, ultimately reducing the commissioners&#146; ministry support. That, too, was unattractive.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09040250000313"></a>But there was a third way. The church and Parliament agreed that allowing the commissioners to spend capital for pension purposes would allow them to meet their pension liabilities and to sustain their other significant non-pension financial support for the church&#146;s ministry. This move has been absolutely crucial to the commissioners&#146; investment performance. It has enabled them to rebalance their portfolio and has given them the flexibility to make the best long-term investment decisions.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09040250000314"></a>The argument for renewing the power today is exactly the same as the argument for conferring the power in 1997. The commissioners&#146; actuary suggests that if they are to meet their pension liabilities and achieve their objectives of increasing their various other forms of ministry support, their expenditure commitments will continue to exceed income for some time. So, unless they are to resort to one of the two options which church and Parliament were determined to avoid in the late 1990s&#151;that is, cutting discretionary support or skewing their investment strategy&#151;they will clearly need this power for a further seven years.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09040250000315"></a>We should keep in mind at all times the very far horizon to which a body such as the commissioners must look. The commissioners&#146; fund is not accruing any fresh pension liabilities and the time will come when their existing pension liabilities will cease and all pensions will be met from the newer funded scheme. Actively planning this transition is simply good financial management. Similarly, investing in assets which promise to produce a good return decades later is a sound strategy, but one which requires patience. This measure will help the commissioners to wait for such opportunities to come through. The legislation does not involve any compulsion to spend capital; we should see it as a vehicle for flexibility. As I said, in recent times the commissioners used that flexibility to invest more heavily in real assets rather than high-income-yielding assets but, equally, if they believe there are good reasons for investing more heavily in bonds and cash, the commissioners can do so.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09040250000316"></a>Between 1 January 1998, when the power came into effect, and the end of 2007, the commissioners spent &#163;405 million of capital but the value of their fund actually increased by &#163;2.2 billion. The outperformance of their investments against the independent benchmark during this period meant &#163;37 million per annum more for the church than average performance would have allowed. I offer that analysis to demonstrate the capital growth at which the commissioners&#146; investment policy is aimed, not as a cunning way of ignoring the circumstances of 2008.  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1231"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1231</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The commissioners&#146; audited 2008 figures are not yet available but it is true to say that, like any other fund at this moment, they have been affected by the market downturn. But this does not alter the argument for this measure.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09040250000317"></a>Nothing in this measure can alter the fact that the value of the Church Commissioners&#146; fund will go up and down with the markets but, crucially, it enables them to adopt a long-term investment and distribution policy which, in turn, gives them the best chance of maintaining their support for the church even during difficult economic times.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09040250000318"></a>That last point is important: we should not get so preoccupied with investment strategy that we forget the beneficiary. Generating superior returns matters only because it means increased proceeds for the church. So, despite the title of the measure, it is not the payment of clergy pensions that is at stake. Clergy pensions for which the commissioners are responsible&#151;that is, those earned on service before 1997&#151;will always be a first call on their fund. Clergy pensions will be paid regardless of our decision today. The point is that this legislation gives the commissioners the best chance of sustaining their other forms of support for the church in addition to the payment of clergy pensions. That means supporting bishops&#146; and cathedrals&#146; ministries, augmenting stipends, funding innovative parish projects which are targeted at the poorest areas of our country&#151;I stand in a diocese which benefits hugely from this support&#151;or exploiting new opportunities such as the creation of a Christian presence in new housing areas or employment areas. It may be a short measure, but it is important to our financial strategy.</p>

On the first measure, I will add only a few words because the right reverend Prelate has said everything that needs to be said in explaining the measure and why it is expedient.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09040250000320"></a>In the past five years, many measures have come before us from the synod, but three have been of particular importance&#151;the Clergy Discipline Measure in 2003, the Pastoral (Amendment) Measure in 2006 and now this measure in 2008-09. Of the three, this measure is the most important for the future of the Church of England. Therefore it needs our support for the reasons given by the right reverend Prelate.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09040250000321"></a>On each of the occasions we have considered these reports, I have been extremely impressed by the thoroughness with which the synod does its business and with the great care it takes to reach unanimity where it can. Very often it achieves either unanimity or something very near it, and I sometimes think that Parliament might take a lesson from that book.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09040250000322"></a>On this measure there is a feeling, which I share, in favour of retaining the clergy freehold. The Ecclesiastical Committee was well aware of that feeling, took it fully into account and, for the reasons which were given in the report, took the view that nevertheless this measure is the right way ahead for the Church of England. I think I need refer only to paragraph 13 of the report, in which we say it will,</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09040250000323"></a>Finally, I apologise that the time chosen for the consideration of the synod turned out to be very inconvenient to certain Members of the House of Commons. I apologise for that. The timing was chosen after soundings had been taken; we tried to get a time that would suit everyone, but that proved not to be possible. I hope that that will not happen again. I support both Motions.</p>

<a name="09040250000324"></a><b><a name="90402-0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09040250000583"></a>Lord Wallace of Saltaire:</b> My Lords, in welcoming this measure I shall say a little about the pensions measure. The clergy, like the university profession and, I suspect, like lawyers and judges, tend to live a long time. They have satisfying retirements, they still have interesting things to do and they survive. As a very occasional guide around Westminster Abbey I have had occasion to remark to visitors on the diet of the monks in the 15th century; they had a regime that did not leave a pensions problem, and perhaps part of the answer to the current one is to encourage more gluttony among the senior clergy.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09040250000325"></a>The serious measure&#151;the more serious of the two&#151;is the important one on the freehold. On the Ecclesiastical Committee we had a long and, in many ways, rather nostalgic debate, which reminded me strongly on occasion of the Barchester novels, where abolishing the parson&#146;s freehold was felt to be a step towards the 20th century, clearly a step too far for some people.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09040250000326"></a>I certainly felt that these measures were highly desirable. They improve the conditions under which clergy work, they make them more properly accountable, they give them more active support in difficult circumstances and they make it easier for the Church as a whole to deal considerately and effectively with those few difficult cases where relations break down among office-holders whose job it is to work together, and are thus a useful and helpful step forward. This is not of course a party measure but, as a member of the Ecclesiastical Committee, I welcome these measures.</p>

As I have already told him today, I often find myself in agreement with what he is saying. All I can say is that if my enthusiasm for his thoughts in this Chamber can be excelled, it is only by my enthusiasm for his singing, which was excellent in last night&#146;s Haydn Mass. I wish more of my noble friends could have been there to hear such a wonderful concert, but such is the business of the state that we must push things like Haydn to one side in order that votes can take place, and all the rest of it. I must plead guilty, with my good colleagues and Whips present, and say that I made the right choice last night; I could not make any other, since my wife was singing in the concert.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09040250000328"></a>The case has been put in exemplary fashion by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford.

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09040250000329"></a>It is a privilege to serve on the Ecclesiastical Committee under the chairmanship of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, because he chairs it so well. His ability speaks for itself, but he brings such good humour, patience and irresistible firmness to our proceedings that we always reach good conclusions under his guidance. I am sure that this is the right step; it makes a great deal of sense.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09040250000330"></a>In our deliberations in the committee I observed that, of late, while we spend a good deal of our time discussing, as our chair has said in this debate, extremely well prepared considerations coming from committed members of the Synod, more and more we hear the language of running the Church as a business and the business disciplines and professional skills that are required. We need effectiveness in the life of the Church but it is not a business, and I wish that these analogies were not made. Even this debate itself and the scope of it are hard to reconcile with the life of the founders of our Church; I cannot really imagine them sitting around discussing pension arrangements or freeholds. We have moved a long way, and we have to be careful that in our business preoccupations we do not throw out the baby with the bathwater.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09040250000331"></a>With regard to pensions, at a time when there is a great deal of anxiety in our society about principle, about ethics and the absence of such considerations, which has led us into the plight that we now face, if we have an established Church then it has a responsibility to be a leader in the whole concept of ethical and principled investment. It is not just that it matters for members of the Church; it should, by the very nature of an established Church, be an example to the nation as a whole. The commissioners, therefore, have a tremendous task in reconciling good management procedures with a commitment to principle.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09040250000332"></a>On the question of tenure, I hold firmly to the view that while this is clearly the right and sensible step to take, whatever arrangements we have in this and other respects with the Church, we must retain the principle&#151;I hope the right reverend Prelate will forgive my saying this as a mere layman&#151;that the hierarchy is there as a service structure, not as a power structure. They are not directors of a company; they are there to serve the Church, society and the clergy. The arrangements that we have in place should be there to enable them to carry out that service, to which I believe the present Archbishop of Canterbury is deeply committed.</p>

I am a member of the Ecclesiastical Committee, and as such I have before me the two papers presented to the House so that noble Lords, too, may be aware of what was said in those deliberations. I am always sorry at times such as this that there are not more people here to debate and comment on these issues, because they are so important to the established Church of this country. We are fortunate that the Synod takes such time and trouble to make sure that, by the time these measures appear before us under the able chairmanship of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, they have discussed and voted on them over a long period. By the time we get them they are well and truly measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09040250000334"></a>We have two measures to discuss today, the terms of service measure and the pensions measure. We had a long and difficult discussion because people wanted to listen to Prime Minister&#146;s Question Time, rather than decide on this. They thought that it was more important; I did not think so. I am very happy that those of us who were there took time to discuss it and that we found out, as we are bidden to do, whether the measure was expedient. That is all that we are bidden to do. We have already heard the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford describe exactly what this first measure is about. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, has spoken, as have others. Noble Lords do not need me to speak any more, but I will add that we on these Benches find this measure expedient.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09040250000335"></a>I turn to the Church of England pensions measure. I chair three different pension schemes in three very different areas of work. I know how worrying all talk of pensions is at this time, particularly in the Church of England, where we do not exactly pay our clergy an enormous amount of money. The pension is so very important to them. We found the measure to be expedient in our committee. We have heard it described and it has been amended so that there is just to be a seven-year review. There is no point in my saying more, other than that it is a great privilege to serve in Parliament on this particular committee with my friend&#151;as I think I may call him at this time&#151;who is opposite. We take these matters very seriously. It is an enormous privilege to have an established Church of England. I am very proud to be here today, on behalf of these Benches, to say that we find this measure expedient.</p>

<a name="09040250000336"></a><b><a name="90402-0009.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09040250000586"></a>The Lord Bishop of Chelmsford:</b> My Lords, I am grateful for all contributions. We on these Benches and in the Church of England are very grateful for the work that is done in the Ecclesiastical Committee and the careful attention that it pays to our measures as they come to Parliament. I agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, about the significance of the first of these measures. I am reminded that in the 1840s serious legislative reforms of the Church took place, leading to clergy having to reside in their parishes and to other reforms of that sort. The Ecclesiastical Commission&#146;s aim in the Industrial Revolution was to fund new parishes as the population grew. The consequence of those measures was that between 1851 and 1908 the Church of England grew as a proportion of the population that worshipped. These measures are important for the capacity of the Church to fulfil its duty. I sense that the measures that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, has mentioned this afternoon are of similar importance for the future life of the Church.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09040250000337"></a>I assure my good friend, the noble Lord, Lord Judd, that I do not consider myself to be in the position of a managing director of a business. If I did, I would fail hopelessly. Micromanaging the clergy and parishes of the Diocese of Chelmsford would be an unwise thing even to countenance. Our task is to enable people to do what they are equipped and skilled to do. These measures, in different ways, will help us to do that slightly better. I ask the House to approve the Motions.</p>

This House will already be aware of the real help that we are offering businesses and those struggling to make ends meet during this time of economic difficulty. The order will provide further help to business by reducing some of the costs associated with insolvency.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09040250000339"></a>Before I set out what the order will do, I shall set out a brief history of it. The draft order was laid on 4 December 2008 using the affirmative resolution procedure. It was considered by the House of Lords Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, which confirmed that it was content that the order should be allowed to progress as an affirmative instrument. The order was approved in the other place on 24 March.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09040250000340"></a>I move on to the detail. When a company finds itself unable to pay its debts, a liquidator is appointed to find and distribute the company assets. Today&#146;s order will deal specifically with voluntary liquidations. In a voluntary liquidation, a meeting of the company&#146;s creditors must be called under Sections 95 and 98 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Notice of the time and venue of this meeting must be sent directly to all known creditors and advertised in the <I>London Gazette</I> and two local newspapers that are circulated in the area where the company has its principal place of business.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09040250000341"></a>The order removes the obligation to advertise in two local newspapers and means that it will be up to the liquidator, under Section 95, or the company, under Section 98, to decide whether advertising is needed and, if it is, to choose the most appropriate method. It makes no change to the requirements to advertise in the <I>London Gazette</I> and for notices to be sent to all known creditors.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1236"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1236</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90402-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09040250000342"></a>These amendments to the Act are expected to deliver some &#163;3 million a year in savings to business. Associated changes are being made to the Insolvency Rules 1986. These will come into force on 6 April this year and are expected to deliver further savings to business of some &#163;14 million a year.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09040250000343"></a>Delivery of the advertising changes is the first step in a process to consolidate and modernise our insolvency legislation. That will be achieved by another legislative reform order, which we aim to lay soon, and further rules amendments. We brought this advertising order forward in advance of the wider reforms as we did not want to delay this useful measure. The savings to business expected from the remainder of the project are around &#163;25 million per year.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09040250000344"></a>The savings from this order arise in respect of the &#163;600 per case that will no longer be spent in an estimated 80 per cent of voluntary liquidations. This will increase the pot of money available to the creditors, because there is no reason why the change should result in any increase in the costs of conducting the liquidation, including the fees of the liquidator.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09040250000345"></a>Costs are not the only reason, however, for introducing the order. We also want to make sure that, where creditors&#146; money is spent, it is spent usefully. That could mean an advertisement in a local paper if the creditors are local. It could equally mean an announcement on a professional website or even a small slot on radio, if they are trying to reach a rural community.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09040250000346"></a>The requirement to use local newspapers goes right back to the beginning of the last century, when those who dealt with a company usually came from the same part of the country, but we do not think that such assumptions still hold good. The chances of local newspapers reaching unknown creditors who are not, as is perfectly possible, based in the same part of the country as the company are very limited. We should not be surprised that the Insolvency Service&#146;s consultation about this proposal found that, in around 98 per cent of cases, no unknown creditors came forward as a result of the advertisements. So, in the vast majority of cases, these advertisements served no useful purpose.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09040250000347"></a>We have considered carefully whether this measure could be open to abuse. It could be argued that companies might wish to conceal their insolvency from their creditors and might be aided if there was no local newspaper advertisement. But adequate measures are already in place to guard against concealment of creditors and those safeguards will not be undermined by the changes that we propose.</p>

<a name="90402-0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09040250000348"></a>The order will make a modest but useful difference to creditors who will have already suffered losses as a result of having dealt with the failed company. It will also give liquidators and companies greater freedom to target their advertising more effectively. During an economic downturn, we should do all we can to help business.

However, needless to say, there are one or two matters that I should like to raise. Before doing so, I ought perhaps to disclose that, at an earlier stage in my career when working in a major firm of chartered accountants, I worked in the insolvency field.</p>

<a name="90402-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09040250000350"></a>The House of Commons Regulatory Reform Committee expressed its surprise that the order was not more ambitious&#151;even the Minister called it modest. The committee said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="09040250000420"></a>&#147;Given the widespread concerns about insolvency procedures ... we believe that it would be more appropriate for the proposal to be considered together with the other proposals expected from the Department as part of the overall project to modernise insolvency legislation&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09040250000389"></a>Will the Minister provide an update on the status of these other proposals? The Minister in the other place mentioned&#151;I think, in this context&#151;what he called the &#147;April-May timetable&#148;. It is April, so why the rush with this subject in isolation?</p>

<a name="90402-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09040250000351"></a>According to the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform,</p>
<ul><a name="09040250000434"></a>&#147;LROs form a key part of the Government&#146;s better regulation agenda&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09040250000390"></a>Yet while more than 1,300 statutory instruments are passed each year, just 20 LROs are scheduled to come into force in 2009. The Minister will accept, therefore, that we are more than a little sceptical of the Government&#146;s robustness in this area.</p>

<a name="90402-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09040250000352"></a>The Regulatory Reform Committee&#146;s concern at the narrow focus of the order might be said to corroborate a scepticism that this order is being introduced to make it look as though the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform is trying to be seen as fulfilling the mandate in the second half of its name, without adequate underpinning substance. Would the Minister care to comment on that? Does it not worry him that, if LROs are such a central plank of this important policy area, this particular LRO has been labelled by the Regulatory Reform Committee&#151;a committee on which the Labour Party has an absolute majority of eight to six&#151;as<I>,</I></p>
<ul><a name="09040250000435"></a>&#147;so minor as to cause doubt as to its usefulness&#148;?</ul>
<a name="90402-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09040250000353"></a>In response to the government consultation document on the draft order, the Newspaper Society raised concerns that the proposals would discourage liquidators from using local newspapers. Have the Government considered this point and are they concerned by it?</p>

<a name="90402-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09040250000354"></a>The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform states that this order will result in annual savings of about &#163;3.4 million. This figure is based on an estimate that 80 per cent of voluntary insolvencies will not need additional advertising beyond the <I>London Gazette</I> entry, because directors will hand over the books of account, which will contain a full list of creditors. The Regulatory Reform Committee labelled this argument &#147;unconvincing&#148;.<I></I>Is there not a danger that, given that the firm is facing insolvency, the books will not have been as diligently maintained as they should have been?</p>

<a name="90402-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09040250000355"></a>Finally, the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 holds that, among other conditions, a proposed change to the law must not deprive anyone of necessary protection. The Regulatory Reform Committee argues:</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1238"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column 1238</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="09040250000421"></a>&#147;We are not satisfied that the retention of requirements to advertise in the <I>Gazette</I>, even when taken with the availability of information from other sources including the internet, will necessarily protect&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09040250000391"></a>creditors. In the Minister&#146;s view, is this order compatible with the 2006 Act?</p>

<p><a name="st_110"></a>
<a name="09040250000356"></a><b><a name="90402-0010.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09040250000591"></a>Lord Addington:</b> My Lords, when I first looked at this comparatively modest and small document I was filled with that dread that usually comes across you when you think &#147;It can&#146;t be this straightforward, can it?&#148; The Commons debates on the subject were prolonged and about procedural purposes, and I concluded that procedure was much more important than the Motion itself. The debate we had earlier about piracy and modern media suggests that the necessary duty to advertise an insolvency in two local papers may belong to another era. Advertising in other areas could be the way forward. However, as the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, has suggested, it really does seem to be a small part of a package.</p>

<a name="90402-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09040250000357"></a>It would be interesting to know the timetable that the Minister envisages, and whether there are any other issues. What would be the duty to advertise and to take reasonable steps? Do the Government have any idea what that really means? How far are we going to go? What is envisaged beyond this? Just to reassure people&#151;if you are ordering something online, are you going to be advertising online? The answer might come out. At the moment it could be read as simply taking away one thing that may not have hit many other people and giving a possible excuse for doing absolutely nothing.</p>

<p><a name="st_111"></a>
<a name="09040250000358"></a><b><a name="90402-0010.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09040250000592"></a>Lord Brett:</b> My Lords, I thank noble Lords for their contributions to the debate. I sense some cynicism; perhaps we all become infected by it in the daily grind of politics, but I think that on this occasion it is misplaced.</p>

<a name="90402-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09040250000359"></a>On the question of this measure coming before other instruments, the next order is expected to be laid by the end of this month or the beginning of the next. A point was raised about the effect on newspapers. Clearly the order will have cost implications for the newspaper industry in terms of lost revenue. These will vary according to the number of insolvent companies in a local newspaper&#146;s locality. However, it is important to note that the measure does nothing to stop companies and liquidators continuing to advertise in local newspapers. That, in the view of the liquidator, is the most sensible thing to do. We are giving the insolvency practitioner&#151;the liquidator&#151;the freedom to decide what is in the best interest of the liquidation, the companies and the creditors. Companies in liquidation can therefore choose to advertise in a local newspaper if they consider it appropriate, using the new technologies and websites that are available. We think that the new regime is preferable to retaining a legislative provision which means that local newspaper adverts must be placed in every single voluntary liquidation without consideration of their actual effectiveness. In the consultation, we found that in 80 per cent of the cases, no creditors came forward, suggesting that there would be some value in a change of regime.</p>

<a name="90402-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09040250000360"></a>I agree that this is a modest measure; the money amounts to only &#163;3.4 million, but that sum will go to increasing the size of the pot of money available to creditors. The remuneration of insolvency practitioners, for example, has to be proved by the creditors; in that case, one can see no reason why costs should increase as a result of the change.</p>

<a name="90402-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09040250000361"></a>Insolvency practitioners are ultimately answerable to the court for the conduct of the case. They are experienced members of a regulated profession. A licensing body can, in appropriate cases, investigate concerns about their professional conduct. Unsecured creditors, which would include many small businesses, are treated equally among themselves. By changing the insolvency rules, the order seeks to improve the transparency for creditors and provide additional information.</p>

<a name="90402-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09040250000362"></a>If I have missed any points raised by noble Lords, I will happily write to them. There is some cynicism about this, but we have not taken the long-grass approach. We have promised&#151;a promise we will fulfil&#151;that further orders will be laid in a very short time.</p>

<a name="90402-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09040250000363"></a>This is a modest proposal; it could have been allowed to wait for several months more, but it will make a useful difference to creditors who have already suffered losses. Why should we not bring in a measure, however modest, which will save money and assist in very difficult times? It also gives liquidators and companies a greater freedom to target their advertising effectively; it could be argued that that is one area where business is increasing, unfortunately, as companies go into liquidation. Therefore, there is no argument for delaying something we can do now. For those reasons, I believe

As I said at Second Reading, fundamentally, this is not a contentious Bill, but one which we must scrutinise in the customary way before we return it to the other place. I thank the Minister for writing promptly after Second Reading dealing with the points that arose during that debate. It is generally a welcome feature of his modus operandi that we receive letters in good time, but the his letter in respect of the government amendments tabled last week, while dated 30 March, arrived only this morning. While I was in the Chamber, a further letter, dated yesterday, arrived. I was going to give him full marks, but I am afraid that I will have to dock a few penalty points in this regard.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000003"></a>Amendment 1 would, on a probing basis, delete Clause 1(2). This subsection requires saving gateway accounts to be managed by the HMRC. I have deleted this subsection in order to find out why the Government consider the HMRC is best qualified to carry out the management of the scheme. The other obvious contender is the Department for Work and Pensions, since that department manages five of the seven benefits listed in Clause 3 as creating eligibility for a saving gateway account.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000004"></a>I have searched the background documents for the saving gateway scheme, starting with the 2001 White Paper and ending with the 2008 summary of responses. The scheme seems to have evolved from one which was jointly in the care of the Treasury and, for no reason I can really discern, the Department for Education and Skills, as it then was, to one which is now led by the Treasury and the HMRC, without any discussion, as far as I can see, en route about the best way for the project to be led. The DWP was involved in the pilots, but it seems to have been allowed to play only a supporting role.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000005"></a>The HMRC is not everyone&#146;s idea of an ideal body to lead a new project. It is the organisation which lost the data relating to around 25 million people and the report carried out by Mr Poynter was damning about the management and organisation skills within the HMRC. Subsequently, it has had to have a major change of personnel at the top. I would be surprised if anyone could claim that the internal failings which were highlighted have yet been solved. The HMRC is also the body which has introduced the disastrous tax  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC292"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column GC292</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>credit system, which continues to attract criticism from Select Committees in another place, the latest being a report from the Public Accounts Committee. That report highlighted the huge problem of over and underpayments that still beset the scheme even after the extraordinary &#163;25,000 disregard, which covers up the fact that the scheme is not fit for purpose. The report also covered income tax and was less than complimentary about the HMRC&#146;s handling of self-assessment and PAYE returns. Other failings in the HMRC are often associated with the introduction of new IT systems, which, presumably, the saving gateway scheme will require. It is hard not to conclude that the Treasury has placed the saving gateway scheme with the HMRC simply because, in effect, it belongs to Treasury Ministers and possibly because it occupies the same building.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000006"></a>A much more logical case could be made for DWP based on the number of benefits and likely number of people qualifying for a saving gateway account. The main reason for saying that the DWP would be more appropriate is that the benefits system works in real time and the tax credits system is still struggling to graft a real-time focus on to a tax system that is fundamentally based on a retrospective look at fiscal years. Put simply, the DWP is used to dealing with individuals&#146; changing circumstances while the HMRC is not. I look forward to hearing the Government&#146;s rationale for using the HMRC. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000007"></a><b><a name="90402-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09040247000365"></a>Lord Williamson of Horton:</b> I agree with the Government&#151;I do not support the amendment&#151;but I want to make a couple of points. I declare an interest: I am the father of an eligible person and my wife and I are both carers, although we are do not fall under the Minister&#146;s definition. I am 100 per cent in favour of the Minister&#146;s amendment although I am not personally covered by it.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000008"></a>I am content with the proposed approach to management. Amendment 40, which we will come to later, would involve looking back and seeing how things were provided and how far the system had worked to achieve its objectives. I am in favour of that amendment.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000009"></a>Following the principle that when you want to make a point and there are an awful lot of amendments, it is easiest to make it on Amendment 1, I want to put one point to the Minister&#151;it is not a critical point but it is of real interest. I want the Minister to comment on the provision in the Explanatory Notes on the way in which the system will work; that is, the third example. That involves someone who saves money for, say, the first year and gets up to &#163;300 and then he or she draws out some money; at the end of the year, there would be substantially less in the account. None the less, the payment from the taxpayer would relate to the highest figure; it would relate not to the amount of money in the account at the end but to the amount of money that was in the account before some of it was withdrawn. In a sense, I do not object to that because the arrangement is very favourable to the saver, but it involves a rather odd proposition. The reality is that many people will put money in for a short period&#151;I know quite a lot of the type of people who are eligible here&#151;but, unfortunately, there will be something that they really

When we get to the end, there will be quite a lot of people who do not have in their account the full amount that was originally put in. Even so, the taxpayer and the Treasury are to pay 50p, which is related to a much higher figure than the amount in the account at the end. I do not object to that but, if I may say so, it involves a rather curious proposition.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000010"></a>I invite the Minister to comment on this point, although its relevance to Amendment 1 is a little marginal. However, it is important, and I really do believe that that is what will happen under this scheme: people will put money in and, even if they draw some out, they will get benefit on a much reduced account.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000011"></a><b><a name="90402-gc0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09040247000366"></a>The Financial Services Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Myners):</b> I begin by saying how much I have looked forward to this Committee stage. I know from my experience of the Banking Bill with noble Lords, including in particular the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that work in Committee will almost certainly be a challenge, that there will be good scrutiny and, conceivably, improvement. I look forward to working with noble Lords to achieve that. I also welcome the noble Baroness&#146;s statement of the Opposition&#146;s support in principle for the Bill and this new product.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000012"></a>I will endeavour to do better with the speed of communication. Indeed, if it continues to fall short of the noble Baroness&#146;s expectations, I may take it upon myself to hand-deliver the letters if they take as long as they appear to have done. I apologise for that. I have always believed that being granted the facility by Members of the House or Committee to respond to technical matters by correspondence is a privilege that colleagues should not abuse; that is to say, we should respond promptly and in detail to anything where we beg the indulgence of the House or Committee to respond in writing rather than during the debate.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000013"></a><b><a name="90402-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09040247000367"></a>Lord Newby:</b> I am sorry to interrupt. I do not know whether the Minister&#146;s letters to the noble Baroness were private billets doux but, if they were slightly more generally distributed, I have not got mine yet.</p>

I suspect that the G20 summit has rather slowed the performance of my office; I apologise for that.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000015"></a>Amendment 1, by removing the provision in the Bill that places the saving gateway under the management of the commissioners for Revenue and Customs, would make it more difficult for the commissioners to exercise general managerial discretion in carrying out the functions conferred upon them by the Bill. At the heart of my answer to the noble Baroness is the observation that this is not a social security benefit. The saving gateway is a savings scheme and therefore constitutionally, properly and correctly falls under the Treasury. The HMRC administers both the individual savings accounts and child trust funds and, consequently, is best placed to administer the saving gateway, building upon its experience and established links with savings providers. The HMRC is of course working closely with DWP as it develops the scheme.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000016"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, refers to performance shortcomings at the HMRC, particularly the loss of data and the administration of certain benefits. The HMRC is committed to enhanced data security programmes, and is investing over &#163;150 million over the next three years. There are new physical and technical controls on access to and movement of bulk data, on paper and electronically, using removable data. My colleagues have, no doubt, previously expressed disappointment at the performance of the HMRC on the loss of data to which the noble Baroness refers. There is a salutary warning there on the importance of achieving confidence in the customer community by not repeating those shortcomings.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000017"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Williamson of Horton, raises a question that even he acknowledges is somewhat tenuous in its linkage to the amendment. However, in the spirit in which we are going to work together to achieve a good outcome here, I am more than happy to answer to the best of my ability his question on whether the match payments should be calculated on the final balance of the account. Our view is that this would unfairly penalise those who, possibly for reasons beyond their control, make a withdrawal from the saving gateway account before the end of the account&#146;s life. That could mean that someone who has saved for 23 months and then had to withdraw the money because of an emergency at home, for example, would get no return at all on their savings if no interest were paid on the account. That would clearly be unfair. The final balance will never be higher than the highest balance, meaning that many account holders could receive a lower return on their savings.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000018"></a>The system that we have chosen means that people will not be penalised for making withdrawals. However, such withdrawals will nevertheless be disincentivised as savers will have to put the money they withdrew back into their account before they can earn the additional match. I remember, at Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Newby, used the phrase &#147;rough justice&#148;, or &#147;rough and ready&#148;, or something of that sort. The truth is that the noble Lord was correct in that respect. We have a wish to be as simple and straightforward as possible, so arguments of the sort advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, which have validity are nevertheless subservient to the better interest of keeping this simple and straightforward. On that basis, I ask the noble Baroness if she will be kind enough to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000021"></a>The Minister said that the reason why it was constitutionally proper for this to be in the Treasury and the HMRC is because it is not a social security benefit. I was trying to make the point that the DWP was just a better organisation and I would have hoped that the Treasury would have chosen the best organisation in Whitehall to carry out this project. The Minister referred to the

The main problem with the HMRC, which has been demonstrated in spades with the tax credit system, is that it finds it difficult to operate with the kind of immediacy in which the DWP has to operate. The very nature of handling benefits means that you have to be very alert to changing circumstances. That is fundamentally where the tax credit system has failed. The HMRC could not adapt to that as its culture is fixated on past years rather than on what is happening now.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000022"></a>I regret that the Minister has not given anything more than a constitutional nicety as an argument for the HMRC. If it were objectively tested by having a market test around Whitehall, it would be difficult to find the HMRC at the top of the list as being the most appropriate organisation, especially given the number of criticisms that are not simply confined to data security. There are backlogs on PAYE, self-assessment and all kinds of other things that are not conducive to being handled in real time. I shall not press this further, although I do not think that the Minister has justified the case. I predict that leaving this to the HMRC could leave the scheme struggling as its workload starts to involve large amounts of paper and processes that have to be dealt with in real time. That is on the Government&#146;s head. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The amendments refer to eligibility for a saving gateway account. Amendment 2 would delete Clause 1(3)(b) which states that the relevant date for a notice of eligibility can be earlier than the date that the notice is issued if the person concerned has already ceased to be eligible. If the person was eligible for, say, jobseeker&#146;s allowance but then got a job and came off JSA without going on to any other benefit or tax credit, the HMRC could nevertheless issue a notice of eligibility allowing that person to open a saving gateway account.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000024"></a>In Committee in another place, the Minister said that that was indeed the Government&#146;s intention and that even a fleeting encounter with the benefits system would create eligibility for a saving gateway account. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, spoke on Second Reading about the opportunities available to young people from wealthy backgrounds. They could register for JSA, get their saving gateway entitlement which their parents might fund and then leave JSA either because they got a job or because it really was too boring to do all those job interviews.</p>

It was simply an opportunity that was too good to miss; and the concern is that a saving gateway account may be too good an opportunity to miss.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000026"></a>Amendment 2 would not allow the HMRC to issue a notice of eligibility if the person concerned had already moved out of eligible benefit or tax credit. Amendment 5 has a similar purpose. It modifies Clause 2 so that the expiry date of a notice of eligibility must be no later than the cessation of eligibility. Even if a notice had been issued to someone who was receiving one of the benefits, it could not be used after the person came off benefits or tax credits. That would further restrict the possibility that people who are not really on benefits would qualify.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000027"></a>In Committee in another place, the Minister said that allowing a saving gateway account to those who no longer qualified affected only around 4 per cent of the eligible population. I suspect that that makes no allowance for the behavioural effect of encouraging people to register for a benefit only for the purpose of gaining access to the tax-free return that the saving gateway account will allow. I can see no possible reason for the saving gateway account scheme to encourage that sort of behaviour, and the scheme should not allow it to occur. The Minister may say that it is very difficult, because DWP will be transferring information to the HMRC only once or twice a month, so the system cannot cope with short-term shifts in eligibility. That has to be a weakness of either systems or processes that are being set up to cope with the new scheme or, to return to the theme of my earlier amendment, with placing responsibility with the HMRC rather than DWP, which is very used to handling short-term changes in the circumstances of individuals. I have already argued it is the more logical place for administration to be located. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000029"></a>Clause 1(3)(b), which Amendment 2 would remove from the Bill, is necessary to ensure that a notice of eligibility can be issued to every person who becomes eligible for a saving gateway account. It may be helpful if I explain the background to, and purpose of, this provision.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000030"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, Clause 1(3) defines the &#147;relevant date&#148;&#151;that is the date on which a person must be entitled to a qualifying benefit or tax credit in order for their account to be a saving gateway account. In most cases, this relevant date will be the date on which the notice of eligibility is issued. However, as I will explain, it will be necessary for there to be exceptions to this rule, and Clause 1(3)(b) would allow for these exceptions.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000031"></a>Eligibility for the saving gateway will be passported from entitlement to certain benefits or tax credits. The HMRC systems will be updated with periodic transfers of information from DWP and the DSD in Northern Ireland. By the time that the HMRC receives these periodic transfers and issues notices of eligibility, some people whose details it has received from DWP or DSD may no longer be entitled to a qualifying benefit  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC297"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column GC297</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or tax credit. They would not therefore be an eligible person on the relevant date specified at Clause 1(3)(a). An example would be a person who has had a short period of entitlement to jobseeker&#146;s allowance within the period between transfers of information from DWP or DSD to the HMRC.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000032"></a>I am sure that noble Lords will agree that it would not be right for people in these circumstances to be excluded from an opportunity to have a saving gateway account, just because their benefit status has changed by the date on which the HMRC receives information from DWP or DSD.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000033"></a>Clause 1(3)(b) allows the HMRC to consider that a date earlier than that on which the notice of eligibility is issued should be &#147;the relevant date&#148;, ensuring that every person who becomes eligible for the saving gateway can be issued with a notice of eligibility.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000034"></a>Amendment 5 would require the notices that the HMRC issue to eligible people to contain an expiry date not later than the date when a person ceases to be eligible under Clause 3, which will generally be when they move off the qualifying benefits or tax credits. This would obviously be rather challenging since the HMRC will not be able to anticipate any future changes in a person's circumstances. However, I appreciate that the intention behind the amendment is to ensure that notices of eligibility issued by the HMRC will not be valid once a person&#146;s claim to the qualifying benefit or tax credit ceases.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000035"></a>I agree that it is important for eligibility to the saving gateway to be appropriately targeted, and we have considered this point carefully, but we have decided to take a different approach so that notices of eligibility will be valid for a set period of time, regardless of changes in people&#146;s circumstances. Let me explain why we have taken this approach. We want people to be clear, when they receive a properly issued notice of eligibility, that they are entitled to open up an account until the point when that notice expires, provided they have the necessary connection with the United Kingdom. That makes the scheme simple for potential account holders to understand and simple for providers to operate.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000036"></a>As I have said, it would be impossible for the HMRC to anticipate when a person&#146;s eligibility might cease and print that date on the notice. To operate the scheme in the way that is envisaged in this amendment would therefore require individuals to declare their benefit or tax credit entitlement to the provider at the point of account opening. That is likely to deter people from opening an account and we do not think that providers would welcome having to ask about, record and report information on benefit entitlement to the HMRC. Where the HMRC later found out that a person had wrongly reported their eligibility status, this would lead to more accounts having to be closed, which we know would be burdensome for account providers and a deterrent to their offering a saving gateway account. Allowing notices of eligibility to remain valid up to their expiry date avoids these problems. It gives providers certainty and it makes it easier for people opening accounts to know where they stand.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000037"></a>However, as I said earlier, we recognise the importance of properly targeting eligibility for the saving gateway and I understand the noble Baroness&#146;s concerns in this area. We anticipate, though, that only in a minority of cases will a person move out of entitlement to the qualifying benefits and tax credits between being issued with a notice of eligibility and opening an account. We estimate that this will apply to only around 4 per cent of accounts that are opened.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000038"></a>As I have said, there is a balance to be struck between achieving marginally more precise targeting of the scheme on the one hand and ensuring that the scheme is simple to use and to operate on the other. We feel we have struck the right balance and that this amendment would introduce unwelcome complexity and may well inhibit take-up of the scheme by either account holders or providers. I hope that the noble Baroness will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The issue is whether a passing acquaintance with the benefits system should be allowed to generate access to a very privileged little savings scheme. I understand the problem that is caused by the HMRC not necessarily having access to the information, and indeed I highlighted that earlier when I said that the HMRC is not good at handling things in real time; it is always behind the pace. It is the use of the HMRC that in part is causing the problem. If the Government had chosen to use DWP, they probably could have used a simpler mechanism with the arrangements set up so that a voucher is issued.</p>

Inevitably there will be data transfer periodically rather than in real time, and that will lead to delays. That is the fundamental burden, and it would take a lot to convince me that HMRC will be efficient once it has this to deal with. Structurally, there is a problem in the scheme. The Minister says that it is not right to exclude someone because they have come out of eligibility before the notice is issued. I have no problem with that because it implies that there is no genuine entitlement in the same sense that there is an ongoing entitlement to benefits. For example, a very rich person could register, get his entitlement and move out of benefit simply to get the saving

<a name="90402-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000044"></a>The Government are creating a problem for themselves. The Minister said that having the issue dealt with by declaration was not desirable because it would mean that the person would have to declare to the provider, although the provider would not have to do anything by way of validation. But the rules already provide that the applicant for a saving gateway account should make a declaration that he is entitled to it, and I do not see how anything additional could come from that. I appreciate that the Government want to do it this way, but I do not think that offering people who have a passing acquaintance with the benefits system a three-month entitlement to open an account is the most just way of spending public money. Indeed, to me it seems to be a waste of public money.</p>

Under this subsection the commissioners must issue notices of eligibility. My amendment provides that they may either issue the notices of eligibility or cause them to be issued. In part this picks up the theme I have been developing in the previous amendments because, as I have said, it is not entirely clear why HMRC should be the lead department. Even if it is, it is not clear that it should be the sole body handling the paperwork for saving gateway accounts. The amendment would allow HMRC to arrange with another body, perhaps DWP, the issue of notices of eligibility&#151;in the case of DWP, it would be at the point when the benefits are actually set up. It would then only be necessary for DWP to tell HMRC which notices have been issued.

I am pleased to reassure the noble Baroness that such an amendment is not necessary. Existing legislation in the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 allows the commissioners to delegate certain functions to a third party. The Act gives powers to the commissioners, under Section 12, to make arrangements for the conduct of their proceedings; under Section 14, to delegate their functions to any other persons; and, under Section 9, to do anything, including entering into a contract, that is necessary, expedient, incidental or conducive to the exercise of their functions. This power to delegate would apply to any of the duties conferred on the commissioners by this Bill once it is passed, including the duty to issue notices of eligibility.

This would require HMRC to issue a notice of eligibility within one month of becoming eligible. A person who is entitled to open a saving gateway account should be entitled to receive that privilege at the earliest possible time. Ideally, that would be at the point that eligibility was established either to a tax credit or to a relevant benefit.

It is in that target group that we are seeking to create the habit of saving. Saving requires forms of weekly or monthly budgeting, so that saving is effectively put on one side. The point at which someone become entitled to a tax credit or a benefit is a natural point at which to identify the possible level of regular savings. If there is too big a gap between the start of the benefit or the tax credit and the opportunity to start saving, the income that has already been received by the individual may already be swallowed up or accounted for as part of regular expenditure. It may be more difficult to carve out saving at a later stage. That is why I believe there needs to be a positive duty on HMRC to get notices out promptly.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000054"></a>The Minister will probably say that my amendment goes too far, because if the reasons have nothing to do with the eligible person and HMRC fails to get notice out, there may be doubt about the validity of a notice issued late&#151;for example, if the computer system breaks down completely and has to be rerun and the letters go out late, one would not want that to prevent someone having the saving gateway account. That is certainly not my intention, but there is a lot of scope for HMRC to get notices out very late. A glance at the recent Public Accounts Committee report on HMRC, or previous Treasury Select Committee reports, will show that HMRC often&#151;not deliberately, but as a matter of fact&#151;builds up backlogs in certain areas. A backlog will be harmful to the success of the saving gateway scheme. With that, I hope that the Minister can explain not only what HMRC is expected to do but what will happen if it does not. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000056"></a>HMRC&#146;s saving gateway system will receive periodic updates from the DWP and from the Department for Social Development in Northern Ireland about people who are entitled to the qualifying benefits for the saving gateway. There will be a similar process to transfer information from HMRC&#146;s tax code system. Based on that information, HMRC will issue the notices of eligibility. The amendment would ensure that that is done within one month. We expect that that would largely be the case. The exact frequency of the date of transfer from DWP systems has not yet been determined, as the IT system is still being developed, but it is very likely to be more frequent than once a month, so it should be able to effect exactly what the amendment suggests.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000057"></a>Once the data have been transferred from DWP to HMRC, it will of course need to be matched to the data already held on the saving gateway system to prevent duplicate notices being sent, but there should not be significant delays in the notices of eligibility being issued, because that will be an automated process. I hope that the noble Baroness and the Committee will appreciate that there may be circumstances in which it will just not be possible to issue notices of eligibility within one month of the person becoming eligible.

Their entitlement to the benefit will generally be backdated to the date of their claim, which will therefore be the date on which they were eligible for the saving gateway. A month may have already elapsed. In that situation, it is just impossible for HMRC to meet the requirement that it must issue notices of eligibility within one month of the person becoming eligible.</p>

It may be that for other reasons time has elapsed from the date on which the person is defined as being eligible and HMRC having the information to issue the notice.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000063"></a><b><a name="90402-gc0002.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09040247000390"></a>Lord Newby:</b> This is a probing amendment designed to flush out from the Government how they will attempt to ensure that the take-up of the saving gateway accounts is as high as possible. The amendment proposes that a further notice of eligibility should be issued if, after a set period, a person to whom one was initially sent has not opened the saving gateway account. I have tabled the amendment because I believe that simply sending a single notice of eligibility, particularly one with a set deadline comprising an eligibility period of three months, will result in a low take-up. At Second Reading I gave the example of the child trust funds where take-up is little over 50 per cent in the poorer constituencies, even though in effect the parent is sent a cheque from the Government and told to, &#147;Put this cheque into whichever child trust fund account you wish&#148;. In this case there is far less incentive to open an account because you have nothing in your hand of any value. You trigger a benefit only when you start putting your own money into an account. I believe that if the only communication that eligible people receive is a single, no doubt very formal, letter from HMRC, a lot of them will barely read it, far less act on it. Do the Government have any plans to do anything beyond sending out a single notification of eligibility as a matter of course?</p>

<a name="90402-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000064"></a>Our earlier discussion raises a second point, particularly in respect of people who will be eligible to open a saving gateway account over a long period and who, for one reason or another, might not be in a position to do so as soon as they get a notice of eligibility. I have in mind particularly recipients of carer&#146;s allowance, who might be in receipt of such an allowance for a number of years. When they receive their notice of eligibility, they may be facing a personal crisis within the family or a financial difficulty, which means that they cannot immediately open an account. As I understand it, three months down the line, even though they will still be eligible in theory to open an account, their notice of eligibility will have expired. Therefore, three months and one day after receiving the notice, they will not be able to open an account. Have the Government any plans to deal with this ancillary or secondary problem of people who are eligible over a long period and who may for a variety of good reasons want to open an account, but not be able to do so within the relatively short period of initially receiving a notice of eligibility? Could that period of eligibility be reopened after a set period&#151;for example, a year&#151;if people are still eligible to open an account? I beg to move.</p>

The Government would do better to focus attention on those who are in the benefits or tax credits system in the long term and whose eligibility ought to continue over a longer period of time. Their circumstances in terms of savings may change compared with the current position, which is making sure that people who will not rely on tax credits or benefits over the long term are given the maximum opportunity to take part in the savings gateway scheme. The Government&#146;s emphasis ought to be the other way around, focusing on long-term tax credit and benefits recipients rather than those who are in the system for only a short period.</p>

We are trying to change people&#146;s habits and deal with those who, first, do not have the habit of saving because perhaps they feel that they are not able to save, and, secondly, are ill-equipped with the technicalities of financial administration in terms of managing their own affairs. There is a point in trying to be as helpful as possible to those who may not open a gateway saving account because it is not the way they have done things before. The Bill might be assisted if we took account of this proposal.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000067"></a><b><a name="90402-gc0002.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="09040247000393"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in this short debate. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, indicated at Second Reading that he was concerned about these issues, so I am not surprised that he has raised them in Committee. Once someone&#146;s notice has expired, they will be able to request a repeat notice if at that point they are still eligible to open a saving gateway account, and they need only phone HMRC to arrange it. We are not creating a complicated process for those who signal their intent. The new notice of eligibility would again last for three months, so that people do not have to open an account within three months of receiving the first notice; they can make their own decision about when to open the account.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000068"></a>The noble Lord has been a little unfair about the child trust fund. We are rather delighted that around three out of four families are opening child trust fund accounts for their children, which indicates a strong engagement with the policy. I hear what he says about child trust funds having added and different advantages over this proposal and therefore proving to be more attractive, but I noticed his criticisms and wanted to put him in the picture on the facts. Indeed, even in households with low incomes where fewer child trust fund accounts are being opened, around 65 per cent are nevertheless taking up the entitlement. I wanted to put the record straight on the issue, but I realise that the noble Lord may contend that thee figures apply to a scheme with features which are even more attractive than this one, a point we all appreciate.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000069"></a>The question is whether the repeat notices should be sent out automatically or whether the person should have to request one. Our concern, which we expressed when this issue was considered at reasonable length in the other place, is that automatically sending notices to people could mean them receiving notices that they do not want. They could be getting them every three months, which would make the scheme an annoyance, not make it more attractive. We all know the enormous frustration everyone feels about unwanted letters inviting them to get involved in things that they have clearly made their decisions about.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000070"></a>I understand the point about that automatic repeat notices might help to encourage take-up, as the noble Lord said clearly at Second Reading, but as my noble friend Lord Myners said in his letter, we are thinking carefully about how to raise awareness of the saving gateway among the eligible population. There can be no doubt about the challenge that presents. We are currently developing a detailed marketing strategy that will draw on lessons learnt from the pilots and

We will discuss the important role to be played by organisations that work with the eligible population in providing advice and promoting financial inclusion. The Committee will be aware of the efforts the Government are making in that respect.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000071"></a>At the moment and for the reasons I have set out, we do not intend that notices of eligibility should be automatically re-issued, but the Bill and the draft regulations give us the flexibility to do so in the future. The Bill defines what must be done, but it does not prohibit the possibility of the strategy identified by the noble Lord being followed. We are not persuaded that it is the best marketing tool at present. I hope that he will recognise that he has provoked a debate about how the Government can increase awareness, and that we are concerned about that matter. However, we do not think that this stratagem should be in the Bill.</p>

The idea is that the answer to the problem of someone who does not take this up after three months is that they request a repeat notice by phoning HMRC. The thought of phoning HMRC, frankly, fills me with dread because I am a busy man. The idea that the majority of people on these allowances would take the opportunity to phone HMRC is absolutely fanciful.</p>

The concept that it is alien to HMRC to send out notices that people do not want is curious. Most of the notices HMRC sends out are not particularly well received by the person who receives them, but that is not the point. The notices are sent out because HMRC and the Government think that is in the public interest. I do not find the argument particularly compelling.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000075"></a>The Government say that they are not sure that having an automatic notice is the best way to increase awareness, but they have not set out any convincing arguments about what better ways there are, other than talking in vague terms about marketing tools. My experience of many marketing campaigns by the Government is that they are almost all total failures, even when a huge amount of money is spent, advertising agencies engaged, posters drafted and so on.</p>

Under the subsection, a person is eligible if he is entitled to the benefits or tax credits listed in subsection (2). The Government have consistently said that they wish to use passporting as the basis for eligibility for a saving gateway account. I assume, therefore, that the word &#147;entitled&#148; in subsection (1)(a) means that a person has made a successful claim for the benefit concerned.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000079"></a>The Minister will be aware that the take-up of benefits and tax credits is far short of the total of those who are eligible. It varies between the benefits. The recent PAC report, to which I have already referred this afternoon, said that take-up of working tax credit is only 61 per cent, and that one in five families do not take up child tax credits. Jobseeker&#146;s allowance take-up is, again, only around 60 per cent. In another place on Report, the Minister said that an additional 2.8 million people could qualify for a saving gateway account if they actually claimed the benefit for which they are eligible.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000080"></a>The way in which the Government are approaching the saving gateway account is to remove those persons from saving gateway eligibility because they do not, for whatever reason, wish to apply for one of these benefits. However, why should they be denied access to an opportunity for a savings incentive if they wish to apply for that alone, independent of applying for a benefit? My amendment is designed to allow a person to establish an entitlement to a saving gateway account if they otherwise satisfy the requirements for one of

Thus, if the person is entitled to claim, under the terms of my amendment he could have a saving gateway account.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000081"></a>The amendment is probing for today&#146;s Grand Committee because I recognise that the processes that have been designed around saving gateway accounts are predicated on the establishment of an entitlement to a payment of benefit or tax credit, and there would need to be a different approach for those who did not want to do anything but apply for a saving gateway account voucher. The Minister will doubtless say that costs would increase that way but, since the non take-up of benefits and tax credits is very high&#151;we are talking about millions of people being excluded from the saving gateway account&#151;the justice of passporting looks to be very rough indeed. There is a case for allowing through those who for reasons of dignity or otherwise do not want to apply for a means-tested benefit, but take a different approach to a beneficial savings scheme. Why should they not be allowed access to the saving gateway scheme? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000082"></a><b><a name="90402-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09040247000401"></a>Lord Myners:</b> I note that the noble Baroness describes this as a probing amendment. It would extend the scheme to people who could claim a qualifying benefit or tax credits but do not do so. As the noble Baroness said, these are people within our target group but who will not be eligible under a system of passporting. Unfortunately, it would not be possible for HMRC to identify this group, so I do not believe that the amendment would be workable. There is simply no way of knowing whether someone would be eligible for these benefits unless they make a claim for them. One option would be to introduce a means test alongside passporting. We will come to that in more detail when we discuss Amendments 8 and 12, also in the name of the noble Baroness, but this seems to be particularly problematic. Given that the people in this group have chosen not to claim the qualifying benefits or tax credit, it seems unlikely that many would choose to complete a means test to apply for the saving gateway.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000083"></a>Many people do choose to claim benefits and tax credits. For example, 82 per cent of eligible families receive child tax credit. That is the highest level of take-up for income-related support ever achieved. The take-up is even higher for households with incomes below &#163;10,000, at 96 per cent, and for lone parents at 95 per cent. Take-up rates for out-of-work income-related benefits are also relatively high at between 49 per cent and 60 per cent for income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance, and between 81 per cent and 90 per cent for income support. We are also simplifying and streamlining the benefits system to make it easier to understand and to help further increase take-up rates. While I understand what the noble Baroness is trying to achieve, I hope that she will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The combined effect of the amendments would allow eligibility to be set by reference to annual income rather than a successful claim for a specified benefit or tax credit. That is a wider concept than I argued for in my previous amendment. It would allow but not require the Government to extend the opportunity to save to other groups not included in the selected benefits set out in Clause 3(2).</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000086"></a>For example, it would allow carers on limited incomes to be drawn into the scheme whether or not carer&#146;s allowance is claimed, and would go beyond the government amendments to which we shall come shortly. It would also allow older people who are poor to come within the scheme, regardless of their pension credit status. Pension credit take-up is another of the notoriously low take-up benefits. The amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, which is a couple of groups away, goes only so far as pensioners who fall within the pension credit net. It would also allow the Government to extend the saving gateway scheme to slightly higher income levels than those within the means-tested benefits limits if that were thought to be socially desirable in terms of the aim of increasing savings.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000087"></a>I am definitely not arguing that the Government should immediately extend the saving gateway scheme to all others on low incomes. Apart from the public expenditure implications, which could be very significant in view of the current economic situation, very careful consideration would need to be given to which groups would benefit most. However, I am arguing for the Bill to be more flexible so that if we return to an economic environment which allows the Government to pursue additional worthy schemes for incentivising savings, the saving gateway scheme could be extended without the need for further primary legislation.</p>

I should have tabled an amendment to Clause 27 because I certainly would not want the scheme extended as I have described without further parliamentary scrutiny. That apart, I believe that, if circumstances allow, the Bill should be able to move outside the envelope of simply passporting this measure by way of benefits or tax credits if that were thought desirable in the longer term. I argue simply for flexibility. I beg to move.</p>

My noble friend&#146;s response in terms of the statistics of those carried by passported benefits into the system are very persuasive. However, there are benefits which are not included here which knock out some of the income-related benefits. I take, for example&#151;though this is, obviously, a diminishing number&#151;somebody on a widow&#146;s benefit, which is not listed, who, were they not on a widow&#146;s benefit, would qualify for, say, income support if they had children, but choose not to take it up because they prefer to remain on the widow&#146;s benefit. That is an older group of people and one that is diminishing in number, but they possibly would be eligible under means testing but not under passporting.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000090"></a>I have not thought about this but I suspect that if I dug around on things such as industrial injuries I might find other groups who would come within the framework of the measure but are knocked out because of this listing effect. I do not know how many people would be involved, and I do not know how widely they would be drawn. Obviously, if my noble friend were minded to accept my amendments, or to revisit my Amendments 11 and 15, it would be a very wide group indeed, but I am not confident that he will feel able to do that. It seems to me desirable for the Government to take up this power. Although I think that the Government&#146;s passporting approach is absolutely the right one, which should bring the vast majority of people into the system very easily and straightforwardly without the hassle factor, the means testing would allow a belt-and-braces approach to be adopted towards people who we may wish to include in the scheme some time down the line but would not be able to include as we would not have the primary powers so to do. My noble friend would be wise to take up the power even if there is no intention or need to take advantage of it in the next three, four or five years.</p>

First, I see complexity beginning to emerge when one starts to work out who will be eligible even under what appears to be a simple requirement. I can see all kinds of groups benefiting who we will not really have in our minds to benefit. We should think how many middle-class students will leave university this year, and who, certainly for the first six months after leaving university, will probably have virtually nil income. If there was means eligibility

That might be a good thing, but it is not what we are aiming for.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000092"></a>I sense that this amendment, if it were put in the Bill and implemented, would leave us with a scheme that is not only more complex, but could also create a series of unintended consequences. The advantage of the scheme as it stands, with or without the proposed amendment of the noble Baroness, is that it has a clarity to it, and that goes very much in its favour.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000093"></a><b><a name="90402-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09040247000407"></a>Lord Myners:</b> These amendments relate to eligibility for the savings gateway account, and as with Amendment 7, aim to extend it to people who will not be eligible under the system of passporting. To that end I am greatly encouraged by the support of my noble friend Lady Hollis for the concept of passporting. As he so often does, the noble Lord, Lord Newby, has hit the nail squarely on the head in terms of seeing the spectre of greater complexity as a result of the good intention that lies behind this amendment, and that comes into conflict with the basic approach of keeping this scheme as simple as possible&#151;an approach that is also consistent with the observation of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, that HMRC might be better at administering something simple than something terribly complicated.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000094"></a>As Members of the Committee will know, the focus of the saving gateway is on working age people on lower incomes. In an ideal world we would like to include everyone in that group and no one outside it. However, there is no easy way of doing that. One option would be to introduce a means test, but that would require people to apply for eligibility for the saving gateway. The alternative, for which we have opted, is a system of passporting eligibility from certain benefits and tax credits. We believe that this is the most simple and effective method available for determining saving gateway eligibility, and in contrast with a means test, people will not be required to approach the Government or fill out detailed forms about their income. This approach will be much more effective in encouraging people to open saving gateway accounts. It would seem rather disingenuous to have a power to introduce a means test, but with no intention of using it. We also believe that the majority of our target group&#151;working-age people on lower incomes&#151;will be eligible for the saving gateway through the system of passporting as set out in the Bill. As we have said, we expect around 8 million people to be eligible for the scheme, which is a sizable proportion of the 40 million or so adults in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000095"></a>However, we have always been clear that while we think passporting is the best system for determining eligibility, we also recognise that it is not perfect. Some working people on lower incomes will not be eligible for the scheme, and there will be some rough edges. The Economic Secretary to the Treasury gave an indication of the numbers in his contribution in another place. As he said, we believe that around 4.5 million working age people on lower incomes will not be eligible through passporting, taking a definition of lower income as  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC311"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column GC311</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#163;10,000 to &#163;11,000 for an individual and &#163;16,000 for a household. However, it is important to remember that this is a snapshot and that people&#146;s circumstances do change. Many in this group will therefore be eligible for the saving gateway at some point, and in any case we intend to allow people to have only one account per lifetime, so this is an important point.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000096"></a>Amendments 8 and 12 would introduce a second way of becoming eligible for the saving gateway in addition to passporting&#151;by means of having an income below a certain level which would, of course, require a means test. As the noble Baroness has said, this would give some additional people a way of accessing the saving gateway, which in itself would sound a laudable and commendable outcome. It would also introduce a significant increase in complexity and cost. We do not believe that this would be proportionate.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000097"></a>First, it would involve extra costs for HMRC, which are estimated at around &#163;2.5 million per year, reducing to a steady state of &#163;1 million after introduction. Secondly, there would also be an increased compliance risk of operating a means test, as individuals would be able to open saving gateway accounts without having previously been through DWP and HMRC checks to establish their eligibility to other benefits or tax credits. Inevitably, some accounts would be opened but subsequently have to be closed; for example, accounts opened by people who had misstated or misunderstood their income. That would be very burdensome for providers. We know that opening and closing accounts will create costs for them and we are keen to minimise the costs of operating saving gateway accounts. It must be very clear to Members of the Committee that the operation of saving gateway accounts will not be a terribly profitable activity for banks to engage in, but it is one which we think banks will welcome in terms of their commitment to promoting financial inclusion. However, we must be careful that we do not deter the provision of product by making the scheme too complicated. Thirdly, having two methods of determining eligibility for the saving gateway could be confusing and would add complexity to an otherwise simple system.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000098"></a>It is also important to be realistic about the impact that a means test would have. As we discussed in relation to Amendment 7, of the 4.5 million working-age people on lower incomes who we believe would be missed out by passporting, we estimate that around 60 per cent&#151;or 2.7 million&#151;could claim the qualifying benefits and tax credits, but have not done so. While that is not a reason to exclude them from the scheme, it does seem unlikely that large numbers of them would choose to complete a means test for a saving gateway account when they have not done so for a benefit or for tax credits.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000099"></a>Clause 3(6) allows flexibility to add more qualifying benefits through regulation, which would potentially include those benefits mentioned by my noble friend Lady Hollis. We would need to consider this carefully, but that flexibility has been built into the Bill. While I understand the noble Baroness&#146;s aims with these amendments&#151;on several occasions, I expressed a good and supportive understanding&#151;I do not believe that   


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC312"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column GC312</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it would be sensible to introduce a system of means testing, which would add complexity and cost. Instead, I believe that we should continue with a simple, efficient system of passporting, which will allow a large majority of our target audience to be eligible at some point in their lives. I hope that the noble Baroness will therefore withdraw her amendments.</p>

This amendment is different from the previous amendment, which tried automatically to bring additional people within the scheme. This amendment is designed only to give the Government longer-term flexibility. I am amazed at the ingenuity of the Treasury in costing something which was not specified. I introduced my amendment, which was quite wide, to allow eligibility though an annual income of a prescribed amount, which gives a lot of scope for setting the possible alteration. Yet the Minister came back with some numbers; namely, that it would cost &#163;2.5 million reducing to a steady state of &#163;1 million&#151;I am astonished by that&#151;regardless of how any regulations might be constructed. Clearly, the powers of the Treasury are getting greater by the day.</p>

If it would be helpful to give more credibility to those numbers by explaining how they have been determined, I will share that information with those who have participated in this debate.</p>

At the heart of this is whether any extension of the scheme would be too complex, which I would not like to prejudge. I accept the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, that certain types of extension of the scheme could raise the problem of unintended consequences or excessive complexity. There could be extensions that are not captured by simply adding additional benefits. The benefits that the noble Baroness referred to might be a step too far without some counterbalance. Of course, I am not normally in favour of means testing, but I recognise that it may be desirable to expand the envelope where appropriate if we are trying to encourage savings. I do not rule out including students, because one problem is that young people have not grown up with a habit of saving; they have grown up with a habit of consumption. There is a great need to re-educate a whole generation about the benefits of saving.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000103"></a>I was disappointed that the Government did not want to include that flexibility in the Bill. As I tried to emphasise, I do not think that it is a foregone conclusion that it would be right to extend the provision. Clearly, it would be right to weigh complexity and cost, as well as unintended consequences, in the balance if an extension were pursued. I shall consider carefully what the Minister said, and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Paragraph (b) states that the connection with the UK necessary gateway eligibility is to be prescribed in regulations in its entirety. My amendment would narrow that flexibility. I do not think that there is much of substance between us and the Government on this. The point of my amendment is to ensure that as much as possible is in the Bill, leaving only detail and genuine flexibility to be the preserve of regulations.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000105"></a>During Second Reading, we touched on the fact that the Bill is one long regulation-making power. The amendment is a modest attempt at rebalancing between primary and secondary legislation. The Government's draft regulations set out in Regulation 4 that the necessary connection is to be ordinary residence. We agree with that, which is why the first leg of my amendment, paragraph (i), picks that up. Regulation 4 then contains some savings for Crown servants posted overseas and some EU workers, but does not require the persons concerned ever to have been resident in the UK, which I found rather surprising. Hence paragraph (ii) states, in effect, that the minimum requirement is for actual residence at some point, which can then be coupled with regulations to deal with ordinary residence.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000106"></a>When he replies, I hope that the Minister can explain two things. First, why cannot the Bill contain the restriction to ordinary residence? The Government usually argue for flexibility in leaving everything to regulations, but I cannot see that it would ever be appropriate to propose regulations that were not based on the fundamental notion of ordinary residence.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000107"></a>Secondly, can the Minister explain why it is possible to satisfy the definition in the regulations without ever having established residence in the UK? We are all rather wearily resigned to EU workers coming here to claim all our benefits, which is what Regulation 4(3) allows. However, I am concerned about someone being deported here without ever having been resident here, which could occur under the draft regulations, but could not occur if my amendment, which would insert a requirement for residence, were passed. I beg to move.</p>

The argument for having regulation-making powers is that the provision covered by regulation will change. It is very difficult to change primary legislation, whereas you can easily change secondary legislation. I cannot for the life of me see why eligibility in terms of a link with the UK will change. Whatever the definition is now will surely be the same definition in five years&#146; time, or for however long we expect the Bill to be in operation. Can the Minister explain why the Government

We accept that there may be some need for flexibility in some of the detail, for people such as Crown servants&#151;other categories may come in over time. However, one of the issues that I raised was why that bit is required to be in secondary legislation, not primary. Powers to make secondary legislation should be restricted to things that might change over time, not things that should be fixed points.</p>

That would mean, broadly, that only people who live or work in the United Kingdom can open a saving gateway account.

I would welcome such a letter if it were to address the situation of, say, someone from Poland who is working in the building trade here and whose wife and children are back in Poland. His earnings are such that he does not qualify for working tax credit but he qualifies for child tax credit, which is an exportable benefit. For these purposes, is he resident in the United Kingdom and therefore eligible for the saving gateway scheme? There are issues which I accept are almost impossible to untangle. Given that that is a high value benefit, it is of some concern.</p>

My amendment was intended to probe that as well as the specifics that have taken us into some interesting byways. I look forward to receiving that letter as I am sure do other Members of the Committee. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Some of us in this House have spent a lot of time saying, &#147;Don&#146;t forget the carers&#148;, most notably the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, and we are glad to see that they have not been forgotten on this occasion. I have already declared that my wife and I are carers. We are not affected by the amendment, because we do not claim a carer&#146;s allowance, and we do not intend to do so. I am also a patron of the charity Rethink, and in that capacity I have had a good number of meetings with carers. My wife has regular meetings with carers in south-west England, so we know quite a lot about it.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000126"></a>As the Minister may know, some carers feel that they are neglected. Indeed, that has been a feature of life over quite a few years. For myself, I do not think that the financial effects will be all that great, but certainly the effect on opinion among carers will be highly favourable, and that is important. They form a large category, and for that reason we should warmly welcome these amendments from the Government.</p>

They indicate not only that the Government recognise the financial problems faced by carers, but that it would be quite wrong to exclude a group of people who make such a huge contribution to society from the opportunity to take advantage of this modest savings measure. As I said at Second Reading, the original decision to exclude the recipients of carer&#146;s allowance went quite counter to the Government&#146;s previous record so far as carers are concerned. They have been extremely supportive, as set out in the national strategy. I am sure that carers everywhere will welcome this amendment, as I most certainly do.</p>

This is the next step in a whole package of wonderful things that the Government have done for carers, including bringing them within the national insurance credit system for the state pension when their caring duties occupy more than 20 hours.

Whether that time will come, we shall see.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000130"></a>I am revisiting an issue I raised at Second Reading, which is to allow pensioners on pension credit to come within the saving gateway. My noble friend responded, as always, fully and courteously but, on rereading, I was not persuaded even by the elegance of his arguments&#151;and he offered us five.</p>
<h5><a name="09040247000353"></a>1.45 pm</h5>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000131"></a>The first argument was that pensioners are already incentivised to save by tax relief of some &#163;30 billion attached to pension contributions during one&#146;s working life. If that results in a pension, that is great, but someone on pension credit almost by definition&#151;though not entirely&#151;has not got an occupational pension, otherwise they would not be eligible for pension credit, and so has not enjoyed those tax reliefs which, as the noble Lord knows and accepts, favour the better off.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000132"></a>The typical pension credit recipient is a widow, who probably has no history of full-time work and, if there were an occupational pension in the family, it probably died with him. Pension tax relief as a support for pensioners does not particularly help the group on pension credit, which the amendment seeks to help. That was my noble friend&#146;s first argument.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000133"></a>The second argument suggested that they will enjoy personal accounts. That is great and wonderful, and it will take something like 25 years for it to make pension credit redundant and therefore to overcome the need now for the saving gateway.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000134"></a>Thirdly, he argued that pensioners have higher rates of savings. His statistics&#151;I have not rechecked them, but I am sure that I did not misread what he said&#151;were that one in four working households do not have savings, but only one in five or six pensioner households do not, and therefore that is a reason to discriminate in favour of the one and against the other. That is just about statistically significant, but it is not particularly policy significant. Either way, there is a sizeable group without savings who need them. This should be based on need, not on age, gender, or where you live. We can target it. Pension credit is a very good proxy for low income and low or negligible savings up to &#163;6,000. After all, sizeable savings will disqualify you from pension credit.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000135"></a>Fourthly, my noble friend rightly reminded us of the excellent track record that this Government have delivered to pensioners, from free prescriptions to bus passes; like others here today, I am delighted about that. But a free TV licence for the over 75s does not help those under 75 to purchase a new TV set; or indeed if you over 75. My noble friend is right about what has been done, but we have equally done admirably for people of working age.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000136"></a>I will not bore the Committee, but I could gratefully recite a list of excellent initiatives that the Government have offered to people of working age, from benefit rollover on entering work, to linking rules, to New Deal support, to pathway bonuses, to earnings disregards, to tax credits. It is not clear to me that working people are more disadvantaged than pensioners in terms of the support received from the Government, and that  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC319"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column GC319</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this is therefore a reason for including the one and excluding the other. They have both been helped, absolutely rightly, and it is arguable that working people have been helped even more proportionately than pensioners.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000137"></a>My noble friend quotes the rise in the basic state pension. I am sure that he would agree&#151;this is the debate about the IPPR report&#151;that a helpful rise in income, which is wonderful, absolutely does not vitiate the need for some modest savings as well. They are not either/or. Indeed, I hope that the extra income offered by the Government in their proposed increases in basic state pension from 5 April will generate some modest margin which, if supported by the saving gateway, could allow pensioners, one of that 17 per cent, for the first time to have some savings. She&#151;it is usually she&#151;would then be better able to manage lumpy expenditure, such as the washing machine, without going into debt or seeking loans from her family, who may be equally hard pressed. She would have the psychological as well as the financial security of a few hundred pounds behind her.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000138"></a>I repeat that this amendment is targeted only on those on pension credit, who are the poorest pensioners, mostly older, single women, but also some men and women who have always had a difficult relationship with the labour market, for whatever reason. I calculate that perhaps half of those on pension credit have no savings at all, and the rest have very little. Old age is full of risk, so many older people feel highly vulnerable, in a literal sense in terms of their health and personal safety but also through their financial precariousness. This would make a difference&#151;a modest one, but a difference.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000139"></a>Finally, given the forthcoming Equalities Bill and its welcome measures to end age discrimination in the provision of goods including financial services, does not a new savings product which effectively has an upper age limit challenge the spirit&#151;and possibly also the letter, for all I know, although we have not yet seen it fully&#151;of such a Bill? In the light of all this, can I today persuade my noble friend to reconsider?</p>

<p><a name="09040247000140"></a><b><a name="90402-gc0004.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="09040247000434"></a>Lord Newby:</b> One of the arguments against the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment, with which I have considerable sympathy, is that a purpose of the saving gateway accounts is to help inculcate the savings habit. The argument is presumably that if you have not acquired the savings habit by the time you reach pensionable age, you are probably not going to.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000141"></a>However, that principle does not apply to other government incentives to save, of which the ISA is the most obvious example. With ISAs, which apply throughout an individual&#146;s life, the Government are giving a considerable incentive to save, much greater than via this provision, on the basis that they want promote saving full stop. If you accept the argument behind the ISA&#151;somebody earning enough to get tax relief on savings is eligible for it throughout their life because the Government think that one should be able to open an ISA aged 65 or 75, rather than it be age-limited&#151;it is difficult to see the logic in not applying that principle to the Bill. I therefore have considerable sympathy with the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment.</p>

I do not think that the amendment is required, as the Government have taken the power to add the credit if they believe that it is necessary. Probably the one thing that would worry me is the extent to which this would add to the cost of the scheme. Allowing the saving gateway accounts to be set up is not cheap, and I worry about the cost. Of course, there would be no pilots on pensioners, so we do not know what the effect would be and whether it would have some unintended consequences.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000143"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Newby, however, my first instinct was that this does not help a savings habit because if you are of pensionable age it is too late to acquire it. However, I recognise that considerable numbers of older people, like younger people, have no reserve savings. Anything that assists them to acquire some is worthwhile. Many people cannot cope with even the smallest financial upsets, such as cookers blowing up and things like that. Anything that helps more people to cope with that themselves can only be regarded as a good thing, but I do have a concern about cost.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000144"></a><b><a name="90402-gc0004.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="09040247000436"></a>Lord Newby:</b> To come back on that question of cost, I have been enjoying reading the Ipsos MORI note that the Minister made available earlier. It said that one of the main reasons why people did not continue to save under the scheme was that they had since retired. The proportion of people who would take up this proposed eligibility would not be great. There obviously is a cost, but I wonder what proportion of people would take it up, and just how great that cost would be.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000145"></a><b><a name="90402-gc0004.htm_spnew22"></a><a name="09040247000437"></a>Lord Myners:</b> As the noble Baroness has said, these amendments would make some or all of the claimants of pension credit eligible for the saving gateway. As I said at Second Reading, we greatly value the expertise of the noble Baroness on these issues and have very carefully considered the points that she has made. However, I have to say that we do not necessarily agree. Her main point was that it is wrong to assume that pensioners should necessarily run down their assets in retirement and that pensioners do need income and capital. It is true that people tend to build assets over their working lives and run them down once they reach pension age. This is the so-called life-cycle hypothesis of savings behaviour put forward by Modigliani and others, based on people saving in order to smooth consumption over their lifetime. That does not mean that no one wants to save in their retirement and that is not what I am trying to suggest.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000146"></a>But who should the additional incentive of the saving gateway be targeted on? I do not deny that some pensioners would benefit from this, but many will already have developed a savings habit and have built up their assets. As I said at Second Reading, there is significant support from the Government for them to do that&#151;for example, through tax relief on pension contributions. As the noble Baroness has said, the difference is not large but it is there. The evidence is that pensioners have higher savings ratios than average.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC321"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column GC321</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000147"></a>While I am not trying to argue that no pensioners would benefit from the saving gateway, we believe that it should be focused on people of working age rather than pension age. The other reason for this is the significant support already available to pensioners. The noble Baroness spoke about pensioners who might run down their assets and was rightly concerned most about the poorest pensioners. However, more so than for the rest of the population, there is support in place for pensioners who find themselves without assets; namely, through specific measures to help them to meet particular expenditures, such as the winter fuel allowance or free prescriptions and through support, such as the basic state pension and pension credit. These measures, as the noble Baroness pointed out at Second Reading, are focused on pensioners&#146; income, rather than capital, but they help to tackle the symptoms of having low levels of assets and make that easier to deal with.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000148"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked about ISAs, which followed his observation at Second Reading when I believe he spoke about a class division; namely, that we seem to be giving huge benefits to people who already are on higher incomes or have a higher level of assets. I am very sympathetic to that. There are many benefits to savers and the middle classes, which are significant, welcome and very much a part of government policy, but they are probably underappreciated and undervalued in the hands of the recipient, and in terms of general acknowledgement and recognition of the cost to the Exchequer.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000149"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked whether this would be a one-off situation. As Members of the Committee will know, one of the aims of the saving gateway is to get people to save, sometimes for the first time. Therefore, it offers a very strong incentive to save. From our studies, the evidence suggests that this can happen. We have had encouraging responses from the first pilot. We believe that the saving gateway should be a one-off, acting as a catalyst rather than an ongoing incentive, which would also dramatically increase its costs if it was to be hardwired into being a benefit for all time.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000150"></a>That approach was supported by the witnesses who gave evidence to the Public Bill Committee in the other place. In particular, Miss Sharon Collard of the Personal Finance Research Centre at the University of Bristol agreed with the idea that the saving gateway was,</p>
<ul><a name="09040247000341"></a>&#147;to provide an initial boost to get people into a savings habit&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09040247000308"></a>She went on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="09040247000342"></a>&#147;there is evidence that that can happen&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09040247000309"></a>In addition, Mr Brian Pomeroy, the chair of the Financial Inclusion Taskforce, also said that it was right,</p>
<ul><a name="09040247000343"></a>&#147;that they get only one shot, because the basis of the scheme is that it should be a kick-start&#148;.</ul><h5><a name="09040247000354"></a>2 pm</h5>

<a name="90402-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000151"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, offered qualified support for the amendment, but went on to say&#151;as I intended to&#151;that it is not required because

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000152"></a>I greatly applaud the indefatigable energy and commitment of my noble friend in support of many groups whose case is not always advocated as well as it should be. My noble friend has worked with great energy and distinction to understand the complexities of life for many in the community who are less fortunate&#151;in particular, carers and the elderly. I am much moved by the arguments that she advances, but I fear that I am not persuaded that it is appropriate for the Government to accept the amendment, so I beg her indulgence to withdraw it.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000153"></a><b><a name="90402-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09040247000438"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> I shall be withdrawing the amendment, but I thank noble Lords for taking part in this short debate, even if their support has been qualified in various and, in some respects, conflicting ways. As always, I am grateful for my noble friend&#146;s courtesy and consideration. I am reassured by the point that both he and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, made about the reserve power, should that be regarded as desirable in future. I return to the simple point that a savings habit is not about moral fibre; in the end, it is to help people acquire savings. The question is: what happens if you are someone who struggles through their working life&#151;for example, a woman who has been a lone parent and been bumping along on various forms of income support and all the rest&#151;and enter retirement with no savings at all? It is too late to revisit choices that you might have made previously, but your need for that modest financial buffer remains.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000154"></a>My noble friend is right to say that we hope that will be a diminishing group, given the initiatives that the Government are proceeding with, but currently the Government have no offer available to pensioners who enter retirement or to current pensioners who have no savings. That is, unless they use an offer like the winter fuel payment and do not spend it on keeping themselves warm but save it&#151;hoard it&#151;in ways that we would not want them to do, given all the evidence about hypothermia. There is evidence that there are 30,000 winter deaths a year from hypothermia beyond the standardised mortality figures. Instead of using it to keep themselves warm and avoid hypothermia, they save it to replace the cooker or the washing machine. That is not a choice that is decent to ask them to make.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000155"></a>I take my noble friend&#146;s point. I understand where he is coming from: that this was designed as a benefit for those of working age. However, to some degree it shows a failure to understand the situation of someone who has had a rough life and is entering a difficult retirement without any reserves. In that case, something such as this would give them a desirable cushion. However, given that we can revisit this in future&#151;some of us may well do so&#151;I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

They amend subsections (4) and (5) of Clause 3 and deal with restrictions on the passporting of child tax credit recipients. Again, I do not think that there is much in substance between us and the Government since the draft regulations give effect to the already stated intention of restricting child tax credit recipients to those on no more than the income threshold for child tax credit. That will rule out those who have considerably higher incomes because child tax credit goes up to around &#163;60,000 of income or even higher if the &#163;25,000 disregard comes into play. We have absolutely no problem with that policy.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000157"></a>What we do have a problem with is that the legislation makes it optional for the Government to issue regulations restricting the right of a child tax credit recipient to gain access to the saving gateway scheme as set out in subsection (4). The effect of subsections (4) and (5) is that even if regulations are made under subsection (4), they need not contain income or similar restrictions to narrow the scope of those eligible for child tax credit also to have access to the saving gateway. We believe that the construction of child tax credit, with its extraordinarily long income taper, means that if eligibility is the passport to the saving gateway scheme, it must be accompanied by restrictions. We agree that restrictions are best set out in secondary legislation, but we are clear that there must be such secondary legislation, which is why I have tabled the three amendments in this group. I beg to move.</p>

It is our intention to apply the conditions set out in the draft regulations. We propose that people can be eligible for the saving gateway only by virtue of entitlement to tax credits where their income does not exceed a specified threshold or where they are entitled to one of the social security benefits specified in Section 7(2) of the Tax Credits Act. The amendments would require that such conditions

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000159"></a>I have set out our intentions with regard to the legislation, but we think it right that the Bill should allow some flexibility for the future. I should say to the noble Baroness that if I had &#163;5 for every time I have replied to an Opposition amendment which would replace &#147;may&#148; with &#147;shall&#148;, I would be very wealthy indeed. This is another clear case where it looks desirable that there should be some determination because we agree about the intention of how the scheme will work. We have &#147;may&#148; rather than &#147;shall&#148; so often in legislation, and we are not the first Administration to do so. Gladstone&#146;s Administration probably set up the practice, if not even earlier than that. I use Gladstone as an illustration to try to get the noble Lord, Lord Newby, on board.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000160"></a>The obvious fact is that governments have an intent. They have a Bill that they intend to turn into law which should work according to the parameters of the time. &#147;May&#148; comes into legislation instead of &#147;shall&#148; because legislation is primary and cannot easily be amended. Replacement by primary legislation is a fearsome task and governments want to preserve a degree of flexibility for the future, if only to have regard to the trials and tribulations of those who come after them. I speak almost in hereditary terms about Labour, of course, but I have to expect that at some time in the future we might have to contemplate a Liberal Administration&#151;I know that the noble Baroness was rising to that possibility with enthusiasm&#151;or even a Conservative one. Within that framework, I want to defend the necessary flexibility. As time evolves and circumstances change, this legislation will still hold good for the concept of the saving gateway. We are at one with the noble Baroness, which is why we built in the requirements. We will operate it and we have already indicated in our draft regulations that that is how we intend to apply it. We have some regard for flexibility in legislation. I hope that I have succeeded in persuading the noble Baroness of the virtues of that approach.</p>

That may be the case, but I have to tell him that it is not the last such debate&#151;not even the last in this Bill. He will have to deal with some more. As he knows, we table amendments in areas in which we think there should be no discretion or flexibility for the Government over time. I am aware that parliamentary draftsmen normally default to &#147;may&#148;, but we have occasionally won an amendment on &#147;shall&#148;. I shall remind him of that when it is clear that the regulations must be passed. I could cite a recent example from the Pensions Bill from last year, but I shall not taunt him with it. This is probably not one of those instances that I regard as most important, and I accept the Minister&#146;s clear assertion, as is laid out in the draft regulations, that the Government intend to restrict the availability of child tax credit recipients to the saving gateway account. I am sure that the Minister knows that the conditions of the saving gateway account are far too generous for

Subsection (1) sets out the basic rule that HMRC will approve account providers in accordance with the ever-present regulations. My amendment says that when HMRC does this, it must have regard to the desirability of choice being available to persons who wish to open a saving gateway account. This is not a mere doctrinal issue about choice, although that is important; my amendment speaks to the difficulties that the Government may have in getting account providers to put themselves forward for inclusion in the saving gateway scheme. We debated that at Second Reading, when the noble Lord, Lord Newby, and I both drew attention to the evidence given in the Public Bill Committee in another place about the willingness and enthusiasm to take part in the scheme from potential account providers.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000163"></a>The banks&#146; view, as expressed in another place and in subsequent briefing to noble Lords taking part in this Bill is based on commercial viability. They believe that the accounts may be too costly to be worth taking on, and we shall return to some of the issues that lie at the heart of their concerns in later amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Myners, seemed not to recognise this; he told us at Second Reading that banks, together with building societies,</p>
<ul><a name="09040247000344"></a>&#147;now recognise the increased value of a loyal depositor base from retail deposits, rather than reliance on wholesale deposits&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/3/09; col. 138.]</ul>
<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000164"></a>I believe that the Minister chose not to understand that banks and others will welcome a depositor base only if it can be operated profitably. There is no point in attracting deposits if it costs money to maintain the accounts. A saving gateway account will not amount to more than &#163;600 before a maturity payment, and let us say that the average is half that. I do not think that the Minister can seriously claim that accounts at that level are likely to be attractive to banks as they will face costly record-keeping and potentially face transfer requirements and the like. The record-keeping is

<h5><a name="09040247000355"></a>2.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000165"></a>The Post Office, which also gave evidence in another place, was extremely keen on the saving gateway scheme and would very much like to offer it. However, Mr Alan Cook, the managing director, made it clear that the Post Office could participate only with a partner to do the administrative work, and doubtless also to invest in the basic infrastructure. He also referred to the need for an unspecified market share being necessary to make the scheme work economically. It is far from clear that the Post Office&#146;s clear enthusiasm about the saving gateway scheme will convert to actual participation in the scheme. That is all down to economics.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000166"></a>Against this background, I have a concern that HMRC may well end up grasping whatever willing provider comes its way. I think that it could be undesirable if HMRC went with one provider of saving gateway accounts because the service levels provided to saving gateway account holders will, in effect, be set by that one provider on a monopolist basis. That one provider will call the long-term shots on how the scheme operates because the barriers to entry by other participants may well be erected on a de facto basis.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000167"></a>Keeping HMRC focused on choice, which is all that my amendment does, will keep it focused on the uneconomic aspects of the saving gateway scheme in its detailed application of the regulations. It may also force HMRC to come back to the Treasury if some of the draft regulations prove to be a barrier to getting account providers to sign up or, more specifically, to get more than one account provider to sign up.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000168"></a>On Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Myners, was somewhat complacent about the willingness of financial services providers to take part in the scheme. Our understanding continues to be that the banks are far from comfortable with it. On Second Reading we also debated the role of the nationalised banks. The Minister did not like our using the term &#147;nationalised banks&#148;. We could call them &#147;public sector banks&#148; if there is sensitivity around the other term, but they mean much the same. Whatever we call them, it is clearly possible that the Government could lean on them to provide saving gateway accounts&#151;it is like kicking a man when he is down. I believe that it would be undesirable for that to happen, as genuine choice would not be available if the choice were only between nationalised or public sector banks.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000169"></a>I have raised this issue because having more than one provider is important if the saving gateway scheme is to be counted as anything like a success, not only in the short term but in the longer term, for the reasons I have given. When the Minister replies, I hope that he can update the Committee on whether there is any realistic possibility that there will be a choice of providers for saving gateway accounts and whether that will result in real choice for consumers. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC327"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column GC327</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>saving gateway accounts. It is absolutely clear that the Post Office is very keen on them, but when its representative gave evidence to the Bill Committee in another place, he said in terms that it did not have a financial model which enabled him to have any confidence that it could make them work financially.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000171"></a>As for the other banks, the BBA made it clear that none was committed to the scheme, and none was looking at it with any enthusiasm whatever. Although the noble Baroness talks about the desirability of choice, I do not think that we are in that luxurious position. My concern is that, as things stand, there will not be a single national provider at all.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000172"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Myners, mentioned earlier that he thought that the banks had a commitment to promoting financial inclusion. Well, they do as long as it does not harm the bottom line. I do not believe that this scheme can work on a straightforward commercial basis; the amount going into the accounts is just too low compared with the inevitable costs, however minimal, surrounding them. The noble Baroness says she thinks that the choice would be inadequate if it was only between the nationalised banks. If the choice is only between nationalised banks, it will be a far greater choice than we will get otherwise. That may be the only option for having any choice at all.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000173"></a>I therefore urge the Government to have discussions with the nationalised banks about their doing this. I am sure that they will say that they cannot do it on a commercial basis. If they cannot do it commercially&#151;I have no idea how much subsidy will be required&#151;and if, as the Government believe, it is a matter of great significance, perhaps they could take it out of some of the other funds that they are devoting to community investment. The banks spend considerable sums in community investment, and it is a question of priorities. If it will cost them, say &#163;2 million or &#163;5 million to subsidise a scheme like this, perhaps they could take it from that budget or from a marketing budget. We know, for example, that RBS is reducing the amount it is giving to Andy Murray, Sachin Tendulkar and various others in sponsorship. But it is still spending a huge amount on sponsorships. Perhaps it could take it out of that and be absolutely up-front about the subsidy.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000174"></a>As I said, I very much doubt whether a straightforward commercial bank can run this scheme at anything other than a loss. If the Government want the scheme to provide choice, they will have to explain to the banks that they control how they can do it. The way that I have just described is probably the only way they will be able to justify it.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000175"></a><b><a name="90402-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09040247000447"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I understand the concern behind these amendments; the noble Baroness voiced them in moving the amendment and the noble Lord, Lord Newby, did so in returning to a theme that he strongly expressed on Second Reading. The scheme has been designed with the aim of securing exactly what the noble Lord said&#151;national provision, but provision over a broad range of appropriately authorised providers. The saving gateway pilots showed that distance from a branch was a key issue. That means that we have to engage the concept of national providers, as  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC328"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column GC328</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has been demonstrated by the two representations made in this short debate. Ease of access is a very important dimension.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000176"></a>The Government have therefore sought to make the scheme as simple as possible for providers to operate. I recognise that simplicity reduces costs, but it does not remove them. The noble Baroness identified the obvious fact that relatively low sums will accumulate and there will probably be a significant number of transactions. However, the intention is that all providers which have the appropriate regulatory permission and are able to offer accounts that meet the requirements set out in the Bill and in regulations will be approved as account providers.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000177"></a>The gentle charge was made that my noble friend Lord Myners was complacent&#151;I think that that was the word used. My noble friend is of a cheery disposition, so I think that it was optimism rather than complacency. It is not a question of being complacent about a scheme that is being set up. There is a great deal of work to be done and the Government are involved in a considerable amount of work. My noble friend was reflecting confidence. We expect saving gateway accounts to be offered by a range of providers&#151;not just banks and building societies, but also credit unions. We are discussing this with potential providers and their representative bodies and are getting a positive response.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000178"></a>Reference was made in the other place to the views of representatives of the banks, building societies and credit unions, which indicate that broadly they want to be involved. We consider our discussions thus far to be making considerable progress. I am not in a position to name names because discussions are still continuing. As the noble Lord, Lord Newby, hinted when he talked about banks having community responsibilities, the banks have social responsibility agendas to which they subscribe and this scheme fits into that general prospectus. In the past, they have committed themselves to issues of social responsibility and an inclusion agenda.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000179"></a>After all, we have seen the banks involved in other areas. Only a year or so ago we discussed dormant accounts legislation, which also showed the banks in a constructive light on the work that needed to be done to release resources into the community. If it is thought that perhaps I am stressing too much the marginal commitments of the banks against the large problems that they currently face, it is also the case that providers will be able to capitalise on the saving gateway account holders who continue to save and will build up rather significant balances. Some will make progress and the banks will have the advantage of being responsible for their accounts, which is of potential advantage to them. The person in the category of obtaining this level of opportunity at one stage may, a decade on, be in a very different financial position. We all know the extent of loyalty of customers to banks, even when they are not treated particularly well, which is legendary. If banks set out to provide a service that is not necessarily profitable in the first instance they must have greater expectations among those of their customers who move into more prosperous circumstances. It is not as if we are asking them to take on a total loss leader.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000180"></a>Reference has also been made to the Post Office, which also has issues to discuss. It has a great advantage in terms of its range of branches. I cannot give a categorical response at this stage on how far on we are, but we are confident that these accounts will be serviced. The Government will be very active to ensure that the legislation is effective, and the Committee will recognise that it can only become effective on the basis of the co-operation of those that can provide such services as have been identified in the amendments.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000181"></a>It is not an issue of complacency; it is a reflection of the fact that considerable work still needs to be done. We are making very considerable progress and we have confidence in the fact that we will have providers that meet the criteria, identified by both noble Lords in speaking to the amendment, to make the scheme successful. I hope, with those reassurances, that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000187"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, also referred to the fact that they have community investment funds or social responsibility agendas. Yes, indeed, banks have funds devoted to that but, of course, they have been leaned on for other things in recent years; for example, the provision of cash machines. In my experience,  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC330"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column GC330</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>banks tend to think that social responsibility is their agenda and not necessarily the Government&#146;s agenda. Of course, there are other calls on the banks waiting in the wings: for example, the funding of financial inclusion and financial education. At the moment, the Thoresen proposals, when rolled out, will be unfunded. Let us not pretend that there is an unlimited pool. Although banks are large organisations which have money that they devote to socially worthwhile projects, we cannot assume that the Government can highjack that.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000188"></a>The Minister said that he had had a positive response and that he was making progress, indeed that the Government were confident. However, the Government have not given us any more confidence today that this scheme will get off the ground. I detect from those contacts that we have, for example, with those in banking, that there is still a problem in this making sense to the providers coming in. Doubtless we can return to that at a later stage. The elements of banks wanting to come in or not, which will come down to the costs imposed on banks, will be covered in later amendments. This is an important issue and if it is not resolved we may not be having a saving gateway scheme at all because you cannot have a saving gateway scheme unless there are some providers to provide the accounts. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The amendment requires HMRC to have regard to the desirability of eligible persons having access to financial information regarding savings. This is a very modest requirement and does not require HMRC to approve account providers only where the account providers agree to provide basic financial education about savings. In the light of the discussion we have just had, that simply might not be feasible.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000190"></a>At Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked the Minister for an update on the Thoresen review and its proposals regarding generic financial advice. The Minister&#146;s written reply, to which the noble Lord, Lord Newby, has referred today, showed that that this has not got very far at all, which is what both the noble Lord and I suspected. There is a large-scale pilot scheme in the north of England but, as the noble Lord, Lord Newby, has already said this afternoon, there is a long way to go before there is anything meaningful on a national scale around financial advice or even information. As I said a few moments ago, there is still no clarity about how that would be financed and paid for, if it were rolled out on a national basis. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Newby,  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC331"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column GC331</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and I both wish the Thoresen proposals well, but it is not clear that they will finally end up with proposals that would ensure that the kind of target groups that we are dealing with in the Bill would have access to financial information and financial education.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000191"></a>Without some level of financial information to reinforce the savings habits that are supposed to be acquired through the saving gateway scheme, it is quite likely that account holders will not acquire the long-term habit of saving. At Second Reading, we referred to the fact that the results from the pilot schemes for the saving gateway were not definitive, partly because they did not extend very far beyond the maturity date. The Minister promised to provide some information on the Ipsos MORI survey, which has been carried out subsequent to the pilots.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000192"></a>In the Chamber this morning, I received the Minister&#146;s letter giving a one-page summary of the Ipsos MORI findings. That was clearly encouraging, but we need to see more detail of the findings. When the Minister replies, will he say when we should expect to get the full copy of the Ipsos MORI report? I ask that in particular because the pilots had much wider groups of people involved than those simply in the target group of the Bill. The Ipsos MORI overall findings do not necessarily speak to the kind of results that we can expect from the saving gateway scheme once it is operational. It is to do with that more granular level, in particular the difference between the relatively higher incomes that were included in some of the pilots compared with the lower incomes that were included in the saving gateway scheme, for reasons that we support. In the pilots, the propensity to save was higher, as is not surprising in those higher up the income scale.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000193"></a>A key issue that HMRC should take into account is whether the providers would be willing to provide at least some basic financial literacy material alongside the accounts. The pilot studies showed relatively little take up of financial education. I do not know whether that was because of the way in which it was offered, or whether it was genuinely not needed. I have a basic gut instinct that there is a very real need to raise the level of financial understanding of those people at whom saving gateway accounts are targeted.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000194"></a>In another place, there was discussion of the undesirability of saving gateway account holders being bombarded with material offering other financial services inappropriately. Those of us who have accounts with the main clearing banks know the kind of credit and loan opportunities that we are constantly offered. There was a feeling in another place that it was undesirable that those should be pushed at this group of account holders. I toyed with whether something along the lines of HMRC abstaining from such marketing to such account holders should be proposed. Instead, my amendment focuses on the positive of giving information, raising awareness and educating people in this group, rather than prohibiting the banks from doing things.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000195"></a>Financial literacy is such a huge problem, as the Thoresen review showed, that any way of improving the level of understanding in society would be valuable. If we can link it to the saving gateway in a formal and  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC332"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column GC332</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>positive way, that would be helpful, and it would improve the possibility of good outcomes from the saving gateway scheme. I beg to move.</p>

I share the noble Baroness&#146;s view about the importance of improving financial literacy, particularly for those who previously have been excluded from the formal financial sector. A point that has not yet come out in Committee is that the saving gateway will attract, we hope, significant numbers into the formal financial sector who are at the moment largely involved, or significantly involved, with the informal financial sector, with some of the risks that might be so attached.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000197"></a>The amendment would ensure that the commissioners for HM Revenue and Customs, which will approve account providers to offer accounts, will, in the exercise of this function, take into consideration access to financial information concerning savings. As I have said, I agree with the noble Baroness about the importance of appropriate access to financial information about savings. The Government and the FSA are working to deliver a shared vision of better informed, better educated and more confident consumers who are equipped to take control of their finances and play an active role in the financial services market, and, in so doing, enhancing their own lives. To that end, last year, we published jointly with the FSA an action plan for financial capability, which set out a number of measures and initiatives to help people manage their money now and in the future.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000198"></a>The Government have launched a number of initiatives in that respect that will also be well positioned to offer support to saving gateway account holders and those who are interested in opening accounts. The &#163;12 million regional money guidance pathfinder, which is funded and delivered by the Government and the Financial Services Authority, is on track to launch in the north-west and the north-east of England in the spring. Financial inclusion champions, sponsored by DWP, have been asked to support and work to promote active engagement with government-supported saving schemes, including the saving gateway. HMRC will also send information direct to eligible holders, along with their notice of eligibility. This will explain the scheme and how to open an account. An HMRC contact staff centre will also be able to answer queries regarding the scheme and information will be available on the HMRC website. The Government will continue to explore the advice and support that will be available to eligible people at account opening.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000199"></a>The noble Baroness asked when we could expect to see the full Ipsos MORI report. I believe that it will be published next month. The noble Baroness also made the observation that pilots had wider flexibility, so the results were possibly not representative. Her observation is true, but we are carrying out further research, which focuses on people with incomes up to &#163;17,000. We will report on that in due course. I therefore hope, in the circumstances, that the noble Baroness will agree that much is already being done&#151;there is a recognition by the Government and

He outlined the work that is already going on. The Thoresen review is worthy, but it will take a long time. It is only in the large-scale pilot, and we do not know when that will happen. We do not know whether there will ever be a roll-out. On HMRC sending information to account holders, I do not think that you would look to HMRC to be a provider of financial education or to be within the financial inclusion envelope. Perhaps other mechanisms need to be found: I am sure that the DWP would be more likely to handle this better. The Government are missing a trick. My amendment simply said that, in selecting account providers, HMRC should bear that in mind. The Minister did not even tell me that it would. Not only does HMRC not need it in statute, it is not even described as a feature of what HMRC would look for in account providers. This does not just have &#147;government programmes&#148; written all over it. If delivery of information about savings and personal financial management through financial service providers can be extended more widely, that is better than relying on government schemes and bodies such as the CAB, valuable though they are. That is why I am disappointed that the Government are going to miss a trick. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The paragraph says that a saving gateway account has to be held for a period provided by regulations. The Government say that they will start with a period of two years. My amendment would continue to allow the period to be prescribed by regulations, but that it must exceed 12 months. If it is possible for the Government to specify a maturity period of less than a year, I would argue that that is not a genuine approach to creating a savings habit. I could argue that two years, the period that has emerged from the pilot studies, is also hardly enough to represent a real savings habit, but I accept that that may need to be informed in the long run by studies of savings behaviour over a long period of time. However, no matter what happens to the upper limit, I cannot see that it is a good use of public money to incentivise short-term savings, which is what a period of less than one year would amount to.</p>

Specifically, regulations would not be able to specify an account duration of less than 12 months. Members of the Committee will know that the Government propose that these accounts should last for two years. Leaving this detail to secondary legislation provides the flexibility to make alterations in the future. That might be necessary if experience of the national scheme suggests that a different account length would better achieve the aims of the saving gateway.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000204"></a>Based on evidence from the pilots, we believe that an account duration of 24 months will best help to initiate a savings habit. I agree that too short a period is unlikely to be effective in achieving the goal of this policy initiative. However, it is important that we are able to respond to any lessons and information that we secure from operating the national saving gateway, and that we do not place restrictions on the account duration that regulations can prescribe. I therefore hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

The Minister says that he would like flexibility, and I say it should not be for under a year. I cannot believe that there could be any difference of opinion about that, and yet the Government still want a degree of flexibility that would allow them to create a saving gateway account which would not represent savings at all; it would just be a sort of current account that gave you a bonus after a couple of months. I do not think that we should legislate for something like that.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000206"></a>The Government are taking flexibility to an undue degree.

Both amendments would amend Clause 4 and set out in primary legislation some basic financial rules about the burdens on account providers. Amendment 22 states that regulations made under Clause 4 may not require an account provider to pay interest. The British Bankers&#146; Association is especially keen on that. It acknowledges that the draft regulations do not require the payment of interest, but says that it would value the certainty that having that in the Bill would give.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC335"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column GC335</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90402-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000208"></a>The problem that banks foresee is that they might be persuaded to be saving gateway account providers on the basis of the draft regulations only to find, having invested in participating in the scheme, that the regulations are changed&#151;whether before the final version is issued or sometime thereafter. Banks, like other businesses, need certainty to plan on anything other than a short-term basis. My amendment does not prohibit the payment of interest, although I think it is highly unlikely that any account provider would find it economic to pay interest, whatever the level of interest rates. I am aware that Citizens Advice believes that interest should be paid to make the account like a proper savings account, but the economics of starter savings accounts are unlikely ever to make that a realistic prospect.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000209"></a>If there were a competitive market where people wanted to attract that source of funds&#151;about which the Minister was optimistic at Second Reading&#151;account providers may need to offer interest to attract funds, but they do not want to be obliged ever to have to provide interest. That is why they seek to have that hardwired into the legislation.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000210"></a>Amendment 23 addresses the other side of the coin. It prohibits the account provider from making charges. The regulations provide for no charges to be made against the saving gateway account. We have no problem with that, but if account providers are not to be allowed to levy charges on the accounts, it seems to us to be fair and reasonable that there should be no interest payable either. As I sought to put the interest rate provision in the Bill, for even-handedness&#146;s sake, I have also sought to put the other side of the equation, the cost side, in the Bill. The main purpose of my two amendments is to raise the issue of interest, which seems to be a stumbling block towards banks wanting to take part in the scheme. As I said, that is something that they continue to express concern about. That is why I have raised it in Committee today. I beg to move.</p>

That brings us back to the issue that we have already discussed several times about what goes in or does not go in to the Bill. It is difficult to see why these two provisions should not go into the Bill, because I am pretty sure that the Minister is going to get up in a minute to say that the Government agree with the substance of both of them.</p>

Amendment 22 would remove the Treasury's power to require in regulations that a provider must pay interest on a credit balance held in a saving gateway account. I can assure noble Lords that we do not intend to impose a requirement on providers to pay interest on account balances. That is our settled view and we have no intention of moving from that position, but we think that it is sensible to retain some flexibility so that, if the position were to change in the future, a change could be made without recourse to primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000214"></a>Amendment 23 would allow regulations to prohibit a provider levying charges on saving gateway accounts. My response here is straightforward. The Bill already provides a broad power to impose requirements on accounts and the draft regulations that have been published make clear that providers may not make withdrawals from a person&#146;s account, by way of charges or otherwise. I refer here to Clause 4(2)(c) and draft regulation 10(2)(e). I hope this provides the confirmation the noble Baroness is seeking.</p>

I shall deal first with the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee because the Minister has often said that if that committee does not raise specific points, it is taken as an endorsement of the whole of the Government&#146;s position. The plain fact is that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee does not replace the detailed scrutiny that takes place through the processes of your Lordships' House, and is not intended to, but highlights areas where it is obvious to it, from its examination and the explanations which are sought from departments, that the order-making powers need to be handled differently. But even if that committee makes general statements, that does not mean that it vouchsafes every order-making power as being appropriate.

<p><a name="09040247000310"></a>I should perhaps have sought to require regulations to prescribe a limit since it should be axiomatic that there can never be an open-ended ability to pay money into a saving gateway account and thereby qualify for maturity payment. We support the imposition of a maximum. Indeed, a maximum should definitely be imposed. On the other hand, my amendment suggests that a minimum amount could also be specified. Draft Regulation 10(2)(d) says that the account provider must permit payments into the account by various means but does not specify anything related to the amount. It must surely be uneconomic for the account provider to handle very small amounts, given that providers are not allowed to make charges. I should have thought that a de minimis amount would be reasonable from that perspective.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000225"></a>In addition, a savings habit will not be worth while unless it is for a meaningful sum. Unless savings can accumulate to a sum that is itself worth while in terms of the kind of things for which savings are kept back, it can hardly qualify as genuine saving. I should have thought that a minimum of something like &#163;5 would be reasonable because if that were all that was contributed to a savings account over the two years that is proposed, it would add up to only &#163;120 before the maturity payment. I should have thought that anything less was not really saving at all. The purpose of my amendment is not to prescribe the minimum but merely to propose that a minimum should be prescribed. I beg to move.</p>

They do not specify a minimum amount.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000227"></a>The noble Baroness has indicated that her amendment is intended to enable regulations to impose a minimum limit per transaction on the amount that may be deposited into an account. We understand that providers may have concerns about the transactional costs of being required to accept numerous low-value deposits. There is nothing in the Bill or the regulations to prevent a provider setting a minimum per transaction limit for deposits in saving gateway accounts to bring them into line with a provider&#146;s general practice for accepting counter deposits. That seems to be the most effective way of addressing this matter as those banks that are most efficient will see the greatest opportunity to cultivate a new target market or to make an important social contribution that will reach their own determination rather than one set by law or regulation. I therefore do not believe that the amendment would add anything to the Bill and I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw it.</p>

The requirements for orders are set out in Clause 27, but I have drafted this amendment to Clause 4 so that it can be debated alongside the substance of Clause 4. That is for the convenience of the Committee. The regulations under Clause 4 allow the length of the maturity period and the maximum amount of the monthly payment to be set by regulations. These two items can drive the amount of the maturity payment, which is calculated in accordance with Clause 8.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000234"></a>I was surprised to see that the regulations, which can radically change the nature and scale of the saving gateway scheme and its overall cost, are left to secondary legislation subject only to the negative procedure. Admittedly, the first orders will be subject to the affirmative procedure. That is welcome, but as we have the draft regulations to assist us in our consideration of this Bill, the issues will not arise on the first orders because we have the opportunity to debate them now. If issues arise, they will be on subsequent orders.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000235"></a>We agree that these issues are best dealt with in secondary legislation. We have debated today and will doubtless debate again at Report whether more should be in primary legislation, but in general terms we believe that it will be necessary to change the size and shape of the saving gateway accounts over time. Secondary legislation is the best way to do that. However, where those details have a direct bearing on the total cost of the scheme&#151;as they clearly could by regulation changes to Clause 4&#151;the affirmative procedure is the only proper way to achieve those changes.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000236"></a>I might be persuaded that it is only appropriate for the other place to approve such an order, but I would be hard pressed to be persuaded that there should be no formal parliamentary approval to an order that could radically change the shape of the gateway accounts and therefore the cost to the taxpayer.

That indicates that the Government are all too well aware of the significance of the secondary legislation. We are making those arrangements.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000238"></a>I listened carefully to what the noble Baroness said a few moments ago. Of course she is absolutely right when she says that scrutiny of the Bill is the responsibility of this Committee and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee comments as it sees fit, but when that committee comments in a way that clearly indicates that the Government have got an interesting area just about right, it is only appropriate that we draw attention to it. I am about to do it again. I know that I am straining the noble Baroness's patience because she is keen to introduce the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee only when it is fiercely critical of the Government. I can recall it having been so on one or two occasions in the past on other Bills. She will therefore not mind that the shoe is on the other foot, as it were, because in its report it states that, given the limited nature of the power, it is content that the negative procedure is appropriate for one exception.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000239"></a>We have reached that position with the first stage of this legislation. Now we come on to the question of potential change. Making the first use of almost all the delegated powers subject to the affirmative procedure will allow the necessary parliamentary scrutiny of the detailed scheme we are introducing. After that, the subsequent use of most powers should, in the Government&#146;s view, be subject to the negative procedure to provide the flexibility to make minor or technical changes to the scheme which are appropriate only for secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000240"></a>There are four exceptions to that: the three crucial delegated powers in Clause 3 that relate to eligibility and the power to set the match rate. Those are key features of the saving gateway, so every use of those powers will continue to be subject to the affirmative procedure. We have identified the key areas.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000241"></a>The amendment specifies that other delegated powers should be subject to the affirmative procedure on each use. In particular, it focuses on the powers to set the maturity period of accounts and the monthly deposit account, but we think that the negative procedure is appropriate for the subsequent use of those powers. As I said, they will be scrutinised on first use but, on subsequent uses, the negative procedure is appropriate. As I have said, that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee is largely content with that.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000242"></a>There are precedents for changes to the monthly deposit limit to be set by negative procedure. For both ISAs and the child trust fund, the subscription limits are set in secondary legislation and can be amended in both cases under the negative procedure. As foe the length of accounts, we have been clear that they should last for two years. However, there should be flexibility to review this position in future. That can best be achieved by making use of the regulation-making procedure. We contend that that should be the negative procedure&#151;not on first use, but subsequently.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000243"></a>I know the noble Baroness will not allow me to produce in aid the evidence that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not make any comment. As she said, it is not its job to comment on everything. On the other hand, when the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee makes a recommendation she expects the Government to jump&#151;as we always do&#151;and treat it with great seriousness. When it does not, she must expect me to comment on the fact that our proposals have at least a clean bill health in respect of the anxieties of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000244"></a>We do not believe that it would be an effective use of parliamentary time to debate some of these matters under the affirmative procedure, save for the first time when the scheme is implemented. Afterwards, it is clear that the negative procedure will be appropriate. It is not as if the negative procedure rules out parliamentary scrutiny. The noble Baroness will give some credence to the fact that I once had the somewhat invidious task of making sure that the Opposition was on the QV with regard to negative instruments, as we always referred to them. She knows that they are profuse, extensive, complicated and mind blowing. Nevertheless, we regarded it as our task. I am sure that the present Opposition discharge their task on negative procedures with the same thoroughness at the other end as they undoubtedly do here. Under that procedure, the legislation is still subject to parliamentary scrutiny, although different from under the affirmative procedure. On the basis of the case that I have put forward, we think that we have got the distribution of affirmative and negative just about right and I hope the noble Baroness thinks so too.</p>

I wonder whether the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not quite appreciate that while the matching amount in Clause 8, which is specified in affirmative regulations, clearly derives the amount of money that is spent out, less obvious is how you express the maturity and the monthly qualifying amount that derive the calculations when you get to Clause 8. It is that that will actually, and probably more significantly, derive the total cost of the scheme. That is different. It is not on all fours with changing the subscription amount to, say, a child trust fund account and an ISA, which are simply for getting tax relief on the interest. It is not the same as getting this rather large matching amount, which is in turn tax free under the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000248"></a>With respect, I do not think the precedents cited are conclusive precedents. The financial implications of the saving gateway are derived as much from the regulations in Clause 4 as they are from Clause 8, and I wonder whether the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not realise that. Clause 8 refers to money and it would be easy to think that that is where the money derives from, but it is not&#151;it derives as much from the earlier clauses.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000249"></a>I am not happy with what the Minister said or that the negative procedure is appropriate. The Minister said that all Oppositions have the ability to raise questions on negative resolutions, which of course they do. Affirmative regulation is not full parliamentary control but it is better than the negative because it requires the Government to come to Parliament to justify what they are asking for and to ask for approval. That is the significant difference between negative and positive. I urge the Minister to take the matter away and to reflect on whether the order-making power is correct. It is not on all fours with the examples he has given.</p>

Her description is right; I merely sought to indicate that there was a parallel. She went on to refer to the increases in costs.

As far as the deposits are concerned, the sums are large in comparison to this scheme.</p>

The amendment says that the regulations may require account holders to be eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and eligible for access to the Financial Services Ombudsman. The amendment is permissive; I do not see how the Government can possibly object to it. Indeed, the regulations provide for an account to be covered by the FSCS or an equivalent in another member state or EEA state. I am aware that it is difficult, although not impossible, to exclude other members of the EU, but I am less clear about EEA states. Thinking back to the problems that we have had with Icelandic banks and some of the other EEA states, I do not think that it necessarily inspires confidence in financial terms.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000254"></a>The regulations do not refer to access to the Financial Services Ombudsman, which I thought was desirable given the valuable work that the ombudsman does, especially in relation to relatively small accounts. Why are the requirements on the compensation scheme and the ombudsman not in the Bill? It is jolly difficult to see why the Government would want flexibility here. Do the Government intend to include EEA states and, if so, what safeguards will there be for account holders? The experience of relying on Icelandic deposit protection does not give us any confidence in the EEA being problem-free. Will the Minister also set out the position as regards the ombudsman? Do the Government believe that it is necessary for the saving gateway account holders to have access to the ombudsman? I certainly believe that that would be desirable. I am not even clear myself what the position would be if a branch bank from another EU state or possibly even an EEA state were to offer a saving gateway account. Could the Minister help the Committee in that respect? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000257"></a>The other point that the noble Baroness made very clearly was that the measure would be of assistance in reassuring people, particularly given the utterly appalling record of the banks in the recent period. Reference was made to the Icelandic bank; it is particularly important that the role of the ombudsman is made fully available and that people are told about it. So many of the amendments that we have discussed have dealt with the provision of information. These people are not well versed in financial management, or even  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC344"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column GC344</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the management of their own finances. They simply would not know about the scope offered by the ombudsman. As I say, in the case of Equitable Life, even more affluent people found it extremely difficult to get information of that kind. In the interests of what I take to be the egalitarian principles underlying this measure, from a progressive Government, I hope that they will take it on board.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000258"></a><b><a name="90402-gc0007.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="09040247000489"></a>Lord Myners:</b> The amendment concerns account holders&#146; savings being covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, and account holders&#146; access to the Financial Ombudsman Service. I can assure Members of the Committee that, under the powers already in the Bill, we intend to make it a requirement of the scheme that all saving gateway accounts are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or a similar deposit guarantee scheme recognised in an EEA member state. All deposits of up to &#8364;100,000 will be covered.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000259"></a>As Members of the Committee will no doubt know, the Financial Services Authority is currently consulting on the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. As part of that consultation, it is stimulating a debate about a significant increase in the level covered, as well as some of the issues that we touched on in considering the Banking Bill, around brands and other issues, where there is still some complexity and uncertainty.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000260"></a>The issue of EEA member states and the deposit protection provided is a matter of some concern for the Government. My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has raised this with the European Commission. Later today I will be going to Prague to attend the ECOFIN meeting, and I will be raising this matter with those attending. These concerns about the strength of the deposit guarantee schemes are exercising minds in a number of locations, have been touched on recently in speeches by senior officers of the FSA and are referred to tangentially in the de Larosire report produced for the President of the EU Commission.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000261"></a>In addition, I can confirm that all accounts operated in the UK will be covered by the ombudsman scheme, without the need for additional provision in the Bill or regulations. As with other accounts, such as ISAs and the child trust fund, as long as a provider has appropriate permission to accept deposits, there is no need to exclude them from offering the saving gateway. We do not intend to place a restriction on non-UK providers, but I add a caveat to that in reminding the Committee that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has expressed some serious concerns about the cross-border operation of the deposit guarantee schemes. We will no doubt be saying more about that in due course, having discussed these matters with member states of the European Community. I hope that the noble Baroness will agree that there is no need for this amendment, and will therefore withdraw it.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000265"></a>I was perhaps most distressed by the Minister&#146;s final response to that final query about how people would get information about what compensation schemes they would be eligible for. The thought of this kind of basic information coming from HMRC does not feel right. It is not clear to me that the individuals who are going to receive their eligibility notices will be able to do anything significant with it, because this is part of a much broader financial inclusion agenda, rather than specifically here. We shall see.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000266"></a>The most concerning part is that there will potentially be saving gateway providers which would not have access to an ombudsman because they are not a UK bank or other financial service provider, and that is not automatically seen on a cross-border basis. That is unfortunate, and perhaps HMRC should be putting out information saying that people should only go to a bank when they can use an ombudsman. I hear what the Minister has said on the other points that I raised. I am pleased to hear that the issue around the EEA is being dealt with at government level. I hope that we may be updated in due course.</p>

<p class="amendment_hs_quote"><a name="09040247000338"></a><b>27:</b> Clause 6, page 4, line 3, leave out &#147;true&#148;</p>

<p><a name="09040247000271"></a><b><a name="90402-gc0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09040247000496"></a>Baroness Noakes:</b> Amendment 27 deletes &#147;true&#148; from Clause 6(2)(b). I shall also speak to Amendment 28, which would delete, on a probing basis, subsection (4).</p>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000272"></a>Clause 6 sets out what an application to open a saving gateway account must contain and has the expected regulation-making powers. Clause 6(2)(b) says that the application must include a &#147;true declaration&#148; about prescribed matters. My amendment deletes &#147;true&#148;, because the truth or otherwise of the declaration can be determined only by reference to the underlying facts, and the provider has no way of determining this.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000273"></a>Under Clause 6(3), an account provider must open an account if an application is made in accordance with Clause 6 and its regulations, and there is a penalty under Clause 21 if the account provider does not do this. It is reasonable for the account provider to check that a declaration has been made, but it is not reasonable for an account provider to ensure that the declaration is true. There is a penalty on a person who deliberately makes an incorrect declaration under Clause 6(2)(b), which is presumably one that is untrue. It is surely only in relation to the account holder that truth is relevant.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000274"></a>Linked to this are the regulations to be made under subsection (4) about circumstances in which the account provider may or must refuse to open an account. Amendment 28 deletes subsection (4) on a probing basis. The draft regulations at Regulation 13 require a provider not to open an account if it has reason to believe that the declaration is untrue. But providers do not seem to be required to make specific inquiries as to truth and thus the addition of the word &#147;true&#148; in Clause 6(2)(b) is misleading, as truth does not affect the provider unless the provider is somehow on notice that the declaration might not be true. Leaving the word &#147;true&#148; in the Bill may require the provider to carry out procedures to verify the truth of the declaration which, in some cases, might be quite difficult. An example is a person's residence status. What should a provider do proactively about establishing residence status? Or are providers simply to take information that comes to them?</p>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000275"></a>Regulation 13 also requires the refusal of an application if the notice of eligibility might not be genuine. What do providers have to do in relation to notices to establish whether they might or might not be genuine? What can they rely on? Providers' staff may not handle more than a few notices each year and I will wager that notices will not be forgery proof. Modern photocopiers produce amazing copies nowadays and photocopied banknotes, as I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Myners, learnt when on the Court of the Bank of England, can fool most of the people most of the time. It is likely that it would be easy to forge a notice if people wanted to. My question on this regulation is: what are providers expected to do with notices to establish their genuineness?</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC347"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column GC347</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000276"></a>These two amendments ask the Minister to say why the word &#147;true&#148; is included in Clause 6(2)(b) and, more broadly, to explain what providers are meant to do before they open an account, either in relation to the truth of a declaration or in relation to the genuineness of a notice. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000277"></a><b><a name="90402-gc0008.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09040247000497"></a>Lord Myners:</b> Both of these amendments relate to account opening. As Members of the Committee may be aware from the draft regulations we have published&#151;draft Regulation 13(2)&#151;we intend that, at account opening, a true declaration will be required from the account applicant confirming that they meet the relevant connection-with-the-UK conditions set out in regulations; and that they have not previously opened a saving gateway account, other than an account closed within a cooling-off period offered by the account provider.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000278"></a>Amendment 27 would remove the word &#147;true&#148; from Clause 6(2)(b), so that the account applicant will be required only to make a declaration rather than, as the Bill currently states, &#147;a true declaration&#148;. I should explain that the word &#147;true&#148; was included in the Bill to add clarity. I recognise that it might be argued that the use of the word &#147;declaration&#148; implicitly requires that what is declared should be true. However, as this provision is the basis for the imposition of the penalty provided at Clause 19(1) of the Bill, we consider it prudent drafting to put the matter beyond doubt in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000279"></a>Clause 6(4), which the noble Baroness&#146;s Amendment 28 would delete, qualifies the requirement at subsection (3) that an approved account provider must open a saving gateway account for any eligible applicant so long as their application is made in accordance with the requirements of the scheme. We believe that there are only very few circumstances in which it would be legitimate for an account provider to refuse to open an account for an eligible person who is prepared to agree to the terms under which the account is offered. We propose to set these limited circumstances out in the regulations. One example relates to credit unions. An unqualified requirement to open accounts for all applicants could present difficulties for credit unions, which, as Members of the Committee may be aware, operate according to a common bond that determines who can become a member. We therefore propose to use subsection (4) to specify in regulations that credit unions will not be required to open accounts for people who are not members or who do not fulfil their membership qualifications. As the Committee may also be aware from the draft regulations, we intend that account providers should not accept an account application when they have reason to believe that a notice of eligibility presented to them is not or may not be genuine, or that a declaration or application made to them contains matters that are or might be untrue. The same applies when any requirements of money-laundering legislation are not satisfied.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000280"></a>The Bill allows for a penalty to be provided in such circumstances. However, the penalty will not be applied when an account provider has taken reasonable steps to comply with the rules. The penalty would not be provided, for example, when an account provider could not reasonably have known from normal account-opening checks that an applicant was not eligible for an account,

In view of my explanation, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her amendment.</p>

Part of the problem is that Clause 6 is being used to drive what the account holder or applicant needs to do as well as what the account provider needs to do. That is really the source of my problems. Could the Minister expand a little on what reasonable steps might be expected of account providers? Part of my probing here is about what they need to do to establish whether something is true, as well as about the genuineness of the vouchers coming forward. It is important that banks should know how proactive or otherwise to be. We have seen in relation to money laundering that unless significant guidance is given, banks can over-interpret what is required.</p>

Our proposed processes here are designed to allow account providers the security and comfort of knowing that they will not be required to open an account when they have reason to suspect that a person is not eligible. In meeting the requirement, we will expect account providers to do no more than to carry out their normal account-opening checks. We do not expect them to carry out any additional checks&#151;for example, to establish an applicant&#146;s benefit or tax credit status, their compliance with residency conditions or whether they have previously held an account with another provider. The essence of what we are trying to do here is to make the provision of such accounts as attractive as possible to banks and others. We hope that that will work to support the saving gateway initiative.</p>

However desirable it is for savings to be encouraged, this particular saving gateway  


<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC349"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column GC349</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>scheme should be available only once; after that, an individual must not expect to be able to gain further access to the extraordinarily favourable terms that the saving gateway scheme embodies.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000285"></a>Clause 6(5) permits regulations to do several things. Paragraph (a) refers to preventing a person from holding more than one saving gateway account at a time. Amendment 29 changes this so that it would prevent a person holding a saving gateway account more than once in a lifetime. That is what the draft regulations currently allow, so we are not out of line with government thinking on that. But, as we often find, the Government are legislating for the flexibility to do something which they have no current intention of doing and which goes against the advice of their own advisers. We do not think that that is a sound basis on which to approach legislation.</p>
<h5><a name="09040247000361"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000286"></a>Mr Brian Pomeroy and Ms Sharon Collard gave evidence on this topic to the Public Bill Committee in another place. Mr Pomeroy, who I have known for many years and who I respect, chairs the Government&#146;s Financial Inclusion Taskforce, which includes savings in its remit. He was very clear that only one shot should be allowed, as was Ms Collard, who had a detailed understanding from her involvement in the evaluation of the first pilot.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000287"></a>I propose to delete paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (5) in Amendment 30. Paragraph (b) allows the specification of an interval before a second gateway account is opened and is unnecessary following my amendment to paragraph (a). Paragraph (c) allows regulations to prevent a person holding more than one saving gateway account during his or her lifetime and is similarly redundant if the flexibility is removed around more than one account.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000288"></a>Lastly, and as an alternative, I have proposed in Amendment 32 that, if the regulation-making power is retained, it is accompanied by the affirmative procedure. It is clearly inappropriate for the Government to make such a radical change to the scheme that they are setting up using only the negative procedure. They are setting the scheme up on the basis that it is only one saving gateway account per lifetime. We believe that it would require significant evidence in relation to savings behaviour to shift from the agreed starting position that only one saving gateway account should be allowed for individuals in their lifetime. The Government should not be allowed to sneak something through on a negative procedure instrument and expect the Opposition, with their eagle eyes, to spot that it was being sneaked through. They should come clean on making such a major change to the nature of the scheme. I hope the Minister can see that it is blindingly obvious that, if there were to be any change, the Government should bring forward an affirmative regulation. I beg to move.</p>

As the noble Baroness has indicated and accepts at full value, we intend that people should have only one saving gateway account in their lifetime. It is in the draft regulations that we have published. It is our intent and the basis on which we are setting up this legislation. I know the noble Baroness agrees with that, because she has said so forcefully. She even suggested that the attempt by the Government to introduce an element of contingency for the long-distance future was sneaking something through. That is not so at all. We simply believe that there should be some flexibility on this point for the future, which is all that Clause 6(5) provides. It merely means that the position can be kept under review and that this or future Governments would be able to adapt the scheme without having to redraft and set up primary legislation. This can best be achieved by using the regulation-making powers under the Bill.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000290"></a>As the Economic Secretary said in the other place, and I repeat today, this is merely contingency planning. We will set the scheme up on this basis. The principles behind the scheme are exactly as the noble Baroness has suggested; namely, that it is a kick-start and is meant to provide for one opportunity. But in drafting legislation of this import, we introduced this reserved position of flexibility for the distant future, which is the only reason for Clause 6(5). It is not at all to sneak anything through; it is quite the opposite. We agree with all the main principles that the noble Baroness has adumbrated in her short contribution. The only thing that I am objecting to is the suggestion that the Government would do anything else except respond full-square with the intent that this is a kick-start and one provision for a lifetime. Nevertheless, when drafting primary legislation, you do not close everything off for the distant future if by drafting the legislation carefully you leave some scope for future contingencies which we cannot foresee. That is the intention behind Clause 6(5).</p>

The Minister said that he wanted flexibility for the distant future. That is probably the reason why, if we buy the flexibility, to which I could probably sign up, any regulations to change that in the distant future should formally come to Parliament for approval. It would be changing one of the essential components of the scheme which, we are all agreed, should be set up on the basis that you get one shot at it.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000292"></a>Let us suppose that evidence came over time that there was a group that was somehow excluded from the benefit for whatever social reasons and we needed the ability to return. There would need to be some evidence to go back to Parliament to extend the scheme beyond the one that Parliament thinks it is approving now. It is for that reason that I put my alternative, which was for the affirmative procedure. That is why I said that it could not be sneaked through. The Government should come and ask Parliament for approval. That is the difference between affirmative and negative.</p>

I have never known any Government to use the negative procedure to sneak anything through. That is not the way we intend the legislation to work. However, there could be a significant change in the distant future, so she is saying that we ought to consider using the affirmative procedure. I will certainly look at that.</p>

At the risk of becoming a class warrior, I strongly support the assertion made by the noble Lord, Lord Morgan, at Second Reading that there is a strong class bias in incentives to save. It is extraordinary that the Royal Bank of Scotland should be given an incentive which amounts to hundreds of thousands of pounds to enable poor Sir Fred Goodwin to have a huge pension, yet poor people saving &#163;25 a month are told that, after a two-year period, they have had their chance. They have had their one shot to adopt a savings habit.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000296"></a>Some of the language used about getting poor people to save is quite extraordinary. There is a sense that they should be grateful for having their one shot, whereas middle-class people, who as we go forward with the 45 per cent upper rate of tax, will be getting almost the same degree of subsidy on their pension contributions as we are proposing here, need this huge subsidy which amounts to billions of pounds a year in order for them to save. There seems to be a complete disparity in the approach to savings between two classes of people. Can the Minister answer two things? First, does this legislation allow the two-year period to be extended and, if so, to what extent? Secondly, what is the Government&#146;s current thinking? I think that the Minister said earlier this afternoon that the two-year period was reviewable, but I would welcome any thoughts he might have on whether the Government intended to review it, and whether they have given any thought to what the outcome might be if they did so.</p>

<p><a name="09040247000297"></a><b><a name="90402-gc0008.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="09040247000509"></a>Lord Morgan:</b> Since my name has been invoked, as a fellow warrior, the noble Lord, Lord Newby, will not be surprised that I totally endorse the spirit and substance of what he has said.</p>

<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC352"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column GC352</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has proposed on other occasions, reinforced. Of course, I understand his point about fairness in the provision of government support for saving.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000299"></a>However, the principle behind the scheme is different from ISAs. It is to give support to those with a low propensity to save because they have limited resources, and to kick-start the saving habit with a generous government subsidy. This legislation can be effective. For instance, the pilot indicated that, three months after the first pilot had finished, 41 per cent of participants were still saving regularly compared to only 16 per cent who saved regularly beforehand. That is encouraging evidence of the potential effectiveness of this scheme. It should act as a one-off catalyst rather than an ongoing incentive.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000300"></a>The noble Lord will recognise the costs involved in increasing the number of the accounts that could be held. We had a discussion earlier this afternoon on the costs of the scheme. Of course, we put this scheme in the framework of social responsibility and financial inclusion. With such small accounts, the number of transactions is unlikely to be affected; they are not bringing any profit&#151;or only very limited profit&#151;to the providers. So we are concerned about the costs of the scheme as it stands. As I indicated earlier, we are optimistic about the results of our fruitful discussions with a range of potential providers, but that is not to say that we should be anything other than careful about the scheme&#146;s costs to such providers. We must therefore look at the scheme in those terms.</p>

<a name="90402-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09040247000301"></a>I understand the sentiment expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, at considerable length, and reinforced by my noble friend Lord Morgan. It is important that we provide fairness in saving schemes. Prior to this scheme being made available, the position significantly benefits the better off. You can start an ISA at quite a low level, but we all know that the figures normally expected for ISAs are several thousands pounds: &#163;3,600 in cash and &#163;7,200 in equities. An awful lot of people subscribe monthly and hit lower levels than that over the course the tax year. This provision is clearly directed at a different group of people, who have limited motivation to save because of their limited resources. They are targeted and will be supported, but we intend that this should be a one-off scheme to kick-start the saving habit. That is the essential principle of the scheme. Although the noble Lord has given voice to proper sentiments, I hope that he will recognise that the Government have to work within a proper framework of what is practicable to keep costs at a reasonable level so that the scheme can be successful.</p>

He set out the difference between the tax incentive here and the ISA. To paraphrase him, the effect of the ISA and pension tax relief is to support those with a high propensity to save, to maintain the saving habit with generous government subsidy. He then went on to say that this scheme is very different from that because it is a one-off catalyst. My question, which he has not begun to answer, is why it is a one-off catalyst rather than a more permanent scheme. He has not answered at all why it would be possible for the Government to extend the two-year period under the

It is possible to extend the scheme&#151;Clause 4(2) provides for that&#151;but, in launching a scheme with many attendant difficulties, we are concentrating on making it effective. We are therefore concentrating on the scheme as set out, with a two-year period and the given level of support. We have elements of flexibility in the Bill, but the noble Lord cannot expect the Government to give the scheme extensively greater possibilities when we must get it launched with the full confidence of the providers and guarantee that it will be effective for those who are intended to benefit from it.

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09040245000003"></a><b><a name="90402-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09040245000392"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform &amp; Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Davies of Abersoch):</b> My honourable friend the Economic and Business Minister, Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Ian Pearson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09040245000004"></a>On 14 January 2009, I informed the House that the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform intended to introduce a working capital scheme as part of the Government&#146;s measures to enhance financial stability and support increased lending to business. Its implementation was subject to EU state aid clearance which was granted by the Commission on 24 March.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09040245000005"></a>I am pleased to inform the House that on 31 March the department signed a guarantee agreement with Royal Bank of Scotland PLC (RBS) and National Westminster Bank PLC (NatWest) to provide guarantees in respect of portfolios of loans that will enable RBS and NatWest to increase their lending to UK businesses.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09040245000006"></a>The agreement with RBS and NatWest is the first of its kind under the working capital scheme. It represents an important step towards achieving the Government&#146;s aim of getting increased credit flowing to UK businesses during these difficult times.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09040245000007"></a>RBS and NatWest have agreed that the capital released by their participation in the scheme will be redeployed in support of lending to creditworthy SMEs and mid-corporates. This forms part of the &#163;16 billion of additional lending to businesses they committed to on 26 February.  This additional lending commitment took effect from 1 March.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09040245000008"></a>Discussions are well advanced with two other banks in relation to their participation in the scheme.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09040245000009"></a>The scheme runs until 31 March 2011.</p>

<a name="09040245000010"></a><b><a name="90402-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09040245000393"></a>The Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Lord Mandelson):</b> The Government have a wide-ranging regulatory reform programme which we began in 2005. Today the Government are setting out next steps to ensure future better regulation.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09040245000011"></a>Given the economic situation, it is important that the Government focus on delivering real help for business now. Following the consultation launched last year, the Government have therefore decided not to implement a system of regulatory budgets at this stage. Rather we will undertake a programme of better regulation measures tailored to the present exceptional economic circumstances.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS100"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column WS100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09040245000012"></a>There is clearly a need for new regulation in some areas now&#151;such as climate change, and financial services in response to the current banking crisis. Moreover, delaying measures which businesses have already planned for can be disruptive. But during the recession and recovery we have a particular reason to look very carefully at whether we should delay planned new regulation and avoid introducing new regulation which increases burdens on business except where there is a clear case for action now. For example, the Government have already delayed implementation of legislation on display of tobacco in small shops until 2013, to help this particular retail sector.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09040245000013"></a>To provide greater rigour to this process of review during the present economic downturn and with a view to economic recovery, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has decided to establish a new better regulation sub-committee of the National Economic Council. The new committee will take on the responsibilities of the Panel for Regulatory Accountability. This committee will scrutinise planned regulation and proposals for new regulation that will impact on business. The new committee will take account of the views of business in coming to its conclusions.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09040245000014"></a>The Government will also be working closely with EU partners to further embed the EU better regulation agenda and to ensure the current pressures on business are taken into account when new European regulation is being considered.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09040245000015"></a>From this summer, the Government will also publish a forward regulatory programme. Business will be able to plan better as the programme will include existing and possible future regulatory proposals.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09040245000016"></a>In 2005, we announced that we would cut the administrative burdens of regulation by 25 per cent by May 2010, ie &#163;3.4 billion. We have already delivered &#163;1.9 billion and are on track to deliver on our promise. Looking forward, the Government will adopt new simplification targets for 2010-15 which will address all regulatory costs on business.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09040245000017"></a>The Government will also set up a new external Regulatory Policy Committee whose role will be to advise government on whether it is doing all it can to accurately assess the costs and benefits of regulation. Building on the work of Philip Hampton, this body will also advise government on whether regulators are appropriately risk based in their work; however, it will not have the power to require changes in the behaviour of independent regulators.</p>

I would now like to update the House regarding the sites undertaking, which was referred to in that letter, copies of which were placed in the Libraries of Parliament. </p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09040245000020"></a>The European Commission as part of its clearance of the acquisition of British Energy received certain undertakings from EDF that are slightly different from those agreed in the sites undertaking  entered into between EDF and HM Government and these are as set out in the announcement of the Commission's decision on 22 December 2008.  The sites undertaking has therefore been amended to reflect these developments.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09040245000021"></a>The Commission asked EDF to offer further undertakings which have had the effect that the disposal of Dungeness or Heysham should happen unconditionally soon after EDF&#146;s takeover of British Energy has completed, rather than making the sale conditional on EDF getting planning permission to build two EPRs at each of Sizewell and Hinkley Point as was the case under the sites agreement negotiated with the Government.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09040245000023"></a>In Great Britain, we already provide protection against direct discrimination and harassment that arises because the victim is wrongly perceived to belong or subscribe to a particular race, religion or belief, or to have a particular sexual orientation. Direct discrimination and harassment arising from association with a person of a particular race, religion or belief or with a particular sexuality are also prohibited.</p>

But we also made it clear that we would need to consider carefully the terms of the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the Coleman<I></I>case<sup>2</sup>, published on 17 July 2008, before determining the final approach for the Equality Bill.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09040245000025"></a>I am today announcing that we have decided to extend the prohibition against associative and perceptive direct discrimination and harassment to other strands and areas where this does not currently apply. The Equality Bill will therefore prohibit direct discrimination and harassment based on association and perception in respect of race, sex, gender reassignment, disability, sexual orientation, religion or belief and age and in relation to both employment and areas beyond this, such as goods, facilities and services.</p>

The following issues will be discussed at the council.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09040245000029"></a>The Commission will present a proposal to amend the 2003 council framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. The revised proposal aims to tackle the challenges to the criminal law across Europe posed by the speed of change of internet-related child abuse, and issues around the management of sex offenders who travel to commit offences. The UK supports work on combating the sexual exploitation of children including the distribution of images of child sexual abuse, and measures that further enable member states to tackle sex offenders who cross borders.</p>

The original framework decision introduced an obligation on member states to have in their national laws some common minimum offences and penalties for this conduct. The Commission&#146;s proposal will revise and update that framework decision and will need to be negotiated at working group level before it can be presented to the JHA Council for agreement.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09040245000033"></a>The presidency will seek political agreement on the directive for a single application procedure for third-country nationals. The proposed directive consists of two parts. The first would prescribe a single application procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a member state. The second part would prescribe a common set of rights for third-country workers legally residing in a member state. The UK has not opted into the draft directive.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09040245000035"></a>During the Mixed Committee with Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein, Ministers will be asked to report on progress in implementing the second generation of the Schengen information system (SIS II), in light of the council conclusions adopted at the last council which identified the need to resolve problems in the central system.  The UK remains of the view that we need a decision in June on the future of SIS II.  The council is also expected to adopt conclusions on the development of the SIRENE Bureaux.  These are not relevant to the UK since they concern arrangements for the operation of the current Schengen information system, to which the UK is not a party.</p>

The UK welcomes progress made by the Commission but wants to see these efforts taken forward, especially in view of the time that the mandate has been opened.  There will also be a report on the state of play in relation to ratification of the EU-US extradition and mutual legal assistance (MLA) agreements. The Commission will provide Justice Ministers with an overview of the EU funds available to support e-justice. Finally, information will be provided on the visit between VP Commissioner Barrot and Czech Minister of Interior Langer to the US.  </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09040245000040"></a>I attended the first Transport Council of the Czech presidency, in Brussels on 30 March.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="09040245000041"></a>There was a progress report and policy debate on the proposed amendment to Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures (the Eurovignette directive). Presenting its latest compromise text, the presidency explained that the draft amending directive would give member states flexibility to add an element for external costs (eg environmental or congestion) to any distance-based charges they levied on lorries. I supported the inclusion of congestion charging from the outset, and restated the UK&#146;s opposition to earmarking of revenues.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="09040245000042"></a>The council reached a general approach on an amendment to the directive on the organisation of working time in road transport. The presidency outlined its compromise text, which would allow member states to exclude self-employed road transport workers from the scope of the directive, if they wished. The text of the general approach was acceptable to the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="09040245000043"></a>The council adopted conclusions on the intelligent transport systems (ITS) action plan, which aims to promote the increase of ITS deployment across the EU, to support cleaner, safer and more efficient road transport The conclusions were acceptable to the UK. </p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="09040245000044"></a>The council adopted a decision endorsing the master plan for air traffic management in Europe (a part of the SESAR project for single sky implementation) and a council resolution on the master plan. Both were acceptable to the UK.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="09040245000045"></a>The presidency and Commission reported on the good progress made on the legislative proposals comprising the single European sky (SES) package<b>.</b> These are: a regulation amending the four regulations adopted in 2004 which established the single European sky; and an amending regulation extending the responsibilities of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to the safety of aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services. I look forward to the formal adoption of these proposals, which are an important step towards completion of the SES.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="09040245000046"></a>The council endorsed the recently agreed comprehensive air transport agreement with Canada. I look forward to the signature of this important agreement in the near future.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="09040245000047"></a>In maritime transport, there was a progress report and policy debate on a draft regulation on the rights of passengers when travelling by sea and inland waterway. The presidency outlined the aims of the draft regulation, which are to provide new rights for passengers with reduced mobility and to improve general passenger rights. I noted the progress made on this proposal and stressed that the final outcome of the negotiations should reflect an appropriate balance between the interests of passengers and those of the vessel operators.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="09040245000048"></a>Also in maritime transport, the council adopted conclusions arising from two recent Commission communications, <I>Strategic Goals and Recommendations for the EU&#146;s maritime transport policy until 2018</I>, and an action plan with a view to establishing a European maritime space without barriers. Both sets of conclusions were acceptable to the UK.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="09040245000049"></a>The presidency reported on the draft regulation establishing the second &#147;Marco Polo&#148; programme. This should allow the Marco Polo programme to fully deploy its potential, and we strongly support it. </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="09040245000050"></a>Under AOB, the Commission reported on the Galileo satellite navigation programme.

This would enable the EU industry to adjust supply to falling demand. I agreed that this was a sensible short-term proposal, but stressed that it should be restricted to the summer season, and an extension should be considered only with an accompanying impact assessment looking at consumer/competition implications. I also pressed for a wider review of the slot allocation regulations to be undertaken by the Commission in 2010, to include an examination of how environmental considerations could be taken into account more fully. The Commission agreed to the UK request and underlined the temporary nature of the proposed suspension to those member states with concerns.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="09040245000052"></a>Over lunch, there was a discussion of the effects of the economic situation on the transport sector and measures to help mitigate the impact.  I pointed to the real economic benefits secured from liberalisation of the transport sector, which are consistent with single market developments, and I emphasised that reduction of carbon emissions has to continue to be taken into account.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="09040245000054"></a>I am today publishing a consultation document on proposed changes to the local authority (LA) building control charging regime in England and Wales.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="09040245000055"></a>The principle of empowering LAs to charge for carrying out their main building control functions related to building regulations has been Government policy since the late 1970s. It derives from the user pays principle and avoids putting further pressure on all those who pay council tax. The charge-setting process was devolved to individual LAs in 1999 through the Building (Local Authority Charges) Regulations 1998.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="09040245000056"></a>Following representations from stakeholders, we carried out a review of the charging regime and developed a number of proposals to address the perceived deficiencies and modernise the charging system. We consulted on the broad principles of the proposed approach as part of the consultation on the Future of Building Control last year and received support from the majority of respondents.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="09040245000057"></a>We are now seeking views on the detailed proposals which will build on the current devolved charge-setting process to LAs in order to:</p>
introduce more flexibility and discretion, remove some restrictions and ambiguities, and enable LAs to more accurately relate their charges to the actual costs of carrying out their main building control functions (ie plan checking and inspections) for individual building projects as appropriate, thereby providing fairer charges;

<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="09040245000058"></a>The charging proposals also reflect the fundamental changes we propose to introduce to the building control system following the Future of Building Control consultation, in particular introducing a risk assessment approach to inspection of building work.</p>

<notus-date day="2" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS111"></a><b>2 Apr 2009 : Column WS111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_351"></a><a name="09040245000363"></a>In July 2007, the Government published their White Paper <I>Delivering a Sustainable Railway</I>. Within this the Government set out their high level output specification (HLOS) for the railways, detailing the outputs they wanted the industry to achieve by the end of the five-year period from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2014 (known as control period 4 or CP4). These outputs covered the areas of capacity, reliability and safety.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_352"></a><a name="09040245000364"></a>In terms of capacity, targets for the accommodation of extra demand were produced for each of the main London termini and major cities. The White Paper indicated that a total of 1,300 additional carriages were expected to be required to meet these requirements. So far 423 of these additional carriages have been ordered, even before the start of CP4.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_353"></a><a name="09040245000365"></a>I am pleased to announce to the House that today that my department has signed a deed of amendment to its franchise agreement with London Eastern Railway Ltd, which trades as National Express East Anglia (NXEA) and is part of National Express Group plc.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_354"></a><a name="09040245000366"></a>This contractual variation will enable NXEA to add 188 carriages to its existing fleet, boosting capacity into London Liverpool Street by providing approximately 11,000 extra seats during the morning three-hour peak period by December 2011.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_355"></a><a name="09040245000367"></a>NXEA will lease 120 new electric multiple unit (EMU) carriages, that will be built by Bombardier Transportation UK Ltd in Derby. These trains, which have a capital cost of &#163;160 million, will be owned by owned by Lloyds TSB General Leasing (No.8) Limited, a subsidiary of Lloyds TSB Bank plc. This is the first time this bank has provided finance for trains. The trains will principally be used on the Stansted Express route, enabling a cascade of rolling stock within the franchise to lengthen other services.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_356"></a><a name="09040245000368"></a>NXEA will also lease 68 Class 321 EMU carriages which are currently in use on the London Midland franchise where they are due to be replaced in July 2009. These carriages will receive an internal refresh.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_357"></a><a name="09040245000369"></a>NXEA will increase car parking space at four stations (Broxbourne, Audley End, Harlow Town and Diss), install two carriage washers and increase its workforce to implement the scheme.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_358"></a><a name="09040245000370"></a>Network Rail will be undertaking infrastructure enhancements to facilitate the changes to NXEA&#146;s operations, including platform lengthening, power supply upgrades and two passing loops.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_359"></a><a name="09040245000371"></a>This is one of the largest contract changes negotiated with a train operating company (TOC) during its franchise term since privatisation of the railways in 1997. I hope to make further such announcements over the next 12 months, although this requires TOCs to co-operate in providing my department with affordable and value for money proposals which meet the capacity requirements for their franchise areas.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_360"></a><a name="09040245000373"></a>Together with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development, I should like to update the House on the current situation in Sri Lanka, our continuing concern and the action we have been taking.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_361"></a><a name="09040245000374"></a>The fate of civilians caught up in the fighting in the north of Sri Lanka between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) is the most pressing concern. It is vital that they are able to move away from danger to safety.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_362"></a><a name="09040245000375"></a>The last remaining territory held by the LTTE continues to shrink. Currently it measures less  than 20 square kilometres. Since January more than 60,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) have left the conflict area and moved into government-controlled territory. Over 10,000 have moved within the past week. But credible reports suggest that well over  100,000 remain trapped within the conflict zone. These civilians have been displaced numerous times over the past 18 months and are living under constant threat from the continued heavy fighting. Despite the lack of verifiable reporting from the conflict area there are credible reports of civilians being killed and wounded every day, including in the &#147;no fire zone&#148;. We condemn the killings of civilians in the strongest possible terms and continue to urge all parties to take action to avoid further civilian casualties. Both the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE must abide by their obligations under international humanitarian law and ensure the protection of civilians at all times.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_363"></a><a name="09040245000376"></a>It was our concern for civilians that led my right honourable friend the Prime Minister to call for a ceasefire on 14 January. I have since repeated that call on numerous occasions: in phone calls with both the Sri Lankan President and Foreign Minister; in public statements; and in concert with other countries.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_364"></a><a name="09040245000377"></a>We renew that call today for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire. We call on the LTTE to allow the remaining civilians to leave the conflict area and to desist from enforced recruitment of civilians. But the actions of the LTTE cannot excuse any failings by the Sri Lankan Government to meet the higher standards naturally expected of democratic governments in a conflict.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_365"></a><a name="09040245000378"></a>We have also been active with partners in the EU, the UN and the Commonwealth. Following discussions at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 23 February, EU Foreign Ministers publicly called for a ceasefire and made clear their concern for civilians trapped by the fighting. Sri Lanka continues to be discussed within the EU and we support a proposed EU high-level troika to Sri Lanka at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_366"></a><a name="09040245000379"></a>At the UN we have been working for some time to ensure that the Security Council is fully briefed on the situation in Sri Lanka. We supported the visit by the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, John Holmes, to Sri Lanka in February and his subsequent briefings to the Security Council. We also welcome the continued engagement by the UN Secretary-General who has made clear his views on the deteriorating situation. This involvement by the UN means that the Government of Sri Lanka can be in no doubt about the concerns felt by the international community over the humanitarian situation.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_367"></a><a name="09040245000380"></a>At the recent meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, although Sri Lanka was not on the agenda, we nevertheless took the opportunity to raise our concerns over developments in Sri Lanka, particularly the humanitarian crisis.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_368"></a><a name="09040245000381"></a>In addition to calling for a ceasefire we continue to call for unhindered access for humanitarian agencies to the civilians displaced by the fighting, including those still trapped in the conflict area. There is an urgent need to increase the quantity and frequency of food and medical shipments to those affected by the fighting. Humanitarian agencies&#151;specifically the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross&#151;also need unhindered access to enable independent observation of the security screening of civilians and the running of the IDP camps. It is vital that these camps are temporary and that the IDPs are returned to their homes as early as is safely possible. We urge the Government of Sri Lanka to abide by their public commitment to return 80 per cent of IDPs by the end of the year.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_369"></a><a name="09040245000382"></a>The appointment by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister of my right honourable friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Des Browne) as his special envoy to Sri Lanka was a measure of the UK&#146;s commitment to contribute to an improvement in the humanitarian situation and to the search for a sustainable political solution to the conflict. It should be seen as such. We have been disappointed that the Government of Sri Lanka continue to reject the appointment, despite earlier assurances from the president that his Government would engage with an envoy. We will continue to press the Sri Lankan Government to reconsider. In the mean time, my right honourable friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun will engage with representatives of other countries, UN agencies, non-governmental organisations, parliamentarians and community representatives with an interest in Sri Lanka.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_370"></a><a name="09040245000383"></a>As well as upping our diplomatic efforts we have also been taking practical steps to contribute to an improvement in the situation. Since September 2008 the Department for International Development (DfID) has committed &#163;5 million of humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka. Of this sum, more than &#163;4 million has already been allocated in support of agencies providing protection and assistance work for IDPs. This includes &#163;835,000 that DfID has transferred this week to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and to the International Organisation for Migration. &#163;915,000 is being held in reserve so that we can continue to respond immediately to further needs as they arise.</p>

<a name="90402-wms0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_371"></a><a name="09040245000384"></a>We recognise that the LTTE is a terrorist organisation and that the Government of Sri Lanka have a need to root out the threat from terrorism. But the over-riding need is for an immediate end to the tragic humanitarian crisis. We want to see an end to the conflict and a serious drive to achieve a sustainable political settlement that takes fully into account the legitimate concerns of all Sri Lanka&#146;s communities&#151;Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims. As part of this process the Government of Sri Lanka need to tackle seriously the problem of human rights violations and the culture of impunity that underpins it. We urge the Government to ensure that all violations, including recent attacks on the media, are thoroughly investigated so that those responsible are brought to justice. The Government will continue to engage with political parties across all communities in Sri Lanka to support progress in all of these areas.</p>

It is not at all clear that targeted online advertising is interception, and if indeed it is interception, whether it is a breach of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). It may also be relevant to note that communications companies are able to intercept communications as a function of conducting their business. They might do this to stop unwanted email messages or potentially harmful viruses that would otherwise cripple our communications networks.</p>

Many more unsuitable people are thought to be deterred from applying to work with children as a result of the requirement for a CRB check.</p>

<a name="90402w0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_16"></a><a name="09040246000038"></a>Legislation governing these lists, as set by the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department of Health, requires fresh checks of the lists for certain positions involving work with children and vulnerable adults, regardless of any previous existing checks.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_17"></a><a name="09040246000039"></a>It is ultimately for each recruiting organisation and not the CRB to decide whether a fresh disclosure should be applied for. The recruiting organisation, using a range of pre-recruitment checks, is best placed to assess whether disclosure is required for a specific position, bearing in mind their legal and other responsibilities. The overriding consideration must always be the safety of those whom the disclosure service is designed to protect.</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_46"></a>To ask Her Majesty&#146;s Government further to  the Written Answers by Lord Bach on 19 March (<I>WA 76&#151;78</I>) regarding the consideration of immigration appeals, what is the policy which permits the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal to destroy files, and thereby make it unable to provide data on its decisions from 2005 and 2006; why the Administrative Court was able to provide statistics for the same period; and whether they have considered the figures for reconsideration in favour of the Secretary of State and orders in favour of appellants.

All tribunal policies accord with the requirements of the Public Records Act 1958, which does not require the AIT to retain any files which are not selected for permanent preservation on the basis of having exceptional legal or procedural importance. All files created pre-2006 that were not selected for permanent preservation will now have been destroyed, or be in the process of being destroyed, in accordance with the retention and destruction policies for that period. Immigration judge decision(s) on file are transferred to Ministry of Justice archives. The AIT policy on file destruction at present is to retain files not marked for permanent preservation for 18 months only.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_91"></a><a name="09040246000136"></a>The Administrative Court was able to provide statistics for the period 2005-2006 regarding applications for reconsideration from its own electronic database. These statistics provide only for applications to the Administrative Court directly for reconsideration of an AIT decision under the opt-in provision established by the 2004 Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act. The AIT's electronic database incurred a problem with approximately 2,000 cases in 2005-06 which resulted in the data for the outcomes of reconsideration applications not being recorded correctly. This was because the outcome of the reconsideration applications was overwritten erroneously with the outcome of the reconsideration hearing. The incorrect data inputs could not be identified or corrected following this and the monthly reports for that period did not break down the outcomes into appellant and respondent. It has therefore not been possible to provide the statistical data for outcome of reconsideration applications for 2005-06.</p>

Two of the extra four Secretary of State seats are being taken by those who have experience of living or working in the national park: one extra with experience of living or working in the Newcastle/Gateshead area; and one with particular knowledge of regional issues.</p>

However, before this could become operational the European Commission proposed the development of an upgraded system (SIS II). The date by which the European Commission initially envisaged that SIS II would be operational was very close to the planned UK date for access to the original system. Furthermore, the original SIS does not include biometric information and is therefore a much weaker control tool than other capabilities that are already in place or being implemented by the UK and our European partners. Ministers therefore took the decision that the UK should refocus its resources on the development of connectivity to SIS II, which will ultimately provide the UK with better functionality than the original SIS.</p>

Kickstart is targeted at schemes that have the potential to become successful or which are currently marginal schemes that with some extra support could be made more successful. The Government are currently inviting local transport authorities to submit bids for funding for a new round of Kickstart projects. &#163;25 million is available between 2009-10 to 2011-12. Kickstart support will not be used to fund projects which have previously received funding under previous challenge schemes, except in wholly exceptional circumstances. In addition it will not be available for schemes which failed to receive funding in earlier Kickstart rounds, unless they have been significantly revised.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_158"></a><a name="09040246000251"></a>The Government provide rural bus subsidy grant to help local authorities support rural bus services. This grant is now paid to authorities as part of their area-based funding and currently supports over 2,000 new and enhanced services on which over 33 million passenger journeys are made annually. This year's allocations total &#163;58.5 million, rising to &#163;60 million in 2010-11, bringing the grant's total to over &#163;0.5 billion since its introduction in 1998. It is for local authorities to determine how they wish to use this funding, but it could be used to support schemes previously funded under earlier challenge schemes.</p>

That is why the Local Transport Act 2008 removes some of the restrictions associated with community transport permits, such as the payment of drivers and the size of vehicles that can be used, to enable the sector to expand its role further.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_159"></a><a name="09040246000253"></a>The secondary legislation associated with the community transport provisions of the Act will come into force on 6 April 2009. It is therefore too early to comment on the impact the Act has had regarding local authorities' ability to provide vehicles and drivers for community transport schemes in rural areas.</p>

It also took into account the concerns and experience of the youth offending teams piloting the scaled approach.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_160"></a><a name="09040246000256"></a>As a result it was clear that what was the low band in the model published in September 2008 would in practice contain children and young people who could not be considered as being of low likelihood of reoffending according to the research data. This was considered to be unacceptable as it would undermine public confidence and that of the courts, so the decision was made to amend the model.</p>

<a name="90402w0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_161"></a><a name="09040246000257"></a>The revised model, published in February 2009 on the YJB website, is now consistent with the research and the experience and advice of the pilot sites and will ensure that children and young people will be receiving levels of supervision commensurate with their assessed likelihood of reoffending.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_162"></a><a name="09040246000259"></a>The YJB has advised that the impact of changing the asset scores for the three bands in the new model will result in an increase in the numbers of young offenders falling into the medium and enhanced bands and a decrease in the numbers in the low band from that of the previous model. This change impacts on the workload of youth offending teams with the earlier model resulting in a significant fall in workload and the revised model having no discernible increase in contact requirements to those presently required.</p>
